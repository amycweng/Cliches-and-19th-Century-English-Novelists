flora annie steel author of on the face of the waters etc london william heinemann all rights reserved miss stuarts legacy chapter i an indian railway station in the first freshness of an autumn dawn with a clear decision of light and shade unknown to northern latitudes lending a fictitious picturesqueness to the lowarched buildings festooned with purple creepers there was a crispness in the air which seemed to belie the possibility of a noon of brass yet the level beams of the sun had already in them a warning of warmth the upcountry mail had just steamed out of the station after depositing a scanty store of passengers on the narrow platform while the downcountry train duly placarded with the information that it carried the homewardbound mail had shunted in from the siding where it had been patiently awaiting the signal of a clear line the engine meanwhile drank breathlessly at the tank where in a masonry tower overhead a couple of bullocks circled round and round engaged in raising the water from the well beneath to the reservoir beside them round and round sleepily while the primeval wooden wheel creaked and clacked and the clumsy ropeladder with its ring of earthen pots let half their contents fall back into the bowels of the earth round and round dreamily with the fresh gurgle of the water in their ears and the blindness of leathern blinkers in their eyes round and round as their forebears had gone for centuries in the cool shade of sylvan wells what was it to the patient creatures whether they watered a snorting western demon labelled homeward mail or the chequered mudfields where the tender wheat spikelets took advantage of every crack in the dry soil it was little to them who sowed the seed or who gave the increase so long as the goad lay in some ones hands so much the cattle knew and in this simple knowledge were not far behind the comprehension of their driver who wrapped in his cotton sheet lay dozing while he drove the sweetmeatseller dawdled by pursued even at dawn by his pest of flies the watercarriers lounged along uttering their monotonous chant any hindu drinkers any mussulman drinkers while in their van dusky hands stretched out holding metal cups and bowls from the very shape of which the religion of the owners might be inferred owners sitting cheek by jowl in thirdclass compartments with a gulf unfathomable impassable between them in this world and the next the lank yellow dogs crept among the wheels licking a precarious meal from the greaseboxes the greyheaded carrioncrows sat in lines on the wire fencing with beaks wide open in unending yawns nothing else appeared to mark the passage of time indeed the absence of hurry on all sides gave the scene a curious unreality to western eyes a feeling which was plainly shown in the expression of a young girl who stood alone beside a small pile of luggage a new arrival remarked a tall man in undress uniform who was leaning against the door of a firstclass compartment and talking to its occupants yes to judge by complexion and baggage was the reply youd hardly believe it but kate was as trim once nowjust look at the carriage a gay laugh came from behind a perfect barrier of baths bundles and bassinettes we hadnt four babies to drag about in those days george and i can assure major marsden that im not a bit ashamed of them or my complexion george dear do for goodness sake get babys bottle filled with hot water at the engine if he doesnt have something to eat he will cry in ten minutes and then you will have to take him while george with the proverbial docility of the angloindian husband and father strolled off on his errand the feminine voice came into view in the shape of a cheerful round little woman with a child in her arms and another clinging to her dress she looked with interest at the girl on the platform she seems lonely doesnt she major marsden frowned he had been thinking the same thing though he was fond of posing as a man devoid of sentiment a not unusual affectation with those who are conscious of an oversoft heart i wonder what she is doing here he said kicking his heels viciously against the iron step of the carriage a twinkle of mischief lurked in his companions blue eyes as she replied what are you doing here my pretty maid going amarrying sir she said cant you see the square wooden box which betrays the wedding cake then if you want to do a christian actand you ladies love aggressive charityjust step out of your car as dea ex machine and take her home again india is no place for englishwomen to be married in now dont go on i know quite well what you are going to say and i agreetheoretically india is an ogre eating us up body and soul ruining our health our tempers our morals our manners our babies the laugh died from her lips at the last word for the spectre of certain separation haunts indian motherhood too closely to be treated as a jest instinctively she held the child tighter to her breast with a little restless sigh a short holiday at home and then an empty nestthat was the future for her so she went on recklessly oh yes of course we are all bad lotsneither good mothers nor good wives my dear mrs gordon i never said one or the other i only remarked that englishwomen had no business in india whats that asked george returning with the bottle only major marsden in a hurry to get rid of me replied his wife dont believe her gordon for allembracing generalities convertible into rigid personalities at a moments notice commend me to you mrs gordon but there i regret to say goes the last bell the train moved off in a series of dislocations which painful to witness were still more painful to endure and philip marsden was left watching the last nod of george gordons friendly head with that curious catching at the heart which comes to all angloindians as they say goodbye to the homewardbound he was contented enough happy in his work and his play yet the feeling of exile ran through it allas it does always till pension comes to bid one leave the interests and friends of a lifetime then all too late the glamour of the east claims the heart in exchange for the body the girl was still standing sentinel by her luggage and as he passed their eyes met in sudden impulse he went up and offered help if she required it his voice singularly sweet for a man seemed to make the girl realise her own loneliness for her lips quivered distinctly it is father i expected him to meet me and he has not come should you know him if you saw him she stared evidently surprised so he went on quickly i beg your pardon i meant that you might not have seen him for some time and i havent seen him since i was a baby she interrupted with a sort of hurt dignity but of course i should know him from his photograph of course he scanned her face curiously thinking her little more than a baby now but he only suggested the possibility of a telegram and went off in search of one returning a minute afterwards with several behind him came the stationmaster explaining with the plentiful plurals and addisonian periods dear to babudom that without due givings of names it was unpermissible not to say nonregulation to deliver telegrams i forgot you couldnt know my name said the girl frankly when a rapid scrutiny had shown that none were addressed to her im belle stuart my father lives at faizapore not colonel stuart of the commissariat yes do you know him a radiant smile lit up her face with such a curve of red lips and flash of white teeth that the spectator might well have been infected by its wholesome sweetness into an answering look major marsdens eyes however only narrowed with perplexed enquiry as he said bluntly yes slightly then perhaps father sent you to fetch me this time he relaxed confidence is catching im afraid not but possibly if he had known i was to be here he might at all events i can make myself useful how i can get you a gharrithat is a carriageand start you for faizapore it is sixty miles from here as you know she bent down to pick up her rugs i did not know you see i expected father philip marsden felt impelled to consolation he has been delayed most likely there has beenin his haste to put forward a solid excuse he was just about to say an accident but floundered instead into a bald something to detain him there generally is something to detain one in every delay isnt there she asked dryly adding hastily but it is very kind of you to help you see i have only just arrived in india so i am quite a stranger people generally are strangers when they first arrive in a new country arent they retorted her companion grimly then as his eyes met her smiling ones he smiled too and asked with a kinder ring in his voice if there were anything else he could do for her im so hungry she said simply couldnt you take me to get breakfast somewhere i dont see a refreshmentroom and i hate going by myself there is the dak bungalow but he hesitated for an instant and stood looking at her as if making up his mind about something then calling some coolies he bade them take up the luggage this way please miss stuart you will have to walk about half a mile but you wont mind that either i expect in reply she launched out as they went along the dusty road into girlish chatter about the distances she could go without fatigue the country life at home which seemed so very far off now and the new existence on which she was just entering you are not in the least like your sisters he said suddenly she laughed they arent my real sisters you see father married again and they are my stepmothers children there are five of themthree girls and two boys besides charlie who is only six years oldbut then he is my brothermy halfbrother i mean its very funny isnt it to have so many brothers and a mother one has never seen but of course i have their photographs he said he was glad of that yet when he had seen her safely started at breakfast he retired to the verandah under excuse of a cigar and found fault with providence briefly he knew too much of the reality not to make poor belles anticipations somewhat of a ghastly mockery poor child he thought how much easier life would be to some of us if like topsy we growed what business has that girls father to be a disreputable scamp for the matter of that what business has a disreputable scamp to be any girls father its the old problem belle meanwhile eating her breakfast with youthful appetite felt no qualms life to her was at its brightest moment this coming out to india in order to rejoin her father had been the hegira of her existence with reference to which all smaller events had to be classified his approval or disapproval had been her standard of right and wrong his mind and body her model of human perfection and so far distance had enabled colonel stuart to do justice to this pedestal for it is easy to touch perfection in a letter especially when it only extends to one sheet of creamlaid notepaper most of us have sufficient principal for such a small dividend i knew father had not forgotten she said calmly when an abject badgewearer was discovered asleep under a castoroil bush and proved to be the bearer of a note addressed in the familiar bold flourish to miss belle stuart you see he had made all the arrangements and i am not to start till the heat of the day is over then i will resign my charge and say goodbye when they had shaken hands he went round to the other verandah where her baggage lay and looked at the wooden box was it a weddingcake even that might be better than life in the home to which she was going though for all he knew the latter might suit her admirably then he went and kicked his heels at the station in order to be out of the way for the bungalow only boasted one room chapter ii the dawn of another day was just breaking when the rattle and clatter which had formed an accompaniment to belles wakeful dreams all night long ceased at the last stage out from faizapore belle stepped out of the palkigharri to stretch her cramped limbs and looked round her with eyes in which sleep still lingered a mud village lay close to the road and from an outlying hut the ponies destined to convey her the remaining five miles struggled forth reluctantly the coachman was furtively pulling at some one elses pipe a naked anatomy halt and blind of an eye dribbled water from an earthen pot over the hot axles two early travellers were bathing in a pool of dirty water belle standing in the middle of the glaring white highway instinctively turned to where in the distance a slender churchspire rose above the bank of trees on the horizon that was familiarthat she understood born in india and therefore a daughter of the soil she could not have been further removed in taste and feeling from the toiling selfcentred cosmogony of the indian village in which she stood had she dropped into it from another planet so alien in heart she passed through the tide of life which sets every morning towards a great cantonment looking on it as on some strange new picture beyond all this among people who ate with forks and spoons and went to church on sundays lay the life of which she had dreamed for years the rest was a picturesque background that was all a final flourish of an excruciating horn gateposts guiltless of gates a ragged privet hedge curving intermittently to a bright blue house set haphazard cornerwise in a square dusty expanseand the journey was over it was not only her cramped limbs that made belle feel weak and unsteady as she stood before the seemingly deserted house suddenly from behind a projecting corner came a wrinkled beldame clad in dingy white bordered with red with one hand she grasped a skinny child dressed in flannel night garments of macgregor tartan with the other she held up her draggling petticoats and salaamed profusely thus displaying a pair of bandy bluetrousered legs belle looked at her with distinct aversion i think i have made a mistake she said this cant be colonel stuarts house the woman grinned from ear to ear arl right missy ba mem sahib comin this by sonny baba she broke in on the whining wail of her voice which made belle think of a professional beggar to apostrophise her charge with loudtongued abuse for not saying good morning to his sissy belle gasped could this dirty dark boy be her brother charlie then a sudden rush of pity for the little fellow whose big black eyes met hers with such distrust made her stoop to kiss him but the child reluctant and alarmed struck at her face with his lean brown fingers and then fled into the house howling followed full tilt by his aged attendant belle would have felt inclined to cry if the very unexpectedness of the attack joined to the sight of the ayahs little bandy legs in hot pursuit had not roused her everready sense of humour she laughed instead and in so doing showed that she could hold her own with life for no one throws up the sponge until the faculty of coming up smiling even at ones own discomfiture has been lost and while she laughed a new voice asserted itself above the howls within a voice with to belles ears a strangely novel intonation soft yet distinctly staccato sharpening the vowels clipping the consonants and rising in pitch at the end of each sentence it heralded the advent of a tall stout lady in a limp cotton wrapper who straightway took belle to a languidlyeffusive embrace while she poured out an even flow of wonderings delights and endearments the girl with the reserve taught by long years of homelessness felt embarrassed at the warm kisses and tepid tears showered upon her then ashamed of her own unresponsiveness tried hard to realise that this was really the great eventthe homecoming to which she had looked forward ever since she could remember she felt vexed with herself annoyed at her own failure to reach high pressure point yet she was not conscious of disappointment and gave herself up willingly to the voluble welcomes of three slender darkeyed girls who presently came running in clad like their mother in limp cotton wrappers they sat beside her on the bare string bed in the bare room which looked so cheerless to belles english eyes and chattered fluttered and pecked at her with little kisses like a group of birds on a branch mrs stuart was meanwhile drying her ready tears on a coarse highlyscented pocket handkerchief giving orders for boundless refreshments and expressing her joy in alternate english and hindustani belle beset on all sides by novelty found it difficult to recognise which language was being spoken so little change was there in voice or inflection at last amid the babel of words and embraces she managed to enquire for her father the question produced a sudden gravity as if some sacred subject had been introduced in after years she recognised this extreme deference to the housemaster as typical of the mixed race but at the time it made her heart beat with a sudden fear of evil colonel stuart is very well thank you replied her stepmother showing a distinct tendency to reproduce the coarse handkerchief he will i am sure be very pleased to see youindeed that is one reason why i am glad myself though of course i welcome you for your own sake too my darling girl i am only a stepmother i know but i will allow no difference between you and my own three so i told the messpresident yesterdaymy daughters cannot go to your ball captain jenkins i said unless belle goes also so of course he sent you an invitation mrs stuart had a habit of saying of course as if she agreed plaintively with the decrees of providence but whenbegan belle her mind far from balls tonight chorused the three girls a chorus followed by voluble solos adjuring her to put on her smartest frock because all the men were frantic to see the original of the photograph which it appeared had been duly handed round for inspection and admiration belle neither blushed nor felt indignant her face fell however when she found that her father would not be up for another two hours but the bated breath with which they spoke of his morning sleep prevented her from rebellion those two hours seemed an eternity and as she sat waiting for him in the dim drawingroom her heart beat with almost sickening force at each sound unconscious as yet of disappointment of anything save not unpleasant surprise she still was conscious of an almost pathetic insistence that father must be the father of her dreams a mellow voice from the window calling her by name startled her from her watch by the door she turned to see a tall figure in scarlet and gold standing against the light which glittered on a trailing sword there was no doubt this time with a cry of father oh yes you are father she was in his arms to him also came the reincarnation of a halfforgotten dream the fair slim whiterobed girl standing in the dim shadows made the years vanish and youth return good god child how like you are to your poor mother he faltered and the ring in his voice made his daughter feel as if life held no more content despite years of dissipation colonel stuart was still a singularly finelooking man well set up and if a trifle fat in his dressinggown no more than portly in a tightlybuttoned tunic he had always had a magnificent way with women a sort of masterful politeness a beautiful overbearing condescension which the majority of the sex described as the sweetest of manners and now inspired by his little girls undisguised admiration he excelled himself discoursing on his delight in having her with him and on the impossibility of thanking heaven sufficiently for the care it had taken of her on this last point he spoke in the same terms that he was accustomed to use towards his hostess at the conclusion of a visit that is to say with the underlying conviction that she had only done her duty he drew a touching picture of his own forlornness when as a matter of fact the very thought of her had passed so completely out of his life that her death would only have caused an unreal regret his eloquence however brought conviction to himself so to all intents and purposes he became a fond father because he felt as if he had been one after all belle even had she known the truth would have no real cause for distress we have no lien on the past of another or on the future either the present is all we can claim and that only to a certain limited extent in truth it would have required little selfdeception to convince any one that belle had always been an abiding factor in life she was a daughter any man might well have been proud to possess tall and straight cleareyed and bright with wholesome thoughts and tastes expressed in every feature as she brought a cup of tea to her father her face alight with pleasure her eyes brilliant with happiness she looked the picture of all an english girl ought to be thank you my dear said the colonel viewing the offering dubiously i thinki meani should prefer a pega b and sa brandy and soda the fact is i had a confounded bad night and it might do me good you know he was faintly surprised at finding himself making excuses for what was a daily habit but it was delightful to bask in the tender solicitude of belles grey eyes as he poured out and drank the dose with an air of accurate virtue once more he imposed on himself on every one in fact but the servant who with the forethought of laziness sat outside with the brandybottle lest he should be summoned again and when finally the colonel rode off to his committee on his big australian charger belle thought the world could never have contained a more magnificently martial figure that this gorgeous apparition should condescend to wave its hand to her at the gate was at once so bewildering and so natural that all lesser details faded into insignificance before this astounding realisation of her dreams this was fortunate for many were the readjustments necessary ere the day was over breakfast where belle sat blissfully at her fathers side revealed two handsome overdressed young men redolent of scent and sleek as to hair these the miss van milders still in rumpled wrappers introduced as their brothers walter and stanley adding by no means covert chaff about store clothes whereat the young fellows giggled like girls and belle became almost aggressively sisterly in her manner walter was in tea or rather had been so as the plantation appeared to be undergoing transmutation into a limited company in order belle was told to produce a dividend stanley was reading for some examination after which somebody was to do something for him it was all very voluble and vague meanwhile they stayed at home quite contentedly satisfied to lounge about play tennis and keep a tame mongoose towards the end of the meal however a redhaired youth slouched into the room thrust an unwilling hand into belles when introduced as your cousin dick and then sat down in silence with all the open awkwardness of an english schoolboy afterwards whenever belles cool grey eyes wandered to that corner they met a pair of fiery brown ones also on the reconnoitre besides these present relations there were others constantly cropping up in conversation and of them belle had enough ere the day was done the young men chattered over their cigarettes on the verandah the girls chattered over belles boxes which they insisted on unpacking at once mrs stuart chattered of and to her servants it was a relief when after luncheon the whole house settled into the silence of siesta though belle herself was far too excited to rest dinner brought a bitter disappointment in colonel stuarts absence for she had excused herself from the ball on plea of fatigue in the hopes of an evening with her father it was cousin dick who as they sat down to table answered the expectation in belles face the colonel never dines on ball nights he goes to mess you see the girls bobbing up and down annoy him and it is beastly to see people bolting their food in curlpapers id speak grammar if i were you retorted mildred van milder flushing up her fringe was a perpetual weariness to her sometimes demanding the sacrifice of a dance in order to allow haircurlers to do their perfect work and i wouldnt wear a fringe like a poodle growled dick whereat mrs stuart plaintively wondered whence he got his manners and wished he was more like her own boys poodles or no poodles when the dancingparty appeared ready for the fray belle could hardly believe her eyes the sallowfaced girls of the morning in their limp cotton wrappers were replaced by admirable copies of the latest french fashionprints their elaboratelydressed hair large dark eyes and creamcoloured skins to which art had lent a soft bloom denied by nature under indian skies joined to the perfect fit of their gowns compelled attention indeed when maud to try the stability of a shoe waltzed round the room with her brother belle was startled at her own admiration for their lithe graceful sensuous beauty ill tell you what it is cried mabel the eldest of the three youll have a ripping good time tonight maudie i never saw you look so cheek she meant chic but the spelling was against her as for mrs stuart she appeared correctly attired in black satin and bugles the girls saw to that suppressing with inexorable firmness the good ladys hankering after gayer colours and more flimsy stuffs left alone with cousin dick belle pretended to read while in reality she was all ears for the sound of returning wheels it was nearly ten oclock and to her simple imagination time for her father to come home the clock struck and dick who had been immersed in a book at the further corner of the room laid it aside and bringing out a chessboard began to set the men he paused frowned passed both hands through his rough red hair and finally asked abruptly if she played a brief negative made him shift the pieces rapidly to a problem and no more was said again the clock struck and this time dick came and stood before her he was a middlesized broadshouldered youth about her own age with a promise of strength in face and figure you had better go to bed he said still more abruptly the colonel wont be home till morning it isnt a bit of good your waiting for him this was the second time that he had stepped in to her thoughts as it were and belle resented the intrusion dont let me keep you up she replied id just as soon be alone then youll have your wish i expect he answered coolly as he swept the chessmen together and left the room some two hours after belle woke from sleep to the sound of an impatient voice bearer bearer peg lao quick hang it all raby you must you shall stop and give me my revenge youve the most cursed good luck father she rose from her chair with cheeks flushed like those of a newlyawakened child the tall fair young man who stood beside colonel stuart turned at the sound of her voice then touched his companion on the arm some one is speaking to you god bless my soul child i thought you were at the ball why didnt you go his tone was kind if a little husky and he stretched a trembling hand towards her i waited to see you father she replied laying hers on his arm with a touch which was a caress the tall young man smiled to himself will you not introduce me to your daughter colonel he said with a halffamiliar bow towards belle colonel stuart looked from one to the other as if he had never seen either of them before introduce youwhy not belle this is john raby a fellow who has the most infernal good luck in creation i have no inclination to deny the fact at this moment interposed the other bowing again the implied compliment was quite lost on belle whose eyes and ears were for her father only i waited for you she said with a little joyous laugh and fell asleep in my chair once more the colonel looked from one to the other the mere fact of his daughters presence was in his present state confusing but that she should have been waiting for him was bewildering in the extreme how many years ago was it that another slim girl in white had gazed on him with similar adoration you had better go to bed now he said with almost supernatural profundity good night god bless you let me stay please father im not a bit tired she pleaded he stood uncertain and john raby drew out his watch with a contemptuous smile halfpast one colonel i must be off hang it all expostulated the other feebly you cant go without my revenge it aint fair you shall have it sometime never fear good night miss stuart we cant afford to peril such roses by late hours again his words fell flat their only result being that he looked at her with a flash of real interest when he had gone belle knelt beside her fathers chair timidly asking if he was angry with her for sitting up angry cried the colonel already in a half doze no child certainly not dear dear how like you are to your poor mother the thought roused him for he stood up shaking his head mournfully go to bed my dear we all need rest it has been a trying day a very trying day belle as she laid her head on the pillow felt that it had been so indeed yet she was not disappointed with it she was too young to criticise kindness and they had all been kind very kind even charlie had forgotten his first fright and so she fell asleep smiling at the remembrance of the old ayahs bandy legs chapter iii early morning in the big bazaar at faizapore so much can be said but who with pen alone could paint the scene or who with brush give the aroma physical and moral which to those familiar with the life of indian streets remains for ever the one indelible memory the mysterious smell indescribable to those who know not the east the air of sordid moneygetting and giving which pervades even the children the gailydressed chattering stream of people drifting by but from the greybearded cultivator come on a lawsuit from his village to the sweeper besom in hand propelling the black flood along the gutter the only subject sufficiently interesting to raise one voice above the universal hum is money even the stalwart herdswomen with their kilted skirts swaying at each free bold step their patchwork bodices obeying laws of decency antipodal to ours even they born and bred in the desert talk noisily of the ghee they are bringing to market in the russet and black jars poised on their heads and if ghee be not actually money it is inextricably mixed up with it in the native mind all else may fade from the memory the glare of sunlight the transparent shadows the clustering flies and children round the cavernous sweetmeatshops the glitter of brazen pots and the rainbowhued overflow from the dyers vats staining the streets like a reflection of the manytinted cloths festooned to dry overhead even the sharper contrasts of the scene may be forgotten the marriage procession swerving to give way to the quiet dead swathed in muslins and bound with tinsel carried high on the string bed or awaiting sunset and burial in some narrow byway among greengold melons and piles of red wheat but to those who have known an indian bazaar well the chink of money and the smell of a chemists shop will ever remain a more potent spell to awaken memory than any elaborate pictures made by pen or pencil on this particular morning quite a little crowd was collected round the doorway leading to the house of one shunker das usurer contractor and honorary magistrate a man who combined those three occupations into one unceasing manufacture of money in his hands pice turned to annas annas to rupees and rupees in their turn to fat for there is no little truth in the assertion that the real test of a buniahs moneylenders wealth is his weight and the safest guard for incometax his girth in inches nevertheless a skeleton lay hidden under shunker dass mountain of prosperous flesh a gruesome skeleton whose bones rattled ominously between him and the perdition of a sonless death stood but one life a life so frail that it had only been saved hitherto by the expedient of dressing the priceless boy in petticoats and so palming him off on the dread shiva as a girl at least so said the zenana women and so in his inmost heart thought shunker das though he was a prime specimen of enlightened native society but on that day the fateful first decade during which the destroyer had reft away so many babyheirs from the usurers home was over and amid countless ceremonies and much dispensation of alms the little nuttu with his ears and nose pierced like a girls had been attired in the pugree and pyjamas of his sex hence the crowd closing in round the lalas calcuttabuilt barouche which waited for its owner to come out hence the number of professional beggars looking on the whole more fat and wellliking than the workers around them certainly more so than a small group of women who were peeping charily from the door of the next housea very different house from shunker dass pretentious stucco erection with its blue elephants and mottled tigers frescoed round the top storey and a railway train flanked by two caricatures of the british soldier over the courtyard doorway this was a tall square colourless tower gaining its only relief from the numerous places where the outer skin of bricks had fallen away disclosing the hard red mortar beneath mortar that was stronger than stone mortar that had been ground and spread long years before the word contractor was a power in india here in poverty abject in all save honour dwelt mahomed lateef a syyed of the syyeds and it was his hewers of wood and drawers of water who formed the group at the door turning their lean faces away disdainfully when the baskets of dough cakes and trays of sweet rice were brought out for distribution from the idolaters house the crowd thickened but fell away instinctively to give place to a couple of english soldiers who came tramping along shoulder to shoulder utterly unconcerned and unsympathetic their glengarry caps set at the same angle the very pipes in their mouths having a drilled appearance such a quiet orderly crowd it was not even becoming audible when shunker das appeared with little nuttu the hero of the day who in a coat of the same brocade as his fathers and a pugree tied in the same fashion looked a wizened changeling double of his unwieldy companion the barouche was brilliant as to varnish vivid as to red linings and the bay australians were the best money could buy yet the people as it passed took small notice of the lala lolling in gorgeous attire against the berlinwoolworked cushion which he had bought from the commissioners wife at a bazaar in aid of a cathedral they gave far more attention to a hawkeyed old man with a cruel highbred face who rode by on a miserable pony and after returning the lalas contemptuous salutation with grave dignity spat solemnly into the gutter this was mahomed lateef who but the day before had put the talismansignet on his right hand to a deed mortgaging the last acre of his ancestral estate to the usurer yet the people stood up with respectful salaams to him while they had only obsequious grins for the other indeed one old patriarch waiting for death in the sun curled up comfortably his chin upon his knees on a bed stuck well into the street nodded his head cheerfully and muttered shunkers father was nobody over and over again till he fell asleep to dream perchance of the old order of things meanwhile the lala waited his turn for audience at the district officers bungalow there were many other aspirants to that honour seated on a row of canebottomed chairs in the verandah silent bored uncomfortable it is an irony of fate which elevates the chair in india into a patent of position for nowhere does the native look more thoroughly out of place than in the coveted honour as it is he clings to it notably with his legs those thin legs round whose painful want of contour the tight cotton pantaloons wrinkle all too closely and which would be so much better tucked away under dignified skirts in true eastern fashion but the exotic has a strange fascination for humanity waiting there for his turn the lala inwardly cursed the western morality which prevented an immediate and bribewon entry but the redcoated badgewearers knew better than to allow even a munificent shoemoney to interfere with the roster the harassedlooking preoccupied official within had an almost uncanny quickness of perception so the rupees chinked into their pockets but produced no effect beyond whining voices and fulsome flattery well lalaji and what do you want asked the representative of british majesty when at last shunker dass most obsequious smile curled out over his fat face there was no doubt a certain brutality of directness in the salutation but it came from a deadly conviction that a request lay at the bottom of every interview and that duty bade its discovery without delay the abruptness of the magistrate was therefore compressed politeness as he laid down the pen with which he had been writing a judgment and leant wearily back in his chair his bald head was framed as it were in a square nimbus formed by a poster on the wall behind it was four feet square and held in treble columns a list of all the schedules and reports due from his office during the year to come that was his patent of position and it was one which grows visibly as day by day and month by month law and order become of more consequence than truth and equity in the government of india the lalas tact bade him follow the lead given i want sahib he said to be made a rai bahadur now rai bahadur is an honorific title bestowed by government for distinguished service to the state so without more ado shunker das detailed his own virtues totalled up the money expended in public utility and wound up with an offer of five thousand rupees towards a new female hospital the representative of british majesty drew diagrams on his blottingpaper and remarked casually that he would certainly convey the lalas liberal suggestion about the hospital to the proper authorities adding his belief that one puras ram who was about to receive the coveted honour had offered fifteen thousand for the same purpose i will give ten thousand huzoor bid the usurer with a scowl struggling with his smile that will make seventyfive thousand in all and tota mull got it for building the big tank that wont hold water if it cost him fifty thousand may i eat dirt and i ought to know for i had the contract it wont last huzoor i know the stuff that went into it tota mull had other services other services echoed shunker fumbling in his garments and producing a printed book tied up in a cotton handkerchief see my certificates one from your honours own hand perhaps the district officer judged the worth of the others by the measure of his own testimonial wherein being then a griff of six months standing he had recorded shunkers name opposite a list of the cardinal virtues for he set the book aside with a sad smile most likely he was thinking that in those days his ambition had been a reality and his liver an idea and that now they had changed places i am glad to see your son looking so well he remarked with pointed irrelevance i hear you are to marry him next month and that everything is to be on a magnificent scale tota mull will be quite eclipsed though his boys wedding cost him sixtyfive thousandhe told me so himself accept my best wishes on the occasion huzoor i will give fifteen thou british majesty rose gravely with the usual intimation of dismissal and a remark that it was always gratified at liberality shunker das left the presence with his smile thoroughly replaced by a scowl though his going there had simply been an attempt to save his pocket for he knew right well that he had not yet filled up the measure of qualification for a rai bahadurship while this interview had been going on another of a very different nature was taking place outside a bungalow on the other side of the road where philip marsden stood holding the rein of his charger and talking to mahomed lateef whose pinknosed pony was tied to a neighbouring tree the old man in faded green turban and shawl showed straight and tall even beside the younger mans height and soldierly carriage sahib he said i am no beggar to whine at the feet of a stranger for alms i dont know the sahib over yonder whose verandah as you see is crowded with such folk they come and go too fast these sahibs nowadays and i am too old to tell the story of my birth if it is forgotten it is forgotten but you know me allah be praised you feel my sons blood there on your heart where he fell fighting beside you which of the three was it what matter they all died fighting and this one is benjamin i cannot let him go he is a bright boy and will give brains not blood to the sirkar if i can only get employment for him so i come to you who know me and mine philip marsden laid his hand on the old mans shoulder that is true khan sahib what is it i can do for you there is a post vacant in the office huzoor it is not much but a small thing is a great gain in our poor house the boy could stay at home and not see the women starve it is only writingwork and thanks to the old mullah murghub admed is a real khush nawis penman persian and arabic too and euclidus and algebra all a true man should know if you would ask the sahib ill go over now no no khan sahib i am too young and you are too old but mahomed lateef held the stirrup stoutly with lean brown fingers the old help the young into the saddle always sahib it is for you boys to fight now and for us to watch and cry allah be with the brave so it happened that as shunker das drove out of the district officers compound major marsden rode in despite his scowl the usurer stood up and salaamed profusely with both hands receiving a curt salute in return british majesty was now in the verandah disposing of the smaller fry in batches come inside it said hastily dismissing the final lot ive only ten minutes left for bath and breakfast but youll find a cigar there and we can talk while i tub amid vigorous splashings from within major marsden unfolded his mission receiving in reply a somewhat disjointed enquiry as to whether the applicant had passed the middle school examination for otherwise his case was hopeless and why in heavens name asked his hearer impatiently the magistrate having finished his ablutions appeared at the door in scanty attire rubbing his bald head with a towel immutable decree of government and loyalty family influencewhat of them a shrug of the shouldersask some one else i am only a barrelorgan grinding out the executive and judicial tunes sent down from headquarters and a lively discord youll make of it in time but you are wrong a man in your position is as it were trustee to a minors estate and bound to speak up for his wards and be overridden no good ive tried it oh lord twelve oclock and i had a case with five pleaders in it at halfpast eleven well ill bet the fouranna bit the exchange left me from last months pay that my judgment will be upset on appeal i pity you profoundly dont mention it theres balm in gilead this is mailday and i shall hear from my wife and the kids goodbyeim sorry about the boy but it cant be helped it strikes me it will have to be helped some day replied major marsden as he rode off meanwhile a third interview fraught with grave consequences to this story had just taken place in the commissariat office whither shunker das had driven immediately after his rebuff with the intention of robbing peter to pay paul in other words of getting hold of some government contract out of which he could squeeze the extra rupees required for the purchase of the rai bahadurship a proceeding which commended itself to his revengeful and spiteful brain as it so happened he appeared in the very nick of time for he found colonel stuart looking helplessly at a telegram from headquarters ordering him to forward five hundred camels to the front at once now the faizapore office sent in the daily schedules original duplicate and triplicate with commendable regularity and drew the exact amount of grain sanctioned for transport animals without fail nevertheless a sudden demand on its resources was disagreeable so as he had done once or twice before in this time of war and rumours of wars the chief turned to the big contractor for help not without a certain uneasiness for though a long course of shady transactions had blunted colonel stuarts sense of honour towards his equals it had survived to an altogether illogical extent towards his inferiors now his private indebtedness to the usurer was so great that he could not afford to quarrel with him and this knowledge nurtured a suspicion that shunker das made a tool of him an idea most distasteful both to pride and honour no mental position is more difficult to analyse than that of a man who having lost the desire to do the right from a higher motive clings to it from a lower one belles father for instance did not hesitate to borrow cash from monies intrusted to his care but he would rather not have borrowed it from a man with whom he had official dealings shunker das however knew nothing and had he known would have credited little of this survival of honour it seemed impossible in his eyes that the innumerable dishonesties of the faizapore office could exist without the knowledge of its chief bribery was to him no crime nor is it one to a very large proportion of the people of india to the ignorant indeed it seems such a mere detail of daily life that it is hard for them to believe in judicial honesty hence the ease with which minor officials extort large sums on pretence of carrying the bribe to the right quarter and hence again comes no doubt many a whispered tale of corruption in high places i shall lose by this contract sahib said the lala when the terms had been arranged but i rely on your honours generous aid in the future there are big things coming in when the protector of the poor will doubtless remember his old servant whose life and goods are always at your honours disposal i have the highest opinion ofof your integrity lala sahib replied the colonel evasively and of course shall take iti mean your previous servicesinto consideration whenever itit is possible to do so the word integrity had made him collapse a little but ere the end of the sentence he had recovered his selfesteem and with it his pomposity the lalas crafty face expanded into a smile we understand each other sahib and if here he dropped his voice to a confidential pitch five minutes after colonel stuarts debts had increased by a thousand rupees and the lala was carefully putting away a duly stamped and signed iou in his pocketbook not that he assigned any value to it but because it was part of the game without any distinct idea of treachery he always felt that lukshmi the goddess of fortune had given him one more security against discomfiture when he managed to have the same date on a contract and a note of hand not that he anticipated discomfiture either in fact had any one told him that he and the colonel were playing at crosspurposes he would have laughed the assertion to scorn he had too high an opinion of the perspicacity of the sahiblogue and especially of the sahib who shut his eyes to so many irregularities to credit such a possibility so he drove homewards elate and on the way was stopped in a narrow alley by an invertebrate crowd which without any backbone of resistance blocked all passage despite the abuse he showered around run over the pigs drive on i say he shouted to the driver when other means failed best not shunker sneered a little goldearringed rajpoot amongst the crowd theres a sepoy in yonder shooting free the lala sank back among his cushions green with fear at the same moment an officer in undress uniform rode up as if the street were empty the crowd making way before him what is it havildar sergeant he asked sharply reining up before an open door where a sentry stood with rifle ready private afzul khan run amuck huzoor major marsden threw himself from his horse and looked through the door into the little court within it was empty but an archway at right angles led to an inner yard when half an hour gonethe guard will be here directly huzoor they were teasing him for being an afghan and saying he would have to fight his own people any one hurt jeswunt rai and gurdit singh not badly he hasseven rounds left sahib and swears he wont be taken alive the last remark came hastily as major marsden stepped inside the doorway he paused not to consider but because the tramp of soldiers at the double came down the street draw up your men at three paces on either side of the door he said to the native officer if you hear a shot go on the housetop and fire on him as he sits if he comes out alone shoot him down allah be with the brave muttered one or two of the men as philip marsden turned once more to enter the courtyard it lay blazing in the sunshine open and empty but what of the dim archway tunnelling a row of buildings into that smaller yard beyond where afzul khan waited with murder in his heart and his finger on the trigger of his rifle there the englishman would need all his nerve it was a rash attempt he was making he knew that right well but he had resolved to attempt it if ever he got the opportunity anything he had told himself was better than the wildbeastlike scuffle he had witnessed not long before a hopeless insane struggle ending in death to three brave men one of them the best soldier in the regiment the remembrance of the horrible scene was strong on him as his spurs clicked an even measure across the court it was cooler in the shadow quite a relief after the glare ah just as he had imagined in the far corner a crouching figure and a glint of light on the barrel of a rifle no pause straight on into the sunlight again then suddenly the word of command rang through the court boldly lay down your arms the familiar sound died away into silence it was courage against power and a life hung on the balance then the long gleam of light on the rifle wavered disappeared as private afzul khan stood up and saluted you are a braver man than i sahib he said that was all a sort of awed whisper of relief and amazement ran through the crowd as philip marsden came out with his prisoner and gave orders for the men to fall in two englishmen in mufti had ridden up in time for the final tableau and one of them nodding his head to the retreating soldiers said approvingly that is what gave and keeps us india and that returned john raby pointing to shunker das who with renewed arrogance was driving off will make us lose it my dear raby i thought the moneyed classes my dear smith if you think that when the struggle comes as come it must our new nobility whose patent is plunder will fight our battles against the old i dont they argued the point all the way home without convincing each other while time with the truth hidden in his wallet passed on towards the future chapter iv had any one a week before his daughter arrived told colonel stuart that her presence would be a pleasant restraint upon him he would have been very angry yet such was the fact her likeness to her mother carried him back to days when his peccadilloes could still be regarded as youthful follies and people spared a harsh verdict on what age might be expected to remedy then her vast admiration gave a reality to his own assumptions of rectitude for the colonel clung theoretically to virtue with great tenacity in a loudvoiced conservative d you if you dont believe what i say sort of manner he also maintained a high ideal in regard to the honour of every one else based on a weakkneed conviction that his own was above suspicion he was proud of belle too fully recognising that with her by his side his grey hairs became reverend so he pulled himself up to some small degree and began to sprinkle good advice among the younger men with edifying gravity as for belle she was supremely happy no doubt had she been earnest or soulful or intense she might have found spots on her sun with the greatest ease but she was none of these things at this period of her existence nothing was further from her disposition than inward questionings on any subject she took life as she found it seeing only her own healthy happy desires in its dreary old problems and remaining as utterly unconscious that she was assimilating herself to her surroundings as the caterpillar which takes its colour from the leaf on which it feeds for a healthy mind acts towards small worries as the skin does towards friction it protects itself from pain by an excess of vitality it is only when pressure breaks through the blister that its extent is realised in good truth belles life was a merry one the three girls were goodnature itself especially when they found the new arrival possessed none of their own singlehearted desire for matrimony her stepmother if anything was overconsiderate being a trifle inclined to make a bugbear of the girls superior claims to her fathers affection the housekeeping was lavishly good and men of a certain stamp were not slow to avail themselves of the best mutton and prawn curry in faizapore where the money came from which enabled the stuarts to keep open house they did not enquire neither did belle who knew no more about the value of things than a baby in arms as for the colonel he had long years before acquired the habit of looking on his debts as his principal and treating his pay as the interest so matters went smoothly and swiftly for the first month or so during which time belle might have been seen everywhere in the company of the three miss van milders cheerfully following their lead with a serene innocence that kept even the fastest of a very fast set in check once or twice she saw philip marsden and was rallied by the girls on her acquaintance with that solitary misogynist mrs stuart indeed went so far as to ask him to dinner even though he had not called on the ground that he was the richest man in the station and belles interests must not be neglected though she was only a stepdaughter but he sent a polite refusal and so the matter dropped nor to mrs stuarts open surprise did belle make any other declared conquest yet unnoticed by all there was some one who long before the first month was out would willingly have cut himself into little pieces in order to save his idol from the least breath of disappointment so it was from cousin dicks superior knowledge of indian life that belle learnt many comforting if curious excuses for things liable to ruffle even her calm of content poor dick hitherto his efforts in all directions had resulted in conspicuous failure chiefly odd though it may seem because he happened to be born under english instead of indian skies in other words because he was not what bureaucracies term a statutory native his mother mrs stuarts younger sister had run away with a young englishman who having ruined himself over a patent was keeping soul and body together by driving engines in some ways she might have done worse for smith senior was a gentleman but he possessed unfortunately just that unstable spark of genius which like a willothewisp leads a man out of the beaten path without guiding him into another the small sum of money she brought him was simply so much fuel to feed the flame and within a few months of their marriage the soft luxurious girl was weeping her eyes out in a miserable london lodging while he went the rounds with his patent there dick was born and thence after a year or two she brought them both back to the elastic house the strong family affection and lavish hospitality which characterise the eurasian race not for long however since her husband died of heatapoplexy while away seeking for employment and she after shedding many tears succumbed to consumption brought on by the fogs and cold of the north so dependent on various uncles and aunts in turn little dick smith had grown up with one rooted desire in the rough red head over which his sleek soft guardians shook theirs ominously briefly he was to be an engineer like his father he broke open everything to see how it worked and made so many crucial experiments that the whole family yearned for the time when he should join the government engineering college at roorkee and then just when this desirable consummation was within reach some one up among the deodars at simla or in an office at whitehall invented the statutory native and there was an end of poor dicks career for a statutory native is a person born in india of parents habitually resident and domiciled in the country true the college was open to the boy for his training but with all the government appointments awarded to successful students closed to him by the accident of his birth his guardians naturally shook their heads again over an expensive education which would leave him practically without hope of employment for outside government service engineers are not as yet wanted in india he might of course had he been the son of a rich man have been sent home to pass out as an englishman through the english college as it was the boy rebellious to the hearts core was set to other employment poor dick if his european birth militated against him on the one side his eurasian parentage condemned him on the other after infinite trouble his relations got him a small post on the railway whence he was ousted on reduction another with a private firm which became bankrupt the lads heart and brains were elsewhere and as failure followed on failure he gave way to fits of defiance leading him by sheer excess of energy into low companionship and bad habits at the time of belles arrival he was trying to work off steam as an unpaid clerk in his uncles office when a boys first love revolutionized his world love at first sight so enthralling so compelling that he did not even wonder at the change it wrought in him belle never knew perhaps he himself did not recognise how much of the calm content of those first few months was due to dicks constant care a silent unreasoning devotion may seem a small thing viewed by the head but it keeps the heart warm poor homeless rebellious dick had never felt so happy or so good in all his life and he would kneel down in his hitherto prayerless room and pray that she might be kept from sorrow like any young saint yet he had an alltoointimate acquaintance with the corruption of indian towns and an alltooprecocious knowledge of evil belle in her turn liked him there was something more congenial in his breezy tempestuous nature than in the sweetness of her stepbrothers and unconsciously she soon learnt to come to him for comfort charlie tells such dreadful stories she complained one day and he really is fond of whiskyandwater i almost wish father wouldnt give him any the governor thinks it good for him i bet returned dick stoutly i believe it is sometimes then as for lies i used to tell em myself its the climate hell grow out of it youll see i did now dicks truthfulness was as a rule so uncompromising that belle cheered up as for the boy his one object then was to keep care from those clear eyes abstract truth was nowhere the next time sonny baba was offered a sip from his fathers glass he refused hastily pressure produced a howl of terror nor was it without the greatest difficulty that he was subsequently brought to own that cousin dick had threatened to kill him if he ever touched a peg again luckily for the peace of the household this confession was made in the colonels absence when only mrs stuarts high strident voice could be raised in feeble anger the culprit remained unrepentant the more so because belle assoilzied him declaring that charlie ought not to be allowed to touch the horrid mixture whereupon her stepmother sat and cried softly with the boy on her lap making both belle and dick feel horribly guilty until the incident having occurred at lunch both the sufferers fell asleep placidly when belle returned from her afternoon ride she found mrs stuart in high good humour decanting a bottle of port wine you frightened me so my dear she said affectionately that i sent for the doctor and he says port wine is better so im glad you mentioned it and belle felt more guilty than ever these afternoon rides were dicks only trouble he hated the men who came about the house and more especially the favoured many who were allowed to escort the van as belles three stepsisters were nicknamed it made him feel hot and cold all over to think of her in the company which he found suitable enough for his cousins but then it seemed to him as if no one was good enough for bellehe himself least of all he dreamed wild happy dreams of doing something brave fine and manly not so much from any desire of thereby winning her but because his own love demanded it imperiously for the first time the needle of his compass pointed unhesitatingly to the pole of right he confided these aspirations to the girl and they would tell each other tales of heroism until their cheeks flushed and their eyes flashed responsive to the deeds of which they talked one day dick came home full of the story of major marsden and the afghan sepoy and they agreed to admire it immensely after that dick made rather a hero of the major and belle began to wonder why the tall quiet man who had been so friendly at their first meeting kept so persistently aloof from her and hers he was busy of course but so were others for these were stirring times the arsenal was working over hours and all through the night long files of laden carts crept down the dusty roads bearing stores for the front to all outward appearance however society took no heed of these wars or rumours of wars but went on its way rejoicing in the winter climate which made amusement possible and no one in the station rejoiced more than belle major marsden watching her from afar told himself that a girl who adopted her surroundingsand such surroundingsso readily was not to be pitied she was evidently well able to take care of herself yet many a time as he sat playing whist while others were dancing he caught himself looking up to see who the partner might be with whom she was hurrying past to seek the cooler air of the gardens where seats for two were dimly visible among the coloured lanterns for the most part however belles partners were boys too young to have lost the faculty of recognising innocent unconsciousness but one night at a large ball given to a departing regiment she fell into the hands of a stranger who had come in from an outstation in order to continue a pronounced flirtation which maud van milder had permitted during a dull visit to a friend that astute young lady having no intention of offending permanent partners for his sake handed him over to belle for a dance and the latter failing to fall in with his step during the first turn pleaded fatigue as the easiest way of getting through the penance philip at his whist saw her pass down the corridor towards the garden and happening to know her companion played a false card lost the trick and apologised time yet if we look out replied his partner but this was exactly what the major could not do and the rubber coming swiftly to an end he made an excuse for cutting out and followed belle into the garden wondering who could have introduced her to such a man to begin with he was not fit for decent society and in addition he had evidently favoured the champagne philip had no definite purpose in his pursuit until from a dark corner he heard belles clear young voice with a touch of hauteur in it then the impulse to get her away from her companion before he had a chance of making himself objectionable came to the front joined to an unexpected anger and annoyance i have been looking for you everywhere miss stuart you are wanted said philip going up to them hallo marsden what a beast you are to come just as we were gettin confidentialwerent we exclaimed belles companion with what was meant to be a fascinating leer she turned from one face to the other but if the one aroused dislike and contempt the air of authority in major marsdens touched her pride who wants me she asked calmly who echoed her partner come thats a good one we both want you dont we marsden luckily for the speaker philip recognised his own imprudence in risking an altercation the only thing to be done now was to get the girl away as soon as possible exactly so he replied crushing down his anger miss stuart can choose between us belle rose superbly you seem to forget i can go alone and alone she went while her partner shrieked with noisy laughter avowing that he loved a spice of the devil in a girl philip moodily chewing the end of his cheroot ere turning in felt that the rebuff served him right though he could not restrain a smile as he thought of belles victorious retreat by that time however subsequent facts had enlightened her as to philips possible meaning and the sight of her former partner being inveigled away from waltzing to the billiard room by the senior subaltern made her turn so pale that john raby on whose arm she was leaning thought she was afraid he wont be allowed to come back miss stuart he said consolingly and i apologise in the name of the committee for the strength of the champagne belles mouth hardened there is no excuse for that sort of thing there never can be one he looked at her curiously i wouldnt say that miss stuart it is a mistake to be so stern for my part i can forgive anything it is an easy habit to acquireand most convenient belle however could not even forgive herself she lay tossing about enacting the scene over and over again wondering what major marsden must think of her how foolish she had been why had she not trusted him why had he not made her understand being unable to sleep she rose and long ere her usual hour was walking about the winding paths which intersected the barren desert of garden where nothing grew but privet and a few bushes of oleander this barrenness was not dame natures fault for just over the other side of the wide white road john rabys garden was ablaze with blossom trails of marechale niel roses heavy with great creamy cups hung over the low hedge and a sweet english scent of clovepinks and mignonette was wafted to her with every soft fitful gust of wind she felt desperately inclined to cross the intervening dust into this paradise and stood quite a long time at the blue gateposts wondering why a serpent seemed to have crept into her own eden the crows longdrawn note came regularly from a kuchnar tree that was sheeted with white geraniumlike flowers the seven brothers chattered noisily among the yellow tassels of the cassia and over head against the cloudless sky a wedgeshaped flight of cranes was winging its way northward all signs that the pleasant cold weather was about to give place to the fiery furnace of may but belle knew nothing of such things as yet so the vague sense of coming evil which lay heavily on her seemed all the more depressing from its unreasonableness a striped squirrel became inquisitive over her still figure and began inspection with bushy tail erect and short starts of advance till it was scared by the clank of bangles and anklets as a group of hindu women bearing bunches of flowers and brazen lotahs of milk for seetlas shrine came down the road beside them in various stages of toddle the little children for whom their mothers were about to beg immunity from smallpox of all this again belle knew nothing but suddenly causelessly it struck her for the first time that she ought to know something who were these people what were they doing where were they going one small child paused to look at her and she smiled at him the mother smiled in return and the other women looked back half surprised half pleased nodding and laughing as they went on their way why belle turning to enquire after the late breakfast felt oppressed by her own ignorance in the verandah she met the bearer coming out of the colonels window with a medicine bottle in his hand did her ignorance go so far that her father should be ill and she not know of it budlu she asked hastily the colonel sahib isnt ill is he the man who had known her mother and grown grey with his master raised a submissive face no missy baba not ill colonel sahib he drunk drunk she echoed mechanically too astonished for horror what do you mean too much wine drunkvery bad explained budlu cheerfully she caught swiftly at the words with a sense of relief from she knew not what ah i see the wine last night was bad and disagreed with him damn bad budlus english was limited but not choice she remarked on it at the breakfasttable repeating his words and laughing none of the girls were down but walter and stanley giggled and the latter was apparently about to say something facetious when his words changed into an indignant request that dick would look out and keep his feet to himself was it you i kicked asked dick innocently i thought it was the puppy then he went on fast as if in haste to change the subject i often wonder why you dont learn hindustani belle youd be ashamed not to speak the lingo in other countries why not here ill teach you if you like theres your chance belle sneered stanley still smarting from dicks forcible method of ensuring silence he really is worth ten rupees a month as moonshee and twill save the governors pocket if it goes in the family an unkind speech no doubt yet it did good service to dick by ensuring belles indignant defence and her immediate acceptance of his offer for she was ever ready of tongue and swift of sympathy against injustice or meanness so the little incident of the morning passed without her understanding it in the least nevertheless dick found it harder and harder every day to manipulate facts and to stand between his princess and the naked indecent truth her curiosity in regard to many things had been aroused and she asked more questions in the next four days than she had asked in the previous four months almost scandalizing the van milder clan by the interest she took in things of which they knew nothing it was all very well the girls said if she intended to be a zenanamission lady but without that aim it seemed to them barely correct that she should know how many wives the khansamah butler had as for the boys they rallied her tremendously about her hindustani studies for like most of their race they prided themselves on possessing but a limited acquaintance with their mother tongue walter indeed being almost boastful over the fact that he had twice failed for the higher standard then the whole family chaffed her openly because she had a few sensible talks with john raby the young civilian and when she began to show a certain weariness of pursuing pleasure in rear of the van insisted that she must be in love with him without knowing it i dont like raby said mildred the youngest and least artificial of the sisters jack carruthers told me the governor had been dropping a lot of money to him at ecarte i dont see what you and mr carruthers have to do with fathers amusements flashed out belle in swift anger i suppose he can afford it and at least he never stints youi mean the family she added hastily fearing to be mean quite true my dear hes a real good sort is the governor about money and he can of course do as he likes but raby oughtnt to gamble it isnt form in a civilian you neednt laugh belle its true it would be quite different if he was in the army soldiers rush in where civilians fear to tread parodied belle contemptuously i wish people wouldnt gossip so why cant they leave their neighbours alone nevertheless that afternoon she stole over to the office which was only separated from the house by an expanse of dusty stubbly grass and seeing her father alone in his private room comfortably reading the paper slipped to his side and knelt down well my pretty belle he said caressing her soft fluffy hair why arent you out riding with the others i didnt care to go then you were to be at home and i like that best i dont see much of you as a rule father colonel stuarts virtue swelled visibly as it always did under the vivifying influence of his daughters devotion i am a busy man my dear you must not forget that he replied a trifle pompously my time belongs to the government i have the honour to serve the girl was a perfect godsend to him acting on his halfdead sensibilities like a galvanic battery on paralysed nervecentres he was dimly conscious of this and also of relief that the influence was not always on him i know you are very busy dear she returned nestling her head on his arm as she seated herself on the floor thats what bothers me couldnt i help you in your work sometimes i write a very good hand so people say colonel stuart let his paper fall in sheer astonishment help me why my dear child i have any number of clerks but i should like to help her voice was almost pathetic there was quite a break in it her father looked at her in vague alarm you are not feeling ill are you belle not feverish i hope my dear its a most infernal climate though and one cant be too careful youd better go and get your mother to give you five grains of quinine i cant have you falling sick i cant indeed just think of the anxiety it would be belle grateful for her fathers interest took the quinine but no drug not even poppy or mandragora had power to charm away her restless dissatisfaction dicks office was no sinecure and even his partial eyes could not fail to see that she was often captious almost cross it came as a revelation to him for hitherto she had been a divinity in his eyes and now oh strange heresy he found himself able to laugh at her with increased but altered devotion hitherto he had wreathed her pedestal with flowers now he kept the womans feet from thorns and the impulse to make their pathways one grew stronger day by day she unconscious of the position added fuel to the flame by choosing his society and making him her confidant naturally with one so emotional as dick the crisis was not long in coming and music of which he was passionately fond brought it about in this wise for belle played prettily and he used to sit and listen to her like the lover in frank dicksees harmony letting himself drift away on a sea of pleasure or pain he scarcely knew which so one afternoon when they were alone in the house together she sat down to the piano and played schuberts fruehlingslied the sunshine lay like cloth of gold outside the doves cooed ceaselessly the scent of the roses in john rabys garden drifted in through the window with the warm wind which stirred the little soft curls on belles neck the perfume of life got into the lads brain and almost before he knew it his arms were round the girl his kisses were on her lips and his tale of love in her ears it was very unconventional of course but very naturalfor him for her the sudden rising to her full height with amazement and dislike in her face was equally natural and even more unforeseen the sight of it filled poor dick with such shame and regret that his past action seemed almost incredible to his present bewilderment forgive me belle he cried i was mad but indeed i love youi love you she stood before him like an insulted queen full of bitter anger i will never forgive you how dare you kiss me how dare you say you love me the lads combativeness rose at her tone i suppose any one may dare to love you im sorry i kissed you belle but my conduct doesnt alter my love his manner meant to be dignified tended to bombast and the girl laughed scornfully love indeed youre only a boy what do you know about love more than you do apparently im glad you realise the fact if that is what you call love at any rate im older than you the retort that he was old enough to know better rose to belles lips but a suspicion that this childish squabbling was neither correct nor dignified made her pause and say loftily how can you ask me to forgive such a mean ungentlemanly thing the last epithet was too much for dick he looked at her as if she had struck him dont say that belle he said hoarsely its bad enough that its true and that you dont understand but dont say that he leant over the piano and buried his face in his hands in utter despair for the first time a pulse of pity shot through the storm of physical and mental repulsion in the girls breast but she put it from her fiercely why shouldnt i say it if it is true because you are kind always so good and kind again the pity had to be repulsed this time still more harshly you will say next that ive been too kind that i encouraged you i suppose that would put the finishing touch to your meanness this speech put it to dicks patience he caught her by both hands and stood before her masterful in his wrath you shall not say such things to me belle look me in the face and say it again if you dare you know quite well how i love and reverence you you know that i would die rather than offend you i forgot everything but youi lost myselfyou know it the thrill in his voice brought a new and distinctly pleasurable sense of power to the young girl and alas that it should be so made her more merciless i prefer actions to words you have insulted me and i will never speak to you again she regretted this assertion almost as it was uttered it went too far and bound her down too much she was not always going to be angry with poor dick surely no not always but for the present decidedly angry very angry indeed insult echoed dick drearily letting her hands slip from his there you go again but fellows do kiss their cousins sometimes had there been any grownup spectators to this scene they must have laughed at the fullblown tragedy of both faces and the alternate bathos and pathos of the pleas they were so young so very young this girl and boy and neither of them really meant what they said belle especially with her vicious retort i am not your cousin and im glad of it im glad that i have nothing to do with you as before her harshness overreached itself and made a man of him you want to put me out of your life altogether belle he said more steadily because i have made you angry you have a right to be angry and i will go but not for always you dont wish that yourself i think for you are kind oh belle be like yourself say one kind word before i go again the consciousness of power made her merciless and she stood silent yet tingling all over with a halffearful curiosity as to what he would say next one kind word he pleaded only one he waited a minute then with a curse on his own folly in expecting pity flung out of the room so it was all over a genuine regret came into the girls heart and she crept away miserably to her own room and cried i wonder dick isnt home to dinner remarked mrs stuart when that meal came round i do hope he isnt going back to his old habit of staying out he heard today that his application for a post in the salt department was refused and he has no patience like my own boys i do hope he will come to no harm the empty chair renewed belles remorseful regret well i cant have him kicking his heels in my office much longer remarked the colonel crossly the headclerk complains of him confound his impudence he actually interfered in the accounts the other day and showed regular distrust i must have good feeling in the office thats a sine qua non oh dicks got a splendid opinion of himself broke in stanley he had the cheek to tell raby yesterday that he played too much ecarte with the speaker remembered his audience too late colonel stuart grew purple and breathless do you mean to say that the boythat boypresumed to speak to rabyto my friend rabyabout his private actions lucilla what is the world coming to this was a problem never propounded to his wife save under dire provocation and the answer invariably warned him not to expect his own high standard from the world this time she ventured upon a timid addition to the effect that rumour did accuse mr raby of playing high and if he does retorted the colonel he can afford to pay raby my dear is a fine young fellow with good principlesdeuced good principles let me tell you i am very glad to hear it charles im sure for it would be a pity if a nice clever young man who would make any girl a good husband were to get into bad habits raby is a man any girl might be proud to marry he is a good fellow he looked at belle who smiled at him absently she was wondering where dick could be raby isnt a christian remarked mabel he told us yesterday he was something else what was it maud an erotic buddhist esoteric suggested belle its all the same he said we were the three thibetan sisters and he worshipped us all but we know who it is dont we how you giggle girls complained colonel stuart fretfully belle never giggles dear child i will teach you ecarte this evening it will amuse you it amused him which was more to the purpose in addition it prevented him from falling asleep after dinner which he was particularly anxious not to do that evening so they played until just as the clock was striking ten a step was heard outside and colonel stuart rose with a relieved remark that it must be john raby at last the opening door however only admitted truant dick with rather a flushed face from raby he said handing a note to his uncle i met the man outside the scowl which the sight of the culprit had raised on colonel stuarts face deepened as he read a palpable excuse for not coming over to play ecarte it seemed inconceivable that dicks remonstrance could have wrought this disappointment yet even the suggestion was unpleasant he turned on his nephew only too anxious to find cause of quarrel it was not hard to find for dick was manifestly excited at your old tricks again sir said his uncle sternly youve been drinking in the bazaar now dick ever since the day on which belle had come to him in distress over charlies abandonment to pegs had forsworn liquor as he had forsworn many another bad habit even when driven to despair he had not flown to the old anodyne but his very virtue had been his undoing and a single stiff tumbler of whisky and water forced on him by a friend who was startled by his looks as he returned fagged from a wander into the wilderness had gone to his unaccustomed head in a most unlookedfor degree the injustice of the accusation maddened him and he retorted fiercely i havent had so much to drink as you have sir dont speak to your uncle like that dick cried mrs stuart alarmed you had better go to bed dear it is the best place for you leave the room you dissipated young meddler thundered the colonel breaking in on his wifes attempt to avert a collision it was the first time belle had witnessed her fathers passion and the sight made her cling to him as if her touch might soothe his anger dick seeing her thus felt himself an outcast indeed ive not been drinking he burst out beside himself with jealousy and rage the man who says i have is a liar go to bed sir bawled his uncle or ill kick you out of the room ill have no drunkards here luckless dicks evil genius prompted an easy retort then youd better go first sir for ive seen you drunk oftener than youve seen me the next instant he was at belles side pleading for disbelief no no belle its a lie i am maddrunkanythingonly it is not true his denial struck home to the girls heart when the angry assertion might have glanced by a flash of intelligence lit up the past she recollected a thousand incidents she remembered a thousand doubts which had made no impression at the time and before colonel stuarts inarticulate splutterings of wrath found words her eyes met dicks so truthfully so steadily that he turned away in despair in blank hopeless despair why tomorrow he cried bitterly in answer to his uncles order to leave the room instantly and the house tomorrow theres no time like the present and i deserve it goodbye aunt lucilla youve been very kind always but i cant stand it any longer goodbye all of you he never even looked at belle again the door closed and he was gone poor dear dick remarked mrs stuart in her high complaining voice he always had a violent temper even as a baby dont fret about it my dearfor large tears were slowly rolling down belles cheekshe will be all right tomorrow youll see and he has really been steadiness itself of late he wasnt anything to speak of either urged mildred with her usual goodnature only a little bit on and i expect he had no dinner dinner or no dinner i say he was drunk growled colonel stuart sulkily no one lies like that unless he isthats my experience but belle scarcely realised what they said her heart was full of fear and though sleep came with almost unwelcome readiness to drive thought away she dreamt all night long that some one was saying one kind word belle only one kind word and she could not speak chapter v outside the parallelograms of white roads centred by brown stretches of stubbly grass and bordered by red and blue houses wherein the european residents of faizapore dwelt after their kind and our poor belle lay dreaming a very different world had been going on its way placidly indifferent not to her only but to the whole colony of strangers within its gates the great plains sweeping like a sea to the horizon had been ploughed sown watered harvested children had been born strong men had died crimes been committed noble acts done and of all this not one word had reached the alien ears only the district officer and his subaltern john raby bridged the gulf by driving down every day to the courthouse which lay just beyond the boundaries of the cantonment and close to the native city there for eight weary hours to come in contact with the most ignoble attributes of the indian and thence to drive at evening heartily glad of escape in the lines of the native regiment philip marsden went in and out among his men knowing them by name and sympathising with their lives but they too were a race apart from the tillers of soil the hewers of wood and drawers of water who pay the bills for the great empire even old mahomed lateef came but seldom to see the major sahib since he had been forced to send his benjamin to delhi there in a hotbed of vice and corruption to gain a livelihood by his penmanship the lad was employed on the staff of a redhot mahometan newspaper entitled the light of islam and spent his days in copying blatant leaders on to the lithographic stones nothing could exceed the lofty tone of the light of islam no trace of the old adam peeped through its exalted sentiments save when it spoke of the government or of its hindu rival the patriot then the editor took down his dictionary of synonyms and looking out all the bad epithets from abandoned to zymotic used them with more copiousness than accuracy sometimes however it would join issue with one adversary against another and blaze out into fiery paragraphs of the following order we are glad to see that yet once more the patriot forgetting its nonsensical raceprejudice for the nonce has to use a colloquialism followed our lead in pertinently calling on government for some worthy explanation of the dastardly outrage perpetrated by its minions on a virtuous mahometan widow c c and lovers of the dreadful after wading through a column of abuse would discover that the ancestral dirt of an old ladys cowhouse had been removed by order of the deputy commissioner yet the paper did good it could hardly do otherwise considering its exalted sentiments but for all that the occupation was an unwholesome one for an excitable lad like murghub ahmed while his fingers inked themselves hopelessly over the fine words his mind also became clouded by them the abuse of language intoxicated him until moderation seemed to him indifference and tolerance sympathy he took to sitting up of nights composing still more turgid denunciations and the first time the light of islam went forth bearing not only his handwriting but his hearts belief on its pages he felt that he had found his mission to think that but four months ago he had wept with disappointment because he was refused the post of statistical writer in a government office between striking averages and evolving utopias what a glorious difference he thanked providence for the change though his heart ached cruelly at times when he could spare nothing from his modest wage for the dear ones at home he had a wife waiting there for him ere long there might be a child and he knew her to be worse fed than many a streetbeggar it seemed to him part of the general injustice which set his brain on fire words nothing but words muttered old mahomed lateef as he lay under the solitary nim tree in his courtyard and spelt out the light of islam with the aid of a huge hornrimmed pair of spectacles pish the pen is mightier than the sword what whitelivered fool said that the boy should not have such water in his veins unless his mother played me false god knows women are deceitful and full of guile this was only his habit of thought he had no intention of casting aspersions on his much respected wife fatma bibi who just then appeared with a hookah full of the rankest tobacco i shall send for the boy oh fatma bi said the stern old domestic tyrant he is learning to say more than he dare do and that i will not have he shall come home and do more than he saysha ha fatma bi laughed too and clapped her wrinkled hands while the shy girl dutifully doing the daughterinlaws part of cooking turned her head away to smile lest any one should accuse her of joy because he was coming back so mahomed lateef covered a sheet of flimsy german notepaper bought in the bazaar with crabbed arabic lettering and the women rejoiced because the light of their eyes was coming back and after all the lad refused stoutly to return he wrote his father a letter full of the most trite and beautiful sentiments informing his aged parent that times had changed the old order given place to the new and that he intended to raise the banner of jehad religious war against the infidel the women cried bismillah and mahomed lateef despite his annoyance at the disobedience could not help as it were cocking his ears like an old warhorse yet he wrote the lad a warning after his lights which ran thus god and his prophet forbid oh son of my heart that i should keep thee back if as thou sayest thou wouldst raise the banner of jehad if a sword be needed i will send thee mine own friend but remember always what the mullah taught thee nor confound the three great thingsthe durulislam the durulhusub and the durulummun have at the hindu pigs especially any that bear kindred to shunkers fat carcase he hath cheated me rascally and built a window overlooking my yard for which i shall have the law of him but listen for the cry of the muezzin and put thy sword in the scabbard when its sound falls on thine ear remembering tis the house of protection and not the house of the foe if thou goest to china as perhaps may befall seeing the sahibs fight the infidel there remember to cool thy brothers grave with tears meanwhile play singlestick with shahbaz khan the mogul and if thou canst get the old meean sahib his father on his legs put the foils into his hand rap him over the knuckles once and he will teach thee more in one minute than his son in five then the old syyed lay down on his bed under the nim tree and fatma bi fanned the mosquitoes from him with a tinsel fan and talked in whispers to nasibun the childless wife of the deeds their boy was to do while haiyat bi the young bride busy as usual found time to dry her tears unseen a fire burning dim in one corner of the courtyard was almost eclipsed by the moon riding gloriously in the purpleblack sky overhead from the other side of the high partition wall came the dull throbbing of the dholki little drum and an occasional wild skirling of pipes the marriage festivities in shunker dass house had begun and every day some ceremony or other had to be gone through bringing an excuse for having the maransunis female musicians in to play and sing high up near the roof of the sugarcake house with its white filigree mouldings gleamed the objectionable window within sat the usurer himself conferring with his jackal one ram lal a man of small estate but infinite cunning it was from no desire of overlooking mahomed lateefs women that shunker das frequented the upper chamber he had other and far more important business on hand necessitating quiet and the impossibility of being overheard even up there the two talked in whispers and chuckled under their breath while in the courtyard below the delicate child who stood between shunker and damnation ate sweetmeats and turned night into day with weary yet sleepless eyes the moon shining in on the two courtyards shone also on the church garden as major marsden after going his rounds turned his horse into its winding paths a curious garden it was guiltless of flowers and planted for the most part with tombstones modern sanitation stepping in like aarons rod to divide the dead from the living had ceased to use it as a cemetery but the records of long forgotten sorrows remained looking ghostly in the moonlight the branch of a rosetree encroaching on the walk caught in the tassel of major marsdens bridle and he stooped to disentangle it straightening himself again he paused to look on the peaceful scene around him and perceived that some one a belated soldier most likely was lying not far off on a tombstone the horse picked its way among many a nameless grave to draw up beside a figure lying still as if carved in stone now my man whats up said major marsden dismounting to lay a heavy hand on its shoulder the sleeper rose almost automatically and stood before him alert and yet confused dick smith what on earth brings you here the boy could scarcely remember at first so far had sleep taken him from his troubles then he hung his head before memory im leaving faizapore and came hereto wait for daylight thats all but the moonlight on the tombstone showed its inscription sacred to the memory of john smith and philip marsden judged instantly that there was trouble afoot boys do not go to sleep on their fathers graves without due cause some scrape no doubt and yet his dislike to colonel stuart made him a partisan and he was more ready to believe ill of the elder than of the younger man dont be in a hurry he said kindly theres something wrong of course but very few scrapes necessitate running away theres nothing to make me run away replied dick with a lump in his throat as he unconsciously contrasted this strangers kindness with other peoples harshness but go i must where the question roused the sense of injury latent for years where how do i know i tell you theres nothing for me to do anywherenothing and then when a fellow is sick of waiting and runs wild a bit they throw it in his teeth when he has given it all up it was not very lucid but the lads tone was enough for philip marsden come home with me he said with a smile full of pity and have a real sleep in a real bed you dont know how different things will seem tomorrow dick looked at his hero thought how splendid he was and went with him like a lamb next morning when the boy with much circumlocution began to tell the tale of his troubles major marsden felt inclined to swear would he never learn to mistrust his benevolent impulses but go down to his grave making a fool of himself a boy and girl lovers quarrelwas that all yet as the story proceeded he became interested in spite of himself do you mean to tell me he said incredulously that miss stuart is absolutely ignorant of what goes on in that house dick laid his head on the table in sheer despair ah major major he cried i told heriyou should have seen her face he burst into incoherent regrets and praises of belles angelic innocence it appears to me remarked major marsden drily to be about the best thing that could have happened fiction is always unsafe belleas you call hermust have found it out sooner or later the sooner the better in my opinion you wouldnt say that if you knew her as i do explained the other eagerly or if you knew all that i do there will be a smash some day soon and it will kill belle outright ah if i hadnt been a fool and a brute i might have stayed and perhaps kept things from going utterly wrong then why dont you go back asked his hearer impatiently i cant he wont have me in the office again you dont know what mischief is brewing there thank you id rather not know but if youre certain this move of yours is finalthat is to say if you dont want to kiss and make friends with your cousinpoor dick writhed inwardly for he had kept back the full enormity of his offencethen i might be able to help you in getting employment they are laying a new telegraphline to the front and as it so happens a friend wrote to me a few days ago asking if i knew of any volunteers for the work the lads face brightened telegraphs oh i should like that ive been working at them these two years and i thinkbut im not surethat ive invented a new all right interrupted major marsden brusquely they can try you at any rate you can start tonight that settles it now you had better go round and get your things ready dick writhed again in mingled pride and regret i cant ive said goodbye to them all besides i left a bundle of sorts in the bazaar before i wentthere philip marsden shrugged his shoulders remarking that the boy might do as he liked and went off to his work returning about two oclock however to find dick asleep wearied out even by a halfnights vigil of sorrow how soft these young things are he thought as he looked down on the sleeping boy and noticed a distinctly damp pockethandkerchief still in the halfrelaxed hand a certain scorn was in his heart yet the very fact that he did notice such details showed that he was not so hard as he pretended he went into the rough disorderly room where he spent so many solitary evenings lit a cigar and walked about restlessly finally telling himself the while that he was a fool for his pains he sat down and wrote to belle stuart in this wise my dear miss stuartat the risk of once more being meddlesome i venture to tell you that your cousin dick smith goes off to beluchistan tonight as telegraph overseer it is dangerous work and perhaps you might like to see him before he leaves if so by riding through the church garden about six oclock you will meet him he doesnt know i am writing and would most likely object if he did but i know most women believe in the duty of forgiveness yours truly p h marsden ps if you were to send a small selection of warm clothing to meet him at the bullock train office it at any rate could not fail to be a comfort to him belle read this rather brusque production with shining eyes and a sudden lightening of her heart perhaps as she told herself this arose entirely from her relief on dicks account perhaps the conviction that major marsden could not judge her very harshly if he thought it worth while to appeal to her in this fashion had something to do with it the girl however did not question herself closely on any subject even the dreadful doubt which dicks mad words had raised the night before had somehow found its appointed niche in the orderly pageant of her mind where love sat in the place of honour was it true the answer came in a passionate desire to be ignorant and yet to protect and save very illogical no doubt but very womanly to a certain extent very natural also for her father forced by the circumstances detailed in the last chapter to retire early to bed had arisen next morning in a most edifying frame of mind and a somewhat depressed state of body he was unusually tender towards belle and spoke with kindly dignity of unhappy dicks manifest illluck these dispositions therefore rendered it easy for belle to make excuses in her turn not that she made them consciously that would have argued too great a change of thought the craving to forget and forgive was imperative and the sense of wrongdoing which her innate truthfulness would not allow to be smothered found an outlet in selfblame for her unkindness to dear dick as for poor father the epithets spoke volumes there is your cousin said major marsden to dick as belle rode towards them through the overarching trees in the church garden dont run away i asked her to come youll find me by the bridge the lad was like mahomets coffin hanging between a hell of remorse and a heaven of forgiveness as he watched her approach and when she reined up beside him he looked at her almost fearfully im sorry i was cross to you dick she said simply holding out her hand to him the clouds were gone and dick smith felt as if he would have liked to stand up and chant her praises or fight her battles before the whole world they did not allude to the past in any way until the time for parting came when dick urged thereto by the rankle of a certain epithet asked with a furious blush if she would promise to forgeteverything she looked at him with kindly smiling eyes goodbye dear dick she said and then suddenly she stooped and kissed him the young fellow could not speak he turned aside to caress the horse and stood so at her bridlerein for a moment god bless you for that belle he said huskily and left her belle with a lump in her own throat and tearful shining eyes rode back past the bridge where philip marsden leaning over the parapet watched the oily flow of the canal water in the cut below he looked up thinking how fair and slim and young she was and raised his hat expecting her to pass but she paused he felt a strange thrill as his eyes met hers still wet with tears i have so much to thank you for major marsden she said with a little tremor in her voice and i do it so badly you see i dont always understand something in her tone smote philip marsden with remorse please not to say any more about it miss stuart i understandandand im glad you do not thinking over his words afterwards he came to the conclusion that both these statements had wandered from the truth but how he asked himself a little wrathfully could any man tell the naked unvarnished disagreeable truth with a pair of grey eyes soft with tears looking at him dick of course raved about his cousin for the rest of the evening and besought the major to send him confidential reports on the progress of events in his opinion disaster was unavoidable and he was proceeding to detail his reasons when major marsden cut him short by saying i would rather not hear anything about it and i should like to know first if you are engaged to your cousin dick confessed he was not whereupon his companion told him that he would promise nothing except he added hastily catching sight of dicks disappointed face to help the girl in any way he could with this the boy professed to be quite content perhaps he had grasped the fact that philip marsden was apt to be better than his word and indeed a day or two after dicks departure marsden took the trouble to go over and inquire of john raby what sort of a man lala shunker das the great contractor was supposed to be the young civilian laughed like them all not to be trusted why do you ask he broke in on the evasive answer by continuing the man is a goldsmith by caste i suppose you know that in old days they were never allowed in government service as the proverb says a goldsmith will do his grandmother out of a pice but if the lalaji gives you trouble bring him to me ive been kind to him and he is grateful in his way now the history of john rabys kindness to lala shunker das was briefly this he had discovered him in an attempt to cheat the revenue in the matter of incometax and had kept the knowledge in his own hands purists would say i ought to report it and smash the man argued this astute young casuist but the knowledge that his ruin in the matter of that rai bahadurship hangs by a thread will keep the old thief straighter besides it is always unwise to give away power that to a great extent was the keynote of john rabys life he coveted power not so much for its own sake as for the use he could make of it for just as some men inherit a passion for drink he had inherited greed of gain from a long line of jewish ancestry the less said of his family the better indeed so far as his own account went he appeared to have been born when he went to read with a celebrated coach at the age of sixteen memory never carried him further in outward speech but as this is no uncommon occurrence in indian society the world accepted him for what he appeared to be a welleducated gentleman and for what he was a man with a pension for himself and his widow his first collector a civilian of the old type used to shake his head when john rabys name was mentioned and augur that he would either be hanged or become a chief court judge he was in camp with me sir this worthy would say when a flight of wild geese came bang over the tent i got a couple the last with the full choke and i give you my word of honour raby never lifted his eyes from the buniahs book he was deciphering in a petty bond case in truth the young mans faculty for figures and his aptitude for discovering fraud partook of the nature of genius and gained him the reputation of being a perfect shaitan devil among the natives philip marsden associated with him on a committee for the purchase of mules learnt to trust his acumen implicitly and became greatly interested in the clearheaded wellmannered young fellow who knew such a prodigious amount for his years pleasant in society too singing sentimental songs in a light tenor voice and having a store of that easy smalltalk which makes society smooth by filling up the chinks being a regular visitor of colonel stuarts house john raby saw a good deal of belle and liked her in a friendly approving manner but whatever mrs stuart may have thought he had no more intention of marrying a penniless girl than of performing a pilgrimage or any other pious act savouring of the middle ages by the way i havent seen the miss van milders or their mother lately remarked major marsden one day to him as they came home from their committee together and met belle going out for her afternoon ride by herself oh theyve gone to mussoorie belles keeping house for her father alone yes alone queer menage aint it i believe the girl thinks shell reform the colonel and he is awfully fond of her but the younger man shook his head with a laugh it jarred upon philip marsden and he changed the subject quickly so she had elected to stay with her father well he admired her courage and could only hope that she would not have to pay too dearly for it chapter vi lala shunker das having discarded all clothing save a scarf of white muslin tied petticoatwise round his loins lay on a wooden bed perched high on the topmost platform of his tall house but even there the burning breezes of may brought no relief from the heat and he lay gasping while his faithful jackal ram lal pounded away with lean brown knuckles at his masters fat body the massage seemed to do little good for he grunted and groaned dismally in truth the lala ached all over both in body and soul a thousand things had conspired against him his last and most expensive wife after spending a fortune in pilgrimages had committed the indiscretion of presenting him with a girl baby his grandmother having died he had been forced much against his will to shave his head his greatest rival had been elevated to the honorary magistracy and adding injury to insult been associated with him on a bunch bench and justice grown in bunches is not nearly so remunerative to the grower as single specimens these were serious ills but there was one far more trivial which nevertheless smarted worst of all perhaps because it was the most recent that very morning shunker das as behoved one of his aspirations had testified to his loyalty by attending the usual parade in honour of the queens birthday on previous occasions he had driven thither in his barouche but ambition had suggested that an appearance on horseback would show greater activity and please the powers so he bought a cast horse from the cavalry regiment just ordered on service and having attired himself in glittering raiment including a magnificent turban of pink benares muslin he took his place by the flagstaff people congratulated him warmly on his confidential charger which even at the feu de joie seemed lost in philosophic reflections shunker das waxed jubilant over the success of his scheme and was just giving himself away in magnificent lies when the bugle sounded for close order preparatory to a few words from the general to the departing cavalry regiment on this the warhorse pricked up its ears and starting off at a dignified trot rejoined its old companions while the lala swearing hideously tugged vainly at the reins arrived at the line the conscientious creature sidled down it trying vainly to slip into a vacant place failing of success the intelligent beast concluded it must be on orderly duty and just as the lala was congratulating himself on having finished his involuntary rounds his horse turning at right angles bounded off to rejoin the generals staff away went the lalas stirrups he must have gone too despite his clutch on the mane had not the streaming end of his pugree caught in the high crupperstrap and held fast so stayed fore and aft he might have reached the goal in safety had not the general annoyed by the suppressed tittering around him lost patience and angrily ordered some one to stop that man whereupon a mischievous aidedecamp gave the word for the halt to be sounded confused out of everything save obedience the charger stopped dead in his tracks and the lala shot over his head still in a sitting posture on being relieved of his burden the coordination stables apparently came uppermost in the horses mind for it walked away slowly bearing with it the end of the lalas turban still fastened in the crupper he feeling a sudden insecurity in his headgear and being even in his confusion painfully conscious of his baldness clung to the lower folds with both hands at this slight check the charger not to be baulked set off at a canter and over rolled the fat lala heels in air then and not till then one roar of laughter rent the air for as he lay there on his back kicking like a turned turtle the pugree began to unwind like a ball of thread while the lala held on like grim death to the lower portion not until the last fold had slipped through his fingers and a quarter of a mile or so of pink muslin was fluttering across the parade ground did he realise the position and struggling to his seat pass his hand over his bald head with a deprecating smile go out raby and pick him up gasped the general aching with laughter youre in political charge arent you but philip marsden who happened to be on staff duty that day was already pouring in oil and wine to the lalas hurt dignity when the young civilian came up with nonchalant courtesy shahbash sahib he said you sat him splendidly and that last prop would have undone a centaur the lala grinned a ghastly smile and philip marsden turned impatiently saying aside get him home do he looks so helpless with his bald head it seems a shame to laugh john raby raised his eyebrows the general shall lend him his carriage that will soothe his wounded vanity so the lala with his head tied up in a red pockethandkerchief went home in the big mans barouche and the spectators of his discomfiture laughed again at the recollection of it you ought to be the editor of a native newspaper marsden remarked john raby you would be grand on the unsympathetic angloindian but if id seen the viceroy himself being unwound like a reel of cotton i must have chuckled no doubt replied the other laughing himself yet i am sure a keen sense of the ludicrous is unfortunate in a conquering race we english always laugh when policy should make us grave that is why we dont succeed perhaps for myself i prefer to grin as some one says humour is the religion of today those who believe in eternity have time for tears we otherswhy we cry vogue la galere lala shunker das however without any abiding belief in a future state was in no laughing mood as he lay under ram lals manipulations listening captiously to his items of bazaar rumour and they say lalji that the sirkar thinks of transferring colonel estuart sahib shunker das sat up suddenly and scowled transfer estuart sahibwhy ram lal redoubled his exertions on the new portion of the lalas frame thus brought within reach until the latter uttering dismal groans sank back to his former position they say he continued calmly that the sirkar is beginning to suspect fool idiot knave growled his master gasping at the furious onslaught on his fat stomach tis all thy bungling have i not bid thee not go so fast times have changed since the commissariat sahibs sat in their verandahs and one could walk a file of twenty camels round and round the house until they counted the proper number but remember tis thou who goest to the wall not i thats the compact shunker finds the money ramu runs the risk have i forgotten it lalaji replied the other with some spirit ramu is ready and tis shunkers part to look after the wife and children when im in jail dont forget that the master would do better if he were bolder this one would have made much in that fodder contract but your heart was as water it always is and if estuart is transferred what then if the branch be properly limed the bird sticks is it limed such things are the masters work not mine ay limed right enough for him but the money ramu the money it will take months to lay the snare for a new man and the war will be over the lala positively wept at the idea ram lal looked at him contemptuously get what is to be got from this sahib at any rate thats my advice the very next day lala shunker das drove down to the commissariat office intent on striking a grand blow things had been going on better than could have been expected in the large empty house where belle thinner and paler as the days of intense heat went by did the honours cheerfully it was not without a struggle that she had been allowed to remain with her father mrs stuart had prophesied endless evil beginning with a bad reputation for herself as stepmother but prudential reasons had given their weight in favour of the girls earnest desire to make light of the heat and avoid flight to the hills was a great recommendation for a civilians wife and that mrs stuart had decreed was to be belles fate so with many private injunctions to the khansamah not to allow the miss sahib to interfere too much in the management the good lady had as usual taken herself and her family to mussoorie shortly after they left fate played a trump for belle by sending a slight attack of malarious fever to the colonel he was always dreadfully alarmed about himself and a hint from the doctor about the consequences of overfree living reduced him to toast and water for a week and kept him from mess for three belle was in a heaven of delight and she was just enjoying the sight of her father actually drinking afternoon tea when budlu came in to say the lalaji wanted to see the colonel dont go father pleaded belle its only that horrid fat man tell him to come again john raby who often strolled across about teatime looked at colonel stuart and smiled he knew most things in the station among others how unpleasant a visitor shunker das might be to his host and not being illnatured he chimed in with the girl by offering to see the man himself the lala leaning back magnificently in his barouche felt a sudden diminution of dignity at the sight of john raby bruises all right lala asked the young man cheerfully and shunkers dignity sank lower still they ought to give you that rai bahadurship for the way you stuck to him by george they should we dont often get men of your stamp lala with estates in every districtdo we so you want to see the colonel what for he added suddenly and sternly huzoor bleated the fat man ii came to inquire after his honours health much obliged to you he is better and i really think if you were to come say this day fortnight he might be able to see you shunker das hesitated fear for his money making him brave there were rumours he began that my good patron was about to be transferred sits the wind in that quarter thought raby amused my dear lala he said its absolutely untrue your eighty thousand is quite safe i assure you huzoor goodbye lalajithis day fortnight and he returned to his cup of tea in high goodhumour then he sat and played ecarte with the colonel for an hour while belle worked and watched them carelessly that makes fifteen remarked the young man as he rose to go whereupon colonel stuart assented cheerfully for he had won that evening and belle looked up with a smiling farewell unconscious and content she lived in a fools paradise hugging the belief that her presence was the charm as though niagara was to be stemmed by a straw or the habit of years by a sentiment as time wore on the few remaining ladies fled before that last awful pause ere the rains break when a deadly weariness settles on all living things belle feeling shy among so many men ceased to go out except on the rare occasions when she could persuade her father to accompany her but though he still adhered to his habit of dining at home he was moody and out of sorts he too had heard rumours of transfer and that meant the possibility of disaster not to be faced with composure restless and irritable he began to relieve the great craving which took possession of him by all sorts of stimulant and narcotic drugs and one day came an almost illegible note from him bidding belle not wait dinner for him she felt instinctively that this was the beginning of trouble nor was she wrong for though colonel stuart was full of excuses the next evening he never even sent a note the day after that so belle ate her solitary dinners as best she might and though she often lay awake till the small hours of the morning brought an altercation between budlu and her father she never sat up for him or made any effort to meet him on his return from this time brutal though it may seem to say so poor belles presence in the house so far from being an advantage became a distinct drawback but for it colonel stuart would have yielded to the mad craze for drink which generally beset him at this time of the year and after a shorter or longer bout as the case might be have been pulled up short by illness instead of this he tried to keep up appearances and drugged himself with chloral and laudanum till the remedy grew worse than the disease so far as he himself was concerned it served however to hide the real facts from his daughter for he met her timid protests by complaints of illhealth assertions that he knew what was best for him and absolute refusal to call in a doctor she grew alarmed the long silent days spent in brooding over her fathers altered demeanour were too great a strain on her nerves and she began to exaggerate the position her thoughts turned again and again to dick if he were there ah if he were only there no one who has not had in extreme youth to bear anxiety alone can fully understand the horror of silence to the young belle felt she must speak must tell some one of her trouble it seemed to her as if her silence was a sort of neglect and that some one must be able to do something to set matters straight but who she hesitated and shrank till one day her father broke down and began to cry piteously in the middle of his ordinary abuse of the servants at lunch a stiff glass of whiskyandwater restored his anger effectually and he made light of the incident but that evening when philip marsden came in late to dress for dinner he found a note awaiting him from belle she having received no answer had been expecting him all the afternoon and as time passed began to wonder at her own temerity in writing dick it is true had bidden her look on major marsden as one willing to help if needs be but what could dick know she went out after a pretence of dinner to the little raised platform in the garden where chairs were set every evening for those who preferred it to the house belle liked it far better the purple arch of sky spangled with stars save where the growing moon outshone them rested her tired eyes and the ceaseless quiver of the cicala prevented her from thinking by its insistence suddenly her halfdoze was interrupted by a voice asking for the miss sahib and she stood up trembling and uncertain why had she sent for him and what should she say now that he had come i came as soon as i could miss stuart said major marsden formally as their hands met but i was out all day and had a guest to entertain at mess he stopped dismayed at her appearance and added in quite a different tone i am afraid you are ill she did indeed look ghastly pale in the moonlight her eyes full of appeal and her lips quivering yet her shyness had gone with the first look at his face and she felt glad that she had sent for him it is father she began then could say no more for fear of breaking down the trivial words brought back the recollection of that first meeting with her months before when she had made the same reply to his offer of help and as he stood waiting for her to master the fastrising sobs a remorse seized him with the thought that surely some of this pain might have been prevented somehow by some one you must think me very silly she murmured hastily i think you are overdone he replied and i dont expect youve had any dinner now have you a smile struggled to her face i dont think i hadmuch then i will tell the khansamah to bring you something now the fullblown tragedy of life seemed to have departed she even wondered at her own tears as she sipped her soup and told him of her troubles with a lightening heart budlu says he never saw father like this before was the climax and even that did not seem a hopeless outlook could he not take leave suggested major marsden at once leave being the panacea for all ills in india thats what i want to know i begged him to go but the very idea excites him would it harm him officially is there any reason why he should not dicks words of warning recurred to major marsden unpleasantly none that i know of he replied i will go round to seymours tomorrow and get him to bundle you both off to the hills you want change as much as your father in a months time you will be laughing at all these fears i think you are laughing at them now said belle wistfully am i well i promise not to laugh at you any more miss stuart he stood up tall and straight to say goodbye isnt that rather a rash promise major marsden i dont think so anyhow i make it and im very glad you sent for me considering how little you knew of meand how disagreeable that little had beenit was kind i know a great deal of you she replied smiling softly dick has told me a lotabout the brevetand the intelligenceworkand the afghan sepoy and the men in buckram too i suppose im afraid dick is not to be trusted did he tell you how the man escaped next day and i got a wigging no cried belle indignantly did hedid you i meanwhat a shame on the contrary it was quite right ill tell you about it some day if i may meanwhile goodbye and dont starve it really doesnt do any good she watched him jingle down the steps thinking how like an overgrown schoolboy he looked in his messjacket so life was not a tragedy after all but a seriocomedy in which only the monologues were depressing and dull she went in and played the piano till it was time to go to bed yet nothing had really changed and fate marched on relentlessly as before we make our own feelings and then sit down to weep or smile over them the very next afternoon colonel stuart was brooding silently over nothing at all in his private officeroom passing the time as it were out of mischief till he went to dine with john raby for the latter with a sort of contemptuous kindness put the drag of an occasional game of ecarte on to the colonels potations sitting in the dusk his face looked wan and haggard and despite his profound stillness every nerve was wearied and yet awake with excitement as might be seen from his unrestrained start when shunker das came into the room unannounced for the officehours being over the chuprassie had departed well what is it now he cried sharply i saw you this morning havent you got enough for one day am i never to have any peace an angry tone generally reduced his native visitors to submission but the lala was evidently in no mood for silence he had taken up a small contract that morning the earnestmoney of which lay for the time in colonel stuarts safe since then he had heard casually that a longexpected source of profit over which he had often talked with the colonel and for which he had even made preparations had slipped through his fingers in other words that all the muletransport was to be bought by a special officer ive come sahib he blurted out sitting down unasked to know if it is true that mardsen sahib has the purchase of mules and if he has what the devil is it to you or to me the mans arrogance was becoming unbearable and colonel stuart was a great stickler for etiquette only this that if you are not going to deal fairly by me you mustnt count on my silence thats all go and tell the whole bazaar i owe you money you black scoundrel cried his hearer annoyed beyond endurance by the mans assumption of equality ill pay you every penny if i sell my soul for it curse you eighty thousand rupees is a tall price sahib sneered the lala and how about the contracts and the commission and the general partnership am i to tell that also the colonel stared at him in blank surprise god knows in his queer conglomerate of morality it was hard to tell what elementary rock of principle might be found yet to a certain extent honour remained as it were in pebbles worn and frayed by contact with the stream of life general partnership you black devil what do you mean mean echoed the lala shrilly why the money ive lent you paid you for each contract the commission ive given your clerks the grain your horses have eaten the the colonels right hand was raised above his head the first coarse rage of his face had settled into a stern wrath that turned it white if you stop here another instant by god ill kill you the words came like a steelthrust and the lala without a word turned and fled before the berserk rage of the northman it is always terrible to the oriental and the lala was a heavensent coward stop cried the colonel as the wretched creature reached the door he obeyed and came back trembling take your money for the contract with you its cancelled i wont have it in the house take it back and give me the receipt i gave you give it me i say the colonel fumbling at the lock of the safe stuttered and shook with excitement take em back he continued flourishing a roll of notes the receiptquick out with itthe receipt for the three thousand five hundred i gave you this morning huzoor huzoor i am looking for it be patient one moment the lalas quivering fingers blundered among the papers in his pocketbook give it me or by heaven ill break every bone in your body his hand came down with an ominous thud on the table i will give it sahibi have itherenoah praise to the gods he shook so that the paper rustled in his hand colonel stuart seized it and tearing it to bits flung the pieces in the waste paper basket at his feet there goes your last contract from me and theres the door and theres your money as he flung the notes in the mans face they went fluttering over the floor and he laughed foolishly to see them gathered up in trembling haste gad he muttered as he sank exhausted into a chair there isnt much fear of shunker so long as ive a stick in my hand hullo whats that something rustled under the table here budlu quick lights it may be a snake confound the servants theyre never to be found he stopped and drew his hand over his forehead two or three times just then budlu entering with the lamp stooped to pick something from the floor it was a note for a thousand rupees crisp and crackling colonel stuart looked at it in a dazed sort of way then burst into a roar of laughter and put it in his pocketbook my fair perquisite by jove and it will come in useful tonight at ecarte budlu give me the little bottle i must steady my nerves a bit if im to play with raby chapter vii people who talk of the still indian night can scarcely do so from experience for especially during the hot weather darkness in the east is vocal with life the cicala shrills its loudest the birds are awake and the very trees and plants seem to blossom audibly go round an indian garden at sunset and it is a sepulchre the roses shrivelled in their prime the buds scorched in the birth the foliage beaten down by the fierce sun visit it again at sunrise and you will find it bright with blossom sweet with perfume refreshed with dew that is the work of night what marvel then if it is instinct with sound and movement never for one hour does silence fall upon the world the monotonous beat of some native musicians drum goes on and on a village dog barks and is answered by another until seventy times seven a crow takes to cawing irrelatively the birds sing in snatches and the indian cock like that of scriptural story crows for other reasons besides the dawn the longlegged rooster who habitually retired to sleep on the summit of colonel stuarts cookroom had however legitimate cause for his vociferations and dawn was just darkening the rest of the sky when the sudden flapping of his wings startled the horse of an early wayfarer who came at a walk down the mall it was philip marsden setting out betimes for a two days scour of the district in search of the very mules out of which shunker das had hoped to make so much profit most men carrying ten thousand rupees with them would have applied for a treasurechest and a police guard but major marsden considered himself quite sufficient security for the roll of currency notes in his breastpocket as he quieted the frightened horse his close proximity to the commissariat office reminded him that he had forgotten to apply for a certain form on which he had to register his purchases the omission would entail delay so he anathematised his own carelessness and was riding on when a light in the officewindows attracted his attention it was early for any one to be at work but knowing how time pressed in all departments under the strain of war he thought it not improbable that some energetic babu was thus seeking the worm of promotion and might be able to give him what he required dismounting lest his horses tread should disturb the sleepers in the house by which he had to pass he hitched the reins to a tree and made his way towards the office not without a kindly thought of the girl forgetful of care who lay sleeping so near to him that unconsciously he slackened his step and trod softly he had been as good as his word and that very day the doctor was to go over and prescribe immediate change change he smiled at the idea wondering what change could stem the course of the inevitable as he drew near he saw that the light came not from the office but from its chiefs private room he hesitated an instant then a suspicion that something might be wrong made him go on till he could see through the open door into the room thefts were common enough in cantonments and it was as well to make sure through the chick he could distinctly see a wellknown figure seated at the writingtable leaning forward on its crossed arms drunk said philip marsden to himself with a thrill of bitter contempt and turned away the bearer would find the colonel and put him decently to bed long before the girl was up poor belle the little platform where she had stood but the night before was faintly visible bringing a recollection of her pale face and sad appeal it is fatherthe first words she had ever said to him the very first he retraced his steps quickly set the chick aside and entered the room the lamp on the table was fast dying out but its feeble flicker fell full on the colonels grey hair and lit up the shining gold lace on his messjacket silver and gold and scarleta brilliant show of colour in the shabby dim room a curious smell in the air and a great stillness made philip marsden stop suddenly and call the sleeper by name in the silence which followed he heard the ticking of a chronometer which lay close to him he called again not louder but quicker then with swift decision passed his arm round the leaning figure and raised it from the table the grey head fell back inertly on his breast and the set halfclosed eyes looked up lifelessly into his dead he heard himself say deaddead not drunk as he stood there for an instant with the dead mans head finding a restingplace so close to his heart the wan face looking up at him as if in a mute appeal a flame of bitter regret for his own harsh judgment seemed to shrivel up all save pity the great change had come to end poor belles anxieties and she ah poor child who was to tell her of it he lifted the head from his breast laying it once more as he had found it on the crossed arms then looked round the room rapidly an empty bottle of chloral on the table accounted for the faint sickly smell he had noticed was it a mistake if not why perhaps there was a letter something at any rate lay under the nerveless hands powerless now to defend their secret philip marsden took the paper from them gently and turned up the expiring lamp till it flared smokily the blotted writing was hard to read yet easy to understand for it told a tale too often written a tale of debt dishonour remorse despair ten thousand rupees borrowed from the safe and an unsigned cheque for the amount drawn on no one but payable to the government of india lying beside the dead man in mute witness to the last desire for restitution in the poor stupefied brain a pile of official letters were scattered on the floor as if they had fallen from the table all save one were unopened but that one contained a notification of colonel stuarts transfer major marsden drew a chair to the table and deliberately sat down to think something must be done and that quickly for already the merciless light of day was gaining on the darkness and there is nothing hid that shall not be made manifest the words somehow recurred to his memory bringing another pulse of pity for poor belle what was to be done the answer came to him suddenly in a rush as if it had all been settled before why had fate sent him there with more than enough money to save the girl from shame money that was his to use as he chose for he could repay it twenty times over ere nightfall why had fate mixed the girls life with his despite his efforts to stand aloof why had she sent for him whywhy was he there the dead mans keys lay on the table the sum owed was clearly set down in black and white the safe close at hand what was there save a personal loss he could well afford to prevent silence and he had promised help when the hastilysummoned doctor came in a few minutes later the bottle of chloral still lay on the table but the blotted paper and the cheque were gone the lamp had flared out and a little heap of grey ashes on the hearth drifted apart as the doors and windows were flung wide open to let in all the light there was he has been dead about two hours said the doctor overdose of chloral of course i forbade it from the hospital but he got it elsewhere they had laid the dead man on the floor and the grey dawn falling on his face made it seem greyer still the native servants huddled trembling at the door the two englishmen stood looking down upon the still figure there is always the fear of an overdose said philip marsden slowly or of some rash mistake the doctor met his look comprehensively exactly who can tell unless there is circumstantial evidence and i see none as yet anyhow he was not responsible for he has been on the verge of delirium tremens for days then you give the benefit of the doubt always if possible again the wind of dawn fanning the dead mans hair drifted the grey ashes further apart he had better stay here continued the doctor moving him might rouse the poor girl and theres no need for that as yet by the way who is to tell her there isnt a lady or a parson in the place i suppose i must returned philip after a pause i think it might be best since she confided her trouble to me but couldnt i get some sort of a woman from barracks just to stay with her right youre a thoughtful fellow marsden take my buggy and go to the sergeantmajor his wife will know of some one ill stay till you return in case she wakes and look here as you pass send a man about the coffin the funeral must be this evening and philip marsden fled from the dreary details of death with a remark that the doctor could send a messenger he was no coward yet he felt glad to escape into the level beams of the rising sun as he drove down along the staring white roads he asked himself more than once why he had interfered to save a girl he scarcely knew from the knowledge of her fathers dishonour and if he could find no sufficient reason for it he could find no regret either it had been an impulse and it was over he had kept his word to dick and done his best to drive care from those clear eyeswhat beautiful eyes they were och then cried mrs ogrady the sergeantmajors wife who hastily roused from her slumbers came out into the verandah in scanty attire and is the swate young leddy alone its meself wud go at wanst but that im a holy roman surr and shud be talkin of the blessed saints in glory an thats not the thing wid a prothestant in his coffin despite his anxiety her hearer could not repress a smile i dont set so much store by religious consolation mrs ogrady its more a kind motherly person i want then tim cried the good lady appealing to her spouse who had appeared in shirt and trousers mrs flanigan wud be the woman but that shes daily expectin her tinth isnt there some kindly person whos seen trouble hastily interrupted the major ah if its the throuble youre wantin take little mrs vickary a baptist and a widdermore by token twice bore with two dhrunken bastes major like a blissed angel and wud be ready to spake up for anny one major marsden with a recollection of widow vickarys sad face as nurse by a comrades sick bed pleaded for a younger and brighter one thereupon the serjeantmajor suggested poor healys mary ann but his wife tossed her head what the men see in that gurrll surr i cant say but shell go and cheerful wid her little boy a swate little boy surr like thim cherubs with a trumpetfor her father she come to live wid died of the fayver a month gone and her man is waiting to be killed by thim afghans somewhere so major marsden driving back with poor healys mary ann and the cherub wielding a piece of sugarcane as trumpet found belle still sleeping then together in the fresh early morning they broke the sad tidings to the girl how it does not much matter for words mean nothing we say he is dead many and many a time carelessly indifferently then comes a day when the sentence is fraught with wild despair and helpless pain the sun seems blotted out and the world is dark yet the words are the same nor can pen and ink write them differently let me see that he is dead oh let me see him was her cry so they took her across to the shabby room where everything stood unchanged save for the sheeted figure on the string bed the gardener had strewn some roses over it and the sun streamed in brightly the sight brought no real conviction to belle it all seemed more dreamlike than ever to fall asleep as she had done in the turmoil of life and to wake finding the hush of death in possession of all things she let philip marsden lead her away passively like a child and all through the long day she sat idle and tearless with her hands on her lap as if she were waiting for something or some one yet it was a busy day in that quiet empty house for in india death comes rudely many a time has the father to superintend the making of the little coffin while the mother stitches away to provide a daintier restingplace for the golden head that is used to frills and lace until in the dawn those two go forth alone to the desolate graveyard and he reads the church service as best he can and she says amen between her sobs there was none of this strain for belle nothing to remind her of the inevitable so she wondered what they wanted of her when as the glare of sunset reddened the walls of her room major marsden came and looked at her with pitying eyes it is time we were starting miss stuart he said gently starting where we thought you would like to go to the cemetery and i have arranged to drive you down it will be a military funeral of course she rose swiftly in passionate entreaty ah no no not so soon he is not dead oh i cannot i cannot then seeing the tender gravity of his face she clasped her hands on his arm and begged to see him once morejust to say goodbye he shook his head it is too lateit is best not but i have no dressit cant be she pleaded vainly every one will be in white as you are he returned with tears he could not check in his eyes come it will be better for you by and by he laid his hand on her clasped ones she looked in his eyes doubtfully and did as she was bidden we will drive out a bit first said philip when she had taken her seat by his side in the tall dogcart that seemed so out of keeping with its dismal office we have plenty of time for i thought the air would do your head goodandit was best for you to be away just now better and best as if anything could make any difference now you are very kind she said in dull recognition of his care philip marsden never forgot that drive the memory of it remained with him for years as a kind of nightmare the girl in her white dress and sailor hat as he had seen her at many a tennisparty the great bank of clouds on the horizon telling of welcome rain the little squirrels leaping across the white road the cattle returning homewards amid clouds of dust the stolid stare of the natives as they passed by it was almost a relief to stand side by side before an open grave listening to an even disciplined tramp audible above the muffled drums coming nearer and nearer a dingy brick wall bleached to mudcolour shut out all view but high up in the sky above the fringe of grey tamarisk trees a procession of flameedged clouds told that out in the west nature was celebrating the obsequies of day in glorious apparel suddenly the dead march struck up loud and full bringing to philip marsdens memory many a sworddecked coffin and riderless charger behind which he had walked wondering if his turn would come next the music ceased with a clash of arms at the gate and after a lowtoned order or two the procession appeared in narrow file up the central path the white uniforms looked ghostly in the deepening shadows but through a break in the trees a last sunbeam slanted over the wall making the spikes on the officers helmets glow like stars belles clasped yet listless fingers tightened nervously as the brigademajors voice rose and fell in monotonous cadence about our dear brother departed it seemed to her like a dream or rather as if she too were dead and had no tears no grief nothing but a great numbness at her heart then some one put a clumsilymade cross of white flowers into her hands bidding her lay it on the coffin bared now of the protecting flag and she obeyed wondering the while why other people should have thought of these things when she had not and thinking how crooked it was and how much better she could have made it herself perhaps for the hands that twined it were not used to such womans work it was philip marsdens task also to throw the first handful of earth into the grave and draw belles arm within his own before the salutes rang out they startled the screaming parrots from their roost among the trees and sent them wheeling and flashing like jewels against the dark purple clouds was it never going to end she thought wearily as they waited again and yet again for the rattle of the rifles yet she stood heedlessly silent even when the band struck into quick time and the cheerful echo of the mens answering footsteps died away into the distance take her home said the doctor who with john raby had remained to see the grave properly filled in ill call round by and by with a sleeping draught that will do her more good than anything as they drove back she complained quite fretfully of the cold and her companion reined in the horse while he wrapped his military coat round her fastening it beneath her soft dimpled chin with hands that trembled a little she seemed to him inexpressibly pitiful in her grief and his heart ached for her it is going to rain i think she said suddenly with her eyes fixed on the dull red glow barred by heavy storm clouds in the west adding in a lower tone father will get wet major marsden looked at her anxiously and drove faster frightened at the dull despair of her tone he had meant to say goodbye at the door but he could not how could he leave her to that unutterable loneliness and yet what good could he do beyond beguiling her to take a few mouthfuls of food poor healys mary ann proved helpless before a form of grief to which she was utterly unaccustomed and as her presence seemed to do more harm than good philip marsden sent her into the next room where she nursed her boy and wept profusely he sat talking to belle till long after the messhour and then when he did turn to go the sight of her seated alone tearless and miserable in the big empty room was too much for his soft heart he came back hastily bending over her then kneeling to look in her downcast face and take her cold little hands into his warm ones and say kind words that came from his very heart perhaps they brought conviction perhaps the touch of his hand assured her of sympathy for suddenly her dull despair gave way she laid her head on his shoulder and cried pitifully as children cry themselves to sleep with the clasp of his fingers on hers and his breath stirring her soft curly hair philip marsdens heart beat fast and his pulses thrilled his own emotion startled and perplexed him he shrank from it and yet he welcomed it did he love her was this the meaning of it all how good you are she whispered trying to regain her composure what should i have done without you her unconsciousness smote him with regret and a great tenderness there are plenty who will be kind to you he answered unsteadily life holds everything for you yet my dear peace and happiness and love love did it hold his for her he asked himself again as he walked homewards in the dark love he was quite a young man still only two and thirty yet he had deliberately set passion and romance from him years before poverty had stood between him and the realisation of a dream till with the sight of his ideal profoundly happy as some one elses wife had come distrust and contempt for a feeling that experience showed him did not could not last why therefore should it enter into and disturb his life at all friendship ah that was different perhaps the future held a time when he would clasp hands with a lifecompanion a woman to be the mistress of his home the mother of his children but belle poor little soft belle stuart with her beautiful grey eyes he seemed to feel the touch of her hand in his the caress of her hair on his lips and though he laughed grimly at himself he could not master the joy that took possession of him at the remembrance dear little belle amidst the doubt and surprise which swept over him as he realised his own state of mind but one thing gave him infinite satisfactionhe had saved her from the far more lasting trouble of her fathers disgrace friend or lover it had been a good deed to do and he was glad that he had done it nothing could alter that and while he slept dreaming still of his clasp on the little cold yet willing hand an official envelope lay on the table beside him mocking his security he opened it next morning to lay it aside with a curse at his own ill luck though it was only a notification that major p h marsden would carry on the current duties of the commissariat office till further orders he had half a mind to go over to the brigade office and get himself excused a word or two about his other work would do it but his pride rose in arms against any shirking for private reasons besides there might be nothing wrong in colonel stuarts accounts and even if there was he would be the best man to find it out yet he walked up and down the verandah a prey to conflicting desires bitterly angry with himself for hesitating an instant common sense told him that it might be as well for one less biassed than he was by previous knowledge to undertake the scrutiny that it was scarcely fair for him to go to the task with a foregone conclusion in his mind but pride suggested that he could not trust himself to decide fairly even now how could he when he was bitterly conscious of one overmastering desire to save belle then came the thought that if she was indeed what in his heart he believed her to be if her steadfastness and straightforwardness were more than a match for his own then the very idea of his refusing the task would be an offence to her after that nothing could have prevented him from placing himself with open eyes in a position from which in common fairness to himself and others he ought to have escaped chapter viii a few days after colonel stuarts death john raby was making up his accounts in a very unenviable frame of mind though the balance on the right side was a large one as a rule this result would have given him keen pleasure for though he was as yet too young to enjoy that delight of dotage the actual fingering of gold he inherited the instinct too strongly not to rejoice at the sight of its equivalent in figures there were two reasons for his annoyance first the constantly recurring regret of not being able to invest his savings as he chose with endless opportunities for turning over a high percentage coming under his notice it was galling to be restricted by the terms of his covenant with government from any commercial enterprise not that he would have scrupled to evade the regulation had the game been worth the candle but as yet it was not by and by when his capital warranted a plunge he had every intention of risking his position and if need be of throwing it up but for this justification he must wait years unless indeed fate sent him a rich wife heiresses however are scarce in india and furlough was not yet due so john raby had to content himself with four per cent which was all the more annoying when he remembered that shunker das was making forty out of the very indigo business on which he had tried to evade the incometax sooner or later john raby intended to have his finger in that pie unless some more fortunate person plucked the plum out first the other reason for his annoyance arose from the fact clearly demonstrated by his neat system of accounts that over nine thousand rupees of his balance were the proceeds of ecarte played with a man who had had the confidence to make him his executor the young civilian had no qualms of conscience here either it had been a fair fight the colonel considering himself quite as good at the game as his antagonist but somehow the total looked bad beside that other one where intricate columns of figures added themselves into a row of nothings for the widow and orphans not a penny so far as the executor could see after paying current debts about madame and the blackandtans as he irreverently styled her family he did not much concern himself but for belle it was different he liked the girl and had often told himself that the addition of money would have made her an excellent wife just the sort one could safely have at home and that to a busy man meant much the thought that philip marsden with his large fortune showed a disposition to annex the prize lessened his regrets for her poverty and yet increased them why he asked himself savagely did nice girls never have money the only gleam of satisfaction in short to be yielded by the balance was the remembrance that his possession of the nine thousand rupees prevented lala shunker das from absorbing it as a matter of fact his executorship had proved a wholesome check on the usurers outcries and it gave the young man some consolation to think that no one could have managed the lala so well as he did the smile raised by this remembrance lingered still when major marsden walked unannounced through the window in unceremonious indian fashion hullo said john raby glad to see you miss stuart is much better today there was no reason why this very pleasant and natural remark should annoy his hearer but it did it reminded him that john raby had acquired a sort of authority over the dead mans daughter by virtue of his executorship neither of them had seen her since the day of the funeral for she had been hovering on the verge of nervous fever but the responsibility of caring for her had fallen on john raby and not on philip marsden john raby and not he had had to make all the necessary arrangements for her comfort and speedy departure to the hills as soon as possible for mrs stuart had collapsed under the shock of her husbands death and the rapid indian funeral had made the presence of the others impossible so philip marsden felt himself to be out in the cold and resented it the nurse told me so when i inquired just now he replied shortly im to see her this afternoon when she comes back from her drive ive sent for shunker dass carriage major marsden frowned you might have chosen some one elses surely he ruined her father not at all he lent him money some one had to do it well its a grim world and her drive cant be more so than the last she had the remembrance evidently absorbed him for he sat silent youre looking used up marsden said the other kindly anything the matter yes well if it has to do with the commissariat business i dont wonder the colonels private affairs are simply chaos he pointed to the piles of papers on and below the table with a contemptuous smile major marsden shook his head the public ones are in fairly good order im surprised at the method but of course he had good clerks and then the system of checks make it possible to be inaccurate with the utmost accuracy whats wrong philip marsden moved uneasily in his chair and gave an impatient sigh i suppose ive got to tell you because youre the mans executor but i dont want to never do anything you dont want my dear fellow its a mistake you dont know what will please other people and you generally have a rough guess at your own desires i dont suppose this will please you the fact is there is a deficit of four thousand five hundred rupees in the private safe of which colonel stuart kept the key is that all all surely it is enough quite enough but im not exactly surprised then i am returned the major emphatically in fact i dont believe there really is any deficit at all do you think shunker das is the sort of man to make a false claim not unless he has fallen upon fair proofs said the other coolly what claim does he make he says he paid in three thousand five hundred the very day of colonel stuarts death and produces a receipt another thousand was paid in by some one else the day before it seems odd that this should just make up the deficiency but you have no proof that these are actually the notes missing curiously enough i have contrary to what one would have expected colonel stuart made a practice of writing the numbers of notes received in a private ledger and none of the four entered as having been given by shunker are to be found now as you were stuarts friend and are his executor do you know of any large payment made to any one within two days of his death it limits itself you see to that time nothing to account for three thousand five hundred returned john raby a little hastily lets stick to shunkers claim first it may be false you say he holds a receipt yes and gives the numbers of the notes also right all but one the book gives a where he gives a but natives often confuse figures john raby nodded and leant back in his chair thinking i believe the notes were paid he said at last and if they are not to be found the inference im afraid is clear the colonel borrowed them i dont believe it returned the major slowly he had been drawing diagrams idly on a piece of paper and now threw aside the pen with decision i dont believe it he repeated and ill tell you why id rather not tell you as i said before but as youre his executor i must when i found him dead that morning there was a paperit wasnt a mistake you understandhis hearer nodded againand in it he had set down the reasons or want of reasons clearly enough i havent got the paper i burnt it i suppose i ought to have kept it but it seemed a pity at the time anyhow the total he hadborrowedwas close on ten thousand ten you said there was only just so you see as luck would have it i had money with me at the time so i replaced it ten thousand no to be strictly accurate nine thousand seven hundred and fifty wellyou neednt stare so raby why the devil shouldnt i if i chose john raby gave a low whistle you must be awfully fond of belle he said after a pause philip flushed a deep angry red ever since the possible necessity for giving his action to the world had dawned upon him he had known what comment would be made but the knowledge did not lessen its sting dont you think we had better keep miss stuarts name out of the conversation i merely tell you this to show that i have good reasons for supposing that there is some chicanery or confusion i beg your pardon exactly so assented john raby with a smile i am as anxious as you can be to keep her out of it and so as executor ill undertake to refund the deficiency at once there may be some mistake but it is best to have no inquiry i hardly see how that is to be prevented for of course i had to report the matter john raby literally bounded from his chair in unrestrained vexation reported it my dear marsden what the deviloh i beg your pardon but really to begin with you cut your own throat what else could i do asked the other quietly you forget i am in charge of the office do returned his hearer pausing in his rapid pacing of the room ah i dont suppose you could do anything else but im not so highflown myself and i cant see the good of chucking ten thousand rupees into the gutter for the sake of a sentiment and then chucking the sentiment after it for the girl adored her father and i warn you if we cant keep off that subject ill go interrupted philip rising i thought you might know something colonel stuart dined with you that last evening if you remember the civilian needed no reminder indeed for the last ten minutes he had been distractingly conscious of a note for a thousand rupees lying in his despatchbox which might throwsome light on the mysterious disappearances yes he replied he did andi see what you are thinking of marsdenhe played ecarte too but to tell the truth he was so fuddled and excited that i refused to go on and sent him home see what comes of benevolence if i had let him play and rooked him he wouldnt have had the opportunity of brooding over difficulties and putting an end to them again you see theres nothing so unsafe as unselfishness philip remembering the notice of transfer he had found open by the dead mans side wondered if matters might not have turned out differently had it been viewed by the calm light of day well it cant be helped now continued the speaker i dont approve of what has been done but ill do my bestin fact im bound as executorto clear the matter up though im sure i dont know where the inquiry may not lead me its an infernal nuisance nothing less well hand me over the papers andi suppose youve no objection to my searching the office none the colonels room is as he left it i was afraid of noise so near the house the speaker frowned at his own words annoyed to find how thought for belle crept into all his actions so far good and look here marsden if you value that girls opinion go and tell her the downright truth she will be able to see you this afternoon a piece of sound advice meant kindly which had the not unusual effect of making the recipient hesitate about a course of action on which he had almost decided in after years when he considered the tangled clew fate held at this time for his unwinding he never hesitated to say here i went wrong but at the time it seemed of small importance whether he saw the girl that day or the next and once more the assumption of authority on john rabys part irritated him into contradiction it will be a pity to disturb miss stuarts first day he replied stiffly and rode away the young civilian shrugged his shoulders philip marsden wasnt a bad fellow on the whole but a prig of the first water imagine any one gifted with a grain of common sense acting as he had done why if he wanted the girls good graces had he not paid up the rest of the money and finished the whole affair it was a long price to pay of course but it was better than giving ten thousand for nothing only a morbid selfesteem could have prevented him really the sense of duty to be found in some people was almost enough to engender a belief in original sin the mere struggle for existence could never have produced such a congeries of useless sentiment he threw himself into a chair determining to have a quiet cigar before tasking his brain with further thought about what he had just heard but the first glance at the daily paper which had just come in made him throw it from him in disgust for it contained a fulsomely flattering notice extolling major marsden at the expense of colonel stuart and openly hinting at discrepancies in the accounts which the former officer was determined to bring home to the latter the style betrayed the hand of some clerk toadying for promotion but style or no style the matter was clear and to be read by the million it all came from marsdens infernal sense of duty and john raby had half a mind to spoil his little game by sending the paper over to belle as usual but with all his faults he was not a spiteful man or one inclined to play the part of doginthemanger consequently when lala shunker dass carriage went over for belle the chuprassi in charge only carried a bouquet the newspaper remained behind keeping company with john raby and magnanimity belle never noticed the omission for she was still strangely forgetful and indifferent even when she drove along the familiar road she hardly remembered anything of her last dismal ride only one or two things showed distinctly in the midst of past pain such trivial things as a crooked cross of flowers and screaming parrots in a stormy sky the rest had gone to come backthe doctor told john rabyere long just now the forgetfulness was best though it showed how narrowly she had escaped brainfever so nobody spoke of the past and while philip was cherishing the remembrance of that first day and using it to build up his belief in her trust she was not even conscious that he had been the kindest among many kind meanwhile philip marsden had not found himself in a bed of roses the impossibility of seeing belle left him a prey to uncertainty and if he was ready fifty times a day to admit that he was in love there were quite as many times when he doubted the fact yet love or no love he was strenuously eager to save her from trouble so his relief at finding the office in good order had been great in regard to matters which had been in colonel stuarts own hands he naturally felt safe the discovery of the deficiency therefore had been a most unpleasant shock the more so because he saw at once that inquiry might make it necessary for him to betray his own action he wearied himself fruitlessly with endeavours to discover any error but the thought of hushing the matter up never occurred to him as possible to some men it might have been a temptation to him it was none so he deserved no credit on that score he told himself again that if belle were what he deemed her she would see the necessity of a report also but then he was reckoning on perfection and poor belle as it so happened was in such a state of nervous tension that she was utterly incapable of judging calmly about anything relating to her father she lay on the sofa after she returned from her drive feeling all the dreariness of coming back to everyday life and in consequence exalting the standard of her loss till the tears rolled quietly down her cheeks whereupon poor healys mary ann full of the best intentions brewed her a cup of tea and sent over the road for the newspaper which she imagined had been forgotten the master of the house was out for his evening ride and thus it came to pass that when he called on his way home he found belle studying the misleading paragraph with flushed cheeks and tearful eyes what does it mean she asked tempestuously what is it that he dares to say of father with her pretty troubled face looking into his john raby washed his hands of further magnanimity he refused to play the part of providence to a man who could not look after his own interests and whom in a vague way he felt to be a rival so considering belle only he told the modified truth making as light as he could of the deficiency and openly expressing his regret that it should ever have been reported the more so because major marsden himself believed there was some mistake this consolation increased her indignation do you mean to say she cried trembling with anger and weakness that he has dragged fathers name in the dirt for a mistake why didnt he come to me or to you we would have told him it was impossible but he always misjudged father he hated him he never would come here ah yes i see it all now i understand the we sounded sweetly in the young mans ears but its injustice was too appalling to be passed over he felt compelled to defence for a moment he thought of telling the whole truth but he reflected that philip had a tongue as well as he and that no one had a right to make free with another mans confidence consequently his palliation only referred to the culprits wellknown inflexibility and almost morbid sense of duty all of which made belle more and more angry as if the very insistence on such virtues involved some depreciation of their quality in the dead man i do not care what happens now she said vehemently i know well enough that nothing he can say will harm fathers good name but i will never forgive him never it is no use excusing him all you say only makes it more unnecessary and cruel andand stupid i will never forgive him no never and all that night she lay awake working herself into a fever mental and bodily by piling up the many evidences in favour of her theory as to philips longcherished enmity he had never called never spoken to them when all the world beside had been friendly his very kindness to dick was tainted for had he not sided with the boy against her father once the train of thought started it was easy to turn the points so that there seemed no possibility of its following any other line than the one she laid down for it as she went along finally to clinch the matter memory served her a sorry trick by suddenly recalling to her recollection philip marsdens gloomy face when she had told him who she was on their first meeting at the railwaystation she sat up in bed with little hot hands stretched into the darkness o father father i was the only one who loved youthe only one a climax at once of sorrow and consolation which somehow soothed her to sleep now while she was employed in blackening his character philip marsden was crediting her with all the cardinal virtues he had not seen the daily paper for reasons which put many other things out of his head for the time being he had no idea when he wilfully went to play racquets that evening instead of following rabys advice of seeing belle that he was throwing away his last chance of an interview but as he sat outside the court cooling himself after the game an urgent summons came from the orderlyroom ten minutes after he was reading a telegram bidding the st sikhs start to the front immediately farewell to leisure for though the regiment had been under warning for service and in a great measure prepared for it the next fortyeight hours were ones of exceeding bustle philip harassed on all sides had barely time to realise what it meant and despite a catch at his heart when he thought of belle the blood ran faster in his veins from the prospect of action his own certainty moreover was so great that it seemed almost incredible that one of whose sympathy he felt assured should see the matter with other eyes nevertheless he was determined to tell her all at the first opportunity and often as he went untiringly through the wearisome details of inspection his mind was busy over the interview to come but the end was always the same and left him with a smile on his face john raby happened to be standing in the verandah when between pillar and post philip found that vacant five minutes which he had been chasing all day long cant see you im afraid he returned cheerfully to the inquiry for miss stuart the fact is she has worried herself into a fever over that paragraph i dont wonder it was infernal what paragraph asked philip innocently john raby looked at him and laughed not a very pleasant kind of laugh upon my soul he said you are an unlucky beggar i begin to think its a true case for youve enough real bad luck to make a threevolumecourse of true love run rough so you havent seen it then ill fetch it out the paper is just inside philip reining in his restive horse viciously read the offending lines punctuating them with admonitory digs of his heels and tugs at the bridle as the charger fretted at the fluttering paper he looked well on horseback and the civilian lazily leaning against a pillar admired him dangling sword jingling spurs and all he folded the paper methodically against his knee and handed it back and miss stuart believed all that he asked quietly women always believe what they see printed she is in an awful rage of course but i warned you marsden you know i did you were most kind will you tell miss stuart when you see her that i called to say goodbye and that i was sorryyes you can say i was sorry for the cause of her fever his tone was bitterness itself look here marsden said the other dont huff take my advice this time and write to her do you think the belief of women extends to what they see written i didnt know you had such a high opinion of the sex raby well goodbye to you and thanks oh i shall be down to see the st march out five am isnt it philip nodded as he rode off all through that last night in cantonments he was angry with everything and everybody himself included why had he meddled what demon had possessed the brigadier to put him in charge of the commissariat office why had not this order for the front come before why had it come now what induced the babu who penned that paragraph to be born and why did a mission school teach him the misuse of adjectives he was still too angry to ask himself why he had not taken john rabys advice that touched too closely on the real mistake to be acknowledged yet awhile the gloom on his face was not out of keeping with the scene as the regiment marched down the mall at early dawn while the band played zakhmi that plaintive lament of the afghan maiden for her wounded lover yet there was no pitiful crowd of weeping women and children such as often mars the spectacle of a british regiment going on service the farewells had all been said at home and if the women wept in the deserted lines the men marched eyes front without a waver behind the sacred flag borne aloft by the tall drummajor whose magnificent stature was enhanced by an enormous hightwined turban close at his heels went two men waving white silvermounted whisks over the holy grunth watchful lest aught might settle on the sacred page which lay open on a yellow satin cushion borne by four sergeants there plainly discernible even by the halflight was inscribed in broad red and black lettering the sure guide through death to life for its faithful followers then separated by a wide blank from the book in front and the men behind rode the colonel finally shoulder to shoulder marched as fine a body of men as could be seen east or west with dexterously knotted turbans neutralising the least difference in height so that the companies came by as if carved out of one block it was a stirring sight making the blood thrill especially when at the turn of the road leading to barracks the bands of the british regiments formed in front to play their fellow soldiers out of the station and the sikhs broke into their old war cry jai jail guruji ke jai victory victory our teachers victory it mingled oddly with thestrains of the girl i left behind me a little group of horsemen waited for the last farewells at the cantonment boundary and one of them riding alongside told philip marsden that a clue had been found and the truth would be made manifest the conventional answer of pleasure came reluctantly but as the hands of the two men met the gloomy troubled face looked almost wistfully into the clever contented one you are very good to her raby i know that goodbye the workmanlike groans and shrieks of the fife and drum replaced the retiring bands and as cheer after cheer greeted the final departure philip marsden felt that john raby was left completely master of the situation that evening twenty miles out among the sandhills he put his pride in his pocket impelled thereto by a persistent gnawing at his heart and followed the advice of writing to belle an honest if somewhat hard letter telling her not of his good deeds but the truth of those which seemed to her bad ten days after at peshawar with the last civilised post he was to see for many weeks his letter came back to him unopened and readdressed in a shaky hand the heartache was better by that time she might have afforded me the courtesy of an envelope he said as he threw the letter into the campfire chapter ix the clue spoken of by john raby lay in the note for a thousand rupees with which colonel stuart had paid a portion of his card debts during his last deal in the great game it proved to be not only one of the missing notes but as luck would have it the very one about the number of which uncertainty existed the figures stood as the colonel had written them so the mistake lay with the usurer if it was really a mistake john raby lit a cigarette and meditated with the list before him but beyond an odd persistency in threes and fives the figures presented no peculiarity so he set the problem aside till he could tackle it on the spot where it had arisen for he was a great believer in scenery as an aid to the senses the day was almost done however ere he found leisure for the task nevertheless fatigued as he was he set to work methodically and was rewarded by the immediate discovery that uncertainty existed as to the number of another note the one which had been paid in by some one else the entry had been blotted by the hasty closing of the ledger and though it read like it was quite conceivable that it might be something else again those threes and fives idly enough he wrote the two uncertainties on a sheet of paper and sat staring at them till suddenly a suggestion came to him making him rewrite the number given by shunker in close imitation of the dead mans bold black figures and then deliberately blot it by placing it in the ledger the result bore so close a resemblance to the blurred entry that his quick brain darted off in a wonder how the usurer had got hold of the number of a note which he had not paid in no reasonable explanation suggesting itself he began a systematic search in the waste paper basket the scraps there would at least tell him on what work the colonel had been engaged during his last day he knew that shunker had had an interview with him in the morning but that did not account for the shreds of a receipt for three thousand five hundred maunds of grain which he found almost on the top an old receipt dated some months back three thousand five hundred tooan odd coincidence so far good the next thing was to have a sight of shunkers face before he had time to hear rumours or make plans the summons to come up for an interview early next morning rather pleased the lala for he received it while at the receipt of custom when it added to his importance in the eyes of the wedding guests who sat watching a nautch girl sidle like a pouter pigeon over a strip of dirty carpet she was stout to obesity her oiled hair was plastered so as to narrow her forehead to a triangle her voluminous skirts ended just under the arms in a superfluity of bust she held one fat hand to her cheek persistently as if in the agonies of toothache while she yelled away as if the dentist had failed to comfort her yet the best native society of faizapore had sat there for an hour and a half with the impassive faces of the asiatic bent on amusement a face which surely will make paradise dull work for the houris yea i will come to raby if he needs me assented the rich man turning with a spiteful chuckle to his right hand where old mahomed lateef sat solemn and dignified see you khan sahib how even the sirkar favours money when i was young oh shunker retorted the other grimly the hands of nikalsane and jan larnce held the sword too tight to leave room for the rupees ay when you khans of kurtpore brought fifty swords to flash behind theirs without payment swords are bought nowadays and those who lack money must een go to the wall the old mahomedans eyes flared mashallah oh buniahji if they go to the wall in my poor house they will find swords enow but yesterday a hut felli mean twas pulled down for repairsand we came on five persian blades ready to use o lalaji no spot or blemish of rust haply they may help back the rupees some day shunker moved uneasily in his chair and the guests sank again into silence broken only by the occasional tributary hiccup which native etiquette demands for the memory of dinner the stars shone overhead and a great trail of smoke from the brazier of oil and cottonseed seemed to mix itself up with the milky way little nuttu the hero of the feast had fallen asleep in his chair his baby bride being engaged in cutting her teeth elsewhere a group of younger men squatted in the far corner round a flaring paraffin lamp talked vociferously in a mixed jargon of individual freedom political rights and representative government and no one laughed or cried at anything neither at the nautch girl with her unmentionable songs nor the spectacle of people discussing freedom while engaged in taking it away from two harmless infants so the night wore on in dull dissipation leaving shunker at a disadvantage when he came to confront the young civilians clearcut cleanshaven face in the morning you have made a mistake lalaji he began opening fire at once a serious mistake about the notes you claim to have left with colonel stuart so much at least was certain john raby however saw more in the unrestrained start of alarm which the surprise evoked it isnt so very serious he continued blandly nothing for you to be so frightened about lalaji we all make mistakes at times by the way did you keep your original memorandum of the numbers in english or mahajani accountants character in mahajani huzoor bleated shunker and john raby smiled for this diminished the possibility of clerical error enormously indeed it was to settle this point that he had sent for the usurer so much the better for you he went on carelessly and if you will bring the paper to me this evening say about six ill see if we can get the error in your claim altered you have interchanged a five and a three in one number and it is as well to be accurate before the inquiry commences it will be a very stringent one by the by what time did you last see colonel stuart but the usurer was prepared this time and when he finally bowed himself out john raby was as much in the dark as ever in regard to the details of a plot which he felt sure had been laid all day long in a sort of undercurrent of thought he was busy ransacking memory and invention for a theory coming back again and again disheartened to the halftipsy laugh with which colonel stuart had given him the note declaring it was a windfall a windfall what could that mean had shunker given it back then there must have been a second interview but none of the servants could speak to one he went over early to the office and sat in the dead mans chair trying to piece things together the shadows were beginning to cling to the corners ere the usurer was announced and something in the scared glance he gave towards the tall figure in the seat of office convinced john raby that the man was reminded of another and similar visit to that room the quaver in hand and voice with which he produced his daybook and said that the huzoors number was right after all clinched the matter i suppose remarked the young man coolly you were confused by the other note a random shot but it struck home huzoor faltered the fat man john raby looked him full in the face and went one better poker was a game of which he was passionately fond the other note with the threes and the fives which you sawwhich you got wheni mean the second time you came herewhen you brought the receipt for the grain which he destroyedby jove he threw his hand up and a light came into his face fool not to see it beforethe receiptthe wrong receipt of course but he never gave me the money i swear he didnt protested shunker completely off his guard his hearer broke into a fit of cynical laughter thank you shunker thank you of course he gave you the money i see it all and as one of the numbers were different you improved on your original memorandum thinking you had made a mistake staynumber wasnt your note by jove he must have given you back the whole roll of four thousand five hundred by mistake youre a bigger blackguard than i thought no no cried the usurer beside himself with fear of this shaitan only three i swear it i only picked up three thank you again lala you picked up three let me see how was it the young man rose pacing the room quickly and talking rapidly stuart must have taken four from the safe the windfall by george the windfall the colonel must have thought shunker had only taken two well youre a nice sort of scoundrel he went on stopping opposite the usurer and viewing him with critical eyes so you gave him the wrong receipt on purpose and now claim a second payment is that it shunker collapsed to the floor as if every bone had left his body i didntill swear by holy ganges by my sons headi didnt mean it i thought he would kill me and i gave him the wrong receipt in my hurry oh sir i swear let go my legs you fool or i shall stand up and dont let your teeth chatter im not going to kill you so you werent even a good scoundrel shunker only a pitiful fortunefinder having done a clever trick by mistake you thought it safe to claim the money again as the only witness was dead and it was safe but for that chance of the other note it was hard luck lalaji hard luck there was something almost uncanny in john rabys jeering smile as he threw himself into a chair and began to light one of his eternal cigarettes the fact being that he was elated beyond measure at his own success and unwilling to detract as it were from his own skill by any hint of carelessness on the other side and now shunker he asked his chief attention being apparently given to his tobacco what do you intend to do coolly as he spoke he was conscious of inward anxiety for he had rapidly reviewed the position and confessed himself impotent should the usurer regain the courage of denial since any attempt to prove the facts must bring to light his own possession of the unlucky note his best chance therefore was to work on the lalas terror without delay i throw myself on your honours mercy quavered the usurer in a dull despairing tone knowing by experience that it was but a broken reed on which to rely you dont deserve any still there are reasons which incline me to be lenient your son is young to be deprived of a fathers care besides as the colonel sahibs executor i do not wish to have a committee of inquiry in the office you understand sahib i understand this eminently sensible view of the matter was as welcome as it was unexpected therefore i shall be content if you withdraw your claim in some credible way of course equally of course you will sign a confession which i will burn when but sahib how not another word i particularly do not wish to know what you are going to do but i havent lived seven years in india without being aware how things can be burked if the sahib would only tell me i tell you to burke it why man if i only had your conscience all things would be possible id make money even out of this ill help you so far you have somehow or another to restore certain notes the numbers of which are known i happen to have traced one of these already and you happen to have got hold of a wrong one i will exchange if you havent got it about youah i see you have that is a great saving of trouble a quarter of an hour later john raby wrote a few lines to major marsdens successor enclosing a thousandrupee note which he had found in an unexpected place in colonel stuarts office adding his belief that the others would doubtless turn up ere long and suggesting a few days grace in order that a thorough search might be made never lie if you can help it he said to himself sardonically that dear old prig marsden would be shocked at my squaring this business though at one stage of the proceedings he tried to do so himself what the devil would be the good of an inquiry to any living soul and as ive lost a thousand in avoiding one no one could accuse me of interested motives marsden and i row in the same boat and if i had had as much money as he has well she is a dear little girl and thats a fact he called on the dear little girl after leaving the office and comforted her greatly by general expressions of hope they made her almost more grateful to him than any certainty would have done for they showed a more perfect trust in her fathers integrity so even the young mans caution told in his favour and he went home very well satisfied with himself to await the final explanation that was to emanate from the lalas fertile brain the notes would be found somewhere no doubt or else in looking over his accounts he would discover a like sum owing to government which would cause the disappearance of the apparent deficiency but amid all his terror the lala had noted john rabys assertion that given a certain conscience he could make money out of the restitution and these idle words stood between him and many a solution of the difficulty his soul if he had one was full of hate a sense of defeat and a desire for revenge if only he could devise some plan by which he could retain the plunder especially that thousandrupee note the whitefaced shaitan had given him in exchange dawn found him still in the upper chamber alone with his faithful jackal there was determination in his face and dogged resistance in ram lals fool whispered the usurer if i fall where art thou and i swear i will let the whole thing go i have moneythou hast none it is only a year without opium or tobacco ramu and the wife and children well cared for meanwhile are you going to back out of the agreement unfaithful to salt a year is ten years without opium lala and there is no need for this i am the scapegoat it is true but only for safety son of owls cursed the usurer still under his breath it is for safety thy safety as well as mine for if thou wilt do as i bid thee it will tie that shaitans hands and if they be not tied they will meddle besides the sahiblogue are never satisfied without a scapegoat and if some one go not to jail they will inquire and then ramu wilt thou fare better twill be longer in the cells that is all opium can be smuggled ramu see i promise five rupees a month to the warder and a big caste dinner when thou returnest from the fatherinlaws house a native euphemism for the jail and listen ramu so the whispered colloquy went on and on through the hot night and during the course of the next day john raby was asked to sign a searchwarrant for the house of one ramu lal who was suspected by his master shunker das of having stolen the missing notes from colonel stuarts officetable for a moment the young man taken aback by this unexpected turn of affairs hesitated but reflection showed him that for all he could prove to the contrary the crime might have been committed at least there would be time enough for interference at a later stage of the proceedings so ramu and his house were searched a note for five hundred rupees was found on his person and two previous convictions against him promptly produced by the police the discovery of but one and that the smallest note gave john raby the key to shunkers plan for if it could be proved that the money had been stolen after it had been duly handed over to the commissariat officer the lalas claim would remain intact thus he would be the gainer by exactly three thousand rupees some of this would of course go towards indemnifying the scapegoat but ramu was notoriously the contractors jackal and bound to take such risks what was to be done it was maddening to be outwitted in this manner but after all no one was really the worse for it ramu had evidently been squared shunker was bound to escape in any case and government had gained all round practically speaking he and marsden were the only sufferers the latter in having paid up ten thousand rupees which the authorities must otherwise have lost he in having restored one thousand out of his honest earnings besides he had forced shunker to disgorge another five hundred in fact but for him and his ecarte the fraud could not have been discovered surely that was enough for any man to do especially as one disclosure must lead to another and in that case government would have to pay marsden back his money all of which devious but straightforward arguments ended in john raby taking care that the case should be tried in another court which it was and successfully ram lal confronted by a mass of evidence ingeniously compounded after native fashion from truth and falsehoodfrom the denials of honest people who could not possibly have seen anything and the assertions of those who were paid to have seen everythingpleaded guilty to having watched his master give the money to colonel stuart who being in a hurry had placed it in an envelopebox on the writingtable whence ramu returning after dark had taken it in a moment of forgetfulness the usual native excuse here the lala interrupted the court to say in a voice broken by emotion that ramu was a faithful servant a very faithful servant indeed so the jackal got eighteen months for the theft and shunker drove down next morning to the jail on a visit of inspection and took the opportunity of presenting one of the warders with five rupees the net result of the whole affair from a monetary that is to say from john rabys point of view being that shunker gained three thousand rupees the government six thousand and odd while philip marsden lost over nine and he himself forfeited one he did not count other gains and losses not even when a day or two after the trial he stood with belles hand in his saying goodbye to her ere she departed to the hills the gharri waited with its pile of luggage outside in the sunlight poor healys mary ann who was to accompany her to rajpore was arranging the pillows and fussing over the position of the icebox which was to ensure comfort i cant thank you said the girl tearfully her pretty eyes on his i wish i could but i cant perhaps you maysome day he replied vaguely wishing it were possible after all i did nothing it was clear from the first that there was a mistake some people did not see the clearness she returned bitterly so your kindnessandand confidencewere all the more welcome i shall never forget it once more the young civilian was driven by sheer keenness of perception to the position of an outsider who seeing the game sees the odds also if i were you id forget all about it he said more earnestly than was his wont it has been a bad dream from beginning to end when we all come back from the wars with a paucity of limbs and a plethora of medals we can begin afresh you look surprised the fact is ive just accepted a political berth with one of the forces and am off at once i am glad faizapore will be dull when you are gone what a nice young gentleman a be miss said poor healys mary ann when he had seen them safely stowed away and with a plunge and a wild tootle of the coachmans horn they were dashing out of the gate so cheerful like he must a suffered a deal imself for to keep up is sperrits so in trouble its wonderful what one gets used to he has been very good to meand to father replied belle softly chapter x a cold wind swept down the peirak valley driving the last leaves from the birch trees which filling the gully crept some short way up the steep ascent to the pass where the ridges of greyblue slate seemed almost a part of the staring blue sky against which they showed like a serrated line of shadow nearer at hand the slopes of withered bent were broken by sharp fanglike rocks gathering themselves in the distance into immature peaks and passes here and there a patch of dirty snow having borne the burden and heat of summer lay awaiting a fresh robe of white at the hands of the fastcoming winter already the round black tents of the pastureseeking tribes were in full retreat to the plains and the valley lay still and silent without even the sweep of a hawk in its solitary circle or the birdlike whistle of a marmot sunning itself on the rocks ere long the snow would wrap all in its soft white mantle and the bunting paired with its own shadow flicker over the glistening drifts notwithstanding the lateness of the season the peirak was not utterly deserted in a sheltered bit behind a cluster of rocks sat two young men one despite the sheepskin coat and turbanwound peaked cap of the afghan showed unmistakable signs of alien blood in the steady gaze of a pair of brown eyes and a white line of clean skin where the fur collar met his neck it was our old friend dick smith and he was on the watch for the last british regiment which was to cross the pass in order to strengthen the little garrison beyond before winter set her silver key upon the mountains his companion carried his nationality in his face for even when afzul khan had condescended to wear the uniform of a sikh soldier no one could have mistaken the evidence of his long straight nose and cruel crafty expression in which however lurked little hint of sensuality you are deeply interested in this particular regiment remarked dick in fair pushtu whats up afzul nothing huzoor a fool who called himself my relative took service once with your sirkar mayhap in this regimentgod knows it does not matter if it was the studied indifference made his hearer smile you are a queer lot you pathans he said lazily not much family affection not much welcome for a longlost brother eh afzul the presence should remember there are pathans and pathans he has not seen my people they are not here he spread a wellshaped nervous hand emphatically east west and south tarred with the same brush north i expect muttered the englishman to himself afzul khan frowned these are my enemies he went on but for the sirkarchk he gave a curious sound half click half gurgle and drew an illustrative finger across his throat it was rather a ghastly performance then why stop afzul khan plucked at the withered bents carelessly becausebecause it suits this slave because the merciful presence is my master because i may as well wait here as anywhere else what are you waiting for he showed all his long white teeth in a grin promotion huzoor it should come speedily since but yesterday the sahib said i was worth all the rest of the gang i must be more careful where the dickens did you pick up english afzul from you huzoor a statement so irredeemably fictitious that it made dick thoughtful youre sharp enough heaven knows but i dont understand why you wanted to learn signalling are you going to give up your jezail and become a babu afzul khan fingered the matchlock which lay beside him i have changed my mind he said shortly i will leave it to the presence to bring down fire from heaven i bring it from this flashinthepan now what can you know about prometheus he shook his head the presence speaks riddles the fire comes to some folk to many of the sahibsto you perhaps god knows the pathans are different our work is fighting dick looking at his companions sinewy strength thought it not unlikely while we are waiting afzul he said idly tell me the finest fight you ever were in dont be modest out with it wherefore not victory is fate and only women hang their heads over success the best fight you say twas over yonder to the north there is a dip but one way up and down twenty of us barakzais and they were fifteen but they were ahead of us in count for by allah their wives were so ugly that we didnt care to carry them off why should you twas a feud once god knows when a budakshan nurzai carried off one of ours and began it if the women ran out we killed the men instead so it was a moonlight night and the fifteen were fast asleep snoring like hogs by allah my heart beat as we crept behind the rocks on our bellies knowing that a rolling stone might waken them but god was good and chk they bled to death like the pigs they were before their eyes were wide open dick smith stared incredulously you call that the best fight you ever were in i call it the epithet remained unspoken as he started to his feet with a shout by george i see the glitter yonder afzul by the turn hurrah hurrah he was off at long swinging strides careless of the fact that the pathan never moved the latters keen eyes followed the lad with a certain regret and then turned to the straggling file of soldiers now plainly visible marsden sahib with the advance guard he muttered why did i give in to those cursed hawks eyes when my bullet was all but in his heart wahillah his bravery made me a coward and now my life is his but i will return it and then we shall cry quits yonders the subadar by god my knife will be in his big belly ere long and some of those gibing punjabis shall jest no more so he watched them keenly with a fierce joy while dick tore down the hill to be brought by an ominous rattle among the rifles below to a remembrance of his dress then he waited hands down in the open until the advance guard came within hail of his friendly voice when he received the whole regiment with open arms as if the peirak were his special property perhaps he had some right to consider it so seeing that he was the only englishman who had ever attempted to make those barren heights his headquarters but as he explained to philip marsden while they climbed the narrow gully hemmed in by perpendicular rocks which led to the summit the breaks in communication from storms and other causes had been so constant that he had cut himself adrift from headquarters at jumwar in order to be on the spot and so avoid the constant worry of small expeditions with an escort without which he was not allowed to traverse the unsettled country on either side here i am safe enough he said with a laugh and if i could only get my assistant a bengali babu to live at the other hut i have built on the northern descent we could defy all difficulties but he is in such a blind funk that if i go out he retires to bed and locks the door the only time he is happy is when a regiment is on the road then his happiness is doomed for this yearunless you use discretion and come on with us to jumwar i doubt your being safe here much longer dick shrugged his shoulders perhaps not and of course i shall have to cut and run before the snow but i like the life and it gives me time ive been at work on a fieldinstrument here his eyes lit up and his tongue ran away with him over insulators and circuits major marsden looked at the lad approvingly thinking how different he was from the slouching sullen boy of six months back im afraid i dont understand dick he said with a halfsmile but ive no doubt it will be very useful if as you say it enables you to tap the wires anywhere with speed and certainty dick gave a fine blush i beg your pardon but these things get into my head it will work though im sure of it id show you if it was here but i left it at the other shanty theres a stretch of low level line across the pass where i was testing it the halfaggrieved eagerness in his voice made philip smile they were sitting together under the lee of a rock on the summit while a halt was called in order to give time for the long caravanlike file encumbered by baggage ponies to reach the top and so ensure an unbroken line during the descent for in these mountain marches the least breach of continuity is almost certain to bring down on the detached portion an attack from the robbers who are always on the watch for such an opportunity you had best come with us dick said philip returning to the point after a pause no the fact is i want to be certain of the communication until you are safe in jumwar those two marches between your next camp and the city are risky i have my doubts of the people doubts shared by headquarters apparently for the chief got a telegram yesterday to await orders at jusraoli i expect they are going to send to meet us from jumwar i wish id known in time replied dick lightly in that case there is not much reason for staying yet i dont know id rather stick on till i am forced to quit that wont be long the snows due already and you are coming on with us so far in any case arent you dick sat idly chucking stones and watching them leap from point to point of the cliffs below him i dont think i shall if you are to be in camp jusraoli for some days you see my babu is no use and something might turn up ill see you across the pass and come back i could join you later on if i made up my mind to cut he lay back with his arms under his head and looked up into the brilliant blue cloudless sky major he said suddenly after a pause do you know that you have never asked after belle havent i the fact is i had news of her lately raby wrote to me a few days ago i wouldnt trust raby if i were you did he tell you that belle hadnt a penny and was trying to be independent of charity by teaching i am very sorry to hear it dick sat up with quite a scared look on his honest face i thought there must be something wrong between you two by her letters he said in a low voice but i didnt think it was so bad as that what is it really my dear boy i dont feel called upon to answer that question its beastly impertinent of course allowed dick but see here major you are the best friend i have and shewhy i love her more dearly every day so you see there must be a mistake the logic was doubtful but the faith touched philips heart and so you love her more than ever he asked evasively why not i seem somehow nearer to her now not so hopelessly beneath her in every way and i can help her a little by sending money to aunt lucilla she wouldnt take a penny of course but they tell me that when my grandfatheri mean my mothers fatherdies i might come in for a few rupees so i have made my will leaving anything in your charge for belle you dont mind do you philip marsden felt distinctly annoyed here was fate once again meddling with his freedom im afraid i do to begin with i may be lying with a bullet through me before the weeks out so may i look on it as my last request major id sooner trust you than any one in the wide world you would be certain to do what i would like should i im not so sure of myself look here dick i didnt mean to tell you but perhaps it is best to have it out and be fair and square the fact is we are rivals he laughed cynically at his hearers blank look of surprise yesdont be downcast my dear fellow youve a better chance than i have any day for she dislikes me excessively and upon my word i believe im glad of it lets talk of something more agreeable ah there goes the bugle he started to his feet leaving dick a prey to very mixed emotions looking out with shining eyes over the dim blue plains which rolled up into the eastern sky it must be a mistake he felt his hero was too perfect for anything else and she something seemed to rise in his throat and choke him so nothing further was said between them till on the northern skirts of the hills they stood saying goodbye then dick with some solemnity put a blue official envelope into his friends hand its the will major i think its all right i got the babu to witness it and of course thethe otherdoesnt make any difference you see i shall write and tell her it is all a mistake the older man as he returned the boyish clasp felt indescribably mean dont be in a hurry dick he said slowly you can think it over and give it me when you join us for join us you must i wont take it till then at all events as for the other as you call it the mistake would be to have it changed whatever happens she will never get anything better than what you give her dicknevernever goodbye take care of yourself as he watched the young fellow go swinging along the path with his head up he told himself that others beside belle would be the losers if anything happened to dick smith who for all the world had cared might at that moment have been lying deaddrunk in a disreputable bazaar there is something he thought sadly that most men lose with the freshness of extreme youth it has gone from me hopelessly and i am so much the worse for it and dick meanwhile was telling himself with a pang at his heart that no girl belle least of all could fail in the end to see the faultlessness of his hero chapter xi the sun had set ere dick reached the narrowest part of the defile where even at midday the shadows lay dark and now with the clouds which had been creeping up from the eastward all the afternoon obscuring the moon it looked grim and threatening he was standing at an open turn surprised at the warmth of the wind that came hurrying down the gully when the low whistling cry of the marmot rang through the valley and died away among the rocks a second afterwards the whizz of a bullet followed by the distant crack of a rifle made him drop in his tracks and seek the shelter of a neighbouring boulder once again the marmots cry arose this time comparatively close at hand to answer it was the result of a seconds thought and the silence which ensued convinced dick that he had done the right thing but what was the next step whistling was easy work but how if he met some of these musical sentries face to face perhaps it would be wiser to go back he had almost made up his mind to this course when the thought that these robbers for so he deemed them might out of pure mischief have tampered with his beloved wires came to turn the balance in favour of going on a disused path leading by a detour to the southern side branched off about a mile further up if he could reach that safely he might manage to get home without much delay only a mile he would risk it creeping from his shelter cautiously he resumed his way adopting the easy lounging gait of the hillpeople rather a difficult task with the inward knowledge that some one may be taking deliberate aim at you from behind a rock more than once as he went steadily onwards the cry of a bird or beast rose out of the twilight prompting his instant reply if they would only crow like a cock he thought with the idle triviality which so often accompanies grave anxiety i could do that firstclass yet he was fain to pause and wipe the sweat from his face when he found himself safely in the disused track and knew by the silence that he was beyond the line of sentries a rough road lay before him but he traversed it rapidly being anxious to get the worst of it over before the lingering light deserted the peaks as he stood on the summit he was startled at the lurid look of the vast masses of cloud which rolling up to his very feet obscured all view beyond they were in for a big storm he thought as he hurried down the slopes at a breakneck pace with all his haste barely reaching the shanty in time for a low growl of thunder greeted his arrival and as he pulled the latch a faint gleam of light showed him the empty room he called loudly darkness and silence again as he struck a match light but still silence quick as thought dick was at the signaller and the electric bell rang out incongruously tinkatinkatink was echoed from the eastward but westward he waited breathlessly while not a sound returned to him communication was broken the wires had possibly been cut and dick stood up with a curiously personal sense of injury his wires tampered with out of sheer mischief yet stay might it not be something more where the devil had the babu hidden himself after fruitless search an idea struck him and he signalled eastward once more repeat your last message giving time at which sent with ears attuned to tragedy dick awaited the reply pm to north side will send cocoanut oil and curry stuff by next mail the echo of dicks laughter as he realised that but an hour or so before the babu had been putting the telegraph to commissariat uses was the last human sound the shanty was to hear for many a long day for the next moments thought roused a sudden fear the babu had doubtless gone over the pass with the troops for the sake of company that was natural enough but if he was still in the north shanty awaiting dicks return why had he not answered the signal sent westward it could not be due to any break in the wire unless the damage had been done after dark for he had been able to telegraph eastward not so long ago was there more afoot than mere mischief it was not a night for a dog to be out in and as dick stood at the door he could see nothing but masses of cloud hurrying past softly silently then suddenly a shudder of light zigzagged hither and thither revealing only more cloud pierced by a few pinnacles of rock not a night for a dog certainly but for a man with a mans work before him belle would bid him go he knew a minute later he had closed the door behind him and faced the pass again ere he reached the end of the short ascent it was snowing gently then with a furious blast hailing in slanted torrents that glittered like dewdrops in the almost ceaseless shiver of the silent lightning everything was so silent save for the wind which caught and twisted in the gullies moaned as if in pain ah was that the end of all things round him in him through him came a blaze of white flame making him stagger against the wall of rock and throw up his hands as if to ward off the impalpable mist which held such a deadly weapon halfblinded he went on his mind full of one thought if that sort of thing came again say when he was passing the snowbridge could a man stand it without a start which must mean instant death the question left no room for anything save a vague wonder till it was settled in the affirmative then the nickname of lightningwallahs given by the natives to the telegraphclerks struck him as being happy and afzuls reference to fire from heaven passed through his mind more like fire from hell surely with that horrible sulphurous smell and now and again a ghastly undertoned crackle like the laughter of fiends there again wider this time and followed by a rattle as of musketry but the snow which was now sweeping along in white swirls seemed to shroud even the lightning horrible to have so much light and to be able to see nothing but cloud and the stones at your feet how long would he see them how long would it be before the snow obliterated the path leaving him lost he stumbled along tingling to his very fingertips despite the cold which grew with every explosion the very hair on his fur coat stood out electrified and his brain swam with a wild excitement on and on recklessly yet steadily his footsteps deadened by the drifting snow until he stood at the threshold of shelter and threw open the door of the shanty great heaven what was this the babu green with fear working the signaller while afzul khan surrounded by six or seven armed pathans stood over him with drawn knife go on you fool he was saying your work is nearly finished the full meaning of the scene flashed through dick smiths excited brain quicker than any lightning treachery was at work with a coward for its agent his revolver was out in a second and before the astonished group had time to grasp the unexpected interruption the babus nerveless fingers slipped from the handles as with a gasping sob rising above the report he sank in a heap on the floor by god and his prophet cried afzul carried away as men of his kind are by the display of daredevil boldness which is their unattained ideal of bravery yea by the twelve imaums but it was well done liar traitor unfaithful to salt cried dick whose extraordinary appearance and absolutely reckless behaviour inspired his hearers with such awe that for the moment they stood transfixed the revolver was levelled again this time at afzul when the memory of other things beside revenge sobered the lad and a flash of that inspiration which in time of danger marks the leader of men from his fellows made him throw aside the weapon and fold his arms no he said coolly i am faithful i have eaten the salt of the barakzais they are my friends dont hurt the lad cried afzul not a moment too soon for cold steel was at dicks throat god smite you to eternal damnation haiyat put up that knife i say the lads words are true he has eaten of our salt and we of his he hath lived among us and done no harm to man or maid by allah the lightning has got into his brain bind him fast and mark you twill be worse than death for him to lie here helpless knowing that the wires he made such a fuss about have lured his friends to death i know his sort deaththis will be seventy hells for him and we can kill him after if needs be dick as he felt the cords bite into his wrists and ankles ground his teeth at the mans jeering cruelty kill me outright you devils he cried struggling madly it was the wisest way to ensure life for the sight of his impotent despair amused his captors give him a nip of his own brandy haiyat or he will be slipping through our fingers said one as he lay back exhausted not i the bottles near empty as it is tales of his boyhood about drunken guards and miraculous escapes recurred to dicks memory and though he felt to the full the absurdity of mixing them up with the present deadly reality the slenderest chance gave at least room for hope there is plenty more in the cupboard he gasped the key is in my pocket true is it o kareem that the feringhi infidel cannot die in peace without his sharab remarked haiyat virtuously but he did not fail with the others to taste all the contents of the cupboard even to a bottle of painkiller which had belonged to the babu meanwhile dick lying helpless and bound felt a fierce surge of hope and despair as he remembered that behind those open doors lay something which could put an end to treachery five minutes with his fieldinstrument in the open and let what would come afterwards he would have done his work the thought gave dick an idea which if anything increased the hopelessness of his position for the only result of his offer to work the wires on condition of his life being saved was to drive afzul who saw his dread of dicks getting his hands on the instrument in danger of being overruled into settling the question once and for all by severing the connection with a hatchet i know him better than that he said he would sit and fool us until he had given warning let him lie there if he has sense he will sleep there was something so significant in his tone that dick felt wisdom lay in pretending to follow the advice he strained his ears for every whispered word of the gang as they crouched round the fire and gathered enough to convince him that the sudden change of plan at headquarters had endangered some deeplaid scheme of revenge and that afzul khan believing dick had gone on to the camp had suggested a false telegram in order to lure the regiment into the open a frantic rage and hate for the man who had suggested such a devilish prostitution of what constituted dicks joy and pride roused every fibre of the lads being lecoq that greatest of examples to prisoners declares that given time pluck and a cold chisel the man who remains a captive is a fool but how about the cold chisel dicks eyes craftily searching about under cover of the failing firelight saw many things which might be useful but all out of reach i am cold he said boldly bring me a rug or move me out of the draught they did both in quick recognition of his spirit and with a laugh and an oath to the effect that the dead man would be a warm bedfellow dragged him beside the wretched babu and threw a sheepskin rug over both dicks faint hope of some carpenters tools in the far corner fled utterly but his heart leaped up again as he remembered that his cowardly subordinate had always gone about armed with revolvers and bowieknives rifling a dead mans pockets with your hands tied behind your back is slow work but the rug covered a multitude of movements half an hour afterwards dicks feet were free and with the knife held fast between his heels he was breaking his back in obstinate determination of some time and somehow severing the rope upon his wrists some time and somehowit seemed hours yet when he managed at last with bleeding hands to draw the watch from his pocket he found it was barely two oclock hitherto his one thought had been freedom now he turned his mind towards escape there was still plenty of time for him to reach the camp ere dawn found the regiment on the move but the risks he might have to run on the way decided him first of all to try and secure his fieldinstrument from the cupboard he lay still for a long time wondering what to do next furtively watching afzul khan as he busied himself over the fire while the others dozed preparatory to the work before them having possessed himself also of the dead babus revolver dick felt mightily inclined to risk all by a steady shot at afzul and immediate flight but the remembrance of those sentries on the downward road prevented him from relying altogether on his speed of foot yet dick knew his man too well to build anything on the chance of either wine or weariness causing afzul to relax his watch it had come to be a standup fight between these two a state of affairs which never fails to develop all the resources of brain and body dick keenly alive to every trivial detail noticed first a longer interval in the replenishing of the fire and then the fact that but a few small logs of wood remained in the pile thereafter whenever afzuls right hand withdrew fresh fuel dicks left under cover of the noise made free with more the sheepskin rug had shelter for other things than a dead body and a living one it burns like a fat hindoo muttered the pathan sulkily as the last faggot went to feed the flame lucky there is more in the outhouse or those fools would freeze to death in their sleep dicks heart beat like a sledgehammer his chance the only chance had come almost before the tall figure of the pathan after stooping over him to make sure that he slept had ceased to block the doorway dick was at the cupboard a minutes surely not more than a minutes delay and he was outside safe and free with the means of warning carefully tucked inside his fur coat too late right up the only possible path came afzul carrying a great armful of sticks to rush on him unprepared tumble him backwards into a snowdrift alongside deal him a crashing blow or two for quietness sake and cram his pugree into his mouth was the work of a minute the next he was speeding down the descent with flying feet the storm was over and the moon riding high in the heavens shone on a white world but already the darkness of the peaks against the eastern sky told that the dawn was not far off the first dip of the wires he decided was too close for safety besides the drifts always lay thickest there the next a mile and a half down the valley was best in every way and as he ran the keen joy of victory not only against odds but against one man came to him with the thought of afzul khan gagged and helpless in the snow but he had reckoned without the cold the chill night air which finding its way through the open door soon roused the sleepers by the illreplenished fire haiyat waking first gave the alarm and the discovery of their leader half suffocated in the snowdrift followed swiftly yet it was not until the latter slowly recovering speech gasped out a warning that the full meaning of their prisoners escape was brought home to them after him shoot him down cried afzul staggering to his feet he can bring fire from heaven if he touches the wires all is lost fool that i was not to kill him the tigers cub the hero of old curse him true son of byramghor born of the lightning so with wild threats mingled with wilder words of wonder and admiration afzul khan still dazed by the blows dick had dealt him stumbled along in rear of the pursuit the latters heart knew its first throb of fear when the signal he sent down the severed wire brought no reply after all was the outcome of long months of labour the visible embodiment of what was best in him about to fail in time of need again and again he signalled urgently imperiously while his whole world seemed to wait in breathless silence failure no no incredible impossible not failure after all suddenly loud and clear came an answering trill bringing with it a joy such as few lives know a shout from above a bullet whistling past him scarcely fair that when his hands were busy and his mind too working methodically despite those yelling fiends tearing down the slope major from dicktreachery something like a redhot iron shot through his leg as he knelt on the cliff a clear mark against the sky lucky he thought it was not through his arm for gods sake he doubled up in sudden agony but went on stand fast there was still a glint of life left in him when afzul khan coming up behind the butchers claimed the deathblow their eyes met firefromheaven gasped dick and rolled over dead the pathan put up his knife gloomily it is true he said with an oath i knew he was that sort he has beaten us fairly an hour afterwards heralded by winged clouds flushed with the ceaseless race of day the steady sun climbed the eastern sky and looked down brightly on the dead body of the lad who had given back his spark of divine fire to the unknown perhaps if bureaucracy had not seen fit to limit genius within statutory bounds dick smith might have left good gifts behind him for his generation instead of taking them back with him to the storehouse of nature and the sun shone brightly also on belle stuarts bed but not even her dreams told her that her best chance of happiness lay dead in the snow she would not have believed it even if she had been told chapter xii it was a walled garden full of blossoming peachtrees and chequered with little rills of running water beside which grew fragrant clumps of goldeneyed narcissus in the centre was a slendershafted twelvearched gardenhouse with overhanging eaves and elaborate fretwork like wooden lace between the pillars on the sides of the stone dais on which the building stood trailed creepers bright with flowers and in front of the open archway serving as a door lay the harmonious puzzle of a persian carpet rich in deep reds and yellows easychairs with a foxterrier curled up on one of them and a low gipsy table ominously ringed with marks of tumblers showed the presence of incongruous civilisation from within bursts of merriment and the clatter of plates and dishes without which civilisation cannot eat in comfort bore witness that dinner was going on then while the birds were beginning to say goodnight to each other the guests came trooping out in high spirits ready for coffee and cigars all with one exception were in the khaki uniform which repeated washing renders and always will render skewbald despite the efforts of martial experts towards a permanent dye most of the party were young and deeply engrossed by the prospect of some skyraces which coming off next day were to bring their winter sojourn at jumwar to a brilliant close one a lanky boy with pretensions to both money and brains was drawing down on himself merciless chaff by a boastful allusion to former stables he had owned dont believe a syllable he says cried his dearest friend i give you my word they were all screws stable indeed call it your toolchest samuel my boy lieutenant samuel johnson whose real name of algernon bestowed on him by his godfathers and godmothers in his baptism had been voted far too magnificent for everyday use blinked his white eyelashes in evident enjoyment of his own wit as he retorted well if they were screws i turned em myself you buy yours ready made well done samivel well done youre improving chorused the others with a laugh you might lend me that old jestbook sam now that youve got a new one replied his opponent calmly im running short of reparteesand of cigars too bad cess to the post by jove i wish i had the driving of those runners id hurry them up man does not live by cigars alone im dead broke for boots interrupted another looking disconsolately at the soles and uppers which not all the shameless patching of an amateur artist could keep together i have the best of you there remarked some one else i got these at tom turtons sale they wouldnt fit any one else yes poor tom had small feet there was a pause among the lighthearted youngsters as if the grim shadow which surrounded that blossoming garden had crept a bit nearer this is delightful said john raby the only civilian present as he lay back in his easychair which was placed beyond the noisy circle his remark was addressed to philip marsden who leaned against one of the octagonal turrets which like miniature bastions flanked the platform i shall be quite sorry to leave the place continued raby its a perfect paradise in truth it was very beautiful the pink and white glory of the peach blossoms blent softly into the snowclad peaks now flushed by the setting sun while a level beam of light streaming in through a breach in the wall lit up the undergrowth of the garden making the narcissus shine like stars against the dark green shadows doubtless remarked philip for a political who comes with the swallows and summer you should have seen it in januaryshouldnt he boys bah the usual last toosday of punch the hardships of campaigning indeed perdrix aux choux and cold gooseberry tart for dinner an idyllic messhouse in a peachgarden coffee and iced pegs to follow well sir cried a youngster cheerfully if you had favoured us in winter we would have given you stewed tom in addition it was an excellent cat we all enjoyed it except samuel you see it was his favourite miaow so he is going to give the stuffed skin to an aged aunt from whom he expects money in order to show that he belongs to the antivivisection league a certain faint regard for the verities is essential to a jest began samuel affecting the style of his illustrious namesake i wish some one would remove the messdictionary interrupted the other the child will hurt himself with those long words some day bad for you if they did grinned a third dye know he actually asked me last mailday if there were two fs in affection whoo hoop closely pursued by the avenger he leapt the low balustrade and the garden resounded to much boyish laughter as one by one the youngsters joined the chase remarkably high spirits yawned john raby but a trifle reminiscent of a young gentlemans academy they jar on the dolce far niente of the surroundings we were glad enough of the spirits a few months ago replied philip significantly the dolce far niente of semistarvation requires some stimulant that was very nearly a fiasco sending you over the pass so late lucky for you the politicals put the drag on the military in time lucky you mean that poor dick smith managed to send that telegram ive often wondered how he did it the story would be worth hearing he was one in a thousand you always had a leaning towards that redheaded boy now i thought him most offensive he de mortuis quoted the major with a frown those are the ethics of eternity combined with a sneaking belief in ghosts but i mean nothing personal he was simply a disconcerting sport as the biologists say from the neutraltinted eurasian and i distrust a man who doesnt look his parentage he is generally a fraud or a monstrosity that theory of yours is rather hard on development isnt it said philip with a smile only a stand in favour of decency and order what right has a man to be above his generation it is extremely inconvenient to the rest of us if he is successful he disturbs our actions if he uses us as a brick wall whereon to dash out his brains he disturbs our feelings to return to dick smith the whole affair was foolhardy and ridiculous if i had been political then i should certainly have refused to allow that campingout on the pass and so he would probably have been enjoying all that money instead of dying miserably just when life became worth having what money asked philip marsden hastily didnt you hear it was in the papers last weekhavent seen them yet perhaps some distant relation of his fathers died in england leaving everything to smith senior or his direct male heirs failing them or their assigns to charity so as no one had made a willpaupers dont generallysome dozens of wretched children will be clothed in kneebreeches or pokebonnets till time is no more in the pause which ensued philip marsden felt as most of us do at times that he would have given all he possessed to put times dial back a space and to be standing once more on the northern slope of the peirak with dicks hand in his theres the will major it doesnt make any difference you know the words came back to him clearly and with them the mingled feeling of proud irritation and resentful selfrespect which had made him set the blue envelope aside and advise a more worldly caution temper nothing but temper it seemed to him now there was a will he said at last in a low voice dick spoke to me of one when we came over the pass together you see there was a chance of his getting a few rupees from old desouza john raby threw away the end of his cigarette with an exclamation by george thats funny to make a will in hopes of something from a man who died insolvent and come in for thirty thousand pounds you knew nothing about but where is the will it was not among his papers for strangely enough the people had not looted much when the pass opened and we went over to search perhaps he sent it somewhere for safe custody it would make a difference to belle stuart i expect for hewell he was another victim i thinkin fact i am almost surethe words came reluctantly as if the speaker was loth to face the truththat he had the will with him when he died he showed it meandraby was every search made for the body his hearer shrugged his shoulders as much as could be done in a place like that for myself i should have been surprised at success think of the drifts the vultures and hyenas the floods in spring of course it may turn up still ere summer is over but i doubt it what a fool the boy was to carry the will about with him why didnt he give it to some one else who was less heroic he could easily have done that for i tell you raby he was worth a dozen of us who remain said philip bitterly as he stood looking over the peachblossom to the lingering snows where dick had died well goodnight i think i shall turn in after all there is no fool like an old fool the civilian followed his retreating figure with a goodnatured smile he really was fond of that youngster he said to himself the mere thought of it all has made him throw away half of the best cigar on this side the peirak by jove i wont give him another it is too extravagant the next morning philip marsden came over to the political quarters and with a remark that last nights conversation had borne in on him the necessity for leaving ones affairs in strict business order asked john raby to look over the rough draft of a will leave it with me was the reply given with the usual easy goodnature it appears to me too legal the common fault of amateurs ill make it unimpeachable as caesars wife get one of my babus to engross it and bring it over ready for you to fill up the names and sign this afternoon no thanks required that sort of thing amuses me he kept his promise finding philip writing in the summerhouse if you will crown one kindness by another and can wait a moment i will ask you to witness it said the latter i shall not be a moment filling it in the advantage of not cutting up good money into too many pieces replied his friend smiling the disadvantage perhaps of being somewhat alone in the world there will you sign two witnesses please but i saw carruthers in his quarters as i came by he will do john raby waiting to perform a kindly act somewhat to the prejudice of his own leisure for he was very busy amused himself during major marsdens temporary absence by watching a pair of doves with pinkgrey plumage among the pinkgrey blossom everything was still and silent in the garden though outside the row of silvery poplar trees swayed and rustled in the fitful gusts of the wind suddenly a kite soaring above swooped slightly the startled doves fled scattering the petals and the wind winning a way through the breach in the wall blew them about like snowflakes it caught the paper too that was lying still wet with ink and whirled it off the table to john rabys feet i hope it is not blotted he thought carelessly as he stooped to pick it up and replace it a minute after major marsden coming in alone found him as he had left him at the door with rather a contemptuous smile on his face carruthers is not to be had and i really have not the conscience to ask you to wait any longer said the major john raby was conscious of a curious sense of relief in after years he felt that the chance which prevented him from signing philip marsdens will as a witness came nearer to a special providence than any other event in his career yet he replied carelessly i wish i could my dear fellow but any other person will do as well i have to see the mukdoom at five and i start at seven to prepare your way before you in true political style can i do anything else for you put the will into the political postbag for safety when i send it over laughed philip as they shook hands goodbye you will be a lion at simla while we are still doing duty as sandbags on the scientific frontier diplomacy wins nowadays not a bit of it in twenty years when we have invented a gun that will shoot round a corner the nation which hasnt forgotten the use of the bayonet will whip creation and we shall return to the belief that the man who will face his fellow and lick him is the best animal in the meantime simla for you and service for us not a bit of that either why the british lion has been on the wartrail for a year already its time now for repentance and a transformationscene troops recalled durbar at peshawar the amir harlequin to foreign office columbine skobeloff as clown playing tricks on the british public as pantaloon and the nameless graves principle my dear fellow replied john raby with a shrug of his shoulders is our modern moloch we sacrifice most things to iton principle by the bye i have mislaid that original of the will somehow possibly my boy packed it up by mistake but if i come across it ill return it dont botherburn it tis no good to any one now nor harm eitherso goodbye warrior goodbye diplomatist they parted gaily as men who are neither friends nor foes do part even when danger lies ahead that same evening the homeward bound postrunner carried with him over the peirak major marsdens will leaving thirty thousand pounds to belle stuart unconditionally it was addressed to an eminently respectable london firm of solicitors who not having to deal with the chances of war would doubtless hold it in safe custody until it was wanted the testator as he rode the first march on the cabul road felt a little bitterly that once more he had done his best to stand between her and care yet it must be confessed that this feeling was but as the vein of gold running through the quartz for pride and a resentful determination that no shadow of blame should be his whatever happened were the chief factors in his action nor did he in any way regard it as final the odds on his life were even and if he returned safe from the campaign he meant to leave no stone unturned in the search for dick smiths body then if he failed to find the will it would be time enough to confess he had been in the wrong john raby as he put the bulky letter in the political bag according to promise felt also a little bitter as he realised that belle with thirty thousand pounds would come as near perfection in his eyes as any woman could and then he smiled at the queer chance which had put him in possession of major marsdens intention finally dismissing the subject with the cynical remark that perhaps a woman who was sufficiently fascinating to make two people leave her money ere she was out of her teens might not be a very safe possession chapter xiii in the tiny drawingroom of a tiny house wedged in between a huge retaining wall and the almost perpendicular hillside belle stuart sat idly looking out of the window not that there was anything to see the monsoon fogs swept past the stunted oaks tipped over the railings filled the verandah crept in through the crevices and literally sat down on the hearthstone for the room was too small the thermometer too high and humanity too poor to allow of a fire without was a soft grey vapour deadening the world within was a still more depressing atmosphere of women widows weeds and wrangling on her lap lay the newspaper filled as usual with items from the frontier to many a woman that first sheet meant a daily agony of relief or despair to belle stuart it was nothing more than a history of the stirring times in which she lived for with dicks sad end and john rabys return to reap rewards at simla she told herself that her personal interest in the war must needs be over a passing pity perhaps for some one known by name a kindly joy for some chance acquaintance might stir her pulses but nothing more yet as she sat there she was conscious of having made a mistake something there was in the very paper lying on her lap which had power to give keen pain even to bring the tears to her eyes as she read the paragraph over again listlessly severe fighting in the terwan pass gallant charge of the st sikhs list of officers killed wounded and missingthe telegram which reached simla a few days ago reporting a severe skirmish in the terwan has now been supplemented by details it appears that a small force consisting of some companies of the st sikhs the th goorkhas the th british infantry and a mule battery were sent by the old route over the terwan pass in order to report on its practical use no opposition was expected as the tribes in the vicinity had come in and were believed to be friendly about the middle of the pass which proved to be far more difficult than was anticipated a halt had to be made for the purpose of repairing a bridge which spanned an almost impassable torrent the road which up to this point had followed the right bank of the river now crossed by this bridge to the left in order to avoid some precipitous cliffs here it became evident that the little force had fallen into an ambuscade for firing immediately commenced from the numerous points of vantage on either side the goorkhas charging up the right bank succeeded in dislodging most of the enemy and driving them to a safe distance from the advantage thus gained they then opened fire on the left bank managing to disperse some of the lower pickets owing however to the rocky and almost precipitous nature of the ground the upper ones were completely protected and continued to pour a relentless fire on our troops who were for the most part young soldiers during the trying inaction necessary until the bridge could be repairedwhich was done with praiseworthy rapidity despite the heavy firemajor philip marsden of the st sikhs volunteered to attempt the passage of the torrent with the object of doing for the left bank what the goorkhas had done for the right accordingly the sikhs led by this distinguished officer rushed the river in grand style how it is almost impossible to say save by sheer pluck and determination and after an incredibly short interval succeeded in charging up the hillside and carrying picket after picket a more brilliant affair could scarcely be conceived and it is with the very deepest regret that we have to report the loss of its gallant leader major marsden who was among the first to find foothold on the opposite bank was giving directions to his men when a bullet struck him in the chest staggering back almost to the edge of the river he recovered himself against a boulder and shouting that he was all right bade them go on lost sight of in the ensuing skirmish it is feared that he must have slipped from the place of comparative safety where they left him and fallen into the river for his helmet and swordbelt were found afterwards a few hundred yards down the stream none of the bodies however of those lost in the torrent have been recovered nor was it likely that they would be as the stream here descends in a series of boiling cataracts and swirling pools in addition to their leader whose premature death is greatly to be deplored the sikhs lost two native officers and thirtyone rank and file the goorkhas but here belles interest waned and she let the paper fall on her lap again one trivial thought became almost pitifully insistent i wish oh how i wish i had not sent back that letter unopened as if a foolish girlish discourtesy more or less would have made any difference in the great tragedy and triumph of the mans death for it was a triumph she could read that between the lines of the bald conventional report theres belle crying actually crying over major marsden broke in mauds cross voice from a rockingchair now a rockingchair is an article of furniture which requires a palatial apartment where its obtrusive assertion of individual comfort can be softened by distance in the midst of a small room and especially when surrounded by four women who have not rockingchairs of their own it conduces to nervous irritation on all sides you talk about disrespect mamma went on the same injured voice just because i didnt see why we shouldnt go to the volunteer ball in colours when he was only our stepfather but i call it really nasty of belle to sit and whimper over a man who did his best to take away the only thing except debts that colonel stuart oh do hold your tongue maudie cried mabel im getting sick of that old complaint i dont see myself why we shouldnt wear our pink tulles it would be economical to begin with and goodness knows we have to think of the rupees annas and paisas nowadays here maud who was not really an illtempered girl became overwhelmed by the contemplation of her own wrongs and began to sob i neverworea yearbehindfashion dress before andwhen i suggest itjust to save the expenseim told im heartless as if it was my fault that mammas settlement was so much waste paper and that our money went to pay really maud you are too bad flared up her youngest sister if it was any ones fault it was uncle toms for not being more careful the governor was awfully good to us always ah things were very different then this remark turned on the widows ready tears very different indeed three in the kitchen and i wouldnt like to say how many in the stable and though i dont wish to repine against providence yet caps are so expensive i cant think why for they are only muslin but miss crowe says she cant supply me with one that is really respectful under five rupees it is all very well for you to talk mabel insisted maud from the rockingchair you have a settlement of your own in prospect so might you retorted the other if you were wise instead of wasting your time over men who mean nothing like that handsome captain stanley yes yawned mildred it is the stubby majors with halfadozen motherless children growing up at home who marry mabel flushed through her sallow skin and in her turn became tearful for in truth her fiance was but too accurately described in these unflattering terms it is not your part to jeer at me for sacrificing myself to the interests of you girls in our unfortunate position it is our duty to avail ourselves of the chances left us and not to go hankering after penniless probationers in the postoffice yet one more recruit for pockethandkerchief drill rushed to the front though more in anger than sorrow if you are alluding to willie allsop retorted mildred fiercely i dare say he will be as well off as your major some day at any rate im not going to perjure myself for money like some people oh girls girls whimpered the widow plaintively dont quarrel and wake charlie for the doctor said he was to be kept quiet and not excited really misfortunes come so fast and things are so dearto say nothing of parrishs chemical food for charliethat i dont know where to turn if poor dick had but lived it was too bad of those nasty afghans to kill the dear boy just as he was getting on and being so generous to me i always stood up for dick he had a warm heart and people dont make their own tempers you know belle who had been sitting silent at the window clasping and unclasping her hands nervously felt as if she must stifle i wish she said in a low voice you would let me go on teaching as i did in the winter why should we mind even if there are old friends here now i am not ashamed of working her remark had one good effect it healed minor differences by the counter irritation of a general grievance and the upshot of a combined and vigorous attack was that there had been quite enough disgrace in the family already without belle adding to it of course had she been able to give lessons in music or singing the suggestion might have been considered since the flavour of art subdued the degradation but the idea of teaching the children of the middle class to read and write was hopelessly vulgar it was far more genteel to become a zenanalady since there the flavour of religion disguised the necessity belle trying to possess her soul in patience by stitching away as if her life depended on it found the task beyond her powers i think ill go out she said in a choked voice oh yes i know its raining but the air will do me good the house is so stuffy its the best we can afford now retorted maud and the position is good suggested mrs stuart feebly belle doesnt care a fig for position mamma snapped up her daughter she would have liked one of those barracks by the bazaar where nobody lives we might have got up a scratch dance there remarked mildred in tones of regret oh not now mamma of course but by and by when things got jollier i dont believe they ever will get jollier came in gloomy prophecy from the rockingchair as belle escaped gladly into the mist and rain six weeks she thought was it only six weeks since the maddening paralysing drip drip drip of ceaseless raindrops had been in her ears and yet these experienced in hillweather spoke cheerfully of another six weeks to come would she ever be able to endure being the fifth woman in that ridiculous little room for all those days what irritated her most was the needlessness of half the petty worries which went to make up the dreary discomfort the extravagant clinging to the habits of past opulence the wastefulness resulting in the want of many things which might have made life more pleasant the apathy content to grumble and do nothing while she felt her spirits rise and her cheeks brighten even from her rapid walk through the driving mist the rain had lessened as she paused to lean over the railings which protected a turn of the road where it was hollowed out from the hillside sheer cliff on one side sheer precipice on the other up to her very feet surged the vast grey sea of mist making her feel as if one more step would set her afloat on its shoreless waste yet below that dim mysterious pall lay she well knew one of the fairest scenes on gods earth smiling doubtless in a sunshine in which she had no part then suddenly causelessly the words recurred to herthe world is before you yet it holds life and happiness and love who had said them even now it cost her an effort to remember clearly the events following on the shock of her fathers death the effort was so painful that she avoided it as a rule but this time the memory of philip marsdens kindness came back sharply and the trivial remorse about the letter rose up once more to take the front place in her regrets until driven thence by one vague impotent desire to have the past back again looking down into the impalpable barrier of cloud through which a pale gleam of light drifted hither and thither she could almost fancy herself a disembodied spirit striving after a glimpse of the world whence it had been driven by death so far away did she feel herself from those careless days at faizapore from the kindly friends the miss stuart surely it is miss stuart cried a mans voice behind her she turned to see john raby who throwing the reins of his pony to the groom advanced to greet her his handsome face bright with pleasure his left arm was in a sling for he had been slightly wounded to the girls eyes he had a halo of heroism and happiness round him i am so glad she said so glad as they stood hand in hand a sunbeam struggling through the cloud parted the mist at their feet below them like a jewelled mosaic lay the doon bathed in a flood of light each hamlet and tree each silver torrentstreak and emerald field seemingly within touch so clear and pellucid was the rainwashed air between further away like fireopals with their purple shadows flashed the peaks of the sewaliks and beyond them shade upon shade light upon light the motherofpearl plain losing itself in the golden setting of the sky i am in for luck all round cried john raby in high delight that means a break in the rains and a fortnight of heaven for meif fate is kind but belle heard nothing one of those rare moments when individuality seems merged in a vast sympathy with all things visible and invisible was upon her filling her body and soul with supreme content are you not coming in she asked when after walking slowly along the mall they reached the path which led downward to the little drawingroom and the four women i will come tomorrow he replied looking at her with undisguised admiration in his eyes today it is enough to have seen you after all you were always my great friendyou and your father yes he was very fond of you she assented softly and with her flushed cheeks and the little fluffy curls by her pretty ears all glistening with mist drops showed an april face half smiles half tears chapter xiv two months later found belle raby sitting in the shade of a spreading deodartree placidly knitting silk socks for her husband who stretched on the turf beside her read a french novel pages would not satisfactorily explain how this sequence of events came about because pages would not suffice to get at the bottom of the amazing unnatural ignorance of first principles which enables a nice girl to marry a man towards whom she entertains a rudimentary affection and afterwards with the same contented calm to acquiesce in the disconcerting realities of life belle was not the first girl who chose a husband as she would have chosen a dress that is to say in the belief that it will prove becoming and the hope that it will fit nor was she and this is the oddest or the most tragic part in the business the first or the last girl who after solemnly perjuring herself before god and man to perform duties of which she knows nothing and to have feelings of which she has not even dreamed is on the whole perfectly content with herself and her world in fact belle as she looked affectionately at her lounging spouse felt no shadow of doubt as to the wisdom of her choice so little has the mind or heart to do with the crude facts of marriage so absolutely distinct are the latter from the spiritual or sentimental love with which ethical culture has overlaid the simplicity of nature to the general confusion of all concerned upon my life paul de kock is infinitely amusing remarked john raby throwing the book aside and turning lazily to his young wife worth twice all your zolas and ohnets who will be serious over frivolity our friend here has an inexhaustible laugh im sure i thought him dreadfully stupid replied belle simply i tried to read some last night i wouldnt struggle to acquire the art of reading paul de kock my dear said john raby with a queer smile its not an accomplishment necessary to female salvation the most iniquitous proverb in the language is that one about sauce for the goose and the gander say what you will men and women are as different in their fixings as chalk from cheese now ithough i am domestic enough in all consciencewould never be contented knitting socks as you are by the way those will be too big for me who said they were meant for you retorted belle gaily not i perhaps not with your lips but a good wife invariably knits socks for her husband and you my dear belle were foreordained from the beginning of time to be a good wifethe very best of little wives a man ever had i hope so she replied after a pause john it is all very well here in holiday time to be lazy as i am but by and by i should like to be a little more useful to help you in your work if i could at any rate to understand it to know what the people we govern think and say and do her husband sat up dangling his hands idly between his knees im not sure about the wisdom of it personally i have no objection besides i hold that no one has a right to interfere with another persons harmless fancies yet that sort of thing is invariably misunderstood in india first by the natives they think a womans interest means a desire for power then by the men of ones own class they drag up grey mare the better horse c how i hate proverbs you see women out here divide themselves as a rule betwixt balls and babies so the men get clique i dont defend it but its very natural most of us come out just at the age when a contempt for womans intellect seems to make our beards grow faster and we have no clever mixed society to act as an antidote to our own conceit now a woman with a clear head like yours belle you are much cleverer than i thought you were by the way is sure with unbiassed eyes to see details that dont strike men who are in the gameunpleasant ridiculous details probablyand that is always an offence if you were stupid it wouldnt matter but being as you are why discretion is the better part of valour but if i have brains as you say i have what am i to do with them cried belle knitting very fast there are the ballsand the babies as pendennis said to his wife tout vient a ceux qui savent attendre by the way i wonder where the dickens the postman has gone to today its too bad to keep us waiting like this ill report him tout vient retorted belle recovering from a fine blush why are you always in such a hurry for the letters john i never am no more am i he cried gaily rising to his feet and holding out his hand to help her i never was in a hurry except and here he drew her towards him in easy proprietorshipto marry you i was in a hurry then i confess you were indeed said the girl who but a year before had felt outraged by the first passionately pure kiss of a boy as she submitted cheerfully to that of a man whose love was of the earth earthy why you hardly left me time to get a weddinggarment but it was much wiser for you to spend the rest of your leave here than to begin work and the honeymoon together much nicer and wiser but then you are wisdom itself belle upon my soul i never thought women could be so sensible till i married you as your poor father said the first time we met i have the devils own luck he thought so with the utmost sincerity as he strolled along the turfy stretches beyond the deodars with his arm round his wifes waist the devils own luck and all through no management of his own what finger had he raised to help along the chain of fatality which had linked him for life to the most charming of women who ere long would step into a fortune of thirty thousand pounds on the contrary had he not given the best of advice to philip marsden had he not held his tongue discreetly or indiscreetly finally what right would he have had to come to belle stuart and say by an accident i have reason to suppose that you are somebodys heiress for all he knew the sentimental fool might have made another will and yet when two days later the dilatory postman brought in the english mail john rabys face paled not so much with anxiety as with speculation have you been running up bills already he asked lightly as he threw an unmistakably business envelope over to her side of the table along with some others you wouldnt be responsible at all events she replied with a laugh for it is addressed to miss belle stuart i am not so sure about that he retorted still in the same jesting way it is astonishing how far the responsibility of a husband extends and his rights cried belle who in a halfhearted way professed advanced opinions on this subject my dear girl we must have some compensation he sat reading or pretending to read his own letters with phenomenal patience while his wife glanced through a long crossed communication from her stepsisters he even gave a perfunctory attention to several items of uninteresting family news which she retailed to him he had foreseen the situation so long had imagined it so often that he felt quite at home and confident of his selfcontrol john came belles voice with a curious catch in it what is it dear nothing the matter i hope you look startled he had imagined it so far but he knew the next minute from her face that he had underrated something in her reception of the news she had risen to her feet with a scared frightened look i dont understand she said half to herself it must be a mistake then remembering apparently that she no longer stood alone she crossed swiftly to her husbands side and kneeling beside him thrust the open letter before his eyes what does it mean john she asked hurriedly it is a mistake isnt it his hand passed round her caressingly could feel her heart bounding but his own kept its even rhythm despite the surprise he forced into his face it means he said at lengthand the ring of triumph would not be kept out of his voicethat philip marsden has left you thirty thousand pounds left meimpossible i tell you it is a mistake now that the crisis was over the cat out of the bag john raby knew how great his anxiety had been by the sense of relief which found vent in a meaningless laugh lawyers dont make mistakes he replied it is as clear as daylight philip marsden has left you thirty thousand pounds by jove belle you are quite an heiress she stood up slowly leaning on the table as if to steady herself that does not follow she said for of course i shall refuse to take it her husband stared at her incredulously refuse thirty thousand poundsare you mad he need not have been afraid of underdoing his part of surprise for her attitude took him beyond art into untutored nature it is an insult she continued in a higher key i will write to these people and say i will not have it without consulting me you seem to forget that you are a married woman now am i to have no voice in the matter his tone was instinct with the aggressive quiet of one determined to keep his temper supposing i disapproved of your refusal he went on seeing from her startled look that he had her unprepared surely you would not wish that is another question i said supposing i disapproved of the refusal what then standing there in bewildered surprise the loss of her own individuality made itself felt for the first time and it roused the frightened resentment of a newlycaught colt i do not know she replied bravely enough but you would surely let me do what i thought right right my dear girl do stick to the point of course if there were urgent reasons against your taking this money but there are interrupted belle quickly to begin with he had no right to leave it to me i beg your pardon the law gives a man the right to leave his money to any one he chooses but he had no right to choose me i beg your pardon again it is not uncommon for a man to leave his money to a woman with whom he is in love in love it was belles turn to stare incredulously major marsden in love with me what put that into your head he shrugged his shoulders impatiently my dear child even if you didnt know it beforeand upon my soul you are unsophisticated enough for anythingsurely it is patent now a man doesnt leave thirty thousand to any woman he happens to know for the first time belle flinched visibly and her face paled all the more reason for refusing surely she replied in a low tone after a pause you could not like your wife why not it isnt as if you had cared for him you know the blood which had left her cheeks came back with an indignant rush care for him cant you see that makes it doubly an insult im afraid not it makes it much more sentimental and selfsacrificing and beautiful on his part and i thought women admired that sort of thing i know that leaving money to the girl who has jilted you is a stock incident in their novels i did not jilt philip marsden i refuse to admit the incident into my life i dont want to vex you john but i must do what i think right her husband who had walked to the window and now stood looking out of it paused a moment before replying my dear belle he said at last turning to her kindly i hate on principle to make myself disagreeable to any one least of all to my wife but it is best you should know the truth the law gives that money to me as your husband you see you married without settlements now dont look like a tragedyqueen dear for it never does any good we have to accept facts and i had nothing to do with making the law you mean that i have no power to refuse cried belle with her eyes full of indignant tears im afraid so but there is no reason why i should stand on my rights i should hate to have to do so i assure you and would far rather come to a mutual understanding honestly i scarcely think the objections you have urged sufficient perhaps you have others if so i am quite willing to consider them the curious mixture of resentment regret and remorse which rose up in the girls mind with the mere mention of major marsdens name made her say hurriedly think of the way he treated father if it was only for that the tears came into her voice and stifled it john raby looked at her gravely walked to the window again and paused i fancied that might be one perhaps the chief reason supposing you were mistaken supposing that marsden was proved to have done his best for your father would it make any difference how can it be proved my dear belle i do wish you would stick to the point i asked you if your chief objection would be removed by major marsdens having acted throughout with a regard for your fathers reputation which few men would have shown i should think more kindly of him and his legacy certainly if such a thing were possible it is possible and as i said before it is best in all things to have the naked undisguised truth i would have told you long ago if marsden hadnt given it me in confidence but now i feel that respect for his memory demands the removal of false impressions indeed i never approved of his concealing the real facts they would have been painful to you of course they must be painful nowworse luck to it but if it hadnt been for that idiotic sentimentality of poor marsdens you would have forgotten the trouble by this time belle with a sudden fear the sort of immature knowledge of the end to come which springs up with the first hint of bad tidings put out her hand entreatingly if there is anything to tell please tell it me at once dont look so scared my poor belle come sit down quietly and i will explain it all for it is best you should not remain under a wrong impression especially now whenwhen so much depends on your being reasonable so seated on the sofa beside her husband belle stuart listened to the real story of her fathers death and philip marsdens generosity is that all she asked when the measured voice ceased it was almost the first sign of life she had given yes dear that is all and you must remember that the trouble is past and overthat no one but we two need ever suspect the truth the truth belle looked at him with eyes in which dread was still the master and he was not accountable for his actions not in any way himself at the time he continued with a sudden sharp cry she turned from him to bury her face in the sofa cushions not himself at the time had he ever been himself never never how could a dishonoured drunken gambler dying by his own act have been even for a moment the faultless father of her girlish dreams and was that the only mistake she had made or was the world nothing but a lie was there no truth in it at all not even in her own feelings i am so sorry to have been obliged to give you pain said her husband laying his hand on her shoulder but it is always best to have the truth his words seemed a hideous mockery of her thoughts and she shrank impatiently from his touch you must not be angry with me it is not my fault he urged oh i am not angry with you she cried with a petulant ring in her voice as she raised herself hastily and looked him full in the face onlyif you dont mindi would so much rather be left alone i want to think it all out by myselfquite by myself the hunted look in her eyes escaped his want of sympathy and he gave a sigh of relief at her reasonableness that is a wise little woman he replied bending down to kiss her more than once ill go down the khud after those pheasants and wont be back till tea so you will have the whole day to yourself but remember there is no hurry the only good point about a weekly post is that it gives plenty of time to consider an answer that to him was the great point at issue for her the foundations of the deep had suddenly been let loose and she had forgotten the question of the legacy almost mechanically she gave him back his farewell kiss and sat still as a stone till he had left the room then impelled by an uncontrollable impulse she dashed across to the door and locked it swiftly pausing with her hand still on the key bewildered frightened at her own act what had she done what did it mean why had her one thought been to get away from john to prevent his having part or lot in her sorrow slowly she unlocked the door again with a half impulse to run after him and call him back but instead of this she crept in a dazed sort of way to her own room and lay down on the bed to think of what of everything under the sun it seemed to her confusion yet always when she became conscious of any clear thought it had to do not with her father or philip marsden but with her own future was it possible that she had made other mistakes was it possible that she was not in love with john why else had she that wild desire to get rid of him the very suggestion of such a possibility angered her beyond measure her life as she had proudly claimed was not a novel nothing wrong or undignified nothing extravagant or unseemly should come into it and it was surely all this not to be in love with ones lawful husband it was bad enough even to have had such a suspicion after a bare fortnight of wedded life it was absurd ridiculous impossible so as the day passed on all other considerations were gradually submerged in the overwhelming necessity of proving to herself that she and john were a most devoted couple as teatime approached she put on a certain teagown which her lord and master was pleased to commend and generally prepared to receive the great mogul as husbands should be received not because she had come to any conclusion in regard to that locking of the door but because whatever else was uncertain there could be no doubt how a husband should be treated for as some one has said while a man tolerates the marriagebond for the sake of a particular woman the latter tolerates a particular man for the sake of the bond so belle poured out the tea and admired the pheasants to john rabys great contentment though in his innermost heart he felt a little manly contempt for the feminine want of backbone which rendered such pliability possible only once did she show signs of the unstilled tempest of thought which lay beneath her calm manner it was when later on in the evening during their nightly game of ecarte he complimented her on some coup remarking that her skill seemed inherited then she started as if the cards she was handling had stung her and her face flushed crimson with mingled pain and resentment yet in her homeless life she had necessarily learned betimes the give and take required in most human intercourse the fact was that already though she knew it not her husband was on his trial and she could no longer treat his lightest word or look with the reasonable allowances she would have accorded to a stranger a man is seldom foolish enough to expect perfection in a wife a woman from her babyhood is taught to find it in her husband and brought up to believe that the deadliest sin a good woman can commit is to see a spot in her sun she may be a faithful wife a kindly companion a veritable helpmate but if the partner of her joys and sorrows is not for her the incarnation of all manly virtues or at least the man she would have chosen out of all the world her marriage must be deemed a failure love that mysterious young juggler is not there to change duty into something which we are told is better than duty and so the simple singlehearted performance of a simple perfectly natural contract becomes degradation belle confused yet resentful lay awake long after her husband slept the sleep of the selfish her slow tears wetted her own pillow quietly decorously lest they might disturb the great moguls slumbers yet she could scarcely have told why the tears came at all for a curious numbness was at her heart even the thought of her dead father had already lost its power to give keen pain and she was in a vague way shocked at the ease with which her new knowledge fitted into the old the fact being that now she dared to look it full in the face without reservation the loving compassion the almost divine pity which had been with her ever since the day when poor dick had first opened her eyes to the feet of clay seemed no stranger but a familiar friend then philip marsden dwell as she might on her own ingratitude his kindness seemed too good a gift to weep over and again she stretched out her hands into the darkness as she had done on the night when her anger had risen hot against the man she misjudged but this time it was to call to him with a very passion of repentance friend i will take this gift also in this at least you shall have your way by george belle said john raby next morning when she told him that she had made up her mind to take the legacy without demur you are simply a pearl of women for sense i prophesy we shall be as happy as the day is long always and belle said she hoped so too but when he fell to talking joyously of the coming comforts of sweet reasonableness and thirty thousand pounds in the life that was just beginning for them her thoughts were busy with schemes for spending some at least of the legacy in building a shrine of good deeds to the memory of her friendsurely the best friend a woman ever had she was bound by her nature to idealise some one and the dead man was an easier subject than the living one chapter xv murghub ahmad with nothing on but a waistcloth his high narrow forehead bedewed with the sweat which ran down his hollow cheeks like teardrops was fanning the flame of his own virtue with windy words in the dark outhouse which he designated the editors room four square yards of court beyond constituted the printing office of the jehad a biweekly paper of extreme views on every topic under the sun for the proprietors of the light of islam having a wholesome regard to the expense of libels had dispensed with the young mans eloquence as being too fervid for safety so heaven knows by what pinching and paring by what starvationpoint of selfdenial the boy had saved and scraped enough to buy a wretched rotten handpress and two used up lithographic stones with these implements and a heart and brain full of the fierce fire of his conquering race he set to work with the utmost simplicity to regenerate mankind in general and the government of india in particular by disseminating the smudged results of his labours on the poor old press among his fellowsubjects for the most part it is to be feared free gratis and for nothing poor old press no wonder it creaked and groaned under murghub ahmads thin straining arms for it had grown old in the service of government and on the side of law and order generation after generation of prisoners in the district jail had found a certain grim satisfaction and amusement in producing by its help endless thousands of the forms necessary for the due capture and punishments of criminals yet to come reams and reams of paper had they turned out as writs of arrest warrants for committal chargesheets orders for jail discipline or joyful thought memos of discharge and now order and discipline were unknown quantities in its life perhaps the change was too much for its constitution certain it is that it became daily more and more unsatisfactory in regard to the complicated arabic words with which its present owner loved to besprinkle his text then the damp overworked stones refused to dry even under the boys hot feverish hands and he lost half his precious time in chasing the shifting sunlight round and round the narrow courtyard in order to set the ink something there was infinitely pathetic about it all especially on the days when with the look of a st sebastian in his young face the lad could stay his hard labour for a while and rest himself by folding the flimsy sheets within the orthodox green wrapper where a remarkably crooked crescent was depicted as surrounded by the beams of the rising sun false astronomy but excellent sentiment then there was the addressing for the post most of the packets bore the inscription bearing but one chosen with care and cunningly corrected with a deft pen never failed to carry the requisite stamp above the quaint address to my respectable and respected father khan mahommed lateef khan in the house of the khan of khurtpore sudr bazaar faizapore which is much as though one should address a prince of the blood to tottenham court road then with the precious parcels in his arms and one copy in his bosom he would joyfully lock the door above which press of the jehad newspaper was emblazoned in english and make his way to some cheap cookhouse where in honour of the occasion he would purchase a farthings worth of fried stuff to eat with his dry dough cakes thereafter he would repair to the steps of a mosque or to one of the shady wells which still linger in the heart of cities in india in order to discuss his own views and writings with a group of young men of his own age for in that large town with its strange undercurrents of new thoughts and aims underlying the steady stream of humanity towards the old beliefs murghub ahmad was not without his audience nor even his following he had the sometimes fatal gift greater than mere eloquence of leading the minds of his hearers blindfold by some strange charm of voice and personality and when as often happened discussion took the form of harangue the slowgathering stolid crowd used to wake up into muttered approbation as the familiar watchwords of their faith were presented to them in new and bewildering forms it was the eve of mohurrim the great feast and fast of orthodox and unorthodox mahomedans an occasion which claimed more zeal than usual from the young reformer on the morrow the paper shrines of the dead hussan and hussain which were now being prepared in many a quiet courtyard would be borne through the streets in triumph followed by excited crowds of the faithful and as sometimes happens it was dussarahtide also and the hindus held high festival as well as the mahomedans a simple thing enough to western minds accustomed to the idea of wide thoroughfares and religious toleration a very different affair in the tortuous byeways of a native town and among the ancient antagonisms it was critical at the best of times and this year doubly trebly so for with the newlygranted franchise of municipal government the richer hindus outnumbered the mahomedans in the committee which had power to direct the route open to each procession so the cry of favouritism went forth and as the gaudy paper streamers were being gummed to the frail bamboo frames many a dark face grew darker with determination to carry the sacred symbol where he chose yea even into the midst of the cursed idolworshipping crew despite all the municipal committees and fat bribing usurers in the world the jehad was full of sublime wrath and valiant appeals for justice to high heaven because a certain connecting alley between two of the big bazaars had been closed to the mahomedans and given to the hindus true another and equally convenient connection had been allowed the former but for many years past the procession of tazzias had struggled through that particular alley and the innovation was resented as an insult east and west mankind is made the same way it was astonishing how many imperious demands on the resources of providence this trivial change aroused in murghub ahmad he called for justice mercy and religious freedom for the stars as witness for the days of akbar on the other hand a rival print with an unpronounceable title clamoured for bikramajeet the heroking of old for hindu independence and the sword either faction it may be observed asked for those things in others of which they had least themselves after the way of factions all over the world thus many a quarterstaff was being diligently whittled that evening and down in the butchers quarter even deadlier weapons were being talked of openly by its inhabitants the most truculent of all the mixed races and trades with which rulers have to deal john raby doing his judicial work in the big courthouse outside the town felt with that sharp halfcunning perception of concealed things which he possessed so preeminently that there was mischief brewing and drove round by the executive officials house in order to tell him so the latter assured him that the newlyelected municipal committee were fully alive to the necessity for precautions whereat the young man shrugged his shoulders and said he was glad to hear it he mentioned it casually to belle with a sneer which he did not allow himself in public at the crass stupidity of needlessly setting race against race by premature haste to confer the blessings of vestrydom on india and belle agreed since even with the limited experience of the past year she had learnt a sort of reverence for the old ways which seem so irredeemably bad to the unsympathetic philanthropy of the west for a whole year had passed since the fateful letter announcing the legacy had come to disturb the foundations of her world it had had surprisingly little effect on her chiefly because she was determined that her life must run in one ordered groove there must be no mistake or fiasco nothing but what she considered decent orderly virtuous uninteresting no doubt but it is nevertheless true that a very large number of women are born into the world with an unhesitating preference for behaving nicely women who can no more help being longsuffering cheerful and selfforgetful than they can help being the children of their parents her husbands clear sight had early seen the expediency of concealing from her the radical difference between her view of life and his own he even felt pleased she should think as she did it was so much safer and more ladylike in his way he grew to be very fond of her and there was scarcely any friction between them since moved by a certain gratitude for the change her money had wrought in his prospects he gave her free play in everything that did not interfere with his settled plans half the said money was already invested in shunker dass indigo concern and john raby was only awaiting its assured success to throw up his appointment and go openly into trade but of this belle knew nothing she had money enough and to spare for all her wishes and that was sufficient for her indeed on the whole she was happy in the larger interests of her new life the tragic povertystricken yet contented lives of the poor around her had a strange fascination for the girl and the desire to see and understand all that went to make up the pitiful sumtotal of their pleasures led her often on her solitary morning rides for john was an incurable sluggard through the alleys and bazaars of the great city in the latter the people knowing in a dim way that she was the judge sahibs wife would salaam artificially but in the back streets both women and children smile on her much to her unreasoning content so the morning after her husbands sarcasm over the mistakes of his seniors she determined in the confidence of ignorance to see something of the processions and with this intention found herself about seven oclock in the outskirts of the town here the deserted appearance of the streets beguiled her into pushing on and on until close to the big mosque a blare of conches and the throbbing of ceaseless drums mingled with cries warned her of an advancing procession wishing to watch it unobserved she turned her horse into a side alley and waited as in all countries a rabble of boys sprung heaven knows whence formed the advance guard behind them came an older yet more mischievous crowd of men flourishing quarterstaves and shouting hussan hussain next emerged into the square a swaying topheavy tazzia looking every instant as though it must shake to pieces and behind it more quarterstaves and more tazzias more shouts and more dark faces streaming on and on to overflow into the square until the procession formed a part only of the great crowd so absorbed was she in watching the swooping out of each successive tazzia like some gayplumaged bird from the intricate windings of the way beyond that she failed to notice the current settling towards her until the vanguard of urchins was almost at her horses hoofs then she recognised the disconcerting fact that she had taken refuge in the very path of the procession turning to escape by retreat she saw the further end of the alley blocked by a similar crowd only that here the shouts of dhurm dhurm durga dei gunga the faith the faith the goddess durga ganges told of hindu fanaticism she was in fact in the very alley which both sides claimed as their own bewildered yet not alarmed for her ignorance of religious ecstasy made her presuppose deference she turned her horse once more and rode towards the advancing tazzias at a footspace the look of the crowd as she neared it was startling but the cry of jehad jehad death to the infidel seemed too incredible for fear and ere the latter came with the conviction that not even for a judge sahibs mem would the stream slacken a young man his gaunt face encircled by a high green turban rushed to the front and seized her horse by the bridle no words dismount yourself from steed and follow your preserver we war not with women the effect of these stilted words uttered in tones of intense excitement was somehow ludicrous smile not be nimble i entreat unhorse yourself and follow follow me the vision of a hideous leering face leading the quarterstaves decided her on complying the next instant she felt herself thrust into a dark entry and ere the door closed heard a scream of terrified rage from her horse as some one cut it over the flank with his staff the outrage made her temper leap up fiercely and she felt inclined to confront the offender but before she could reach the door it was shut and hasped in her face then the desire to escape from darkness and seesee something no matter whatpossessed her and she groped round for some means of exit ah a flight of steep steps black as pitch narrow broken she climbed up and up till a grating in the wall shed a glimmer of light on the winding stair up further till she emerged on a balcony overlooking the street whence she could see far into the alley on one side and into the square on the other beneath her feet lay a small empty space edged by the opposing factions hurrying into collision give way give way idolaters hussan hussain futeh mahommed victory of mahomed yelled the tazziabearers jai jai durga devi dejai give way killers of kine shouted the hindus for an instant or two belles horse hemmed in by the advancing crowds kept the peace by clearing a space between them with head and heels then choosing the least alarming procession it charged the hindus breaking their ranks as maddened by terror it plunged and bit only for a moment however for the packed mass of humanity closing in round it held it harmless as in a vice the charger of pertap cried a huge ricehusker with ready wit as he leapt to the saddle and coming rather to grief over the crutches raised a roar of derision from the other side he scowled dangerously come on brothers he cried digging his heels viciously into the trembling snorting beast down with the cursed slayers of kine this is durgajis roaddhurm dhurm hussanhussain then the dull thud of heavy blows seemed to dominate the war of words and business began in earnest as a mahomedan caught behind the ear fell in his tracks it was not much of a fight as yet for in that narrow street the vast majority of the crowd could do nothing but press forward and thus jam activity into still smaller space until the useless sticks were thrown aside and the combatants went at each other tooth and nail but unarmed so they might have fought out the wildbeast instinct of fighting but for the fact that the hindus with commendable foresight had headed their procession by athletes the mahomedans by enthusiast so inch by inch surging and swaying yelling cursing yet doing comparatively little harm the combatants drifted towards the square until the wider outlet allowed a larger number of the mahomedans to come into play and thus reverse the order of affairs once more the tazzias surrounded by their supporters carried the lane and swept back the redsplashed figure of durga amidst yells of religious fury so the battle raged more in words than blows belle indeed had begun to feel her bounding pulses steady with the recognition that beyond a few black eyes and broken heads no harm had been done when a trivial incident changed the complexion of affairs in an instant the foremost tazzia which had borne the brunt of conflict and come up smiling after many a repulse lost balance toppled over and went to pieces most likely from the inherent weakness of its architecture the result was startling a sudden wave of passion swept along the mahomedan line and as a young man sprang to the pilaster of the mosque steps and harangued the crowd every face settled into a deadly desire for revenge kill kill kill the idolatersjehad jehadthe cry of religious warfare rang in an instant from lip to lip and now from behind came a fresh burst of enthusiasm as a body of men naked to the waist pushed their way towards the front with ominous glint of sunlight on steel as they fought fiercely for place room room for the butchers kill kill let them bleed let them bleed the shout overbore the high ringing voice of the preacher but belle watching with held breath saw him wave his hand towards the lane slowly unwillingly at first the crowd gave way then more rapidly until a roar of assent rose up the butchers the butchers kill kill belle gasped and held tight to the railing seeing nothing more but the tide of strife beneath her very feet red knives gleaming no longer straining hands and every now and again a gurgle and a human head disappearing to be trodden under foot heaven knows how weapons come in such scenes as thesefrom the housespassed to the front by willing handssnatched from unwilling foes who fall in a second it was knife against knife murder against murder durga durga devi destroy destroy hussan hussain kill kill then suddenly a rattle of musketry at the far end of the square where cut off from the actual conflict by an impenetrable crowd a strange scene had been going on unobserved two or three mounted englishmen unarmed but sitting cool and square on their horse sat the head of a company of mahomedan and hindu sepoys who stood cheek by jowl calm apparently indifferent their carbines still smoking from the recent discharge about them was a curious stillness broken only by the sound of more disciplined feet coming along at the double a glint of red coats appears behind and then a policeofficer the sunlight gleaming on his silver buckles gallops along the edge of the rapidly clearing space laying about him with the flat of his sword while yellowtrousered constables emerging heaven knows from what safe shelter dive in among the people whacking vigorously with the traditional truncheon of the west a rapid order to the sepoys an instant of marking time as the company forms then quick march through an unresisting crowd as they near the combatants a few brickbats are thrown there is one free fight over the preacher and then the great mass of mankind falls once more into atoms each animated by the instinct of selfpreservation five minutes more and the processions have gone on their appointed ways with the loss of some chosen spirits while the ghastly results are being hurried away by fatigueparties recruited from the bystanders only one round of blank cartridge remarked john raby as the deputy commissioner rode forward ruefully to inspect the damage ten minutes more and it wouldnt have been so easy for the fighting would have reached the square and once a man beginsgreat god whats that he was out of the saddle staring at a horse that was trying to stagger from the gutter to its feet perhaps in all his life he had never felt such genuine passion as then certainly belle herself was never so near to loving her husband as when she saw the awful fear come into his face at the sight of the riderless steed she had been waiting for him to come nearer before calling for assistance and now the thought of her past danger and its meaning almost choked her voice im not hurt oh john im not hurt she cried stretching her hands towards him he looked up to see her on the balcony and his relief as it often does brought a momentary resentment belle what the devili mean why are you here now that it was all over she felt disagreeably inclined to cry but something in his voice roused her pride and urged her to make light of what had happened and so avoid being still more conspicuous ill come down and explain she replied with an effort wait ill be with you in a moment which is the door as he paused to kiss her before helping her down the dark stair belle passed the happiest moment of her married life physically and morally she felt crushed by the scenes she had witnessed and his calm halfcallous strength seemed a refuge indeed not across the square whispered the policeofficer as he was about to take her the shortest route that poor brute must be shot john raby raised his eyebrows a little but took the hint women were kittle cattle to deal with even the best of them like belle who for instance would have thought of any one with a grain of sense getting into such a position underneath all his kindness lay a certain irritation at the whole business which he could not conceal chapter xvi belle recovering from the shock healthily looked for a like forgetfulness in her husband but she was disappointed there is nothing to make such a fuss about john she said when a few days brought no cessation of his regret at her having been mixed up in such a scene it hasnt hurt me you see and as for the notoriety people will soon forget all about it at any rate it shows you that i was right in saying that the philanthropical dodge doesnt do in the wife of an official he replied moodily a thing like that might do a man a lot of harm i cant see how besides there isnt much philanthropy in watching menoh john dont let us talk of it any more it makes me feel ill i want to forget all about it but you cant i dont want to be disagreeable belle but have you ever considered that there must be a trial and that you as an eyewitness must she turned pale and clutched the arm of her chair nervously no i see you haventthats always the way with women they want all the fun of the fair without the responsibility the ringleaders will be tried for their lives of course eight of the poor beggars were killed and two more are dying so they must hang some one you had a boxseat so to speak and are bound to give your evidence but i could only see the tops of their heads i couldnt possibly recognise you must have seen and heard that fool of a preacher my dear child thats the worst of it if you hadnt studied the language it would have been different as i said before it all comes of taking what you call an interest in the people i dont see how you are to get out of being called on for evidence and i tell you honestly id have given pounds to prevent you putting yourself in such a position it may mean more than you think but i couldnt give evidence against that boy said belle in a very low voice i told you john i thought it was he whowho it doesnt matter a straw if he did help you the question is if he excited the crowd of course he did and with your predilection for abstract truth you would say so i suppose even if it waswell unwise whatwhat would the punishment be she asked after a pause he looked at her with unfeigned surprise really belle you surely see that some one must be hanged the question is who but he used such long words he had been quarrelling with a cigarette during the conversation and now threw it away impatiently you are certainly a very ingenuous person belle on the whole perhaps you had better stick to the truth you couldnt manage anything else satisfactorily of course i shall stick to the truth john she replied hotly well i dont want to be disagreeable you know but in your place i shouldnt and thats a fact why she asked in a startled voice for many reasons to begin with the boy comes of decent folk marsden used to swear by the father there were three brothers in the regiment and one of them saved the majors life or something of that sort why belle whats the matter she had risen and was now fain to catch at his outstretched hand to steady herself why she scarcely knew finding the only explanation in an assertion made as much for her own edification as his that her nerves must be out of order nerves he echoed as he placed her with half contemptuous kindness in his chair and brought her a scentbottle ill tell you what it is dear no woman should have both nerves and conscience its too much for one frail human being it is no use my advising you to forget all about this wretched business or to suppress the disagreeable parts and yet in your place i should do both oh john yes i should from a sense of dutyto myself first and then to society what will be gained by hanging that blatant windbag of a boy murghub ahmad who in his cell awaiting trial was meanwhile comforting himself with the belief that the fate of nations depended on his life or death would no doubt have resented this opinion bitterly yet it was all too true the evil lay much further back than the utterance of the halfrealised words which had poured from his lips like oil on the flame he had said things as wild as subversive of the law dozens of times before and nothing had happened no one had taken any notice of it and now the boy buried his face in his hands and tried to think if he was glad or sorry for martyrdom mahomed lateef stern and indignant hurried from far faizapore to see his benjamin and in the sight of the pale halfstarved face forgot his anger and pledged his last remaining credit to engage an english lawyer for his sons defence and then he girt his old sword about him counted over the precious parchments of olden days and the still more precious scraps of modern notepaper which were all that was left to his honour and thus armed set off to see the big lord sahib at simla he came back looking years older to await as they bade him the usual course of law and order so it came to pass that as her husband had foretold belle found herself one day saying in a low voice i heard him call on the people to fight i saw him wave his hand towards the hindus you meanpray be careful mrs raby for it is a point of great importancethat as the butchers were coming up you saw the prisoner wave them on to the conflict i cannot say if that was his intention i saw him wave his hand as they were passing as they were passing should you sayi mean did it give you the impression that he was encouraging them urging them on belle raby before she answered looked across the court at the boy then at her husband who with a slight frown sat twiddling a pen at the government advocates table it did i think it would have given that impression to any one who saw it and with these words every one knew the case was virtually at an end so far as murghub ahmad was concerned roman matrons are not in it thought john raby as he flung the pen from him impatiently and yet she will regret it all her life and wonder if she didnt make a mistake or tell an untruth to the end of her days o lord im glad i wasnt born a woman they wont hang him if thats any consolation to you my dear he said as they drove home though upon my word it isnt your fault if they dont im beginning to be a bit afraid of you belle your conscientiousness would run me out of that commodity in a week but i suppose some people are born that way the fresh wind blew in her face the sun was shining the little squirrels skipping over the road the memory of that drive to her fathers funeral returned to her sharply with a sort of dim consciousness that something else in her life was dying and would have to be buried away decently ere long why didnt you tell me before that he would not be hanged she asked in a dull voice why for many reasons for one i thought you might be more merciful andbut theres an end of it theyll give him fourteen years over in the andamans by george the boy will learn that the tongue is a twoedged sword pity he wasnt taught it before perhaps it was at all events mahomed lateef his father went back to his sonless house with a vague sense of injustice not to be lost this side the grave and a palsied shake of his head only to be stilled by death not to stay there long however for he was ousted even from that dull refuge by the necessity for selling it in order to redeem his pledges so he flitted drearily to his last hold on life a scrap of land between the indus and the sandhills where if the river ran high the flooding water raised a crop and if not the tiller must starveor go elsewhere if only to the six feet of earth all men may claim whereon to sow the seed for a glorious resurrection about a month after the trial john raby came home from office not exactly in a bad temper but in that cynical contemptuouslypatient frame of mind which belle began to see meant mischief to the heroworship she still insisted on yielding to her husband ive brought you something to read he said coolly laying a newspaper on the table and taking up the cup of tea she had poured out for him as that unfortunate trial has led to this premature disclosure i think it only fair to ask you what you would rather i did in the matter honestly i dont much care of course i would rather have had a little more time but as the native papers have got hold of the business im quite ready if you prefer it to throw up my appointment tomorrow however read iton the second page i thinkand skip the adjectives well he asked as after a time she laid down the newspaper and stared at him in a bewildered sort of way the main facts are true if that is what you mean i was lucky enough to hit on that indigo business it will pay cent per cent if properly worked i thought she replied in a toneless voice that it was againstthe rules exactly so but you see i havent the slightest intention of remaining in the service i never had if once i got an opportunity and ive got it but the rules bother the rules i am not going to buy a pig in a poke to please propriety that part of it is done and i think it is always best to let bygones be bygones if you like me to send in my papers today ill do it if not i shall hang on for a time and defy them why should one lose twelve hundred a month for an idea i do my work quite as well as i did and there wont be any necessity for personal supervision down in saudaghur till next spring but as i said before if you have scrupleswhy you brought the money and im deeply grateful i assure you dont look scared my dear ill insure my life if you are thinking of the pension of a civilians widow dont laugh john i cant stand it have any more of the native papers been writingthings like that and she shivered a little as she spoke no thats the first but the others will follow suit they were desperately indignant about the mohurrim riot that is why i wanted belle stood up and stretched her hands out appealingly to her husband dont say it oh please dont say it you dontyou cant mean it he came across to her taking her hands in his thats not consistent belle youre always for having the truth i do mean it what harm would you have done to anybody by toning down what you saw for the matter of that what harm have i done to any one by investing money in indigo none absolutely none however it is no use talking about it we should never agree people seldom do on these points but you ought to know by this time that i never mean to hurt your feelings in any way so which is it to bedignity or impudence and belle as he kissed her felt helpless it was like being smothered in a feather bed all softness and suffocation well im waiting am i not a model husband now dont begin to cry when its all over perhaps it is best as it is for i shall have to build you a house belle think of that a house of your very own and look here you can go in for doing good to your hearts content when you are no longer the wife of an official cheer up theres a good time coming and you have to decide if its to come now or next spring how can you ask she said breaking from him hurriedly to walk up and down the room twisting her fingers nervously we must gogo at once very well its a little hasty but remember its your doing not mine and for goodness sake you poor little consciencestricken soul dont cry at getting your own way chapter xvii john rabys announcement that he was about to leave the service fell like a thunderbolt on his old friend shunker das for that astute gentleman had sketched out a very different programme in which the shaitan sahib was to figure as chief actor indeed when the latter had first come nibbling round the indigo prize shunker had as it were asked him to dine off it chuckling in his sleeve the while at the idea of getting his enemy into the toils but then he knew nothing of the thirty thousand pounds which the young civilian rightly considered a sufficient insurance against any punishment for breaking the rules of his covenant so all the lalas deft hounding of the native papers on the track of disgraceful corruption and disregard of law on the part of mr john raby of the civil service had simply resulted in bringing a personal supervision destructive of accountcooking into the business he went down to saudaghur shortly after the rabys and nearly had a fit over the calm decision with which the young englishman took possession of the field new machines were being imported new vats built new contracts made with growers throughout a large stretch of the district on all sides shunker found himself forestalled outpaced left in the cold he would dearly have liked to break absolutely with this shrewd unmerciful partner yet to indulge this desire meant loss for the lala despite his hatred of the work was not blind to john rabys supreme capability for making the business pay he was torn asunder by rage at having been outwitted and admiration for the wit which had effected the task he came home one day to the square block of a house he owned on the outskirts of saudaghur village cursing freely and longing for some covert means of relieving his spite the recipient of his curses took them with stolid indifference she was a darkbrowed deepchested lump of a woman engaged in cooking the lalas dinner in a dutiful conscientious sort of way while she kept one eye on a solid twoyearold boy who was busy over a pumpkin rind this was kirpo the absent ram lals wife who had been sent to occupy this empty house of the lalas for several reasons chiefly because it was out of the way of scandal and it had pleased shunker to combine pleasure with the business of supporting her during her husbands imprisonment wherefore is one of those problems of human perversity best left alone kirpo herself had merely adopted the surest way of securing comfort and a pair of gold bangles during this unpleasing interlude and in her heart was longing to return to her rightful owner but not without the bangles there was however considerable divergence of opinion between her and the lala on this point resulting on the one side in her refusal to retire discreetly before the off chance of any remission of her husbands sentence which might induce a premature appearance and on the other in shunkers half alarmed desire to let her risk her nose by discovery neither of them being altogether in earnest and each anxiously awaiting symptoms of capitulation in the other i dont care for your words lalaji she retorted in answer to his abuse we women have to eat curses aye and blows too but we get our own way for all that i mean to have the bangles so the sooner you unstomach them the better her black brows met in determination as shunker consigned her and all her female ancestors to unspeakable torments if you say much more ill have the evil eye cast on that sickly nuttu of yours maibishen does it you take seven hairs be silent shedevil shouted the lala turning green what ails you to give the mind freedom on such things lo i have been good to you kirpo and the boy therewould mine were like him kirpo caught the child in her arms covering him with kisses as she held him to her broad brown breast thine pooh thou art a poor body and a poor spirit shunker afraid for all thy big belly afraid of rabysahib look you i will go to him nay i will go to his mem who loves to see the black women and she will make you give me the bangles now shunkers evil disposition partook of the nature of an amoeba that is to say no sooner did a suggestion of food dawn upon it than straightway the undefined mass of spite shot out a new limb in that direction kirpos words had this effect upon him after all why should she not go to see the mem how angry the shaitan would be if he knew that his shunkers mistress had had an interview with the stuckup english girl what business too had she to bring her husband money when her father was bankrupt rare sport indeed to chuckle over when raby put on his airs by the holy water of gunga he cried thou shalt go kirpo as my wife no one will know silks and satins kirpo and sheets held up for thee to scuttle through so that none may see aha and i have to take off my shoes at the door curse him he lay back and chuckled at the bare idea of the petty concealed insult of which no one but himself would know kirpo looked at him in contemptuous dislike if i was a bad woman like thy friends in the bazaar i would not go for they say she is easy to deceive and kind but i am not bad it is you who are bad so i will go but with the bangles and with the boy too in a khimkhab cloth of gold coat twill be as thy son lalaji remember so thou wouldst not have him look a beggar her shrill laughter rang through the empty house making an old woman glance upwards from the lower court kirpo should go home muttered the hag or she will lose her nose like dhundei when they let her husband out of gaol by mistake a grand mistake for poor dhunnu oho oho kirpo devi returned the lala with a grin of concentrated wickedness thou shalt have the bangles and then thou shall go see the mem first and to damnation after mark my words tis a true saying for another suggestion of evil had sprung into vision and he already had a feeler out to seize it two days later he sat on the same bed grinning over his own cleverness yet for all that disconcerted kirpo had fled with her boy and her bangles that he had expected but he was hardly prepared to find a clean sweep of all his brass cookingpots into the bargain he cursed a little but on the whole felt satisfied since his spite against belle raby had been gratified and kirpo got rid of at the price of a pair of deftly lacquered brass bangles he grinned still more wickedly at the thought of the latters face when she found out the trick as he sat smoking his pipe a man looked in at the door a curiously evasive downcast figure in garments so rumpled as to suggest having been tied up in tight bundles for months as indeed they had been duly ticketed and put away in the storerooms of the gaol holy krishna muttered the lala while drops of sweat at the thought of the narrow escape oozed to his forehead tis ramu himself and ramu it was scowling and suspicious wheres my house he asked after the curtest of greetings unfortunately for the truth shunker das had answered this question in anticipation many times so he was quite prepared thy house oh ramu if she be not at home god knoweth whither she hath gone i sent her here for safety seeing that women are uncertain even when illlooking but she hath left this security without my consent his hearers face darkened still more deeply as he looked about him in a dissatisfied way i went straight to faizapore they said she was here he did not add that he had purposely refrained from announcing his remission for good conduct in order to see the state of affairs for himself shunker meanwhile was mentally offering a cheap but showy oblation to his pet deity for having suggested the abstraction of the brass pots to kirpo i say nothing ramu he replied unctuously but this i know that having placed her here virtuously with an old mother who is even now engaged in work below she hath fled nor stayed her hand from taking things that are not hers see i am here without food even driven to eat it from the bazaar by reason of her wickedness but i will call and the old mother will fetch some thou must be hungry hadst thou sent word ramu the faithful servant should have had a feast from the faithful master ramu and he looked at each other steadily for a moment like two dogs uncertain whether to growl or to be friends fret not because of one woman ramu added his master peacefully hadst thou sent word she would have been at home doubtless she is no worse than others she shall be worse by a nose retorted his hearer viciously whereat the lala laughed he sat talking to his old henchman till late on into the night during the course of his conversation following so many trails of that serpent his own evil imaginings that before ramu full of fresh meats and wines had fallen asleep shunker das had almost persuaded himself as well as the husband that kirpos disappearance had something to do with gold bangles and a series of visits to the shaitan sahib in the resthouse where until their own was finished the rabys were living this scandalous suggestion found to ramus mind a certain corroboration next day for on his way to the station in order to return to faizapore he came full tilt on his wife also hurrying to catch the train the gold bangles on her wrists and the fact of her having remained in saudaghur after leaving the lalas house pointed to mischief he flew at her like a mad dog too angry even to listen now the station of saudaghur was a good two miles from the town and the road a lonely one so that the enraged husband had no interruptions and finally marched on to his destination leaving his wife half dead behind a bush a brutal but not uncommon occurrence in a land where animal jealousy is the only cause of womens importance that evening john raby riding back from a distant village in the dusk was nearly thrown at the resthouse gates by a sudden swerve of his horse dohai dohai dohai the traditional appeal for justice rose to high heaven as a female figure started from the shadow and clutched his bridle it was kirpo with a bloody veil drawn close about her face the young man swore not unnaturally well whats the matter he cried angrily past experience teaching him the hopelessness of escaping without some show of attention im not a magistrate any longer thank god go to the police my good woman oh he continued in contemptuous comprehension as the woman clutching fiercely with both hands let go her veil which falling aside showed a noseless face tis your own fault no doubt the lala the lala shrieked kirpo tis his doing shunker das asked john raby reining up his horse in sudden interest yes shunker das he gave me the gold bangles for going to see your mem and pretending to be his wife he did it the illbegotten son of a hag the vile offspring of a shedevil so with sobs and curses she poured the whole tale of her wrong into the young mans ear he listened to it with wonderful patience all you want i suppose is to punish your husband he asked when she paused for breath no almost yelled the woman the lala the lala i could choke him on his own flesh john raby laughed these half savages had certainly most expressive methods of speech a pity their actions were not as forcible wait here he said quietly ill send you out a note for the native magistrate but mind no word of your visit to my wife im not going to have that all over the place kirpo squatted down at the gatepost wrapping the bloody veil round her once more a habit she would have to grow into with the years not a stones throw from this ghastly figure in the large bare sittingroom of the resthouse which she had decorated to the best of her ability with indian draperies disposed after the fashion of the west sat belle in a low wicker chair a teatable bright with silver and china awaited the masters return while a pile of music scattered on the open piano showed her recent occupation there you are at last john she said cold isnt itquite christmas weather but your tea is ready and what has my wife been doing with herself all day he asked with the complacent affection which invariably sprang up at the sight of his own home comfort oh i working and reading and practising as usual theres a very interesting article on the morality of the vedas in the nineteenth century it seems wonderfully pure a little more sugar if you please and one of those cakes with the chocolate dear was the reply given with a stretching of the limbs into the curves of a cushioned chair do you know belle india is a most delightful country if blanche amory had lived here she would not have had to say il me faut des emotions they sit at the gate so to speak and the contrasts give such a zest to life you with that white gown and all the accessories as the studioslang has it are like pate de foie after the black bread of the spartans if you have done your tea go to the piano theres a dear girl and play me a valse reves damour for choice that will put the truffles to the pate kirpo squatting at the gate waiting for vengeance heard the gay notes what a noise she said to herself no beginning or end just like a jackals cry i wish he would send the letter it came at last and kirpo for one always believed that to it she owed the fact that ramu was caught tried sentenced and imprisoned for a whole year for as she used to say in telling the tale to her cronies i hadnt a cowrie or an ornament left so it would have been no use complaining to the police the lala too impressed a like belief on the indignant ramu tis true enough he said that it is tyranny to deny a man his right to teach his wife caution but thereshe went straight to raby sahib and now you are in for a whole year without a friend to stand treat my poor ramu ram lals teeth chattered at the prospect of desertion but you will stand by me still master he asked piteously wherefore ramu even a buniah leaves old scores alone when there is a receiptstamp on the paper chuckled the usurer pray that thou hast not the same warder oh my son and come back to me if thou wilst when the time is over he happened to be in high good spirits that morning owing to a slip on john rabys part in regard to the signing of some contract which promised to put rupees into the lalas private pocket so much so that he went to the resthouse in order to gloat over the prospect in his unconscious partners presence it was the first time that the latter had seen him since kirpos appeal and confession for john raby had purposely avoided an interview until the trial with its possibility of unpleasantness was over now he calmly shut the door and made the practical joker acquire a thorough and yet superficial knowledge of the ways of the ruling race finishing up by a contemptuous recommendation to vinegar and brown paper ive been fighting your battles dear he said coming into his wifes room and leaning over to kiss her as she lay resting on the sofa a pile of dainty lace and muslin things on the table beside her told tales for the future my battles john i didnt know i had any enemies here or any friends she might have added for those three months in the resthouse had been inexpressibly lonely her husband away all day and no white face within fifty miles enemies no belle i should say not but i have and whats mines yours you know then half amused half irritated he told her of kirpos visit her eyes sought his with the puzzled look which life was beginning to put into them i suppose it was intended as an insult she said but when a man has half a dozen wives some married one some another way itit doesnt seem to matter if they are married or not my dear cried he aghast i do hope you havent been reading my french novels she smiled a trifle bitterly no they bore me its the gazeteer of this district which is to blame how many kinds of marriage i forget one is called a kickingstrap i know it is a mere question of names all through what difference can it make john raby walked up and down the room in for him quite a disturbed manner im sorry to hear you speak that way belle its always a mistake if you cant see the insult you will at least allow that it confirms what i have always maintained the undesirability of mixing yourself up with a social life that doesnt fit in with ours it has put me into rather a hole at all events a hole john what do you mean why even the lala wont work with me after this and i must take all the risk there isnt much of course but somehow ive been hustled all through first by that foolish trial i thought we had agreed to leave that alone john interrupted his wife with a heightened colour true o queen and you neednt be afraid belle you and the babies shall be millionaires billionaires if you like and a speech like this accompanied as it was by the halfcareless halfaffectionate glance she knew so well would start her selfreproach on the road to that sanctuary from all her vague puzzles the fixed belief that she and john were the most attached of couples it would nevertheless be almost impossible to overcolour the absolute loneliness of the girls life at this time her husband away from dawn till sundown her only companions a people whose uncouth patois she hardly understood whose broad simplicity of purpose and passion positively confused her own complexity it was utter isolation combined with the persistent reflection that close by in the native town humanity went to and fro full to the brim with the same emotions of joy and sorrow hope and fear though the causes were different it made her feel as if she had dropped from another world and being from physical causes fanciful she often thought when looking over the wide level plain without one tree to break its contour which stretched away from her to the horizon that but for the force of gravity she could walk over its visible curve into space one of her chief amusements was what her husband laughingly called her jardin dacclimatisation a dreary row of pots where in defiance of a daily efflorescence of glaubers salt she coaxed a dozen or so of disheartened pansies into producing feeble flowers half the size of a wild heartsease she was extremely patient was belle raby and given to watering and tending all things which she fancied should adorn a womans house and home and among them gratitude scarcely a day passed but the thought of philip marsdens illrequited kindness set this irreclaimable heroworshipper into metaphorically besprinkling his grave with her tears until countless flowers of fact and fancy grew up to weave a crown for his memory a frame for his virtues the extent to which she idealised him never came home to her for the fact of his having passed finally from life prevented her from having to decide his exact position in her pantheon another thing which intensified her inclination to overestimate the benefits she had received at philips hands was her husbands evident desire for complete silence on this subject naturally in one so impulsively generous as belle this seemed to make her remembrance and her gratitude all the more necessary so time passed until as women have to do she began to set her house in order against life or death today tomorrow the next day everything familiar commonplaceand then how the heart beats in swift wonder and impatience even though the cradle may be the grave a hint of spring was in the air that sudden spring which in northern india follows close on the first footsteps of the new year belle with a light heart sat sorting her husbands wardrobe and laying aside in camphor and peppercorns things not likely to be required for who could tell how long it might be ere she could look after johns clothes again as she paused to search the pockets of a coat a building sparrow hopped across the floor to tug at a loose thread in the pile of miscellaneous garments among which she was sitting and a brighteyed squirrel hanging on the open door cast watchful glances on a skein of berlin wool which appeared utterly desirable for a nest the whole world she thought seemed preparing for new life working for the unknown and she smiled at the fancy as she began methodically to fold and smooth more carefully than usual for this was johns political uniform and the sight of it invariably brought her a pang of regret for the career that had been given up suddenly her halfcaressing fingers distinguished something unusual between the linings something that must have slipped from the pocket for she had to unrip a rough mend in the latter ere she could remove a sheet of thin paper folded in two smooth uncrushed the writing startled her it was philip marsdens and she sat there for a minute staring at it blankly in after years the smell of camphor always brought her back to that moment of life the sunlight streaming on the floor beside her the twittering bird the watchful squirrel the draft of a willsurely the willand yet how came it in her husbands pocket in the coat that he must have worn then he had knownhe must have known about the money money yes the one passion she had ever seen on his face the one love the sparrow came back again and again robbing one life for another the squirrel emboldened at her silence made off with its hearts desire but still poor belle lay in a dead faint on the floor and there she might have remained with the accusing paper in her hand to face her husband had not pain sharp compelling pain roused her to what to a new life to something beyond yet of herself something to defy fate and carry hope and fear from the present to the future a vague understanding of her own position came to her as she lay slowly gathering consciousness until she rose to her feet and looked round her almost fearfully it must not alter anything she muttered as the torn shreds of paper fell from her shaking hand it cannotoh dear god it shall not not now not now i could not bear it not now not now all that night belle raby fought a strange uncertain battle fought hard for the old life and the new for life or death scarcely knowing why she did either and caring little thinking little of anything save the blind instinct of fight and with the dawn the child which was hers but which she was never to see gave up its feeble desire and left nothing but a pitiful waxen image to tell of life that had been and was gone but belle fast clasping her husbands hand was in the land of dreams the land to which many things besides the dead child must belong forever chapter xviii death we are told changes our vile bodies and minds it is at any rate to be hoped so if orthodox heaven is to be endurable to some of us and when mind and body have gone nigh to death so nigh that he has stilled us in his arms for long days and nights when he has kissed the sight of all things mortal from our eyes and charmed away love and dread till soul could part from flesh without one sigh does not that sometimes send us back as it were to a new life and make us feel strangers even to ourselves belle raby felt this as she came back discreetly decently according to her wont in all things from the valley of the shadow everything was changed and she herself was no longer the girl who had cried uselessly not now ah dear god not now when she first floated up to consciousness through the dim resounding sea which for days and nights had seemed to lull her to sleep it had been to find herself in johns arms while he fed her with a teaspoon and she had drifted down again into the dark carrying with her a faint halfamused wonder why a man who had so deceived his wife should trouble himself about her beeftea neither was it a fit season for tragedy when with hair decently brushed for the first time and a bit of pink ribbon disposed somewhere to give colour to the pale face she lay propped up on the pillow at last fingering a bunch of roses brought her by the traitor nor when he had carried her to the sofa with pleasant smiles at the ease of the task could she begin the dreadful accusation you knew i was an heiressthat was why you married me horrible hateful the blood would surge over her face the tears come into her eyes at the thought of the degradation of such a mutual understanding better far better that the offender should go scotfree and after all where was the difference what had she lost only ignorance the thing itself had always been the same and yet she had not found it outyet she had been content that was the saddest strangest part of all and in her first bitterness of spirit she asked herself more than once if she had any right to truth when lies satisfied her so easily he had not chosen her out of all the world because he loved her and yet she had not found him out was it not possible that she had not found herself out either and what then did it make any difference any difference at all during her tedious convalescence she lay turning these things over and over in her mind almost as if the problem referred to the life of some one else it was a critical time for the new venture and long before she could leave the sofa her husband had to spend a day here two days there arranging for labour and machinery above all for the new house into which he was so anxious for her to settle comfortably before the hot weather came on all was very natural and right nevertheless it marked the beginning of the epoch which comes about in most marriages the time when adam and eve leave the garden of eden and face the world the time when different dispositions naturally drift apart to different interests belle still weak and unstrung found a morbid significance in her husbands growing absorption in the business she seemed to see the greed of gold in his handsome face as he sat descanting over his cigarette on the many projects of his busy brain yet she said no word of blame or warning for she began to lack the courage of criticism the fact was she did not want to know the extent of the gulf between them therefore she kept silence on all points which might serve as a landmark to their relative positions even so she came on the knowledge unawares im glad you dont fret over the baby he said to her one day but you were always sensible the poor little thing might have got ill you know and it would have been a bore if you had had to go to the hills this year when there is so much to be done after that she would have died sooner than mention a grief that was always with her despite her smiling face yet when he was away she wept unrestrained tears over a forlorn little spot in the dreary garden where they told her the lost hope lay hidden away for ever from her eyes if she had only seen it once she used to think if she could only have shed one tear over the little face of which she used to dream if she could only have whispered to it that she was sorry that it was not her fault such grief she told herself was natural even in the happiest wife it could not be construed into a complaint or counted as a surrender to fate she was not going to do that whatever happened never never that was the ruling idea to which even her own unhappiness gave place and the cause of this fixed purpose was a curious one nothing more or less than a passionate desire not to defeat the purpose of philip marsdens legacy he had meant kindly by her when she thought with the glow of ardent gratitude which his memory invariably aroused had he not meant kindly by her and hers and no one least of all she herself should turn that kindness to unkindness poor belle she was bound hand and foot to heroworship and life had shown her unmistakably that it was safer to canonise the dead she lived it must be remembered in a solitude hard even of explanation to those unacquainted with outstation life in india the growing gulf between her and her husband had to be bridged over a dozen times a day by their mutual dependence on each other even for bare speech the saying it takes two to make a quarrel falls short of truth it takes three two to fight and one to hold the sponge and play umpire after a few days of silence consequent on his frequent absences belle was quite ready to welcome john back with smiles and this very readiness gave her comfort things could not be so far wrong after all and so every time he went away she set herself to miss his company with a zest that would have seemed to the spectatorshad there been anyrightminded wrongheaded and purely pitiful it was so even to herself at times when for instance the shadows of day lifted in the nighttime and she woke to find her pillow wet with tearswhy she knew not perhaps because those who had loved her best were lying in unknown graves far away among the everlasting hills it seemed so strange that they should have met such similar fates their very deaths mysterious if all too certain in her mind they seemed indissolubly mixed up with each other living and dying and her thoughts were often with them not in sadness in anything but sadness rather in a deep unreasoning content that they had loved and trusted her and all the while fate was arranging a cunning blow against her hardcontested peace she was expecting her husband one evening when the rapid indian twilight had begun to fill the large bare room with shadows and as driven by the waning light from her books she sat down at the piano her fingers found one theme after another on the keys quite carelessly they fell on the fruehlingslied which three years before had wrought poor dicks undoing and then suddenly she seemed to feel the touch of his warm young lips on hers to see the fire and worship of his eyes was that love she wondered as her fingers stilled themselves to silence or was that too nothing but a lie dear dear old dick the shadows gathered into an eager protesting face the empty room seemed full of the life that was dead for ever ah if it could be so really if those dear dead could only come back just to know how sorely the living longed for them a sound behind made her rise hastily is that you john how late you are she said with face averted for dark as it was the unbidden tears in her eyes craved concealment no it is i philip marsden her hand fell on the keys with a jarring clang that set the room ringing philip nervous overwrought unstrung as she was by long months of silence and repression it seemed to her that the dead had heard her wish how terribly afraid she was afraid of philip a swift denial in her heart made her turn slowly and strain her eyes into the shadow by the door he was there tall and still for darkness dazzles like day and philip marsdens eyes were seeking her in vain by the sound of her voice until he saw a dim figure meeting him with outstretched hands philip oh philip kindest best dearest in the shadows their hands met warm clinging hands and at the touch a cry halffear halfjoy dominated the still echoing discord the next instant like a child who frightened in the dark sees a familiar face she was in his arms sobbing out her relief and wonder ah philip it is you yourself you are not dead you have come back to me my dear my dear he had entered the room cynically contemptuous over the inevitable predicament into which fate and his impulsive actions had led him during his long captivity he had so often faced the extreme probability of her marrying john raby that the certainty which had met him on his arrival at kohat two days before had brought no surprise and but little pain the past he had said was over she had never liked him and he that too was over had been over for months if indeed it had ever existed he must go down at once of course explain about dicks legacy and settle what was to be done in the meantimethat was all and now she was in his arms and everything was swept away in the flood of a great tenderness that never left him again oh belle you are glad you are glad that i have come back the wonder and joy of his voice seemed to rouse her to realities she drew away from him and stood with one hand raised to her forehead in perplexity how dark it is she cried petulantly i did not see i cannotwhy did you come like a thief in the night why did you not write whyyou should not have come you should not i did write he answered gently the blame in her tone seeming to escape his ear i wrote from kohat to tell you the dogcart was at the station and i thought it was for john not for you she interrupted almost fiercely it was for my husband she broke off into silence yes i heard at kohat you were married he could not see her face nor she his and once more her voice was petulant in complaint you startled me no one could have seen in the dark shall i call for lights now if you please when he returned followed by a servant bringing the lamp she was standing where he had left her great heavens how she had changed was this little belle stuart with her beautiful grey eyes this woman with the nameless look of motherhood the nameless dignity of knowledge in her face and yet with a terror such as the tyranny of truth brings with it in the tired eyes which used to be so clear of care i am sorry he began then his thought overflowed conventional speech making him exclaimdont look so scared for pitys sake dont look like that she echoed swiftly that is what you said the last time i saw you dont belle the whole world is before you life and happiness and love it was not true and you have only made it worse by coming back to upset everything to take away everything i am not going to take anything the money money what money i was not thinking of money ah i remember now of course it is yours all yours then silence fell between them again but it was a silence eloquent of explanation so eloquent that philip marsden had to turn aside and look out on the red bars of the sunset before he could beat down the mad desire to take instant advantage of her selfbetrayal but he was a man who above all things claimed the control of his own life and the knowledge that he too had been caught unawares helped him it is all my fault mrs raby he said coming back to her with a great deference in voice and look this has startled you terribly and you have been ill i think yes i have been ill very ill the baby died and thenoh philip philip i thought you were dead i did indeed that was the end every atom of chivalry the man possessed every scrap of good in his nature responded to the pitiful appeal i do not wonder he answered and though he spoke lightly there was a new tone in his voice which always remained in it afterwards when he addressed her i thought i was dead myself come let us sit down and i will tell you how it all happened yes i thought i was dead at least so afzul khan declares afzul khan that was the name of the sepoy you arrested at faizapore did she remember that it was so long ago long before the day he had seen her last when he had tried to comfort her and she had sobbed out her sorrow as to a brother in just such another bare shadowy room as this ah poor belle poor belle had it all been a mistake from beginning to end the only refuge from bewildering thought seemed speech and so he plunged into it explaining at far greater length than he would otherwise have done how he came to be sitting beside her instead of lying with whitening bones in some deep pool in the mountains he must he said have become unconscious from loss of blood and slipped into the river after he was wounded for afzul khan from his place of concealment on the waters edge had seen him drifting down and dragged him to safety they were a queer lot the afghans and afzul believed he owed the major a life after that it was a week ere he could be taken to decent shelter because afzul was also wounded but of all this he himself knew nothing his unconsciousness passing into delirium it was six weeks ere he awoke to find himself in a sort of cave with snow shining like sunlight beyond the opening and afzul cooking marmotflesh over a smoky fire even after that there was a rough time what with cold and hunger for it was an enemys country and the people about were at bloodfeud with afzuls clan at last it became a tossup for death one way or the other seeing he was too weak to attempt escape so he had given himself up to the tribe trusting that to their avarice an english prisoner might be worth a ransom while afzul had gone east promising to return with the swallows then months had passed bringing threats of death more and more constant as the promised ambassador never returned until towards autumn being stronger he managed to escape and after running the gauntlet of danger and starvation succeeded in reaching afzuls tribe only to find him slowly recovering from rheumatic fever brought on by exposure and privation the poor fellow had been at deaths door and long ere he was strong enough to act as pilot eastwards winter had set her seal on the passes so there they had remained fairly comfortable until spring melted the snows and he added with a smile for belles face had resumed its calm i grew quite fat in comparison yet they all took me for a ghost when i walked in to the messroom at kohat one evening after dinnerjust as i walked in here but her truthful eyes looked into his and declined the excuse no i did not take you for a ghost except for an instant i knew it was you and that you had come back to claimeverything then you knew wrong i have come to claim nothing perhaps i have no right to claim anything so it need make no difference it must make a difference to john she interrupted coldly i was thinking of him it is hard on him at all events hard of course it is hard he answered with a sudden pain at his heart yet it is not my fault i meant no harm you have done no harm as far as i know was the still colder reply but in her turn she rose and looked out to that low bar of red still lingering in the horizon it is all very unfortunate but we shall managesomehow there was a pause then she added in quite her ordinary tone i dont think john can be coming tonight so we need not wait dinner for him they have taken your things to the end room i see a light there but i have no right he began crossing to where she stood she turned to him with a sudden gracious smile right you have every right to everything you have given mewhat have you not given me a tall figure crouching in the verandah rose as they passed through the open french window who is that she asked half startled afzul khan i cant take him back to the regiment of course but he came so far with me he has business he says in faizapore afzul khan call him here please it was a curious group those two bound to each other by such a tissue of misunderstanding and mistake and the pathan responsible for part of those mistakes he stood by salaaming stolidly for all that taking in the scene with a quick eye you have brought me back the best friend i ever had said belle with a ring in her voice and all instinctively her hand sought her companions and found it it is gods will not mine was the reply not an atom of sentiment in the words not a scrap of sanctimoniousness simply a statement of fact gods will and stowed away in the folds of his fur coat lay a long blue envelope ominously stained with blood and addressed in a free bold hand to miss belle stuart favoured by major marsden of the st sikhs that was poor dicks will at any rate even in their ignorance those two looked at each other and wondered gods will it was strange if true we dine in the garden now it is cooler i shall be ready in ten minutes said belle she was waiting for him under the stars when he came out from his room and the slender figure against its setting of barren plain and overarching sky seemed all too slight for its surroundings you must be very lonely here he said abruptly her light laugh startled him not tonight at any rate tonight is high holiday and i only hope the khansamah will give us a good dinner come you must be hungry thinking over it afterwards the rest of the evening seemed like a dream to philip marsden a halo of light round a table set with flowers a man and a woman talking and laughing the man with a deep unreasoning content in the present preventing all thought for the future how gay she was how brilliant how little need there was for words with those clear sympathetic eyes lighting up into comprehension at the first hint and with some people it was necessary to have johnsons dictionary on the table ready for reference afterwards again as he sat in the moonlight smoking his cigar and the cool night wind stirred the lace ruffle on the delicate white arm stretched on the lounge chair how pleasant silence was silence with the consciousness of comprehension then when her hand lay in his as they said goodnight how dear her words were once more i want you to understand that i am glad why not you thought i meant the money but it was not that i dont know what i meant but it was not that i used to cry because i couldnt thank you and now you have come i do not want to thank me for what he asked with a catch in his voice but there was no answering tremble in hers you are not so wise as your ghost it knew supposing it was better to be dead after all that would be a pity would it not goodnight john will be home tomorrow he stood and stared at the lamp after she had gone as if its feeble ray would illuminate the puzzle of a womans face and words he did not know that for the first time in her life belle had turned on fate i do not care she had said recklessly as she walked up and down waiting for him amid the flowering oleanders one cannot be always thinking thinking he has come back and i am glad surely that is enough for tonight it was not much to claim and yet it made the puzzle so much the harder for philip marsden he sat on the edge of his bed and swore to himself that he did not know what it all meant that he did not even know his own feelings to leave a girl with whom you fancied yourself in love and who apparently hated you to die and fall out of love only to find when you came back to life that she who had scorned you living had taken a fancy to your memory nay more to find that something in you had survived death what were the elements of a french novel born out of such materials he had never thought over these questions being one of those men who from a certain physical fastidiousness are not brought into contact with them so he may have been said to be in his way quite as conventional in his morality as any woman and the suggestion of such a situation offended him quite as much as it would have offended belle the pride and combativeness of the man rose up against the suggestion even while the very thought of her glad welcome thrilled him through and through he wished no harm to hergod forbid and yet if one were to believe the worldbah what was one to believe he was too restless to sleep and with the curious instinct which drives most good men to be tempted of the devil in the wilderness he put on a pair of thick boots turned up his trousers methodically and set out to seek peace in a moonlight walk bathos no doubt but if the sublime borders on the ridiculous the commonplaces of life must touch on its tragedy it was a broad white road down which he started at a rattling pace before behind it merged into a treeless horizon and it ledgod knows where for all he knew it might be the road leading to destruction the readymade conventional turnpike worn by the feet of thousands following some bellwether who had tinkled down to death when the world was young the moon shone garishly eclipsing the stars it seemed a pity seeing they were at least further from this detestable world than shea mere satellite dancing attendance on a halfcongealed cinder and allowing it to come between her and the light at every critical moment a pretty conceit but not thought and philip was there with the firm intention of thinking out the position yet again and again he found himself basking in the remembrance of belles welcome how glad how unfeignedly innocently glad she had been till fear crept in fear of what of the french novel of course he had felt it himself he had asked himself the same question doubtless as she had and what in heavens name was to be the answer must love always be handfast to something else or was it possible for it to exist not in the selfdenying penance of propriety and duty but absolutely free and content in itself why not as he tramped along stunning noises came from a neighbouring village thrummings of tomtoms and blares of inconceivable horns mingling in a wild beastlike tumult that meant a marriage in all its unglozed simplicity of purpose a marriage to use the jargon unsanctified by love but after all what had love to do with marriage what could the most unselfish dream of humanity have to do with the most selfish the most exacting the most commonplace of all ties love it is true might exist side by side with marriage but the perfection of the one was not bound up in the perfection of the other had not the attempt to find an unnecessary figleaf by uniting sentiment to passion only ended in an apotheosis of animalism not much above that which found expression in those hideous yells and brayings above nay below for it degraded love and passion alike by false shame to escape the wedding party he struck away from the road and felt relieved when he had got rid of its hardandfast lines its arrogance of knowing the way the clumps of tall tigergrass shot arrowlike against the velvet sky and every now and again a faint rustle at their roots told of something watching the intruder a brooding partridge may be perhaps a snake with unwinking eyes and as he walked his thoughts seemed to lead him on till something of the truth something naked yet not ashamed as it had been before mankind ate of the sorrowful tree came home to him it could not be true that verdict of the world he would defy it suddenly he found himself confronted by a strange barrier blocking his way as far as eye could reach on either side rose a wall of shadow twenty feet high a wall dense and dark below filmy as cobwebs where the tasselled reeds of which it was composed touched the purple of the sky the gossamer wings of a day could pass through those feathery tops but below even the buffalo had to seek an oozy track here and there he had often heard of this reed wall which following the old river bed divides village from village as effectually as when the stream ran fast and deep but its curious aptness to his thoughts startled him impenetrable save for those who sought the mire or those with the wings of a dove which was it to be as he stood arrested by his own fancy a nightheron flitted past its broad white wings whirred softly and its plumed head craning forward with bloodred eyes searching the shadows cleft the moonlight by some strange jugglery of fancy it reminded him of a picture by gustave dore and with the remembrance of francesca da rimini came that of the scared look in poor belles face he turned aside impatiently beset once more by the desire for escape and struck across the plain coming after a time on a footpath which he followed mechanically through the tamarisk bushes until he emerged on an open space where a hoar frost of salt crystals glittered on rows and rows of tiny mounds so pure so white that the eye might have sworn to a winters night even while the other senses told of more than summers heat a deception increasing the unreality with which philip recognised that his wandering steps had led him to a village graveyard a far cry from the marriage feast he sat down on the pile of disordered bricks and stucco which marked the restingplace of the saint round whose bones the faithful had gathered and asked himself what chance there was of standing out against the opinion of the many in life if even in death it was always follow my leader a quaint place it was no enclosure no token of hope or grief no symbol of faith nothing but the dead clean forgotten and out of mind ah but belle had not forgotten him and if he had remained dead she would have gone on giving him the best part of herself without reproach without remorse was death then the only freedom from the body he sat so long immersed in his own thoughts that the slow stars were wheeling to meet the dawn ere he rose and threw out his arms cramped by long stillness dead yet alivethat was the old panacea was nothing else attainable must love be killed why a rustle in the tamarisks beyond the open made him turn sharply and make his way towards the corner whence it proceeded as he did so a group of men defiled from the bushes set down the burden they carried and without looking round began to dig a grave the hour the absence of wailing gave philip a momentary thought that he might be assisting at the concealment of some crime but his knowledge of the people reassured him yet as he approached all the partysave a very old man mumbling his beadsscurried into the jungle and so he judged it wiser to stop and give the orthodox salutation the patriarch rose in feeble haste allah be praised we thought you were the ghost already come back come back he cried in louder quavering voice tis only a presence seeking sport doubtless come back and get her under earth ere dawn or twill be the worse for all then as one by one his companions crept back to their task he answered philips curious looks with waggling head only a wanton woman huzoor seven months ago meek as a dove playing about the village with maidenplaited hair but when the matrons unbound it for the bridegroom as in due course of duty the wickedness came out it is so with some women a fancy that hath not bit nor bridle a wantonness of mind when god made them to be mothers and she would have been oneay a happy onefor all her fancies had she not wept herself into a wasting and died with her unborn child cursed creature bringing evil on the whole village with her whims quick quick my sons hide her before dawn with the irons round her thumbs and the nails through her feet then will i sow the mustardseed in her path homewards so that cockcrow will ever send her back to the worms ere she hath done gathering and all for a fancy when god made women to be mothers a wanton mind a wanton mind the broken quavering voice went on accusingly as philip turned away sick at heart here was the other side of the shield and which was the truth he went home feeling he had gained very little from the wilderness chapter xix the night which had proved so restless to philip marsden had been for belle strangely enough one of profound repose never since as a child she fell asleep with the fresh cool caress of her pillow had she felt less inclination to be wakeful less desire for thought the measureless content which comes so seldom save in a pleasant dream held her body and soul to feel it was enough yet as she woke to the sound of her husbands early return she woke also to a full consciousness of the change philips resurrection from the dead must bring into their lives a hasty remorse at her own brief happiness made her slip on a morninggown and go into her husbands officeroom the wonder whether he knew or whether the post which always went to him direct while he was in camp in order to save time had failed to find him made her cheek pale she scarcely knew which would be worst to meet him crushed by the news or to have to kill his easy content with bitter tidings she found him already engaged with the tea and toast which the servant had brought in on his arrival and her heart sank face to face with it anything seemed better than the task of telling hullo belle little woman is that you up so early but it must have been deuced startling for you to have marsden walking in like lazarus then you have heard she interrupted with quite a sigh of relief of course ive heard one always does hear that sort of thing but the fool of a peon took the letters to the village id just left so it was too late to send you word and then i had to finish some work its a queer go isnt it poor old marsden somehow it makes me laugh belle sat down helplessly in the low chair by her husband feeling utterly lost was she never to be able even to guess at his moods she had imagined that this would be the most bitter of blows and he found it provocative of laughter im so glad you take it that way john she began i was afraid afraid of what by the way he is here i suppose you havent sent him elsewhere or done anything foolish i hope why should i send him away i dont understand oh nothing onlyyou see when you have got to keep on the right side of a man it is as well not to be too particular i suppose you have been talking about the money what did he say a slow colour crept into belles face not muchat leasti dont think we talked about it at all there were so many other things john raby whistled a tune then he smiled upon my soul you are sometimes quite incomprehensible belle but perhaps it is as well you might have put your foot in it somehow and as it is absolutely necessary that the legacy should remain in the business we must be careful if we play our cards decently this ridiculous resurrection wont make much difference you see marsden is a gentleman he wouldnt ruin anybody least of all a woman he hullo whats the matter now her hand gripped his arm almost painfully dont john dont for pitys sake dont phew you neednt pinch me black and blue my dear for hinting at the truth you know what marsden did to save you once why shouldnt he do something to save you now there is no use mincing matters when one is in a corner like this i mean to have the use of that money and if we play our cards fairly we shall get it i mean to have it and youre bound to help for though i dont wish to reproach you belle you must see that you are mainly responsible for the position i yes you if it hadnt been for your squeamishness i should still have been a civilian and able to go back on my tracks then again but for having to quarrel with shunker for his impudence i should only have been at halfrisks he would have had to sink or swim with me and that would have ensured his advancing more capital the fact is that luck has been against me all through what is it you want me to do she asked faintly how can i help oh if you ask in that tragedytone its no use answering i want you to be sensible that is all there really is nothing to make a fuss about ill ensure him a fair interest and his coming back doesnt alter our position we have been living on his money for the last year but we thought he was deadthat it was ours oh john there is a difference dont you see he is tiedthat he has no choice as it were if you mean that marsden is a gentleman and sees that the predicament is none of our making then i agree she knelt down beside him looking into his face with passionate entreaty in hers john she said i cant make you understand but if you love meever so littledont dont beg ofof this man surely we have taken enough you have some money of your ownindeed i would rather starve it would kill me if you took advantage ofof his kindness then seeing the hopelessness of rousing sympathy in him she buried her face against the arm of his chair with a sob of pain ill tell you what i do know belle he answered kindly enough it was a confounded shame of marsden to upset your nerves by popping up like a jackinthebox youre not a bit strong yet go and lie down till breakfasttime and leave me to settle it why you little goose you dont think im going down on my knees to beg of any man i am only very wisely going to take advantage of the natural strength of the position it isnt as if you had ever cared a button for him you know something like a flash of lightning shot down from heaven on poor belle shrivelling up all her strength she crept away to her room and there with flaming cheeks paced up and down wondering why the sky didnt fall on the house and kill every one every one but philip the memory of the night before had come back to fill her with shame and doubt and yet with a great certainty when had she felt so happy so content when had she talked to john straight out from her very heart as she had talked to philip what must he have thought that she had been seeking to please him as john called it trying to play her cards well no he would not think such things and yet the alternative was even less honourable to her what had possessed her she johns wife who had triedwho had always tried so hard to be content how had this inconceivable thing come about preposterous absurd it had not come about it could not should not must not be yet after all what was the use in denying it philip stood far above john in her pantheon she had known that for months but then it was allowable to canonise the dead why had he come back above all why had he brought his saintship with him so the circle of passionate resentment at fate and still more passionate contempt for herself went round and round bringing no conclusion she would have liked to throw herself on her bed and cry her eyes out but trivial yet insuperable barrier to this relief it was too near breakfasttime for tears since no one must guess at her trouble so she appeared at the appointed time and asked philip if he had slept well and if he would take tea or coffee and no one knew that she was wondering half the time why the sky didnt fall down and crush her for noticing that philip saw she was pale that philip handed her the butter and philip looked to her always for an opinion what right had he to do all this when her husband did not poor belle she had dreamed dreams only to find herself as she thought in the most despicable position in which a woman can possibly find herself she never paused to ask if the verdict of society in its more virtuous moods was trustworthy and that a woman who discovers some other man to be nearer the sun than her husband must necessarily call her marriage a failure and so forfeit some measure of her selfrespect her righteous ignorance simply made her feel as she looked at the welllaid table that here were all the elements of a mariage a trois an idea hateful to her and from which according to what she had been taught the only escape was flight yet how could there be flight if john would not give up the money and then the thought that the table laid for two last night had been ever so much more pleasant came to reduce her reasoning powers to pulp she listened to the story of poor dicks willthat will which had led to the present puzzlefeeling that the halfexcuse it gave to johns avarice was but another rivet in the chain which bound her life to philips for with his kind face before her eyes and his kind voice in her ears it was useless denying the tie between them that was the worst of it she knew perfectly well that as he sat there calmly talking to her husband silence was no protection to her feelings he knew them just as she knew of a certainty what his were not by any occult power not by any mysterious affinity but by the cleareyed reason which affirms that given certain conditions and certain ideals the result is also certain and yet while she acknowledged her confidence in him something she knew not what rebelled against his sympathy it was an interference an offence it is a pity you did not take the will she said coldly it would have saved us all a great deal of annoyance the patience in his reply made her still more angry she positively preferred her husbands frown as he suggested with a very different tone in his voice that if major marsden had finished breakfast he should come and talk over details in the office but i should like your wife began philip john is much better at business than i am interrupted belle i dont take much interest in that sort of thing andi would rather not thank you so the two men whom fate had always placed in such strange antagonism to each other sat amicably arranging the business while belle wandered about from one occupation to another angry with herself for knowing which of the two had her interest most at heart its all settled belle cried her husband gaily as they came in to lunch marsdens a trump but we knew that before didnt we youll never regret it though philip for it is twenty per cent and no mistake i say belle we must have a bottle of champagne to drink to the new firm marsden raby and co he hurried off for the wine leaving belle and the major alone marsden raby and co horrible detestable nor was the position bettered by philips remark that there was no other way out of it at present dicks will might turn up if as was not unlikely some one had buried the poor lad there was no doubt that some one had looked after his effects in the shanties at all events her husband had arranged to pay back the money by instalments so soon as possible all this only made her reply stiffly that she was sure john would do his utmost to lessen the risk i shall leave it in his hands at any rate said philip who despite his pity and sympathy was human i shant trouble you much with interference by the way when does the train leave tonight i shall have to be going on my way whats that cried john returning with the champagne going away nonsense you must see the new house your new house for the time being and then there is the new dam you must see that as member of the firm mustnt he belle her silence roused philips old temper yes i suppose i ought to see it all afzul is leaving tonight as he has business somewhere or other but i will stop till tomorrow we might ride over in the morning to the house if you have a horse at my disposal they are all at your disposal said belle quickly major marsden can ride suleiman john i shall not want him they dined in the garden again that evening but it was a different affair and the perception that it was so added to belles wild rebellion at the position in which she found or fancied she found herself when they stood out under the stars again saying goodnight belles hand lay in philips for an instant while john filled himself a tumbler from the tray in the verandah somehow the tragedy of her face proved too much for the humour of the man who knew himself guiltless of all save a great tenderness i am not going to bite my poor belle he said with a smile half of amusement half of annoyance you neednt call in the aid of the policeman i assure you she looked at him angrily but as she turned away there were tears in her eyes he sat on the edge of his bed once more pondering over the events of the day but this time there was no doubt in his mind at all he cared more for belles peace than for anything else in the world he would go away for a while but he would not give her up he would prove to her that there was no need for that to his surprise she was waiting in the verandah when he came out of his room at daybreak next morning she looked businesslike and selfreliant as all women do in their ridinghabits and she was fastening a rose at her collar johns not quite ready she remarked easily but he said we had better go on and he would catch us up i want to see about the garden the roses here are mine and as some of them are quite prettythis one for instancewont you take it you cant have seen many roses latelyi intend moving them by the bye ive sent out breakfast so as your train doesnt leave till midnight we can have a jolly day philip fastening the rose in his buttonhole wondered if the best parlour with all the covers off was not worse than calls on the policeman both seemed to him equally unnecessary but then he had all the advantage in position he could show his friendship in an unmistakable way while poor belle had only the far harder task of receiving benefits you dont remember suleiman my arab at faizapore she said as they cantered off you are riding him nowoh dont apologise the pony does well enough for me john gave me such a delightful surprise in buying him back after we were married got him dirt cheap from a woman who was afraid to ride him remarked john coming up behind cheerfully and belle was divided between vexation and pleasure at this depreciation of his own merits i should think you rode pretty straight as a rule said philip looking at her full in the face many women make the mistake of jagging at a beasts mouth perpetually if you can trust him its far better to leave him alone dont you think so john race me to the next kikar tree its our last chance for we shall be among the corn soon come major marsden overtaking them at regulation pace owned that belle did ride very straight indeed perhaps she was right after all and the position was untenable he felt a little disheartened and weary only his pride remained firm telling him that he had a perfect right to settle the point as he chose surely he might at least rectify his own mistakes the sun climbed up and up and even in the cooler greener riverland beat down fiercely on the stubble where here and there the oxen circled round on the threshingfloors and clouds of chaff glittering like gold in the light showed the winnower was at work john was in his element pointing out this field promised to indigo and that village where a vat was to be built it is getting a little hot for mrs raby to be out remarked philip though he was quite aware it would be an offence by george it is late look belle theres the house beyond those trees on the promontory it is three miles round but if you cut across so by the sand its only one and a half marsden and i will go the other way i have to see a village first and then we can look at the new dam it is over yonder i suppose said philip pointing to a likely bend in the river bank just so then i will see mrs raby across the cut and join you there but i can manage quite well by myself protested belle i have no interest in villages mrs raby andexcuse mebefore we start your ponys girths require tightening he slipped from his horse and was at her side before she could reply then im off cried john with a faint shrug of his shoulders ill meet you at the corner marsden in twenty minutes steady lad steady murmured the major with his head under the flap of the saddle as suleiman figeted to join his stablecompanion belle standing tapping her boot with her whip moved forward give me the reins i dont see why you should do everything philip came up from the girths smiling and began on the curb what a fidget you are im glad john isnt like that curbs and girths mean more than you suppose there now you can go neckandcrop at everything and i wont say you nay steady lad steady one two threeare you all right thank you i think i have the proper number of hands and feet and so far as i know my head is on my shoulders replied belle tartly they dipped down a bit from the fields to a sluggish stream edging the higher land and then scampered across the muddy flats towards the promontory which lay right at the other side of the bend pull up please cried philip that strip looks quick nonsense john comes this way every week its all right belle gave her pony a cut making it forge ahead but it was no match for suleiman who unaccustomed to the spur bounded past her pull up please dont be foolish pull up philip shouted hearing the ominous cloop of his horses feet another dig of the spur a leap a flounder and suleiman was over the creek not so belles pony slower heavier it was hopelessly bogged in a second and floundering about sank deeper and deeper throw yourself off cried philip as far as you canarms flat soquite still please there is no danger i can get at you easily and it is not deep a minute after his hand closed on her wrist as she lay sinking slowly despite her stillness for the pony relieved of her weight was plunging like a mad thing and churning up the sand and water to slush i must get a purchase first these sands hold like birdlime he said after an ineffectual attempt dont be frightened if i let go for a moment then with one hand through suleimans stirrup he knelt once more on the extreme edge of the firm ground and got a grip of belle again now thenall together more all together than he desired for suleiman alarmed at the strain backed violently reared and finally broke away leaving philip prone on his back in the dirt i hope i didnt hurt you he said struggling up rather blindly to aid belles final flounder to safe ground not much she replied with a nervous laugh as she shook the curiously dry sand from her habit my wrist will be a bit black and blue thats all why philip whats the matter philip he had doubled up limply horribly as if he had been shot and lay in a heap at her feet philip what is it as she slipped her arm beneath him to raise his head something warm and wet trickled over itblood the wound he murmured my handkerchiefanythingi am sorry then the pain died out of his face and his head felt heavy on her arm the wound she sought for it by the aid of that ghastly trickle only to find when she tore the coverings away that it was no trickle but an intermittent gushing that must be stopped somehowher handkerchief his handkerchief her own little white hands it had all passed so quickly that it seemed but a minute since he had cried pull up and there she was with his head on her knee face downwards and the warm blood soaking over her people make long stories afterwards of such scenes but as a matter of fact they derive all their horror from their awful swiftness belle bareheaded in the sunlight was full of one frantic desire to see the face hidden away in her habit was he dead was that the reason why the blood oozed slower and slower she craned over his closecropped hair only to see the outline of his cheek philip philip she whispered in his ear but there was no answer was it five minutes was it ten was it an hour since she had sat there with her hands ah ghastly ghastly she could not look at them and yet for no temptation in the world would she have moved a finger lest he was not dead and sheoh blessed thoughtwas staving death aside a shout behind and her husband tearing down at a mad gallop alarmed at the return of the riderless horse good god belle what has happened look and tell me if he is dead she said quick i want to knowi want to know he was not dead and yet the bleeding had stopped then they must get him home get him somewhere as best they could a string bed was brought from the nearest village with relays of willing yet placid bearers belle walked beside it in philips helmet for her own hat had been lost in the quicksand keeping her hand on the rough bandages while john raced ahead to set the doors open it was dreary crossing the threshold of the new house with the jostling shuffling footsteps of those who carry something that is deaths or will be deaths but there was a light in belles eyes and even her husband accustomed as he was to her even nerves wondered at her calm decision since they must procure a doctor as quickly as possible the best plan would be for john to ride across country to a station where the afternoon mail stopped to return to saudaghur and a mere hospital assistant would be needless delay she did not mind she said being left alone and meanwhile they must send for a supply of necessaries since it was evident that philip could not be moved at any rate for a day or two so belle sat in the big empty room which by and by was to be hers and watched alone by the unconscious man feeling that it was her turn now it was a vigil not to be forgotten and once as she raised his head on her arm in order to moisten his lips with the stimulant which alone seemed to keep life in him he stirred slightly his eyes opened for a second and a faint murmur reached her ear no need for a policeman a smile pathetic in its absolute selfsurrender came to her face as she stooped and kissed him with the passion of protection and possession which a mother has for her helpless child and that is a love which casts out fear as she crouched once more beside the coarse pallet where he lay for the room was destitute of all furniture save the string woven bed belle raby for the first time in her life faced facts undistorted by her own ideals and judged things as they were not as they ought to be she loved this man but what was that love was it a thing to be spoken of with bated breath just because the object happened to be a person whom all things consenting one might have married her nature was healthy and unselfish her knowledge of the devastating passion which is said to devour humanity was derived entirely from a pious but unreasoning belief in what she was told it is not the fashion nowadays to say so but that is really the position in which a vast majority of women find themselves in regard to many social problems and so in that dreary shadowy room with the man she loved dependent on her care for his sole chance of life belle raby asked herself wherein lay the sin or shame of such a love as hers and found no answer and yet when her husband returned with the doctor he brought back with him also the old familiar sense that something she knew not what was wrong the old resentment born of the old beliefs at the odious position in which she found herself but now she tried to set these thoughts aside as unworthy unworthy of her own self above all unworthy of philip chapter xx afzul khan was sitting in shunker dass house at faizapore with a frown upon his face he had come all the way in order to consult mahomed lateef the old syyed about a certain blue envelope which was hidden away in his posteen only to find that the old man had retreated before his enemies to his last foothold of land while the usurer had enlarged his borders at the expense of the ruined old chiefs ruined house now mahomed lateef was afzul khans patron in this way the latter was fosterbrother to that dead son who had died gloriously in the regiment and who had been born at an outpost on the frontier indeed but for the old man afzul would never have put the yoke of service round his neck so his frown was not only on account of his useless journey much of it was anger at his old friends misfortunes and those who had taken advantage of them it angered him to see a blue monkey painted on the wall in front of which the staunch mohammedan used to say his prayers it angered him still more to see the rows of cookingpots where there used to be but one yet business was business and shunker might be able to tell him what had become of the commissariatcolonel sahibs daughter for afzul had had the address of the letter spelt out for him by a selfsatisfied little schoolboy at kohat and knew enough of poor dicks family history to suppose that belle stuart must be his cousin estuart sahibs daughter echoed shunker a sullen scowl settling on his face as it always did at the memory of his wrongs why she married that shaitan raby who lives at saudaghur now because he was turned out of the service wah a fine pair and a fine tale she had a lover marsden of a sikh regiment who paid for her with lakhs on lakhs then when he was killed she took the money and married raby scum and they talk about our women bah this was not all malice and uncharitableness on the usurers part for it must be remembered that if we know very little of indian social life the natives know still less of ours the result being on both sides the explanation of strange phenomena by our own familiar experience and this is not as a rule a safe guide in conditions of which we know nothing afzul gave a guttural snort startling but expressive she married raby truly it is said the journeyings of fools are best not made and marsden sahiblong life to himwas her lover inshallah she might have found a worse before the worms got him chuckled shunker and then his money was worth another fine man that is womans way white or black raby sahibs mem repeated afzul meditatively there thou speakest truth o shunker he is with her now the memory of those two standing together hand in hand came to him and he nodded his head approvingly for the thought that belles allegiance might return to its original object commended itself to his mind his view of the subject not being occidental who is with her now asked shunker with a stare marsden sahib hast not heard he hath come back to life the usurers eyes almost started from his head come back he shrieked he is not dead oh holy lukshmi what offerings to thy shrine why the shaitan will lose the money he will have to give up the business and ioh guneshji i am revenged i am revenged he lay back on his bed gasping gurgling choking with spiteful laughter and real passionate delight the pathan scowled his knowledge of english law was limited and he objected to laughter at marsden sahibs expense if he gave it to the mem for what he got as thou sayest shunker marsden sahib will never ask it back he will take the woman instead that is but fair thou dost not understand their crooked ways gasped shunker and tis waste of time to explain so marsden sahib is alive again that is news indeed hurri gunga i must go down to saudaghur and felicitate the shaitan on his friends return he he on his friends return afzul felt the longing of the frontiersman to stick a knife in a fat hindu stomach but he refrained the blue envelope was going to be a heavier responsibility than he had thought for and till that was settled he must not wander into byways no matter how the pigfaced idolater had lied in other things it was true about the mem and the major he had seen that with his own eyes had dick sahib been her lover too and what did both those brave ones see in such a poor thin creature truly the ways of the sahiblogue were past finding out nevertheless he would seek out the old khan and see what he said shunker might be lying all except that about the memsahib and the major that was true it was well on to noon when afzul after many hours of varied travelling by train by canal and finally on foot found himself in mahomed lateefs last few acres of land of a surety they were not ones to be voluntarily chosen as a restingplace bare of everything save the sparse stalks of last years millet crop showing all too clearly how scanty that crop had been bare to the very walls of the halfruined tower which stood supported on one side by the mud hovel occupied by the owner a significant fact that bareness showing the lack of flocks and herds the lack of everything that was not wanted for immediate use and as he stood at the open door of the yard it also showed cleanswept and garnished dire sign of the poverty which allows nothing to go to waste yet it was not empty of all for as the pathan knocked again a child bubbling over with laughter ran from a dark door into the sunlight nana nana granddad catch catch it cried and its little legs unsteady though they were kept their advantage on the long ones behind long but old crippled too with rheumatism and want of food to keep the stern

he is like them all she crooned dost have a mind khan sahib of futteh mahomed fallingthe first and i so frightened there was a scratch a finger long on his knee and peace fatma and go back there is a stranger at the door go back i say it was a difficult task to draw the veil over those bent shoulders but the old womans wrinkled hands did their best as she scurried away obediently salaam alaikoom said the pathan the mother may return it is i afzul brother of the breast afzul the old martinets face grew dark the only afzul i knew was a runaway and a deserter art thou he ay khan sahib replied the man calmly i ran away because i had sold my life to marsden sahib and i wanted to buy it back again i have done it and i am free marsden sahib tis long since i heard that name allah be with the brave pity there was none to stand between him and death as on that day when my son died thou liest khan sahib i stood in my brothers place marsden sahib is not dead i left him three days ago at saudaghur not dead this is a tale a prisoner no doubt inshallah my blood scents something worth words here fatma take the child or stay its best he should hear too such things sink through the skin and strengthen the heart and bring food woman what thou hast and no excuses a brave man stomachs all save insult so with the child on his knee the old soldier listened to afzul khans story while in the dark room beyond the women positively shed tears of shame over the poor appearance which the plain bajra cakes unsweetened unbuttered presented on the big brass platter there is the boys curdled milk suggested his sadfaced mother he will not mind for a day peace unnatural scolded the grandmother the boys milk forsooth what next women nowadays have no heart a strange man and the boys milk forsooth haiyat bibi blushed under her brown skin hers was a hard life with her husband far over the black water and this stern old man and woman for gaolers but the boy was hers she hugged that knowledge to her heart and it comforted her the evening drew in the child dozed off to sleep but not one jot or tittle of adventure was to be passed over in silence inshallah but thou didst well god send the traitors to hell ay marsden sahib was ever the bravest of the brave these and many another exclamation testified to the old campaigners keen interest but when afzul began tentatively to question him about the blue envelope the light died from the hollow eyes raby sahib nay he knew nought save that the people said it was the memsahibs money he was spending in this new talk of indigo and what not he wished them no ill but murghub ahmad far away in the andamans had saved the mem from insultperhaps worseand she had given evidence against him in the trial he wished no man ill but if what the people said was true and raby sahibs new dam would prevent the river from doing its duty then it would be a different matter ay the new factory was but ten miles up the river but no one lived there as yet now the matter of the blue envelope became more and more oppressive to afzul khan the more he thought of it easy enough to send it anonymously to raby sahibs mem and so be quit of it once for all but what if she had taken the majors money as shunker asserted in order to buy a new husband and what if this paper of eshmitt sahibs meant more loot afzul was all unconsciously jealous of this whitefaced mem and but for a strange sort of loyalty to the boy he had betrayed would have liked to put the letter in the fire shake himself loose of all ties and return to his people nay thou askest more than i have to give replied mahomed lateef to his questioning i know tis on paper they leave their moneys for as i said the colonel sahib once asked metwas in china during the warto set my name as witness to something was it longshaped in a blue cover asked afzul eagerly there was no cover but it was long like the summons from the courts stay if thy mind be really set on such knowledge there is a friend of my poor murghubsone who pleads in the courtseven now resting in his fathers village but a space from here he must know more than thou canst want to hear so in the cool of the next morning afzul walked through the barren fields to see the pleader a keenfaced sallow young man seemingly glad to escape for the time from patentleather boots and such like products of civilisation the pathan found him squatting over against a hookah and basking in the sunshine like the veriest villager for all that he was fulfilled with strange knowledge of law and order as administered by the alien and afzul sat openeyed while he discoursed of legacies and settlements of the feme covert and the married womens property act with a side glance at divorces and permanent alimonystrange topics to be gravely discussed at the gateway of an indian village through which men were carried to their rest and women to their bridal beds with scant appeal to anything but custom it utterly confused afzul though it sent him away convinced that the blue envelope must mean the loot of another lover to the memsahib i will wait he said to himself decisively yes i will wait until she is faithful and goes back to the major then as that pleader fellow says he will get the money but if he leaves her and takes his money instead then i will send her the envelope that is but fair god and his prophet but their ways are confusing tis better to steal and fight as we do it makes the women faithful that evening he spent half an hour with a needle and thread borrowed from old fatma in sewing the blue envelope safely into his skincoat then he sat once more stirring the old mohammedans blood with tales of fight and adventure till far on into the night yet the earliest blink of dawn found him creeping away from the still sleeping household and his right arm bare of a massive gold bracelet he had worn for years that he had left lying on the babys pillow for was not the child the son of his brother had not his father saved marsden sahib also ah that score was not paid off yet he still seemed to see the tall figure standing in the sunlight fool that he had been not to fire instead of giving himself away at a mere word even now though he knew that but for him philip marsdens bones would have been churning in a dreary dance of death at the bottom of some boiling pool in the terwan torrent he felt the bitterness of defeat his very admiration growing as it did with the others display of pluck added to his resentment to take an order from a man when you had your finger on the trigger of your rifle it was all very well to save a wounded comrade to stand by him through thick and thin but that did not show him or convince yourself that you cared as little for his menace as he had done for yours some day yes some day he would stand up before marsden sahib and defy him then he could cry quits and go home to his own people in peace nevertheless the news of his masters accident which met him on his return to saudaghur sent him without an instants pause to the factory where philip still lay unconscious and when he walked at the dead of night into the big bare room where belle sat watching his face softened at the sight of that dark head on the pillow it softened still more when something of the pastheaven knows whatseemed to come with him rousing a low quick voice from the bed afzul it is cold put on more fuel do you not feel the cold afzul afzul for that something had carried philip marsden back to the smoky cave among the snows although the windows stood wide open to let in the tardy coolness of the summer night the pathan drew himself together and stood at attention huzoor he answered quietly it is done the fire blazes belle in the halfshadows thrown by the sheltered lamp stood up looking kindly at the newcomer im glad you have come afzul she whispered he has been calling for you so often behind his military salute the man smiled approvingly she was of the right sort faithful to the old love marsden sahib should marry her and get the money if that was the way they managed things over the black water and this solution of the question grew upon him as he watched her unfailing devotion when between them they helped the sick man through the dreary trouble which was all too familiar to the pathan it was so in the cave he would say as time dragged on through days when the sick man lay still and silent through nights when the quick hurried words never seemed to leave his lips and it was all they could do to keep on the bandages its the bullet in the shoulder blade thats troublin him said the clever little irish doctor who rode forty miles every day between two trains in order to see his patient and keep an eye on his hospital put three more days strength into him mrs raby and ill bring over another man and well have at it somehow the wound has niver haled and niver will till it gets a fair chance shortly after this belle found herself pacing up and down the verandah scarcely daring to think of what was going on within would he die was this really the end was it to be peace at last and no more struggle and lo and behold when the doctors let her into the room again he was lying with a smile on his face because the pain the ceaseless pain which had annihilated everything else in the world was gone ive given you a lot of trouble he said and even as he spoke fell asleep from sheer blessed ease after that again came a time when even afzul stood aside and let the mem take the lead while he sat watching her curiouslya time when it positively seemed more to her that philip should take so many spoonfuls of nourishment every hour than that he should get better when the content of immediate success blotted out the thought of future failure and the fear of death was forgotten in the desire of staving it off most people who have nursed a case in which even the doctors stay their hands and wait on nature know that strange dreamlike life wherein the peaks and passes on the temperature chart seem by contraries to raise or depress the whole world belle fought the fight bravely and not until she stood one day looking at a thermometer which registered normal did she feel a sinking at her heart they had come down into the low levels of life they were back in the workday world yet it was not the one they had left six weeks before even outwardly it had changed the last green blade of grass had withered to a brown shadow on the sunbaked soil and the duststorms of may swept over the halffinished house it looks dreary enough now but just you wait till next year said john raby in his cheerful confident way the new dam will be finished i hope the water will come in at high level to the garden the place will be a paradise of flowers and we shall be dividing thirty per cent profit theres a prospect oh by the way did i ever tell you that beast shunker das came down just after you did marsden expecting to find me on my back like a turned turtle his face when he saw i was jolly as a sandboy was a caution by george that man does hate me and no mistake belle moved a step nearer her husband and laid her hand on the back of his easychair perhaps it was only his goodnature in leaving her free to nurse philip but somehow she felt they had drifted far apart during the past six weeks i seem to have heard nothing she began wistfully better employed on the head of the firm my dear he replied with a laugh you do her credit marsden and now i must be off again for there is some idiotic fuss at a village a few miles off shunkers work i expect but we are too strong for him even the native recognises the almighty dollar and if they will only have patience ill engage to treble the revenue of this district well goodbye belle ill be back tomorrow or next day soon as i can get as the americans say take care of yourselves when he had gone the punkah went on swinging belles hands knitted busily philips lay idle in the languor of convalescence all was as before and yet there was a differencea difference of which each was conscious and which brought a certain restraint why does shunker hate him asked major marsden there was no lack of confidence now between these two and if he asked many questions she was quite ready to answer them faithfully according to her lights in this one however she failed to give a just impression for the simple reason that she herself had no conception of the extent of the usurers malice in fact his impotent rage on discovering that philips return had apparently made no difference to the rabys would have been incredible to an educated englishwoman had she been aware of it which she was not the man coming down to saudaghur expectant of consternation had found nothing but a stir of fresh enterprise which his keen business eye told him meant money he wandered about from village to village noting the golden seed being sown by his adversary until the thought of the harvest in which he would have no share positively worried him into spleen and ague and as he lay among the simple village folk a fresh idea for revenge came to console him it is never hard to change the stolid opposition of the indian peasant into stolid obstruction no overt injustice is required nothing but a disregard of custom and so shunker taking advantage of the short period during which he had been associated in partnership with john raby began cautiously to call in debts in the name of the firm now in an indian village a debt to the ancestral usurer is a debt that is to say no nighty ephemeral liability which may crop up at any time claiming payment but a good solid inheritance going back sometimes a generation or two a patent almost of solvency a claim certainly for consideration at the hands of your banker since a bumper crop might any day give you the upperhand or a bad one make it still more unwise for the creditor to present his bill thus when shunker disregarded timeworn prejudices to the extent of asking one peru an oldestablished customer to make a settlement the latter looked as if the foundations of the round world had been moved pay he said slowly his broad nostrils inflated like those of a horse shying at novelty i am always paying buniakji year by year one harvest or another god knows how much but tis the old way and old ways are good they are good sighed the usurer piously i like them myself peru but new masters have new ways new masters do not make new land retorted the peasant shrewdly enough that remains the same it must be sown yet when i ask the seedgrain as my fathers have done the answer is pay pay of course i will pay when the crops ripen does not harvest mean payment to the peasant your crops wont ripen long on those fields im afraid my poor peru the sahib wants land here everywhere for this new factory of his the men who will not pay will see what befalls a little will go this year a little more next if i were alone twould be a different matter for i was ever faithful to my friends shunkers air of virtuous distress was admirable but peru laughed the rough peasant laugh full of broad toleration as vermin to the pathan so are the graindealers to the farmer we warm you and you feed on us till you grow troublesome thenoff goes the coat one buniah is like another why then dost change i change not dunderhead cried shunker enraged at a certain slow superiority in the other tis raby sahib claims payment then tell raby sahib i will pay when the river comes it will come this year perhaps if not next year if luck be bad it may tarry twain not longer it comes ever sooner or later then let us talk of payment shunker leaned forward his evil face kindling with malice but what peru if the river never returns what if raby sahibs new dam is built to prevent the water coming so that he may have a grip on the land what if the seedgrain thou sowest springs green to die yellow year after year pera dittas oxeyes opened helplessly what if the river never returned the idea was too vast for him and yet it remained with him long after shunker had gone to sow the same seed of mischief in other minds he did it deftly taking care not to turn the screw too tightly at first lest he should bring down on himself the villagers final argument of the stick the reason given by the laird of inverawe for hanging the laird of inverie that he just didna like him has been given before now as fair cause for doing an unfortunate usurer to death with quarterstaves so shunker did not disturb primeval calm too rudely nevertheless as he paused for a night ere returning to faizapore in the empty house at saudaghur where kirpo had passed the months of ramus captivity he felt content with his labours he had started a stone of unpopularity on its travels which by and by would bring down an avalanche on his enemy as he lounged on the string bed set for coolness on the flat roof he told himself not without a measure of truth that sooner or later all his enemies perished ah if it were only as easy to keep those you loved in life as it was to drive those you hated down to death but it was not and the thought of frail sickly nuttu came as it often did to take the savour even from revenge the memory of deserted kirpos sonsthose strapping youngsters whom he had often seen playing on that very roofmade him groan and roll over on his fat stomach to consider the possibility of marrying yet another wife he had married so many only to find disappointment as his face came back disheartened to the unsympathetic stars which fought against him he started as if he had been shot for there was kirpo herself tall and menacing standing beside the bed the veil wrapped tightly round her body left her disfigured deathshead face visible dont be more of a coward than need be she said scornfully as the lala after shooting up like a jackinthebox began to sidle away from her his dangling legs swinging wildly in his efforts to move his fat form ive not come to beat the breath from thy carcase twill die soon enough never fear and just now there is a son to perform the obsequies there wont be one by and by the indifference of her voice and the aptness of her words to his own thoughts roused the lalas rage what dost want hag of a noseless one he shrieked shedevil baseborn not bad words lala she interrupted calmly ive had enough of them i want money im starving thou knowest it what else could i be starving the word rolled sweeter than any honey under shunkers tongue then starve away so thou thoughtest to trick meme how didst like the bangles kirpo dear the brave bangleshehe to his surprise the allusion failed to touch her instead of breaking into abuse she looked at him curiously drew her veil so as to hide all but her great dark eyes and squatted down as if for a chat on the ground opposite to him look here lala she said this is no matter for ill words tis business what is past is past im going to give thee a chance for the futurea last chance dost hear so ive come to say i am starving for six months i paid for my food in this very place paid for it in thy pleasure fair and square so far but now because of that pleasure ramu is in jail again and i am noseless then ramus people have taken his sonshai hai his beautiful sonsfrom me because of that pleasure is not that payment enough lala shall i starve also why not chuckled shunker i have no need of thee any more kirpo leaned forward with hand raised in warning her fierce eyes on his face have a care lala have a care it is the last chance thou dost not want me good i asked for naught to be taken i asked for something to be given not a paisa not a pai broke in the usurer brutally im glad of thy starvation im glad theyve taken away thy sons stop lala shrieked kirpo her calm gone her voice ringing with passion i did not say my sons i said ramus look shunker look i have another as she spoke she tore her veil asidein my arms lala is he not fair and strong for a two months babe would you not like to have him no no hands off no touching he is mine i say mine mine she sprang to her feet holding the baby high above his head exultantly he sat staring at it and trembled like a leaf kirpo he gasped give it to me by all the gods in heaven i will pay a peal of mocking laughter greeted the words bah now i have roused thee tis all a lie shunker all a lie only a trick of starving kirpos and yet somehow he favours thee as thou mightest have been before the grease came to spoil beauty for all that not like nuttu the sickly one nuttu will die this one will live wilt thou not hearts darling and delight she covered the babe with a storm of passionate kisses kirpo by all the torments of hell urged shunker what art there already not so fast lala not so fast wait till i bring this babe to curse thy pyre to spit on thy ashesthy sonthy son it is a lie burst in the wretched man beside himself with doubt certainty and desire he is not mine well said shunker well said laughed kirpo triumphantly growing calmer with her evident success he is not thine he is mine she folded her veil round the sleeping child with a flourish as if to emphasise her words and stepped backwards as she stood there sombre malignant the winged thoughts flew through shunkers brain there is strictly speaking no possible divorce no remarriage for the hindu but if ramu could be got out of the way he shunker das might pose as a social reformer it was a fine idea or he mighta thousand suggestions found expression in the covetous hands he stretched towards his victim kirpo listen i will not listen i gave the chance for the childs sake now kirpo take what thou likest i will take what i like lala that is revenge before he could say another word she had turned her back on him and ere he could rise to stop her was down the narrow stair and out into the street with her precious burden so lala shunker das lay down and cried because not one of the women his wealth had bought could bear him a son save this kirpo whom he had betrayed fool that he was not to have seen she must have some deep move on hand ere she came to beg of him revenge he had dreamt of that himself but what was his poor spite to this devilish malice he tried to remember that want was a hard master that kirpos own people came from beyond the fourth river and were therefore useless to her as a refuge that it was womans way to bark more than bite in his heart of hearts he knew that she had said truly when she offered him his last chance and as a matter of fact while he sat trying to recover confidence on the edge of his bed kirpo and the baby with many a swing of the full skirts as she strode along were making their way direct to the enemys camp in other words to john rabys new factory the sahib had interfered on her behalf once and he hated shunker he could give her coolies work on the new dam and in return she could give him valuable information as to the usurers little game the lala had had his chance partly for the sake of comfort partly for the sake of the child now she would devote herself to revenge and gain a living at the same time of all this however belle was profoundly ignorant nor did kirpo say more to her new master than was necessary to show a sound conceivable reason for her professions of attachment to his cause john raby laughed when he heard of his enemys vows of vengeance but he was wise enough to see the prospect of unpopularity with his poorer neighbours and the advisability of being prepared for opposition i hope you dont mind marsden he said a day or two before the major left but ive been treating with that truculent rascal of yours afzul hes coming back to india he says next cold weather on business or something ive asked him to bring me a gang of navvies and do overseer himself till next rainy season those hillmen work like englishmen and the new dam will require constant care until it solidifies besides i believe in mercenaries a bandit is always handy and afzul consented asked philip in surprise jumped at it there is no one like the noble savage for turning an honest penny when he can and i own to tempting him pretty stiffly we may want that sort of fellow by and by to keep things going i am surprised at afzul for all that continued philip thoughtfully i wonder what he means devotion to you laughed the other you should have heard him and you too belle he laid the butter on thick about your capabilities as a nurse she looked up quickly i suppose its ungrateful but i dont like that man he always seems to have something in his mind that i cant get hold of he is very intelligent replied her husband with a shrug of his shoulders and took quite an interest in the business i assure you he asked a lot of questions and to tell the truth i think a thoroughly devoted rascal is the most useful thing in creation so i hope he is one philip laughed shall i leave my interests in his hands belle or in yours leave them to me my dear fellow interrupted john belle doesnt understand business chapter xxi perhaps her husband was right in saying belle did not understand business at any rate she had little to do with it in the uneventful months which followed it was a dry hot year bringing no respite of rain to the long weary hours it brought plenty of work however to john raby who was up with the dawn and never seemed to tire or flag in his unceasing pursuit of success in good sooth as belle confessed to herself philip could have found no better custodian for his money and this knowledge was a great consolationhow great she scarcely realised until something came to disturb it she was writing to philip marsden one day when john entered the room she rose hastily even though she felt vexed with herself for doing so why should she not write as a matter of fact she spent a considerable portion of her time over these letters sometimes she would resolutely put pen and paper away and set to work to sew every possible button on johns undergarments or perform some other virtuous domestic duty only to find when all was done that leisure still stared her in the face for the leisure of a long hotweather day in an outstation may be compared to that of a solitary cell their nearest neighbours were twenty miles away and belles experiment of having her youngest and most goodnatured stepsister on a visit had ended in disastrous failure the girl had cried for three days consecutively out of sheer low spirits it was all very well she said plaintively when one was married and got something by it but what was the use of being miserable before there was any necessity for it and when one couldnt even scold the servants to amuse ones self by and by when charlie allsop got his step she would no doubt have to put up with jungle life for a time but now her dearest belle must excuse her maud had written such a description of the dress she was going to wear at the masonic ball and really now that mabel was married to her widower and charlies schooling paid for by john they got on splendidly in the little house why shouldnt belle go back to missouri with her and take rooms at scotts hotel they would have such fun but though her husband gave her full leave to do as she liked belle shook her head over this tempting offer she felt that she could not afford to neglect the tithes of mint and cummin the jots and tittles of the law she must at any rate make offering of what she had to give so she stayed at home and blushed violently when she rose from her desk writing to marsden said john carelessly i thought you might be and i wanted you just to give him a hint or two about the business it would come naturally from you and save surprise the fact is there has been a lot of unforeseen expense then the firm in calcutta to which i sent my first batch of stuff has failed altogether i shant be able to spare any interest on the money this year no interest belle could only echo his words stupidly for the very idea of such a contingency had never entered her head and the fact seemed to bring back all the old sickening dislike to the situation well he looked at her with the expression of distasteful patience which always came to his face when awaiting a remonstrance but none followed she was so absorbed in the fresh shame to her of this failure that she could think of nothing else of course it is a pity he went on somewhat mollified by her silence but marsden isnt a fool he knows one has generally to wait for a return indeed i consider it lucky we have not to borrow i wish you wouldnt look so tragic over it belle we are not ruined far from it only for the present we have to live on our capital belles face brightened could we not pay the interest out of capital too john her husband burst out laughing as he threw himself into an easy chair upon my soul for utter incapacity to understand even the morals of business commend me to a really good woman interest out of capital we are not a swindling company belle we might pay it out of your own savings john she urged knowing how hopeless it would be to argue transference from one budgethead to another and consequent cooking of accounts no my dear i left that system of bookkeeping behind me when i quitted government service marsden must go without his interest for the present he has very good pay and the loss is quite temporary in any circumstances the returns would have been unfavourable for this year owing to the drought why even with the aid of the dam i have scarcely had enough water for a quarter of the acreage i intend to have next season his voice tailed off into indifference as his attention became concentrated in a paper he had taken up and there was an end of the matter so far as he was concerned pens ink and paper had lost their attraction for belle that day and for many days after indeed it was not until the knowledge that her long silence would cause anxiety that she faced the task of finishing her letter to major marsden the very certainty that he would care little for the absence of the promised dividend and be quite ready to accept her husbands views on the matter made it seem all the more hard for her and though she determined to leave the proper person to tell the unwelcome news she found herself hampered on all sides by her own knowledge even remarks on the dryness of the weather savoured of an attempt at excuse and for the first time she felt glad to write her signature at the bottom of the page when it was done she leant her head over her crossed arms in a sudden rush of weariness and thought how different it would have been if she could have met philip on equal terms if they could have told each other the truth in all things theoretically it was all very well to say that the money had nothing to do with the position but practically she could not get rid of the conviction that she and john were preying on a mans sense of honour or worse on his affections it was no use telling herself she was despicable in having such thoughts that setting love aside friendship itself excluded the question of give or take as a matter of fact philip did give her all he had and he tookwhat did he not take she cowered before that the worst question of all she could not escape from the haunting sense of wrong which seemed to sap the strength of her selfrespect and back through all her heartburnings came the one foolish fancy that if she could only have met philip with the money or even a decent five per cent interest on it in her hand she could have looked into his face with clear unshadowed eyes and now how was she to meet him when there was not even a dividend philip meanwhile was undergoing no qualms on the contrary he was having a very good time to begin with he was in command of the regiment and drawing as john raby said excellent pay furthermore he was enjoying as was inevitable the return to health and life after eighteen months of death to all pleasure lastly his conscience was absolutely at rest in regard to belle he would have been more or less than human had he not been aware that he had behaved as well as a man could in very trying circumstances in fact he was a little complacent over what had been so far a very simple and easy solution of a problem which other people held to be insoluble he sent belle the last new books and wrote her kind brotherly letters and thought of her as the best friend he had and always with the same underlying consciousness of pure virtue he forgot however that poor belle stood in a very different position one in which calm peace was wellnigh impossible so as her letters became less frequent and less frank he began to puzzle somewhat captiously over the cause finally he hinted at an explanation and receiving nothing but jesting replies he took ten days leave and went down to saudaghur ostensibly to settle the half yearly accounts for both john and he found a sort of solemn refuge from the truth in the observance so far as was possible of strict business relations it gave him quite a shock to find how much change his few months absence had wrought the bare deserted house where belle had nursed him back to life and where he and she had spent so many days forgetful of the workaday world content in a kindly constant companionship was now a luxurious house hedged about by conventionalities the drawingroom where his sofa had reigned supreme was full of bricabrac tables and heaven knows what obstacles through which a man had to thread his way like a performing ape belle herself despite her kind face and soft voice was no longer the caretaker full of sympathy she was his hostess his friend but also another mans wife a fact of which she took care to remind him by saying she was glad he had come in time to celebrate the anniversary of her weddingday on the morrow despite his theories philip did not like the change it vexed him too that she should look pale and worried when he had really done all all that an honest man could do to smooth her path had he not even kept away for five whole months so he was decidedly out of humour when coming from a long spell of business with john in the office he found her alone for the first time she was standing by the fireplace in the drawingroom and he made his way towards her intent on words but she forestalled him well he has told you about it i supposethat there is no dividend she said defiantly and as she spoke she crushed the withered roses she had been removing from a vase and flung them on to the smouldering embers he looked at her in surprise i scarcely expected one oh belle he continued hotly is it that did you think could you think i would care she gave a little hard laugh how stupid you are of course you dont mind cant you see it is thatwhich hurts cant you understand it is thatyour kindnesswhich must hurtalways the dead leaves had caught fire and flamed up throwing a glare of light on both their faces it seemed to light up their hearts also perhaps she had not meant to say so much yet now that she had said it she stood gracefully upright looking him in the eyes reckless ready for anything the sight of her brought home to philip what he had forgotten before that in this problem of his he had not to do with one factor but with two and one of them a woman not a passionate one it is true but a woman to whom sentiment and emotion were more than reason a woman whose very innocence left her confused and helpless uncertain of her own foothold and unable to draw the hardandfast line between good and evil without which she felt lost in a wilderness of wrong the recognition startled him but at the same time aroused his combativeness i confess i dont see why it should he said rather coldly surely i have a perfect right to setother things before money and it is wrong shall i give you a copybook so that you may write the sentiment down for future reference philip she interrupted swiftly copybook maxims about right and wrong are so useful when one has lost the way arent they for myself i am tired of themdead tireddead tired of everything and once again with a gesture of utter weariness she leant against the mantelpiece her head upon her crossed arms his hands clenched as if to hold something tighter something that seemed slipping from him i am sorry he said huskily is it my fault she flamed round upon him yea it is your fault all your fault why did you ever leave me that money the truth and the unfairness of her words bit deep it was why did you come back to take it away when we first met he retorted in rising anger i told you then i had a right to live if i chose i tell you now i will take the money back if you choose i will do it today if you like it is only lent i can give notice what difference will it make now she went on recklessly will it undo the mischief your legacy did it all it made john she broke off suddenly a look of terror came to her eyes and she turned away well i am waiting to hear it made john nothing she said in a low voice what is the good it is all past but i have a right to know i will know belle what wrong did my legacy do you what wrong of which i know nothing let me see your facei must see it he bent over her almost rough in his impatience at the fine filmy threads of overwrought feeling which seeming so petty to a man yet have the knack of tying him hand and foot what did she mean though they had never talked of such things the fact that her legacy had decided johns choice could be no novelty even to her a woman who had money must always know it would enhance her other charms then suddenly a hitherto unappreciated fact recurred to himif this was her weddingday she must have been married very soonthe memory of a marble summerhouse in a peach garden with his will on the table and john standing by flashed upon him making the passionate blood leap up in resentment belle he cried imperiously did hedid you know have you known he paused his anger yielding to pain had she known this incredible baseness all these weary months those months during which he had been priding himself on his own forbearance and she had said nothing yet she was right for if once this thing were made clear between them what barrier would remain why should they guard the honour of a man who had himself betrayed it in the silence which ensued it was lucky for them both that the room was full of memories of her kind touch soothing his restless pain so the desire to give something back in kind came uppermost is there nothing i can do he said at last moving aside and standing square and steady nothing i can say or do to make it easier for you if you could forget he shook his head i will go away if you like though i dont see why i should then it would only be giving up one thing more to please me she answered with a little sad smile why should you give up anything when i can givenothing ah philip philip if you had only taken poor dicks will and were free to goif you chose he frowned moodily i should not choose so it would make no difference except that you think there would be one i cannot see it as for the will im afraid it is hopeless but if you like i can take leave and try afzul might come with me if i like she echoed in despair if i like it always comes back to that the slow tears overflowing her tired eyes cut him to the quick though in sober truth he thought them needless it mustseeing that i love you why should you shrink from the truth belle great heavens what have you or i done that we should be ashamed of ourselves dont lets speak of it philip she cried in a sort of terror it is all my fault i know but i cannot help it it is no use saying i am wrong everything is wrong from beginning to end and though he fretted and fumed argued and appealed nothing he could say sufficed to reassure her rightly or wrongly she could not view the situation as he viewed it she was galled and chafed on every side nor could he fail to see during the next four days that his presence only brought her additional misery she seemed unable to take anything naturally and she shrank equally from seeming to avoid being alone with him or from being alone yet with true womanly inconsequence she shrank most of all when he told her that he had made up his mind to go and not to return until she sent for him they were walking up and down the new dam which curved across a bend in the sandy reach waiting for her husband who with afzul and his gang of bandits was busy seeing to a strengthening of the side nearest the river a red sun was setting over the jagged purple shadow of the suleiman hills and flaring on the still pools of water below the embankment i am driving you away she said despondently you cannot even look after your own business because of me then his patience gave way damn the business he cried heartily and walked along beside her kicking the little clods from his path before turning to her apologetically i beg your pardon belle but it is a little trying let us hope the business will be successfully dammed and then according to john i shall get my money back in two years so cheer up freedom is beneath your feet just below them measuring up earthwork stood john raby and afzul khan as they passed the latter looked up salaaming with broad grins i wonder if he will take her away soon was his thought i wish he would then i could get rid of the paper and be off home by summer with raby sahibs rupees in my pocket what is he waiting for she likes him and raby sahib would be quite content with the money john looked up too and nodded dont wait for me good people i have to go over to the further end you neednt keep tea for me belle i prefer a whiskeypeg ta ta and as they moved off their figures showing dark against the red sky he looked after them saying to himself that the major could not complain one way and another he got his moneys worth your husband works too hard belle said philip you should persuade him to take it easier he is so anxious to make it a success she replied quickly so are we all retorted philip cynically we ought to manage it between us somehow as they passed the coolies huts a big strapping woman with her face hidden in her veil came out and salaamed who is that asked philip at once the last few days had brought him a curious dissatisfaction with belles surroundings despite the luxurious home she seemed out of keeping with afzul and his bandits the tagrag and bobtail of squalid coolies swarming about the place and the stolid indifference of the peasants beyond the factory a protegee of johns he got her out of trouble somewhere he says he has the biggest lot of miscreants on the frontier on his works they dont look much i must allow but this woman seems to like me she has such a jolly baby i had to doctor it last week hows nuttu today kirpo the woman grinning opened her veil and displayed a sleeping child isnt he pretty philip said belle softly and see they have pierced his nose and ears like a girls for luck i suppose may god spare him to manhood prefaced philip piously in native fashion before he asked the mother if it were not so she shook her head no protector of the poor all my boys are healthy he is called nuttu so that as he thrives some one else of the same name may dwindle and pine that is why she hugged the baby to her with an odd smile she could not have meant that there was really another child whose death she desired said belle as they went on i would not answer for it if i were you they are a queer people by jove how that woman does hate some one im glad it isnt you belle and kirpo looking after them was saying in her turn that they were very queer people if he was her lover why did the mem look so unhappy the sahib logue did not cut off their wives noses or put them in prison so what did it matter truly those two were compassed about by a strange cloud of witnesses as they strolled homewards perhaps the civilised world would have judged them as harshly but no tribunal human or divine could have judged belle more harshly than she did herself and herein lay all the trouble she could not accept facts and make the best of them john raby coming in later found the two reading solemnly one on either side of the fire and told them they were horribly unsociable i couldnt get away before he said afzul wanted a days leave and i had to measure up before he started has he gone already im sorry remarked philip i wished to see him before i leave tomorrow tomorrow john raby looked from one to another have you been quarrelling and poor belle with the necessity for derisive denial before her felt more than ever that she was on the broad path leading to destruction i am sorry i have to go said philip with perfect truth but i really am of no use here chapter xxii could philip marsden have seen into mahomed lateefs old tower about the time he was leaving nilgunj his regrets might have had a still more truthful ring and belle might have been saved from once more adding to the difficulties of her own lot and as it were making a stumblingblock of her own good intentions for in that case major marsden would have stopped another day in order to see his old friend and in the course of conversation would have heard things which might have changed the current of subsequent events but fate decreed otherwise more than once seeing the daily increasing poverty of his patron afzul khan had suggested an appeal to the major as one sure to do something for the father of the man who had stood between him and death but the stubborn old malcontent had lumped the whole western creation in his category of ingrates the past is past he would say angrily i will not even ask justice from one of them and according to thy tales marsden sahib has taken to trade and leagued himself with raby who is no better than a buniahno better than shunker bahadur whom god smite to hell hast heard what they are doing down yonder pera ditta was here last week saying his land was to be sold because he could not pay and how could he pay when water never came and how could water come when strangers enter and build dams without let or hindrance afzul frowned true father and tis about that dam i would have you speak not look you that it did harm this year twas gods fault not rabys that the river failed though folk will not have it so and next year even the dam will do good not harm if a sluice be put in it such as they have north in the big canals look you raby is no fool before allah he is wise and he offered to put one so that the water would run every year right away to the south if the people would promise him to grow indigo and dig part of the channel but shunker or god knows who hath stuffed their ears and they will not listen so raby means the pigheaded fools shall learn reason i blame him not but that is no cause why you should starve and starve you must if the river does not come i will starve sooner than beg and the child that was an argument which invariably brought the discussion to a close in vehement objections to interference and loudvoiced assertions of independence nevertheless afzul returned to the charge again and again moved to insistence by a personal desire to be free from the necessity of eking out the expenses of the household he gave cheerfully enough to the women on the sly lest the old martinet should wring his neck for the impertinence but for all that he wanted to be free to go his own ways when summer came if the sluice were made and a constant supply of water insured the old man and the women would at least escape starvation john raby who had found the pathan singularly intelligent and with some knowledge of levelling learnt from poor dick had so far given him confidence that he knew what ought to be done but he was not well enough up in the whole matter to understand that his master had considerable excuse for refusing to do it as a matter of fact the dam had been constructed with great care so as to avoid cutting off the water supply from the neighbouring villages where the floods came with fair regularity john raby had even spent money in improving their chances on certain conditions about indigo which he well knew would eventually be of enormous benefit to the people themselves in regard to those further afield he had made a very fair proposal which mainly owing to shunkers machinations they had rejected briefly he had offered a constant supply of water at the price of a little labour and a few reasonable concessions when they refused his terms he smiled and went on building his dam up to a certain floodpoint he knew it would be an obstruction beyond that the river would still find its way he only enlarged the cycle of floodless years but on this fact he counted for eventual submission as for the owners of the few small holdings between the dam and the basin of alluvial soil tilled by these pigheaded hindus he was sorry for them but as it was quite impossible for him to ensure a watersupply without giving it beyond their best plan would be to exert their influence towards a reasonable solution of the difficulty in a matter like this he was not a man to swerve a hairs breadth from his own plan for the sake of anybody he conceived that he had a perfect right to do as he chose and if others disputed his action they could go to law about it only long before the vexed question of the frequency of flood in past years could be decided one way or the other he felt certain that the sight of the surrounding prosperity would have overcome all opposition afzul khan however only half in the secret believed that the sluicegate might be made by an appeal to major marsden and when the latter came to the factory took a days leave on purpose to rouse the old khan to action it being quite hopeless to expect him to ask a favour of john raby of whom he never spoke save with a gibe perhaps the thought of seeing a familiar face influenced the old man for when the argument reached its usual climax of and the child khan sahib what of the child he gave a fierce sigh and pressing the boy who was sitting on his knee closer to his heart muttered impatiently what is the pride of a man before the hunger of a child i will go so hold thy devil of a tongue and let us have peace afterwards however when afzul with solemn satisfaction at his victory was polishing up the old warriors sword mahomed lateef became restive again i know not that i will go he owes me somewhat tis true and in past time i thought him just but i like not this talk of trade tis not a soldiers task the pathan leaning over the shining blade breathed on it to test its lustre wah khan sahib alls fair in love and war men do much for the sake of a woman without tarnishing their honour longer than my breath lingers on good steel marsden sahib did it for love of the mem look you the old man scowled i like not that either let him choose the one or the other and use his sword to keep his choice afzul smiled cunningly wait a while khan sahib wait a while the fowler must have time to lure his bird and some women have cold hearts she hath a heart of ice yea i will go afzul and i will tell him of murghub ahmad and how she bore false witness not so thou wilt ask for water and get thy revenge safe in thy pocket it lies heavy on an empty stomach so they borrowed a pinknosed pony from the pleaders father in the next village and with his little grandson arrayed in huge turban and tarnished tinsel coatee disposed in front of the highpeaked saddle khan mahomed lateef khan set off to see the major and plead the childs cause a picturesque group they made as they passed along the sandy ways and treeless stretches of hard sunbaked soil afzul leading the pony the boy laughing and clapping his hands at the novelty the old soldiers white beard showing whiter than ever against the childs dark curls fatma and haiyat standing outside recklessly unveiled to shriek parting blessings and injunctions and lo after all these preparations after all this screwing up of courage and letting down of pride the major had gone afzul could scarcely believe his ears gone and he had been reckoning on giving certain hints about dicks will which might have served to bring matters to a crisis he returned to the hut where he had left the khan and his grandson while he went to arrange for an interview and tried to persuade mahomed lateef not to allow his journey to go for nothing but to prefer his request to raby sahib himself he might even write a petition and demand that it should be sent on to the major if pride forbade asking a favour of the former afzul might as well have urged the old man to wear patentleather shoes or perform any other such abomination of desolation am i a baboo that i should cringe and beg he answered wrathfully the major is a soldier and knows what it means to stave a blow from a comrades head tis but defending your own in the future but this man he would talk of rupees and i have none to give let it be fool i will stop the night here as was arranged since the child seems tired tomorrow we can return i am not so far through that a days journey will kill me so from the recesses of the windowless shanty he watched john raby passing back to the house when the days work was done then he went forth in the twilight and prowled about the new factory noting the unmistakable signs of masterful energy with a curious mixture of admiration and contempt as thou sayest he is a man and no mere moneybag like shunker was his final comment come little one say thy evening petition and let me roll thee in thy quilt for thine eyes are heavy the child already half asleep slid from his grandfathers knee and standing stretched his little hands skywards god bring justice to those who brought my father injustice he murmured drowsily a savage exultation came to the old face looking down on the curves and dimples ameen ameen justice that is all we seek come light of mine eyes and god give thee many wakenings thereafter the two men sat silent waiting for sleep to come to the child and it came but not for long perhaps in less careful hands the boy had taken chill perhaps afzuls more sumptuous fare was the exciting cause anyhow a few hours afterwards kirpo roused by the helpless men from the deathlike slumber of the domesticated savage found little hussan ahmad struggling for breath in his grandfathers arms a prey to spasmodic croup of course she had not the remotest idea what was the matter or what was to be done she could but take the child to her capacious bosom and add to the general alarm by shrill sympathy it was a fitthe dear one would diehai haisome one had bewitched it then suddenly an inspiration seized her the mem let them send for the mem but last week her own boy had had the gripes until the mem came with a little bottle and cured him hai hai the darling was choking send for the mem if they would not have him die before their eyes afzul looked at the grandfather interrogatively pride fear resentment and love fought hard for the mastery she will not come she hath a heart of ice quavered the old voice seeking for excuse and escape from responsibility who can count on a woman but death is sure and she is wise in such ways i know say khan sahib shall i go there was an instants pause broken by the childs hoarse crow then the faith of a lifetime spoke go it is kismet give her the chance it is gods will to give it she may not come and then but ten minutes after belle raby in her soft white evening dress had the struggling child in her arms and reassuring words on her lips afzul khan too held a bottle and a teaspoon whereat kirpos face broadened to content have no fear master she whispered in the old mans ear tis the same one i swear it a charm a potent charm most englishwomen in india gain some knowledge of doctoring not only from necessity but from the neighbourliness which turns them into nurses where in england they would be content with kind inquiries and though croup is comparatively rare among the native children belle had seen it treated among english ones such knowledge a medicinechest and common sense seem and indeed often act like magic to the ignorant eyes helplessly watching their loved ones fight for life the old mohammedan stood aside bolt upright as if on parade a prey to dull regrets and keen joy as belles kind voice conjured up endless things beyond the thought or comprehension even of the childs mother had she been there hot water a bath fetched from somewhere in the dark beyond the feeble glimmer of light in which those bare white arms gleamed about the childs brown body ice a soft white blanket within the folds of which peace seemed to come to the struggling limbs till sleep actually claimed the child again he is all right now said belle smiling keep him in your arms kirpo and give him plenty of air i will come tomorrow and see him again afzul have you the lantern she stooda strange figure in that mudfloored mudroofed hovelfastening the silver clasp of her fur cloak with slim fingers sparkling with jewels a figure more suitable to some gay gathering on the other side of the world then from the darkness into the ring of light where she stood stepped another figure a tall old man made taller by the hightwined green turban proclaiming him a past pilgrim to the great shrine of warriors a man with his sons medals on a threadbare velvet coat and a sharp curved sword held like a sacrament in his outstretched palms huzoor he said bowing his proud old head all the conflicting emotions of the past hour had concentrated themselves to this words either of gratitude or blame were beyond him god knows which given opportunity of calm thought he might have offered but so taken by surprise carried beyond his own personal interests by admiration he gave in the true old fighting instinct which dies hard amongst the mohammedans his allegiance to what was brave and capable huzoor the english girl had learnt enough of native customs to know her part those slim white fingers lingered an instant on the cold steel and her bright eyes smiled up into the old mans face the gift is not mine but yours perhaps it was the faculty of just admiration is a great possession she found her husband still smoking cigarettes over a french novel by george belle he said you look awfully nice that sort of thing suits you down to the ground you were born to be a lady bountiful and send social problems to sleep with sentiment by the way do you know who the little beggar is i asked the khansaman he is the son of that man murghub ahmad who was transported his grandfather is living on the ancestral estate about ten miles down the old nullah im precious glad marsden didnt find him out or he would have been bothering me to do something for the old fellow and i havent time just now for charity i leave that to you my dear it suits youas i remarked just nowdown to the ground belle who had turned very pale said nothing but she seemed to feel the chill of the cold steel at her fingertips she understood better what that offering had meant and sentiment or no sentiment something rose in her throat and kept her silent next morning according to promise she went over to the huts again the dew shone on the flowers as she crossed the garden an indescribable freshness was in the air the child but newly aroused from a sweet sleep was still surrounded by the white blanket in the midst of which he sat cuddled up rubbing his eyes and yawning afzul was smiling at the door the grandfather calmed into stern politeness standing by the bed rise o hussan ahmad he said to the child after a few words of inquiry and reply rise and say thy thanks to the mem for her kindness they are due they are justly due still drowsy and mindful only of an accustomed order the boy stretched his chubby little arms skyward may god bring justice to those who brought injustice to my father khan mahomed lateef khan started as if he had been shot and his right hand fell sharply on the childs shoulder then wandered to his swordhilt it is fate he muttered gloomily out of his own mouth i am rebuked belles heart gave a great throb of anger and pain she had lain awake piecing the stray threads of the story together till it had seemed to her a sad yet beautiful pattern on the web of life and now why do you say that she asked gently of the child as if he were the only person present he looked at her fearlessly i say it morning and evening listen may god bring justice to those who brought injustice to my father the eyes of those two men watching her were like spurs to her high spirit listen she said i will say it too may god bring justice to those who brought injustice to your father the eyes fell as she passed out without another word by the god who made me swore the old soldier she is a brave one and she hath my sword remember that afzul if the time should ever come my sword at least is for her and hers for the rest the child has spoken afzul smiled grimly he was beginning to see what those two brave ones fancied in the palefaced mem she was too good for raby sahib with his rupees he decided yet women are always influenced by wealth perhaps the thought of what she would leave behind hindered her from following the major if so a little reverse in the business might be beneficial anyhow and come what may he must get rid of that cursed blue envelope ere summer opened the passes for homesick footsteps even if he had to leave it behind him unconditionally he must do so since by that time he would have money saved to last for an idle year or two chapter xxiii some ten days after this john raby came from the office into the drawingroom with a letter in his hand and vexation on his face upon my word belle he began you have a most unfortunate turn for philanthropy as i always told you ive no doubt your doctoring that little croupy imp suggested the idea that we were made up of benevolence sentiment my dear child is the devil in business what is it now john she asked with an effort at lightness for all that her tone made him raise his eyebrows impatiently there is no accounting for the jar which comes at times between two natures especially when circumstances are emphasising their respective individualities this was the case between belle and her husband her conscientiousness being hypersensitised by constant selfblame and his being dulled by the keen desire to triumph over all opposition only that bankrupt old warrior appealing through marsden to the firm for an annual supply of water from my dam a cool request isnt it and marsden of course being sentimental as you are hopes it will be done all i can say is that it is lucky he and you have me to look after your interests but if it could be done my dear child dont you think id have done it had the thing been possible without detriment to us i dont suppose marsden thought of it in that light but he ought to have done so i have my faults no doubt but im not an ogre i wish it had been possible so do i but it isnt therefore if you dont mind i hope you will refrain from arousing philips benevolence more than you can help i mean by allusions to the old man and the child they are a most picturesque couple of course but if sentiment is to come in i may as well throw up the whole business for mind you belle it is just as well you should know that the factory is bound to be unpopular at first unpopular why asked belle in surprise i thought you said it would improve the condition of the people immensely after a time however it is no use discussing it i shall write to marsden and saywell i shall say chiefly that i also am filled with pious and benevolent intentions but that i desire a free hand meanwhile as i see from philips letter that afzul has been priming you with pity which you have been handing on i wish you wouldnt give the old man as much money as you like of course but dont egg my partner on to socialism theres a good girl he looked very bright and handsome as he bent over and kissed her do you know belle he said laughingly you are the most transparent fraud in creation i believe you set the old man on to marsden now didnt you she flushed scarlet i only told afzul when he was speaking of it that the best way was to write a petition and philip was an old friend just so but we dont want old friends or new ones either to interfere im manager of this factory and i intend to manage it my own way do you mean without consulting philips wishes he turned round on her sharply as he was leaving the room that is about it he knows nothing of business and should be glad to have some one to act for him who does there was as usual so much sound common sense in her husbands words that belle tried to crush down the dissatisfaction she could not help feeling at the idea of philip being made responsible for actions of which he might know nothing after all had it really come to this that she did not trust her husband to behave uprightly the thought was poison to all peace and she thrust it aside in horror at its very appearance yet a new element of trouble had entered into life and she found herself quite unconsciously keeping ears and eyes open for things which she had previously ignored this did not escape her husbands keen sight and in his light halfserious way he rallied her on this newlydeveloped interest in the business the fact was they were beginning to understand each other too well and now and again a tone came into johns voice which sent the blood to her heart in a throb of fear and made her grovel positively grovel before her ideal of wifely duty then her husband would recover his careless goodnature and the household run so smoothly that even belles highstrung nerves scarcely felt a jolt so the spring came bringing to the garden a rush of blossom wellnigh impossible of description to those accustomed to slow northern lands belle could have picked clothesbaskets full of marechal niel roses from the bushes and yet have left them burdened with great yellow cups the pomegranates glowed with a scarlet positively dazzling to the eyes the gardenias were all too strongly scented the bees and butterflies drugged themselves with honey from the wild tangle of overgrown overblown annuals which forgetting their trim english habit usurped the very paths by thickets of mignonette sweet pea dianthus and a host of other familiar flowers belle walking round her domain in the early morning when the nightly gift of dew still lay on the leaves used to wonder how serpents could creep into such a paradise the very isolation of the life had an irresistible charm what was the use of worrying about ideas where was the good of fretting over the mischances of that world which lay beyond this calm retreat suddenly however that world asserted its existence she had still kept up her habit of morning rides and though her husband was now up with the dawn he was far too much absorbed in his work to accompany her save when business sent him beyond his own boundaries even then she began to notice his excuses for escaping her companionship and when in her drowsy content she went so far as to express a halfjesting remonstrance he would reply in the same tone that he had no intention of slaving forever and that this was his working day by and by when he had turned marsden adrift and could have the whole thing to himselfwhy he meant to have it and enjoy it meanwhile it was much pleasanter for her to ride along the river bank and through the inundation lands than in the dust southwards where his business took him so often but this level expanse of bare fruitless soil had an attraction for belle and one day losing her way on it she made for the landmark of a village on the horizon and thus found herself considerably beyond her usual distance from home it was a village with poverty and sloth written on the blistered rainmarked mud walls and in the absence of fuelheaps and thornenclosures a sorry forsaken spot it was despite the swarm of lowbredlooking brats who came out to stare at her as she rode at a foots pace through the widest lane a woman stood slouching at the entrance to a courtyard and belle pausing asked her the way to nilgunj the scowl on the face raised to hers startled her so did the words are you rabys mem her answering assent met a rude reception in the curt recommendation to find the way herself accompanied by a sudden closing of the door then came a shrill clamour of voices from within and one by one over the alley walls dark disapproving faces full of angry curiosity the display of hostility might have gone no further if her horse restive at being checked and no doubt disliking the crowd of children following close on its heels had not sidled and backed putting the young imps to hustling flight this was naturally the signal for shrieks and abuse from the mothers and though a touch of the whip recalled her beast to duty humanity was not so reasonable a little ragamuffin took up a piece of dirt and threw it after her the others approved and though fear of her horses heels kept the little arms at a comparatively safe distance belle raby had nevertheless to submit to the indignity of riding through the village pursued by pelting urchins and by no means pleasant abuse from over the walls her indignation was greater than her fear or even than her surprise and the scornful glance with which she met the angry eyes on a level with her own silenced more than one of the tongues but for a sense that it would have been undignified she would dearly have loved to dismount seize one of the ringleaders and administer summary justice the possible meaning of this unusual reception did not strike her until emerging from the village still pursued by her tormentors she came straight upon her husband his look as he recognised the position filled her with alarm and there was something in it of such absolutely uncontrolled passion and hatred that it flashed upon her that he at least must have good reason to understand the scene john dont do anything please dont she cried as he threw himself from his horse they are only children im not going to run after those little demons if you mean that he replied giving her the reins of his mount to hold but they have parents i suppose ill be back in a moment dont be afraid belle they are curs every one of them but they shall pay for this in more ways than one he came out five minutes afterwards followed by a protesting and most venerable looking pantaloon representative of that past age in which a white face was verily a sign of kingship he took no notice of the lavish appeals and apologies but putting his notebook in his pocket remounted im sorry you came this way he said as they rode off but as i often say you have a faculty for getting into mischief which is surprising in such an eminently virtuous person as you are belle however you mustnt do it again in fact i should prefer your keeping to my land for the next two or three months belle given time to think had lost much of her courage in dismay at this most unexpected insight into the world beyond her gates could such a state of affairs be necessary why she began my dear child dont ask me why i cant supply reason to these pigheaded brutes and dont for goodness sake make a fuss over it and bring marsdens softheartedness down on me just when i need to have a free hand i told you i should be unpopular and i am that is the long and short of it more unpopular than need be for somehow the people have got an idea that i could help if i chose why didnt marsden put their appeals in the waste paper basket as i do instead of raising hopes by referring to me has he been referring to you her husband looked at her and laughed im not going to give myself away in confidence as i said before im awfully sorry you came out this way and chanced on that village it is the worst about here for all that there is no need for any anxiety i assure you afzul and his bandits are worth a hundred of these curs and once the people see i am a man of my word they will come in sharp enough but if philip bother philip he is a trump of course but i think he has mixed himself up a little too much in this business i shall be glad when he is out of it surely if you were to explain my dear belle explanation is nothing to demonstration in six weeks time when the first flood comes i shall prove myself right and waltz in hands down an easy winner that is to say if nobody fouls me now out of goodness and righteousness and all charitableness it was one thing to be told this another to find comfort in it and as the days passed belle grew more and more uneasy she felt sure all could not be fair and square that there must be some antagonistic element at work to make the unpopularity so intense perhaps because she watched for it so keenly it seemed to her that discontent showed itself more and more freely on the faces of the people she did meet in her now limited walks one evening she had a bad five minutes listening to a row in the coolies quarters with her husbands clear voice dominating the clamour she was still pale when he came whistling through the garden as if nothing had happened it was only he said a war of words between kirpo and afzul there had always been a jealousy between them the latter declaring that such a hideous female was not worthy to touch any mans bread for the former had risen by favour from mere cooliedom to act as cook for a gang of hindu workers the woman retorting that the hillmen were no better than pirates ready despite their professions of horror at meats prepared by idolaters to steal her supplies if her back was turned afzul had of late been growing idle and uppish so john had sided with kirpo in this particular dispute i think kirpo is rather uppish too replied belle i heard her ordering some of the men about as if she was their mistress her husband laughed easily just like a native the fact being that kirpo is useful to me at present by giving me information i can rely upon and she presumes on the fact when the floods have come i shall be able to dispense with herwith a variety of things in fact i shall not be sorry i hate being beholden to people belle bent her head over her work and sewed faster i dont like afzul i dont like kirpo and i like the unpopularity least of all oh john could you not give way a little i am sure philip now look here belle i said just now that i hated being beholden to any one and you yourself made enough todo when i borrowed this money from marsden and youve fussed and worried about it ever since because you think he consented for your sake perhaps he did and so i mean to show him he should have consented for his own i call that a laudable ambition which should satisfy your pride now in my opinion the only road to success lies my way that i think should settle the matter once and for all of course i am not infallible but unless something very unexpected turns up you will be laughing at your own fears this time two months now as i told kirpo to come up to the office as soon as it was dark let me get some peace and quiet first i think haydn would suit me today there is no forced sentiment in him jolly old chap so belle played haydn and john dozed in his chair till the darkness settled deep enough to hide kirpo as she stole through byepaths to the office verandah there behind a creeperhung pillar she waited till johns tall figure showed itself at the writingtable then she went forward and raising the bamboo chick said softly i am here huzoor all right come in and shut the door some one hiding in the oleander bushes in full view of this incident muttered a curse and settled himself down in a new position so what shunker had said was true and disfigured as she was kirpo still kept her hold on the shaitan sahib but for a promise he had made to the usurer not to anticipate the great revenge brewing for john rabys discomfiture ramu for it was he once more out of prison would have asked nothing better than to have waited patiently till kirpo appeared again and then in the darkness to have fallen on her and killed her outright as it was he sat with eyes fixed on the door controlling his passion by the thought of future and less hazardous revenge upon them both he had a long knife tucked away in his waistcloth but it seemed to him as if he could feel its sharp edge and see its gleaming curve plunging into flesh truly a venomous dangerous animal to be lurking among the white oleanders in belles paradise as she sat playing haydn and john with a contemptuous smile on his face was listening to kirpos tales she knew a good deal did kirpo but not all she did not know for instance that her husband lay among the oleanders else she might have hesitated in playing the part of spy though she was no coward and her revengeful desires were keen by and by she came out and a crouching shadowy figure followed her through the garden and then struck across the barren plain to the village which john raby had described as the worst of the lot the village of which belle used persistently to dream the village where even the children looked at her with eyes of hate her husband did not dream of anything he used to sleep the sleep of the just and wake fresh as a lark to the pursuit of the one reality in his lifemoney and even in its pursuit he was content because it occupied him so thoroughly that he had no time to notice minor details sometimes belle irritated him but the instant after he would smile it was a way women especially good women hadthey could not help it sometimes he fell foul in spirit of his senior partner but not for long what were such trivialities in comparison with the main fact of general success belle was a good wife marsden a good friend above all the concern was a good concern a rattling good business and he john raby had plucked the plum out of shunkers very hands that last thought was always provocative of a smile meanwhile the lala was smiling too the reappearance of ramuwho seemed to keep all his virtue for the purpose of procuring a ticketofleavehad considerably strengthened the usurers hands by providing him with one absolutely reckless tool when the time came for setting fire to the carefully laid train he would not have to seek for a match and that when one had to deal with these slowbrained peasants was a great gain with such a leader he looked forward confidently to mischief sooner or later kirpo might tell tales but there were some tales shunker meant to keep secret till the right moment came for turning passive opposition into active interference chapter xxiv belles paradise did not last long in less than three weeks the hot winds came to shrivel the bursting buds and turn even the promise of blossom into a sign of death the sunshine took a deeper yellow glow the blue faded from the sky an impalpable dust began to settle on all things down in the sand stretches below the house the network of the river grew finer day by day and the mudbanks left by shrinking streams assumed airs of perpetuity by clothing themselves with green herbs as if the time of floods were not nigh to swallow them up once more all else far and near seemed fainting in a great thirst longing for the crisis which was to bring them life but belle though the floods had not yet come felt one calm still morning as if the waters had gone over her head and she had no power to resist the current which swept her from her feet it was a trivial thing which roused the feeling only a word or two in one of philips letters which she held in her hand as she stood beside her husbands writingtable i quite admit it my dear girl he was saying calmly marsden has written to me on that subject several times and i have replied as i thought fit it is quite possible i may have given him the impression i was willing or even that i was going to do more than has really been done what then only this she replied hotly that you have degraded him in the eyes of these people he promised inquiry and he had no business to promise anything he referred it to me and he has no right to complain of my decision he does not complain when has he ever complained she interrupted trying hard to keep the passion from her voice you can read what he says if you like he thinksi do not ask howthat you have done your best exactly i have done my best for the business he did not mean that oh john the shame of it will kill me to take everything from a man even his honour and good name you dont appear to be so much concerned about mine but i promised to pay philip back his money in two years and i mean to do it be reasonable my dear child some one must take the responsibility some one must take the odium which is unfortunately inseparable from success why should you complain because i take it cheerfully belle crushed the letter closer in vexed despair i can never make you understand do you not see it is a question of right and wrong you have taken his money and are using it as he would hate to have it used you havei do not say deceived himbut kept the truth from him and even if you succeed what will you be doing but giving him money gained as he would have scorned to gain it her husband laughed a very ugly laugh and for the first time his face showed some emotion i always knew you thought marsden perfect but i wasnt aware of your estimate of my comparative virtue i cannot say im flattered by it i cant help it she said almost with a sob i cant see things in the light you see them that is a mutual disability so for heavens sake let us agree to differ the thing is done even if i wished to do so the sluice could not be built now the river is due in three weeks or sooner and any interference with the dam at present must mean disaster to all concerned i tell you this because i want you to understand that now at any rate my hands are tied perhapsi mean no doubt but he must be told andand given his choice it is not right tell him my dear if it pleases you to do so though i think it is a pity for in two months time if all this fuss doesnt play the devil with my plans the difficulties will be over by the way what do you propose to tell him that i have behaved like a scoundrel you have no right to say such things john she cried indignantly he shrugged his shoulders well that i have behaved as he would have scorned to behave c c it seems to me about the same thing in different words the flush which rose to her face told how hard she was hit that was the mischief of it allthat fatal comparison between these two men against which she had struggled in vain why should she have compared them why even now should she not let things be and trust to johns superior wisdom for he was wise in such matters and heaven knows gave himself up wholly to insure success how could she tell philip what was she to tell him yet he must know even for johns sake he ought to know what was being done in his name i will ask him to come here she said with an effort then he can see for himself john raby looked up quickly very well do so only remember this i disclaim all responsibility for what may happen and i tell you fairly i mean to have my own way you know perfectly well that i consider quarrelling mere waste of time but if the position becomes awkward that will be your doing not mine i will tell him to come repeated belle slowly then thats settled perhaps it may be best after all he added his face losing its last trace of vexation indeed i thought of asking him before but the fact is the last time he was here you showed your uneasiness so distinctly that i hesitated once more the colour rose to his wifes face as she turned away was everything from beginning to end her fault she wondered as she sent off a telegram asking philip to come if he could get leave she chose a telegram more because it relieved her from the necessity of giving her reasons than from any desire to save time and so accelerate the explanations she dreaded yet when late in the evening of the next day john coming from the factory told her with a certain elation in his voice that the river was on the rise she clasped her hands nervously and wished philip had wings all the next day she found herself going to the verandah whence she could see the sandy flats and wondering if those distant streaks of water were indeed creeping nearer the barometers falling fast so im afraid your philanthropy comes a little too late belle said john when he came in to lunch but personally im glad the floods will be early i dont mind confessing to a little anxiety as to whether the dam will work and it will be a relief to see you looking less worried i think every one is too much on the strain just now even afzul he was only saved from throwing up his place this morning by the news that philip was coming tomorrow so you see your plan has done some good already the night closed dark and hazy and belles last look from the verandah showed her nothing but dim distances stretching away to a lighter horizon she could not sleep yet she would not make any stir so she lay awake wondering what forces were at work among the shadows and what the dawn would bring forth john john she cried touching his shoulder to rouse him when the first glimmer of light came to reveal the labour of the night the floods are out right up to the high bank he was on his feet in an instant by george i am in luck he cried it will take them all by surprise tell them to bring tea belle i must be off to the dam at once and dont expect me back till lunch marsden will excuse me and besides he gave a little light laugh it will give you leisure to get over your confession its awfully nice to have some one to be penitent in your place it saves a lot of bother dont you remember floracs reply to pendennis about his mothers tears you must have made her weep a good deal says pen mais enormement mon cher a few minutes later he had left her with a kindly goodbye and a recommendation to take things easy as he did as she walked up and down the verandah waiting for philips arrival she asked herself more than once whether it would not be wiser to follow johns advice now that the last chance of remedy was over for the present why should she give herself the pain of acknowledging that she condemned her husbands action drifting this way and that in the current of thought as many another thing swept from its moorings was drifting in the floods beneath her eyes she had reached no certain conclusion when the even tread of the horse which they had sent to meet philip brought her back to action with a strange dread of herself he was beside her in an instant and though she had worded her telegram so as to avoid anxiety it was clearly evident in his face well what is it he said still holding her outstretched hand of welcome and looking into her face curiously nothing she answered hurriedly nothing in the least important onlyi wanted to see you come in you must be tired that beast has such rough paces i would have sent suleiman but he is lame come in tea is ready so she ran on and philip who to say sooth had been on tenterhooks ever since the receipt of her summons had to fall into her mood not without a certain sense of injury but the pleasure of being within touch of her hand and sight of her face was irresistible so that the following hours seemed to take him back to the most perfect memory of his whole life to that evening at saudaghur which he and she had spent together in thoughtless unreasoning content perhaps this memory cast its glamour over belle likewise certain it is that something beat down and overwhelmed all thought and care john coming in almost late for lunch found them laughing over the last weeks punch which philip had brought with him and taking his cue quickly if with some contemptuous surprise dropped his serious air and became the genial host never was there a gayer or more lighthearted trio but outside the house the clear promise of the morning had dulled to a yellow haze and every now and again a swirl of dust swept past making the yellow deeper in for the first andi of the season said john raby standing by the window the natives say it is a sign of a healthy year to have a duststorm early more good luck you see belle there is nothing like keeping a calm sough and trusting to providence doesnt it make you feel heavenly calm marsden to be here in this jolly room and know that outside in all that dust and pother the elements are working together for your good philip laughed i feel very well content thank you the comfort of contrast always appeals to my selfish nature hark to that belle ill never believe in philips saintship again cried her husband triumphantly well i must be off there was the tiniest crumble in the dam and i must get my bandits to work on it before dark by the way marsden afzul said he was coming to see you this afternoon if so sit on him the beggar has been half mutinous of late faugh what an atmosphere but i dare say it will be better outside how well he is looking said philip as he watched the figure disappearing through the haze i wish i could see you do more credit to the heavenly calm he made the remark lightly enough thinking only of his first glance at her when he arrived a glance which had prompted his swift inquiry as to what was the matter but he was startled out of all save surprise by the look on her face as she turned towards him from the window heavenly calm she echoed almost wildly yes for you and for me and for him but for the others you asked me and i said nothing was the matter it was a lie everything is the matter outside there in the dust as she spoke the hand she had laid on his arm in her vehemence tightened to a clutch her eyes fixed themselves on something john she cried he is coming back running oh what is it what is it almost before he could grasp her meaning the door burst open and john raby was back in the room calm for all his excitement quick marsden quick get your revolverthe fools are at the dam theres treachery and not a moment to lose quick man quick treachery what how i dont understandbelle what is the matter for she had thrown herself between him and her husband and stood with one hand on his breast as if to push him back he shall not go he does not understand she cried passionately i tell you he shall not go until i have told him all he does not know he does not understand it is not fairphilip dont heed her marsden its all fancy and there is no time for words i tell you they are at the damthe fools cried john his selfcontrol seeming to give way at the very thought of danger to the work of his hands belle let him go i command youi entreat but she stood firm every fibre of her nature tense in this final conflict a conflict not so much between the two men as between her instincts and her beliefs and yet the sense of personal injury so long repressed made her words reckless you have taken everything from himeverything that makes life worth livingeven his love and because of that he has given up everything without a word and now you ask his honour his life in a bad cause but you shall not have it philip if you love meif you love your own good namestay where you are it is i who command it with an oath john raby dashed past her to the office but ere philip had time to do more than unclasp as gently as he could the arms she had flung about his neck her husband was back again revolver in hand his clear face blurred by anger sheer animal anger belle he cried beside himself with uncontrolled passion dont add this folly to your other foolishness think i am your husband so choose between us choose between us i say or by god she interrupted him in tones so bitter that no escape remained from their finality choose yes i have chosen at lastat last philip shall not suffer his answer came swiftly then stay with your lover i might have known i was a fool to trust a woman ere the echo of his voice died away he was out in the storm again leaving those two in a silence worse than the words just spoken he had disengaged her arms but her hands had tightened themselves on his and so they stood face to face looking into each others eyes but in his lay a pity and tenderness before which hers failed and fell you must not go she whispered low and fast i have not told you and i ought to have told you he had no right to use your name to be so hard and they may kill you i have a right to tell yousurely i have a right to so much her warm clasp held him unresisting yet in his heart of hearts he was not thinking of her only of some expedient which should avoid the last resource of brute force for with all his tenderness his pride was in arms have i not given you enough belle he said hoarsely will you not even leave me my courage with a sob she flung his hands from her as if they bit and stung go she cried you are unjust ungenerous but go he did not wait torn as he was by love and compassion for the woman he was leaving so forsaken and abased he could not pause in the mad hurry which seized him even for a word of comfort time if he was to retrieve his selfrespect and hers was too precious another instant and he was searching frantically for his revolver among his halfunpacked things and feeling a certain fierce joy in anticipation of the struggle to come a quick snatch a breathless relief and he looked up to find afzul khan standing by the only door of exit from the room afzul he cried why are you here why are you not at your post when there is danger afoot follow me at once but the pathans answer was to close the door and stand with his arm thrown across it boltwise then he looked at the major boldly yet respectfully im here huzoor because i have grown tired of helping a tyrant the sahib should be tired of it too and take his reward that is what i came to make known to the presence let me pass fool shouted philip struggling to get at the door but afzul was his match in strength and even as he resisted found time for words listen huzoor if it is the money let it go i have here in my pocket something that will put more money into the mems hand so you can have her and the money too are you mad let me pass i say or it will be the worse for you for you huzoor there is danger the men mean fight but if raby sahib has none to back him he will choose prudence he wrought the evili will not stir sahib till you have listenedhe wrought the evil let him bear the loss you philip gave one glance round for other means of escape then the breathless hurry of the last few moments left his voice and manner stand back afzul he said quietly or ill fire onetwothree an instants pause and the hand on the trigger wavered something the memory of those days and nights in the smoky cave perhaps came between philip and the wrist he aimed at for the ball struck the door below it splintering the wood but that waver slight though it was caught the pathans quick eye he threw up his arm with a laugh of malicious triumph we are quits huzoor we have both been fools before the others bravery that is the end the end at last the meaning of his words even the words themselves were lost on philip who was already down the verandah steps his head as he ran bent low to save himself from being blinded by the swirl of dust which now swept past continuously afzul scowled after the retreating figure fool he muttered between his teeth but i have done with him nowdone with everything save this accursed letter i wish i had sent it to the mem at first it belongs to her and she is the best of the bunch so muttering he made his way to the verandah and raising the bamboo screen looked into the drawingroom belle crushed to a dull endurance by the consciousness of her own impotence to aid nay more with the very desire to help killed by the awful knowledge that both those men had flung her aside as something beneath their manhood had thrown herself face downward on the sofa where she lay with clenched hands striving to regain some power of thought or action yet in the very effort driving herself to greater helplessness by her wild insistence that time was passing that she must decide must do something huzoor she started to her feet and found afzul beside her with outstretched hand the sight by rousing a physical fear brought back the courage which never failed her at such times well she asked boldly i am not come to hurt you huzoor but to give you this it belongs to you she put out her hand mechanically and took a small package done up native fashion in a bit of old brocade mine what is it she asked in a dull tone it is dick sahibs will he died fighting like the brave one he was but they were all brave those threedick sahib and marsden sahib and raby sahib they die fightingcurse them they die fighting with the first cry she had given belle broke from him and still clutching the packet followed in the footsteps of those two and as she ran beaten back by the wind and halfblinded by the sand she scarcely thought of their safety only that she might get there in time only in time dear god only in time to show them that she was brave also the lurid yellow of the duststorm had darkened or lightened everything to the same dull tint the sand beneath her feet the sky above the swaying trees between each and all seemed like shadows thrown upon a screen and her own flying figure the only reality in an empty world of dreams not a sound save the broad rush of the wind not a sight save the dim dust hazed paths bordered by shrivelled flowers then beyond the garden the long curve of the dam the deeper sinking into duncoloured soil of those frantic feet and running with her as she ran the swirls and dimples of the yellow river angry for all its silence if only she might be in time there in the centre of the curve like a swarm of bees shifting crowding pressingwas that johns fair head in the centre if the wind were only the other way she might have heard but now even if they were crying for help she would not hear suddenly her stumbling flight ceased in a stumbling pause was that the wind she threw up her hands without a cry and stood as if turned to stone it seemed to her as if the seconds beat themselves in on her brainonetwothreefourfivenot more than that then a low dull roar ending in silence silence and peace for she lay huddled up in a heap upon the ground as if struck by lightning chapter xxv when john raby waking at belles touch to find the floods had come remarked that the people would be taken by surprise he said truly the corollary he drew from this premisethat he was to be congratulated on good luckwas not so sure for there are times when the unforeseen acts as a spur to those who when prepared often lack the courage of action and this was the case with a large body of the malcontents whom shunker das aided of late by his lieutenant ram lal had been diligently instructing in the necessity for resistance at the proper time but a vague formula of this sort is a very different thing in the eyes of the stolid lawabiding peasant from the resolution that today this hour this minute they had to set aside their inherited endurance their ancestral calm and fight so had the floods come in due course and after due warning it is more than probable that even ram lals reckless desire for revenge would have failed to excite the people to the organised attack on the new dam towards which all shunkers machinations had tended and in which he saw at least temporary ruin to his enemys plans fate however provided the element of surprise and to these slowbrained rebels seemed to leave no choice beyond instant revolt or instant submission aided by ram lals envoys the news that the river was rising travelled fast down the depression of cultivated land along whichgiven a high floodmarkthe water might be expected nor was the assertion wanting that such a floodmark had already been reached during the past two days and its benefits neutralised by raby sahibs unholy contrivance by dawn bands of the restless had begun to drift about from village to village eager to discuss the position and by degrees gaining a certain coherence of intention even those who hung back from the idea of active interference joining the crowd out of curiosity and so increasing the quantity of human tinder ready for ignition by the smallest spark before noon khan mahomed lateef khan looking out from his ruined tower saw a cloud of dust beyond his bare brown fields and ere long was in parley with a recruiting band not i swore the old man fiercely these are not days for honest blows my songod smite those who smote himcould tell you so much and his son must learn his fathers wisdom ye are fools let every one of you give one rupee after the manner of a wedding and go purchase the slithering lies of a pleader then may ye have justice in the sahibs courts not otherwise besides look ye shunker is in this and his jackal ramu and by the twelve imaums i hate them worse than raby sahib ram lal hath cause retorted a villainouslooking goldsmith hailing from the village where belle had been pelted by the children we hindus khan sahib are peacelovers till they touch our women the old mussulman burst into a scornful laugh best not chatter thus to me gurdit inshallah there have been times when honest blows with a good sword have brought the faithful many a hindu peri but i quarrel not so go your way fools like sheep to slaughter if so your wisdom teaches i bide at home nay but khan sahib expostulated that very peru with whom shunker had begun his work we go not to or for slaughter we mean to petition first to marsden sahib who comes today so the pathan hath given out what interrupted the khan with a frown he hath returned then go ye doubly to slaughter for there is one who dallies not with words he knows how to smite and if it comes to blows i know which side good swordsbut there i bide at home nor despite their urgent importunities would he consent even to join those who favoured a petition no doubt the racial disinclination to be mixed up with idolaters had something to do with the refusal beyond this there was a stronger desire to give no help to shunker and stronger than all was that liking for sheer pluck which makes a native regiment recruited from the martial races and led by englishmen it trusts well nigh the perfection of a warlike weapon many records bear witness to this fact none more so than the story of ahmad kheyl when but for an englishmans voice and the steady response of indian soldiers the tale might have been writ disaster instead of victory perhaps some of the three thousand ghazies who on that day dashed like an avalanche down the hillside on to the thin brown line guarding a mistaken retreat of redcoats may have expected colour to side with colour if so they paid dearly for their error it is pluck with pluck and the words retreat be damnedstand fast men attributed rightly or wrongly to an englishman not mentioned in despatches were sufficient to weld two nationalities into a wall which broke the force of one of the most desperate charges ever made at least so runs the storyout of despatches khan mahomed lateef khan then retreated growling to his tumbledown roof and betook himself inconsequently to polishing up his sword half an hour afterwards however he suddenly bade old fatma bring him his company raiment with the medals and clasps of his dead sons sewn on it then he said a brief farewell to the child left the women without a word and went over to borrow the pinknosed pony of the pleaders father who being the government accountant was of course discreetly at home why didst not make thy son take up the case without payment asked the old man wrathfully as his neighbour held the stirrup for him to mount then should i not have had to go in mine old age and strive for peacemark you for peace but as he rode off the old sword clattered merrily about his old legs and he smiled thinking of the gift given when the light of his eyes lay sick in the mems arms the sword is for her and hers according to my oath he said to himself god knows it may be peace i will do naught to hinder it but with marsden sahiballah akbar at least they do not worship stocks and stones like these pigs so behind the gathering cloud of witnesses half hidden in the gathering dust came the pinknosed pony ready for peace or war the odds either for one or the other flickered up and down a dozen times as village after village sent or held back its contingent finally it flared up conclusively with the advent of ramu at the head of his particular villains armed not only with sticks and stones but with picks and shovels like a spark among tinder the suggestion flamed through the masswhy waste time in words when without a blow except at solid earth they could bring the floods into their own channel since afzul and his gang had declared in favour of the people so said ramu and the peasants were only too ready to believe him seeing that picks and shovels were more to their minds than blows thus while the trio of aliens to whom that low curve of earthwork meant so much were talking and laughing over their lunch the dam was being assailed by a swarm of men eager for its destruction almost at the same time the khan sahib spurring the pinknosed pony to the overseers hut found afzul asleep or pretending to sleep perhaps the hint of bribery was true perhaps the pathan thought a crisis was needed at all events he was too crafty to show his hand to his stern old patron and set off ostensibly to give the alarm at the house and summon his gang who by a curious coincidence happened to be employed half a mile or so further up the river not till he saw his messenger reach the verandah did the khan seek the scene of action picks and shovels indeed well these ploughmen had a right to use such weapons and he would stand by and see fair play how afzul fulfilled his mission has already been told also the result of john rabys appeal for help to philip marsden to say that the former could not believe his eyes when on first turning out of the garden he caught sight of the crowd gathered on the dam is but a feeble description of the absolutely incredulous wrath which overpowered him he had been prepared for opposition perhaps even for attack when such attack was reasonable but that these fools these madmen should propose to cut a channel with the full weight of a flood on the dam was inconceivable as he ran back for his revolver a savage joy at the danger to the workers themselves merged itself with rage at the possible ruin of his labour and a fierce determination by words warnings and threats to avert the worst they could not be such fools such insensate idiots as he passed the workmens huts on his return he shouted to afzul and getting no reply ran on with a curse at all traitors he was alone against them all but despite them all he would prevail as he neared the crowd bareheaded revolver in hand he felt a wild desire to fire without a word and kill some one no matter whom the suspicion however that this attack could not proceed from anything but revenge had grown upon him and became conviction as he saw that the largest portion of his enemies were of the ruck men who never did a hands turn and who even now stood by applauding while others plied spade and mattock in the latter in their stolid wisdom and experience lay his best chance and he slipped the revolver to his pocket instantly stop you fools he shouted stop peru gunga where are your wits the floodthe flood is too strong then recognising the old khan he appealed instinctively to him for support stop them khan sahib you are old and wise tell them it is madness as he spoke reaching the growing gap he leapt down into it and wrested a spade from the man nearest to him it was yielded almost without resistance but a murmur ran through the bystanders and the workers dug faster jodha boota dhurma rose johns voice again singling out the men he knew to be cultivators this is folly tell them it is folly khan sahib i know not answered the other moodily tis shovel not swordwork and they have a right to the waterbefore god sahib they have a right to so much before god they will have more than they want interrupted that eager tone and something in its intelligent decision arrested one or two of the older workers they looked round at the swirling waste of the river and hesitated tis but his craft cried ramu excitedly showing himself for the first time i know raby well on on my brothers he has wiles for men as well as for women the revolver came out of john rabys pocket again swiftly but an ominous surge together of the crowd showed him that it must be a last resource when all else had failed and now there were steps behind him coming down the embankment hard and fast the next instant philips voice with the ring of accustomed command in it came sharp listen the first of you who puts spade to ground god save his soul from damnation the native is essentially dramatic the very turn of his speech where the imperative remains intact even when it has filtered through other lips shows him to be so and philip marsden with the intimate knowledge of years counted not unwisely on this characteristic for effect the surprise the appearance of one who in a vague way they considered of the right sort the certainty that the voice they heard meant what it said produced a general pause among the diggers a pause during which mahomed lateef drew his sword gently from the scabbard listen again cried philip put down those spades and you shall have justice i promise it but even as he spoke john raby gave a quick excited cry back marsden back the dam is cracking back for gods sake it is too late let the fools be he sprang up the gap and as he did so a man sprang after him it was ramu ready for the deed he had come to do fearful lest by this unexpected flight his prey might escape him the glance of a knife a cry more of surprise than pain and john raby twisting round in a last desire to get at his assassin overbalanced and fell headlong down into the ditch the next instant before philips revolver could single out the criminal the old khans sword swirled above the high turban allahihukk allahiakbar god is right and might the fervour of youth rang in the familiar warshout and the memory of youth must have nerved the hand for ramus head heeled over on his shoulder in ghastly fashion as he doubled up beneath the force of the blow but ere he fell the ground beneath him split as if for a grave and with a hiss of water pouring through the cracks the loosened soil gave way on all sides philip bounding down to reach his fallen friend felt a sudden dizziness as the solid earth swirled round split up broke into islands then with an awful swiftness while the crowd fought frantically for a crumbling foothold the dam like a childs sandcastle before an incoming wave broadened sank melted disappeared leaving nothing but a sheet of water racing madly to find its old haunts then it was when the scene in which all her life seemed bound up disappeared bodily from before her eyes that belle raby threw up her hands and forgot the whole world for a time philip strong swimmer as he was struggled hard with the underdraw ere he rose to the surface shook the mud and water from his eyes and looked about him many a wretch swept past him shrieking for aid but he searched for something which even amid his own danger he could not think of without a curse once twice thrice he dived after a hint a hope then coming on mahomed lateef drifting halfunconsciously down stream he gave up the useless search and buoying the old mans head against his shoulder struck out for the back eddy he was so spent when he reached the shore that he could with difficulty drag his burden to the dry warm sand and sink down beside it the whole incident had passed so rapidly that it seemed but an instant since he had been running down the embankment eager to be in time and he had been in time for what suddenly he remembered belle and staggered to his feet the storm was darker than ever and aided by the afternoon shadows wrapped everything in a dim twilight which hid all save the immediate foreground still he could see from the ebb of the flood in front of him that the great mass of upheld water must have surged first in a forward direction and then recoiled to find the lower levels which lay at right angles thus it seemed probable that many of those swept away in the great rush might have been left high and dry a quarter of a mile or so lower down and in this case nothing was more likely than a further attack on the house for once blood has been shedand that some of those engaged must have lost their lives seemed certaineven the proverbially placid peasantry of india loses its head belle therefore must be found not merely to tell her of the calamity but to secure her safety the instant after this thought flashed upon him philip marsden was making his way to the house stumbling as he ran through heavy sand and in the teeth of a choking duststorm men even strong men have in such a storm lost their way and been smothered to death as they sought shelter in some hollow but philip was too set on his purpose to think of pausing belle belle he cried as he ran up the verandahsteps and burst into the drawingroom she was not there belle belle i want you but there was no reply the absence of servants the deserted verandah did not surprise him news flies fast among the people but belle was it possible she too had ventured out perhaps along the dam itself the very thought turned him sick with fear and he dashed into her room calling on her again and again the thousand and one delicate tokens of her presence hit him hard by contrast with the idea of her out there alone perhaps swirling down that awful stream with which it seemed to him he was still struggling belle belle he was out of the house once more through the garden down by the huts was it a year or a minute ago that he had passed that way running as now to be in time or were past and present nothing but a bad dream one of those endless nights from some unknown horror which survive a thousand checks and go on and on despite perpetual escape no it was not a dream the last time there had been a low curve of earth before him where now nothing showed save a dim yellow flood sliding so smoothly that it seemed to have been sliding there since time began each step bringing him nearer to it brought him nearer also to despair then just as he had given up hope on the very brink so close that one clenched hand hung over the water he found her lying as she had fallen found her none too soon for even as he stooped to raise her another few inches of loosened soil undermined by the current fell with a dull splash and he realised that ere long the river would have turned her forgetfulness to death lifting her as best he could in his arms he paused an instant to consider what had best be done one thing was certain neither house nor hut was safe until time showed the temper of the survivors yet help and remedies of some sort he must have and shelter too from storm and night he thought of kirpo but decided not to trust her a lucky decision since to seek her would have been but waste of time as recognising her husband among the rioters she had fled into the jungle with her child the servants might be found if fear had not dispersed them but where in the meantime was he to leave belle at last his thoughts returned to the old khan he was faithful and if he had recovered might at least keep watch while philip sought other help besides not far from where he had left the old man philip had noticed a reed shanty built against the abutment of the dam and so hidden from the sight of all save those coming from that side he determined therefore to carry belle thither and if he could find mahomed lateef to leave her in his charge this was no easy task for belle unconscious as she was proved an awkward burden over such a rough road and it was a great relief to be able to lay her down at last in comparative shelter and assure himself that she was still alive for as he had struggled on the dead weight in his arms had filled him with apprehension the next thing was to find the khan here fate proved kind and within a few yards of the shanty philip came upon him battling against the wind yet finding breath for a running fire of curses on all idolaters to cut short his gratitude and explain what was wanted took but a moment the next saw philip hurrying towards the house again since if the rioters returned time might run short it did despite his hurry so that after vainly searching for the servants he was still rummaging for more ammunition and most potent weapon of all for money when the sound of advancing voices warned him to be off thanks to the almost blinding dust there was little fear of being seen in his retreat yet when on reaching the shanty he found belle still quite unconscious he recognised that the most difficult part of his task had yet to come he had brought back a few comforts snatched up hastily as he made his escape and now set to work to force a few drops of brandy down her throat wrap her in warmer garments and chafe her cold hands and feet to do so he had to unclasp the fingers of her right hand by force and withdraw something she held in it this without giving it a glance he slipped into the breastpocket of his coat and so continued his efforts after a time her colour became less deathlike she moaned once or twice turning her head aside as if to escape from some distasteful sight but beyond this there was no change and the hope of her recovering the shock sufficiently to aid in her own escape seemed very slender nor did philip wonder at her collapse when he thought of what it must have been for her to stand by helpless and see those who had left her in anger swept away into the unforgiveness of death huzoor whispered the old khan who in deference to inviolable custom had been sitting with averted face in the doorway where shivering from the chill of the wind through his wet clothes he had been considering the position carefully we must get out of this to sit here will have us crippled with ague by dawn there is my pony i will go fetch it from the huts perchance they may not see me perchance they would not touch me if they did for ramuthe man i killed huzoorhath no bloodkin in these parts and death cools friendship besides their wrath will be only against white faces when i am gone ten minutes lift the mem and make for the dip in the south road by the nullah if all goes well you will hear hoofs ere long but if these fools are set on blood make your way as best you can due south eight miles more or less keeping the left bank till you see a squaretowered house give this to the women they will obey it he took the talisman signet from his thumb and slipping it into philips hand left the hut the next ten minutes seemed interminable and the relief of action when it came was great this time belle proved an easier burden when wrapped closely in a shawl and lifted leisurely once amongst the tall tigergrass in the nullah he rested his knee against a high tussock and still holding her in his arms waited anxiously for he was now on the direct route to the house and liable to come across a straggling rioter at any moment the risk however had to be run as the only available bridge over a cut from the river lay a few yards further on sheltered by the high grass philips eyes were practically useless to him and the ponys hoofs being deadened by the sand it needed a low whistle from the khan to bring him out on to the road beside the pinknosed pony give me her here across the pummel huzoor said the old man briefly your legs are younger than mine and time is precious so gently mashallah i have seen women carried thus before thiswomen who gave the rider more trouble than she is like to do now if you are ready huzoor for though tis dark enough there will be a blaze ere long those lowcaste pigleatherworking dogs had got to the sahibs brandybottles and you know what that means did they try to stop you asked philip when after crossing the bridge in silent anxiety they struck into the comparative safety of the jungle the old man grunted softly his anger tempered by the necessity for caution by the twelve imaums they said i was afraidi mahomed lateef syyedthat i was sneaking away and ii never even called them pigs despite his anxiety philip could not resist a smile partly of confidence for no better proof of the khans resolution to bring belle safely out of trouble could have been found than this unparalleled meekness so they went on swiftly philip at the bridlerein the old khan supporting belle partly on his arm partly by a dexterous arrangement of his scabbard over which the old man chuckled as if in contented reminiscence of bygone days tis as i said huzoor he remarked pointing to a red flush rising behind them that is the bungalow roof tis well she is out of it so far philip thinking of all the horrors of the past few hours and contrasting them with his memories of belle in her pretty home clenched his hands wishing he were nearer perhaps the khans sympathy saw to his thought for the old man went on in aggrieved tones and we get no good from it not even an honest setto when the women are safe for tomorrow the tahseeldar and the police will spoil sport besides these shoveldiggers will be afraid of their own actions by dawn even now we are safe safe as if we are driving down the watered road of a cantonment our only care to convey this poor soul to womans hands inshallah the women have the best of it in your reign huzoor well some one will have to answer for the days work replied philip grimly some one ay that is todays law and even of that i know not grumbled the khan for look you ramu and none else killed the sahib and i killed ramu so that is done the rest were peaceable enough god knows and you hang not for the bursting of bunds dams and burning of bungalows there is no justice nowadays it was past midnight ere the pony pulled up of its own accord at a ruinous door and the owner with mighty shouts and much impatient rattling of his swordhilt on the panels roused the inmates come forth fatma he cried to the whitesheeted form muttering faint excuses which appeared at length heed not the stranger tonighthaiyat also he is my brother and this look you is my sister we will carry her within to the womens room and ye must see to her as women should and bring us word of her state speedily tis best so huzoor fatma is learned in womans lore and hath simples she will tell us if there be hurts or danger for tonight the mem had best stay here since there is nought to be done save rest not so khan sahib i must return and see after the old mussulman raised his right hand solemnly let the dead rest in peace also for tonight huzoor i saw raby sahib fall and i know how dead clay toucheth the earth to which it returns the knife struck home huzoor right through the heart lo it was kismet raby sahib is dead but his slayer is dead also so we his comrades may rest awhile till dawn comes i will wait till dawn said philip and hear what the women say so the khan disposed himself to sleep with the calm of an old campaigner and philip sat out in the warm night air waiting for the dawn the storm had ended in weakminded thunder and a few spots of dry rain which had nevertheless left a freshness behind them here and there through the parting drifts of cloud and dust the stars twinkled brightly making philips thoughts turn to a future more peaceful than past or present he drove the erring fancies back to realities with a certain scorn of himself but they broke from control again and again with the insistence which truth brings to bear on conventionalities it was true that by and by time would heal the present trouble it was true that by and by regrets would soften there was no hurry no thought but pity and sorrow for what was and yet he started from a vision of peace to find old fatma by his side the khan had long since been snoring placidly so the old matrons eyes could look into philips with straightforward confidence the mem will do for now huzoor there is no danger none at all but by and by in the months to come may god save from harm the child that will be born he rose to his feet white to the very lips just heaven was this poor belles last legacy chapter xxvi the old khans forecast proved correct in every particular by noon on the day after the outbreak the ringleaders were safe in the lockup awaiting trial and save for the smouldering house and the yellow flood of water sliding down the old channel there was nothing to tell of the past nights work for the dead bodies had been carried to their homes and the women wailed over them discreetly behind mud walls as if they had died in their beds all save john rabys and that was making a dismal procession towards the nearest railway station preceded at a little distance by poor belle crushed and but halfconscious of the truth philip riding by the side of the litter felt there was something exasperating in the absolute insignificance of the whole affair it almost seemed as if some one must be to blame as if something could surely have been done to avert so terrible an ending to what was after all but a storm in a teacup but then neither he nor the authorities who had to inquire into the matter were in possession of that masterkey to the whole position which was to be found in shunker dass desire for revenge for he had worked carefully leaving scarcely a trace behind him and though kirpo came forward boldly to declare his responsibility her palpable motive for spite discredited her statements besides at the very outset of the inquiry it became clear that john rabys murder by ramu had nothing whatever to do with his action in regard to the water and however absurd the mans jealousy might seem it was certainly sufficient to explain the rancour with which kirpos husband had set himself to conspire against the englishman it was evident therefore that the latter had met his death not from his harshness towards the people but from the goodnature with which he had originally espoused the womans cause both philip marsden and the khan could only witness to the freedom from all attempt at personal violence on the part of the crowd even when john raby had thrown himself among the workers and taken a spade from them by force while the subsequent burning and looting of the factory was evidently an after impulse caused by the rage of the survivors at the loss of their companions the whole affair in short being one of those perfectly maddening mistakes and misapprehensions which serve sometimes to emphasise the peculiar conditions of life in our indian empire all this or most of it was in due time dinned into the widows ears by kindly but strange voices for there was one familiar voice which she dreaded to hear because the owner knew of something which the others did not know something she could not remember without despair so day after day she lay in the spare room of the head officials housethat spare room which shelters such an odd variety of guests the travelling member of parliament the widow the homeward and outward bound the dying sometimes the deadand when philips name was mentioned she would turn her head away and beg to be left alone a little longer just a little longer hurt as he could not fail to be at her avoidance of him he understood the reason of it all too well and waited patiently then the last day of his leave came and he sent to say he must see her before he left so belle white as her widows cap nerved herself for the interview with the man whom she had preferred before her dead husband that is how in her abject remorse she put it to herself she had chosen her lover the natural indignation at deceit the generous instinct the sense of injustice which had forced her to the decision were all forgotten before the memory of those minutes of delay how could she meet philipphilip round whose neck she had thrown her arms while defying the husband whom she had sent alone to seek death that philip had refused to play the part she gave him that he had forced her to play a better one herself brought her no comfort she was too much absorbed in the scene as it affected her and the dead man to care what philip had said or done the very fact of his entering into it at all was an offence she would not consider him in the least except to tell herself that she was also responsible to him for the loss of his money to this additional selfreproach she clung firmly as if to a protection and when she saw him pausing for half a second at the first glimpse of her in her widows weeds she thrust it forward hastily like a shield against his sympathy i am so sorry she began coldly it was not his fault he did his best about the money and now you have lost it all a sort of irritated amazement came over him what did he care for the money why should she be fretting over it when his thoughts were full of herof her only he looked into her griefdarkened eyes with a certain impatiencethe old impatience at seeing her unhappythe old eagerness to rouse her into hope oh belle what does all that matter dont look so miserable over it for pitys sake she drew her hand from his slowly with her eyes full on his face you are fond of saying that but how can i look anything else when i killed my husband belle the horrified surprise in his tone scarcely expressed his bewilderment for he had little experience of women or the morbid exaggerations in which at times they find a positive relief belle what do you mean how can you say such things what is the use of hiding the truth from ourselves she answered almost with satisfaction at her own selftorture she had not meant at least she thought she had not meant to broach the subject at all but now that it was begun she threw herself into it with out reserve you know as well as possible that it was i who really killed him i who prevented your being in time to save him there was more pity than amazement in his voice now have you been tormenting yourself with that thought all these long days poor child no wonder you have been miserable belle my dear it isnt true you know yourselfsurely you must know it isnt true i know nothing of the sort she interrupted quickly with a dull hard voice i kept you and you were too late nothing can alter that it is the truth it is not the truth he answered quietly if you had but let me see you at first i might have spared you this unnecessary pain perhaps i ought to have insisted on seeing you but he went on after a slight pause but i respected your wishes because because you knew i had reason to dread seeing you she broke in passionately because you knew it was i who killed him because you were afraid dont deny it philip you knewyes you knew why he stood before her manly and strong pitiful yet full of vexation i will not have you say such thingsof me at any rate belle i will not even have you think them of me or of yourself either in your heart of hearts you know they are not true truethey are lies belle wicked lies you have been working yourself up in your loneliness to believe something impossible preposterous and it is my fault for letting you be lonely i was not too late no power on earth could have saved john i was there armed ready the khan was there also with drawn sword yet we could not save him no one could have saved him that is the truth if you had gone sooner she murmured pressing her hands tightly together till the rings on them cut and hurt as if she were glad of pain of something to appease her own selfcondemnation if you had not been delayed you might have persuaded him to be more cautious philip almost smiled a smile of vexed surprise at her perversity my dear belle am i a man to preach caution when i am opposed was john a man to listen to such caution when the time for action had come nonsense i dont wish to be hard dear i dont say mind you that the remembrance of his anger is not very bittergod only knows how bitterfor you to bear but belle if he knows anything now he knows that he was wrong he was not wrong he was right i chose you and forsook him philip gave a little impatient shake of his head then walked away to the window feeling how hopeless it was to argue with a woman in belles position a man was absolutely helpless before such weakness and such strength yet after a pause he returned to the attack by a side route besides he said coming back to where she was seated and standing beside her resting one hand on the back of her chair it was not really you who delayed me it was something else of which you know nothing if i had seen you i would have told you but there was no use mentioning it to others because the man had gone and there was nothing to be done it was afzul kept me he came to my room when i went to fetch my revolver and barred the door he wanted me to listen as you did i think he was mad but i had to fire ere he would let me pass you see it was he who delayed me not you one reason why i did not mention it was this the man was a deserter but he had saved my life andi thinki think he must have been mad but belle made no answer with her head resting on her hand she was frowning slightly in pursuit of a fugitive memory afzul she echoed at last in puzzled tones i had quite forgotten but surely he came to me in the drawingroom he gave me something and he said something surely about dick could it have been about dick her eyes sought philips for the first time with appeal and he was sorry to chill the interest in them with a negative yet what could afzul possibly have to say about poor dick smith hardly i should think i doubt if they ever met even at faizapore but this reminds meyou had something tight clasped in your hand when i found you close to the riverso closedid they tell you how close it was to death my dear when i came upon you lyingoh belle so close something in my hand echoed belle coldly what did you do with it like you i had forgotten said philip recovering from the break in his voice i put it in the pocket of my coat when i was trying to bring you back to consciousness in the hut i dare say it is there still shall i go and see her affirmative sent him away relieved at the more human interest in her face a minute afterwards he returned with a little brocaded packet looking as if it had lain in damp lodgings i hope it isnt hurt he said lightly but having no servant here my clothes have dried as best they could and it feels rather pulpy open it and see what parting gift that inexplicable compound of fidelity and treachery left behind him he had a great admiration for you belle it is not for me after all it is for you she replied after a pause as she smoothed out the long blue envelope which had been rolled round a smaller packet at least i think so the writing above is smudged but marsden st sikhs is quite clear look at it while i open the other he took the letter from her calmly without a misgiving his first glance at it however roused a sudden doubt a sudden memory but ere he had grasped the meaning of his own thoughts belles hand was on his arm and her voice appealing to him in a new glad tone of hope oh philip it is dicks ring i have seen him wear itso often i cant be mistaken it is dicks ringcan he be aliveis hedo you think he can be alive still for an instant they stood so she like a resurrection of her girlhood he stupidly staring at a curious dark stain blotting out part of the address then the truth began to dawn upon him and his hand clenched in a growing passion no he said fiercely and his voice was almost a whisper at first no this is his willthe will i would not takeafzul my god afzul had it all the time he must have been in the passah i rememberthe subadarthose others all his enemieshe must have killed the boyhe must have killed the boy his horror his anger burst bounds he forgot everything else in the wild hatred which rose up in him against the murderer as he strode up and down the room silent for the most part but every now and again breaking out into a passionate regret why had he been so blind to think that all the time this man had nursed him all the time he had taken so many benefits from that hand it had been red with poor brave dicks blood why had he not shot the scoundrel when he had the chance but belle stood as he had left her the fingers of her right hand still caressing the ring which half unconsciously she had slipped to the third finger of her left where overlarge for the slender restingplace it almost hid the golden circlet of her wedding ring her eyes soft with a great tenderness seemed to see nothing but a young face eager in its plea for toleration dick poor dick had anything better than his love ever come into her life the sight of her as she stood almost with a smile on her face brought a new element into philips thoughts all that time while belle had been beating her wings against the cage afzul had been walking about with release in his pocket it is gods will the scene in the verandah at saudaghur on the first night of their return from death recurred to philips mind as such forgotten incidents do when time has shown their true significance making him realise more clearly than he had ever done before in all his life what mere shuttlecocks in the game of fate the strongestwilled may be at times a certain defiant revolt made him cross to where belle stood and put his arm around her as if to claim her the fates have been against us my darling he whispered passionately against us all along she scarcely seemed to hear him scarcely seemed to notice his touch in truth she had forgotten him forgotten even her troubles philip she said and there was a strange thrill in her voice if we had only known he could have told us what dick did it was something very brave i know but if we could only be sure what it was before the eyes full of a great tenderness which were raised to his he felt as far beneath her in his selfishness as she had seemed to him but just now in her morbid weakness how could he be angry with her how could he even blame her and yet when he left her room at length he looked so dispirited that the little irish doctor coming in on his daily visit to mrs raby felt impelled to clap him on the back and remark somewhat inconsequently that women god bless em were only occasionally responsible for their words certainly not so when their nerves were jangled and out of tune whereat philips pride rose at the very idea that the bystanders understood or thought they understood the position perhaps they were even now speculating how soon those two would give up mourning and be married the only drop of comfort came from mildred van milder who had come to be with belle and take her back to the little house at missouri when she was fit to travel and her consolation consisted in a tearful remark that belle had far better have married dick smith he was very young of course and had no money but charlie allsop hadnt any either and yet she wouldnt change him for all the legacies in the world the news of the discovery of dicks will was a nine days wonder and even found its way into the daily papers much to philips annoyance otherwise the fact itself was a distinct relief since it gave belle independence and removed the fear of her choosing poverty in preference to his help a choice which in her present frame of mind seemed a foregone conclusion at the same time it was likely to raise a new crop of difficulties for three years had passed by since the money had fallen in to the charity and a long time must elapse before it could be recovered if indeed it could be recovered at all luckily the proving of the will was not difficult despite the peculiarities of its custody to begin with it was in dicks own writing and the old khan was able to speak with certainty as to having seen both envelope and ring in the pathans possession and bear out the fact that philip had taken the brocaded packet from belles hand in the hut the question as to how afzul had come by it was in philips opinion all too clear especially when inquiry proved that the pathan had at any rate been on the peiwar pass about the time of the murder so far good the remainder however was more puzzling and philip felt that belle made a wise decision in refusing to disturb any existing arrangements until as she put it time should show what she ought to do the doctors strongly advised her going home to england as soon as the advent of the rains should make the long railway journey to bombay possible the complete change would give her the best chance of recovering the shock and she could then see with her own eyes how the money had been spent and what portion of it if any she would care to leave in its present employment i shall meet you in delhi he wrote in reply to the letter in which she gave him her final decision and see you safe to bombay to begin with there are one or two little business formalities which require my presence as executor and then i must see you once more there is to be a punitive expedition over the frontier in spring so leave will be impossible until the cold weather after next and that is a long time i may never see you again she read these words as she sate on the windowseat of the little drawingroom where she had read the news of his death three years before three years was it only three years since with her eyes still wet with the tears she did not understand she had gone out into the mist and the rain to find that vision of a sunlit world at her feet with john raby standing at her side and now he was dead dead in anger while tears far more bitter than those she had shed at the thought of philips death came to her eyes with the thought of seeing him again yet the world seemed to have stood still otherwise the little room the slanting pines the drifts of cloud over the hills even maud in the rockingchair and mrs stuart still aggressive in her tears and widows capsfor the good lady had ordered a new one in anticipation of belles visit moved thereto by an illdefined but very kindly impulse of sympathy but belle did not know this she only saw that sameness which is almost irritating when we ourselves have changed so much she used to sit in the little room where she had slept the night before her wedding and wonder what she had done to bring herself into this position herein for once agreeing with philip who far away with his regiment asked himself many and many a time what either of them had done of which they needed to be ashamed meanwhile the little household went on its monotonous way contentedly charlie was at school much improved and glad of belles presence partly because he was fond of her partly because she occupied his room and thus prevented that weekly return home from saturday to monday at which he was beginning to grow restive since it was almost as derogatory to dignity as being a homeboarder mrs stuart employed herself in weeping placidly over belles misfortunes and paying visits to her friends during which she darkly hinted that she had always been against the match for mr raby had played ecarte and though of course he had not lost his money that way it was not comme il faut in a young civilian maud was growing older in the rockingchair and inclined as ever to resent other peoples tears i dont think belle is so much to be pitied after all she cried captiously other people are not always having legacies left them and l means more to a widow than to a married woman besides she neednt remain a widow unless she likes philip marsden has been in love with her all the time whereat mildred signing her daily letter to charlie allsop with a flourish which would have done credit to the heiress of millions interrupted her sister hotly i think its a beastly shame to say so all the same maudie i dare say its true but im sure if any one said such things of me when i was a widow id never marry the man no not if i liked him ever so much ill tell you what it is belle has had a hard time of it and if poor dick were only here as well as his money i believe she would marry him and be happy my dear girls expostulated their mother feebly her husband is not six weeks dead till next tuesday if any one had suggested marriage to me when poor colonel stuart oh that is different mamma retorted mildred impatiently belle only married john by mistake lots of girls do the same thing mabel has with her major but then she will never find it out so it doesnt matter charlie says oh if charlie says anything that settles the matter broke in maud peevishly i wish you two would get married and then you would soon cease to think each other perfection for my part i consider belle is not to be pitied she has plenty of money and by and by she will have a baby to amuse her when shes tired of other things what more can any woman want im very sorry for her now but grief doesnt last forever and after all she never was in love with john thats one comfort perhaps if belle had been asked she might have denied the last statement if she had loved him the past would certainly have been less of a regret the future less of a fear what was to be the end of it all that question clamoured for answer as the big ship began to slide from its moorings leaning over the taffrail her eyes heavy with unshed tears she could see nothing but philip standing bareheaded in the boat which slipped landwards so fast a minute before his hands had been in hers his kind voice faltering goodbye in her ears and now suddenly her clasped fingers opened in a gesture of entreaty philip she whispered comeback come back but the swirl of the screw had caught the boat and major marsden was in his place at the tillerropes his face set landwards the rowers bent to their oars and so inch by inch yard by yard the rippling sunlit water grew between those two was that to be the end chapter xxvii seven years time enough so physiologists tell us for the whole structure of the body to be worn out and renewed again and for the mind is it to be allowed no chance of change no throwing aside of effete matter no relief from the monotony of a fixed body of opinions thoughts and emotions that would be hard indeed yet belle rabyfor she was belle raby stillhad altered little either outwardly or inwardly in the seven years which had passed since she stood leaning over the taffrail watching a boat slip landwards and asking herself if that was to be the end of it all perhaps this lack of change was the less remarkable because as she leant over the wicketgate looking into the lane beyond she was still watching and waiting and asking herself what the end was to be not however as she had done then for then she had been in a state of nervous collapse and unable to judge fairly of anything or any one of herself least of all to do her justice this state of mind had not lasted long indeed belle had found herself facing the white cliffs of england and the uncertain future awaiting her there with more equanimity than she would have deemed possible or even proper a month before the long journey homethat slow passaging day after day towards a set haven regardless of storm or calmthe imperturbable decision of the big ship which seems to have absorbed your weakness in its strengththe knowledge that day and night night and day while you forget the engines like a great heart are throbbing on purposefully across the pathless seaall this has worked many a miracle of healing in mind and body exhausted by the struggle for existence it wrought one for belle luckily since the future held many a difficulty despite them all as seven years afterwards she stood bareheaded in the cool english sunshine she looked wonderfully young and happy even though those seven years had been the fateful ones which find a woman in the twenties and leaves her in the thirties true it is that wisdom either of this world or the next brings a sadness to most eyes but in this case a sweetness had come with it which more than counterbalanced the loss of gaiety in fact belle raby had never looked more attractive than she did as she stood in a white dress with a jacqueminot rose tucked away in the lace at her throat leaning over the wicketgate waitingwaiting for what for philip of course ten oclock had just chimed from a churchtower close by and the time between that and the halfhour had belonged for years to her best friend sometimes during those short thirty minutes of a busy day she wrote to him sometimes as now she stood watching for him with tolerable certainty that if steamers and trains were punctual he would step with bodily presence into her life for a few weeks but most often she was setting time and space and absence and all the trivialities which clip the wings of poor humanity at defiance in other words she was allowing her imagination to get the better of her common sense that is one way of putting it another is possible to those who like belle have learnt to recognise the fact that the outside world exists for each one of us not in itself but in the effect which it produces on our consciousness two women are grinding at the mill the one weeps over the task the other smiles just as they choose to weep or smile the secret of the emotion lies not in the cosmic touch itself but in the way the consciousness receives it and in the picture which the imagination draws of our own condition the abstract truth the actual reality affects us not at all so belle raby as she looked out to the wild roses in the hedgerow and the yellow butterflies fluttering over the grey bloom of the flowering grasses saw nothing of the placid english landscape spread before her eyes she was standing on a faraway indian platform where the crows sat on the railings cawing irrelatively and a tall man in undress uniform was listening to those first wordsit is father that had been the beginning of it all the keynote both of the discords and harmony of the whole then suddenly as irrelatively perhaps as the cawing of the crows the scene changed the flood of sunshine faded to mirk and fog such mirk and fog as humanity and its ways creates in london on a dull november day an atmosphere of civilisation and culture say some perhaps but if so civilisation with all its advantages is apt to smell nasty she saw a man and a woman standing opposite each other in a london lodging in a london fog but five minutes before philip had come into it buoyantly decisively bringing with him a memory of sunshine and purer air now he stood with his back to the grey square of the window his hands stretched out to her in something between command and entreaty belle put down the child and let me speak to you and then for the first time she had gone over to him with the child still in her arms and kissed him jack will not trouble me dear she said he is such a quiet wee mite come let us sit down and talk it over now when lovers fall to talking hand in hand it is proper even in a novel to avert ones head and smile saying that the conversation can have no possible interest to outsiders or if a sentence or two be suggested it is necessary to insist that love divine love can only find its first expression in mere foolishness belle and philip therefore could evidently not have been lovers for they talked serious and sound good sense while the yearold jack with his wide wistful eyes lay in his mothers arms and listened to it all what was it to him if more than once a reluctant tear fell on his tiny wrinkled hands and more than once philips voice trembled and then stopped a while what were such emotions to a life which had come into the world barred from them forever for belles child would never be as other children are so much was certain whether he would ever need her care more than anothers was yet to be seen but it was strange was it not she seemed to hear herself saying in a calm voice the steadiness of which surprised her even at the time that poor dicks legacy had gone to a hospital for just such poor little godstricken children dont belledont for pitys sakei cant bear it that had been the mans cry bringing home to her the fact that she and philip had changed places in the old days a duty had lain between them a duty lay between them now why had she seen evil and shame in this mans love then and yet find none in it now then he had been calm and she had fretted now with another mans child in her arms and just the same love in her heart she had the decision and he the restless pain in those days no thought of such love as deals in marriage had ever arisen between them but now philip had come all the way from india full of a mans determination to end the story in what the world said was the only possible natural or moral ending to any lovestory and on such stories as theirs the worldly verdict runs thus they had loved each other when they could not marry which was very wrong but a kindly providence having removed the unnecessary husband they could marry which set everything right the mirk and fog settled very closely round them as they sate by the fire closer on philip than on belle for it was his turn to be scared by the phantom of foregone conclusions what he had strenuously denied when the position ran counter to his pride seemed true enough now that it joined issue with it he loved belle so of course he must want to marry her the two things were synonymous when of course there was a possibility of getting married yet belle even with tears in her eyes could smile as she told him that her first thought in life lay in her arms that she could not even give him hope in the future or bid him wait since the waiting might be forever that had been more than five years ago and there was still a smile on belle rabys face as she roused herself from her daydreams looked at her watch and turned back into the garden perhaps he had missed his train even if he had he would still come by and by to see how magnificently the roses were blooming that year there were roses everywhere wild in the hedgerows manycoloured in the borders white in the trailing sprays that climbed round about the verandahs of the low cottage which formed one wing of a plainer yet more important building beyond it was evidently the later addition of a different taste for the gardens surrounding them showed a like dissimilarity in the distance open stretches of wellkept lawns and wide gravelled paths civilised commonplace round the cottage a strip almost wild in its profusion of annuals its unpruned roses and the encircling shade of tall forest trees which must have stood there long before either the cottage or the pretentious building beyond had been thought of a strip of garden suggestive even to a casual observer of a less conventional fashion of life than is usual in the old country to belle as she stooped to push a tangle of larkspur within reasonable bounds it served as a reminiscence of days which with all their sadness she never ceased to regret she envied philip often philip in command of his regiment away on this expedition or that able to come back always to the sociable yet solitary existence so strangely free from the hurry and strain inseparable from life in the west philip whose name was known all along the frontier as the boldest soldier on it a perfect content for and in him glowed at her heart as with her hands clasped behind her she strolled back to the gate and there he was his head uncovered his pace quickening as he saw her her pulse quickened too but she composed herself to calm for they had a little game to play this middleaged man and woman a game which they had played with the utmost gravity on the rare occasions when fate brought them into each others presence your train is a little late today phil isnt it she asked as she held the gate open for him rather have you been waiting long his voice trembled a little in the effort to take it all as a matter of course though hers did not but then the novelty of environment was greater for him than for her how long is it this time phil i forget and after all what does it matter come and see the roses dear there are such a lot out this morning he stopped her for an instant by drawing the hand he held towards him and clasping it in both of his more roses than there were yesterday belle he asked with a sort of eager certainty in his tone she looked at him fondly yes more than yesterday then suddenly she laughed and laid her other hand on his i will say it dear since it pleases you there are more roses today because you have come and this is holidaytime their welcome was over they had stepped for a time into each others lives a ridiculous pretence of course a mere attempt to make imagination play the part assigned since all eternity to facts but if it pleased these two or if it pleases any number of persons who find facts are stubborn things why should the world quarrel with it belle had once on a time made herself unnecessarily miserable by imagining that she and philip were in love with each other and that since love was inextricably bound up with marriage or the desire for it she must be posing as the heroine of the thirdrate french novel her consequent loss of selfrespect had very nearly spoiled her life and even philip had never ventured to think what might have happened had john lived to force them into action the unreality of her past fears had come home to belle however during the long months when she had waited for her last legacy and with the first sight of the babyface whereon fate had set its mark of failure all too clearly had come a resolution that in the future nothing but her own beliefs should rule her conduct her life and philips should not be spoiled by other peoples ideas her imagination should be her slave not her master so much and more she had said to philip on that mirky day when in his first disappointment he had declared that he could not bear it but that had been five years ago and life seemed more than bearable as he walked round the garden with her hand drawn through his arm and held there caressingly a man who is in command of a regiment in which he has served since he was a boy whose heart is in his profession whose career has been successful has other interests in life besides marriage if he has not the less he figures as a hero even in a novel the better it is like nilgunj isnt it said belle pointing to the tangles of flowers with a difference you cant grow marechal niel roses in england they werewelloverpowering as i came through mildred has the garden very nice you would hardly recognise the place the trees you planted are taller than the house but everything grows fast in indiatheir eldest girl is up to my elbow oh and maud was there on a visit wearing out her old clothes she hasnt forgiven you yet belle for what she calls throwing away your money and becoming a hospital nurse i spent some time in trying to explain that you were simply spending your money in the way which pleased you best but it was no use she only said that caps were no doubt very becoming why dont you wear them belle you always tell me to take what pleasure i can out of life and i obey orders there was a pause ere he went on and charlie is quite a dandy more like you belle than i should have thought possible from my recollection of him as a youngster at faizapore allsop gives a firstrate account of him says he is working splendidly and allsop himself what a rare good fellow he is with just that touch of determination his race generally lack he is making the business pay now not as john would have done of course but it supports them and leaves something over for the bloated capitalist besides it is so much better for charlie than loafing about at home like the others you neednt tell me that phil said belle softly dont you think i see and understand all the good you have forced from what promised to be evil that is rather strong isnt it it would most likely have done as well without my interference things generally come right in the end especially if you trust other people at least that is my experience in the regiment by the way i went over to see the old khan when i was at nilgunj he is a bit broken though he wont allow it by his wifes death obstinate old hero he declares too that it is no satisfaction having his son back from the andamans because he is only out on ticketofleave he stickles for a full apology as if life would be endurable without a grievance of some kind or another if he only knew how i had backstaired and earwigged every official on the list over that business i wasted a whole months leave at simlawhich i might have saved up and spent on board a p and o steamer my dear it was during the rains and i seemed to live in a waterproof on my way to some burra sahib or another but my pride is all broken and gone to bits belle i shall be asking the authorities for a cieship some day if i dont take care well the old man sent you his salaam as usual said the women ruled the roost nowadays and in the same breath fell foul of them collectively because his daughterinlaw had not prepared some peculiar sherbet which old fatma always produced on state occasions not that haiyatbi minds his abuse now she has a husband to bully in her turn that says the khan is womens way since the beginning of time deceitful and instinct with guile and then belleyes then he brought out the old sword and here it is dear his and mine in the old way if only in the spirit he stood beside her stretching out his hands in the wellremembered fashion as if something sacred lay in them and before the tenderness in his face the calmness of hers wavered for an instant did we really go through all that together phil she asked with a tremble in her voice oh my dear my dear how much you have all given me and i giveso little but my pride is like yours all broken and gone to bits and i take everything i can get you should see how i beg for the hospital she turned to the big white building beyond the cottage as if to escape into another subject and philip turned also is itis it getting along nicely he asked dutifully yes dear she replied looking at him again with a smile but we shall have time to talk of that by and by you havent given me half the budget of news and do you know phil i begin to suspect that in writing you tell all the pleasant things and keep back the disagreeables now that isnt fair as children say it spoils the game does it well i wont do it again let me see what is the most unpleasant story i have heard for the last few months ahyes that is about the worst he paused with a frown well only shunker das is dead that isnt very distressful but you remember kirpo why philip it was her husband who yes of course of course but i was not thinking of that only of the day when she came out of the coolies hut with a child in her arms and told us why he was called nuttu well it is a horrid story belle but that pitiless old fatalist the khan who was my informant saw the hand of high heaven in it shunker got the telegram informing him that he was to be made a rai bahadur and another announcing his sons death by the same messenger ghastly wasnt it he had a fit and though he lived for some weeks they never could understand a word he said though he talked incessantly one can imagine what he wanted from the sequel well at his funeralpyre up turns kirpo with a strapping boy of about eight years old and there was an awful scene she swore it was shunkers son and made the child defile the ashes do you remember her face that day and how i said she hated somebody great heavens there is something perfectly devilish in the idea of such a revenge and yet we talk calmly enough of the sins of the fathers being visited on the children she paused as the church clock struck eleven it is time i went to see my bairns phil will you come too they will be at their best the outones just in from the garden the inones ready for their midday rest they look so comfortable all tucked up in their cots the bravest man winces sometimes and philip despite the five years had never forgotten that day of mirk and fog when he had first seen john rabys child and belle had bidden him go away if he could not be satisfied with what she had to give him to be satisfied or go away both it had seemed to him then equally impossible yet he had done both still the memory was painful you are going to build the new wing next year i suppose he said as indifferently as he could when leaving the shady wilderness they made their way along the gravel walks which were seamed in every direction by the wheelmarks of invalid carriages it depends she replied quickly answering the effort in his tone by a grateful look i may not have to build it i may not be here i am to go where i am most wanted that was settled long ago phil he was silent what was there to say side by side they climbed the terrace steps to reach the front of the hospital which looked right across a stretch of windswept down to the open sea a row of perambulators and wheeled couches stood under a glazed verandah and above the level lines of square windows the words smiths home for incurable children showed in big gold letters as a balustrade to the semigrecian facade belle glanced up at it before passing through the noiseless swinging doors i always wish i had been in time to stop that awful inscription she said but it was scarcely worth while pulling it all down you see none of them can read we take them young and those who stop dont live to be old that is one thing to be thankful for you dont like my speaking of it phil but i often wonder what would have become of this empty shell of a house if my jack had been born as most children are bornas i wished him to be born some one would have carried on the work i suppose if i hadnt and yetthese bairns might have been god knows where instead of in the sunlight she opened an inner door and signed to him to pass before her there was sunlight there and no lack of it though it shone on sights which to philip marsdens unaccustomed eyes seemed to dim the brightness rows of little crutches along the walls weary unchildlike faces resting on the low divans in the windows in the centre a more cheerful picture of little ones gathered round a table set with bread and milk this is my show room and these are my show babies said belle with a smile we all get about more or less and play by ourselves dont we nurse and some of us like georgie here are going home again because we are too strong for the place we dont keep noisy romping rioting ragamuffins do we children the face she turned up to hers as she passed grinned doubtfully but all the other little white faces dimpled and wrinkled with mirth at the very idea of georgies exile they went up stairs now into more sunshine streaming on rows of beds where childhood wore away with no pleasure beyond a languid joy at a new picturebook or a bunch of flowers here they trod softly for some of the little ones were already asleep where is freddy asked belle in a whisper of the nurse busy smoothing an empty cot he seemed so restless this morning maam that dr simmonds thought we had better put him in the white ward he was afraid belle passed on her face a shade graver and as philip followed her up another wide staircase she paused before a closed door and asked him to wait for her she would not be long he caught a glimpse of a smaller more homelike room white and still with the light shaded from the open windows then he stood leaning against the bannisters watching the dancing motes in a sunbeam slanting down from the skylight overhead a skylight looking as if it were glazed with sapphire that was the white ward said belle coming out and passing upward through the beam of light she spoke almost cheerfully but philip who had faced death and worse horrors than death many a time without a qualm felt himself shiver once again they paused before a closed door and she gave philip a hurried halfappealing glance before she said nervously i have jack in this ward now dr simmonds thinks it good for him to be with the other children and he seems to like it better it was the sunniest room of all for the windows were set wide open and the blinds drawn up the scent of the roses from belles garden drifted in with the cool fresh wind the children had evidently all been out for a pile of hats and cloaks lay on the table but they were now seated on their cots awaiting their turn for lunch philips eyes travelling down the row of beds rested on a crop of golden curls and he gave a little exclamation half groan half sigh that was a face he could not mistake strange and wistful as it was not an unintelligent face either and great heavens how like the fathers as it fell stricken to death listen said belle touching his arm a nurse passing with a tray paused in pleased expectancy jack her voice echoed softly through the silence the golden head turned the veriest ghost of a smile came to the pinched face and the thin little hands stretched themselves aimlessly into space with a sudden plaintive cry which sent a lump to philips throat lor protested the nurse full of pride didnt he say it beautiful clear that time mother yes it is mother my pretty and you knows her voice dont you dearie just as well as any on us belle sate down on the cot gathering the child in her arms and the yellow curls nestled down contentedly on her shoulder a mite of a boy with great wide blue eyes fixed on the only face he ever recognises do you think him grown at all she asked then seeing philips look bent over the child and kissed the blue veins on the large forehead there was a passion of protection in her kisses if he were the only one phil i should break my heart about it but there are so manyandand it is so causeless her eyes seemed to pass beyond the child and she went on more cheerfully then he is such a contented little fellow when he is with mearent you jack again came the ghost of a smile and the same plaintive cry philip walked to the window and looked out on the roses it was a very slight thing that cry to have come between a man and a womanif it had come between them he turned to look at belle instinctively and found her looking at him no nothing had come between them before the insoluble problem of what belle held in her arms love seemed to him forever divorced from marriage the veriest pariah born of god knows what or of whom the outcome of the basest passion might enter the world fair and strong and capable while their child if they married bringing each to each a pure devotion might be as these children here he crossed the room again and sate down on the bed beside her how many have you in the hospital now he asked in a low voice for jack contented and comfortable was evidently falling asleep fifty but dr simmonds says he could fill a hundred beds tomorrow it is the best place he declares of its kind would you undertake so much she shook her head i never knowno one knows from day to day they are all so frail freddy for instance was no worse yesterday and today there are plenty to fill my place here whenwhen the time comes it may never come besides he added i may be incurable myself ere long dont you remember promising me the gatekeepers place if ever i was pensioned off minus a leg or an arm did i she answered in the same light tone as she rose to lay little jack on his pillow and draw the blanket over him then i must warn the present old cripple that his place isnt a permanent one isnt he like his father phil she added laying her hand on the childs pretty soft curls very they passed along the sunny corridors again and so out into the open air philip drew his hand over his forehead as if to brush away puzzling thoughts and gave a sigh of relief come down to the cliffs with me belle he said there is plenty of time before lunch and i feel as if i wanted a blow its rather an irrelevant remark but i wonder what will become of the babies if women become men they crossed the downs keeping step together and walking rapidly as if to leave something behind finally seating themselves in a niche between two great white pillars of chalk whence they could see the waves ebbing and flowing among the rocks at their feet the horizon and the sky were blent into one pale blue so that the fishing boats with their redbrown sails seemed hovering between earth and heaven how long is it this time she asked after a pause the usual three months yes the usual three months from the frontier that leaves me six weeks with you six whole weeks there was another pause philip she said suddenly ill marry you tomorrow if you likeifif it would make you happier he was sitting with his hands between his knees looking out absently over the waves below he did not stir but she could see a smile struggling with his gravity my dear belle the banns havent been called perhaps we could afford a special license on the easypurchase system by monthly instalments she suggested quite as gravely but really philip when i see you growing so old dont be afraid of the truth belle am i very bald bald no but you are grizzling fast phil and when the fact is brought home to me by seeing it afresh i ask myself why you shouldnt have a wife and children i could of course there are plenty of young ladies now on the frontier oh belle i thought we had settled this long ago you cant leave jack you wouldnt with a clear conscience if you could i cant leave the regiment i shouldnt like to if i could is not that an end of marriage from our point of view besides he turned to her now with a smile full of infinite tenderness i am not at all sure that i do want to marry you when perfection comes into a mans life can you not understand his being a little afraid philip not of you dear but this love of ours seems better than we are ourselvesthan i am certainly then marriage as i take it is for young people and what they call love is the bribe held out by nature to induce her thoughtless children to undertake a difficult duty the sweet isnt unwholesome in itself but that is no reason why we should call it manna from heaven and say it is better than plain wholesome bread and butter you are growing detestably didactic in your old age phil when you come to the gatekeepers house i shall have to amend your ways you forget i shall be incurable then but you are right i am fast becoming a real old crusted military fogy and of all fogies that is the worst you cant think what a nuisance i am to the boys at mess they depute a fresh one to prose to the colonel every night i know better when young cameron came home sick he had a very different story young cameron isnt to be trusted to begin with he had had a sunstroke and then he proposed marrying on subalterns pay well you cant expect the world to give up falling in love because you dont approve let it fall by all means only let us call things by their proper names you and i belle know the trouble which follows on the present confusion and if we eminently respectable people suffered much many must suffer more many why the question is marriage a failure fills up the interstices of conversation left between the rights of labour and home rule how can it be anything but a failure when people are taught to expect impossibilities when they are told that love is better than duty thank heaven we never were in love with one another never noat leastyes perhaps i was one day do you remember when you kissed your cousin dick in the church garden at faizapore i was decidedly jealous as i stood by the canal bridge if he had lived belle i think you would have married him she did not answer but sate softly smiling to herself so long ago as that she said at last in a contented tone of voice philip started to his feet with a halfembarrassed laugh even now after all these years her womans nature in its utter inconsequence was a puzzle to himperhaps to herself come he said prosaically im sure it must be time for lunch are you so very hungry she asked dusting from her dress with something of regret in the action the sweetsmelling herbs which she had idly gathered from the crannies of the cliff and crumbled to pieces for the sake of their perfume i ought to be seeing i had no breakfast she started up in her turn philip how could you and never to tell me you see we were late all through something went wrong somewhere and then i had to catch the ten oclock train dont look horrified i got a stale bun at swindon stale buns are most unwholesome that is what materialists like you always say of any diet which does not suit them personally i like stale buns you mean that you can put up with them when you have a solid lunch in prospect he had taken her hand to help her to the level and now suddenly he paused and stooping kissed it passionately oh belle my darling why should we talk or think of the future today is holidaytime and i am happy so hand in hand like a couple of children they went homewards across the down while the great gilt letters of the legend above the hospital glowed and shone like a message of fire against the blue sky was that the end of the story so far as belle and philip were concerned or on some other sunshiny day in a future june or december did those two pass through the churchyard where the tiny flowerset graves grew more numerous year by year and beneath the tower whose chime had so often called belle to her bairns take each other for better for worse most likely they did but it is a trivial detail which has nothing to do with the record of miss stuarts legacy that began with her father and ended with her child she paid it cheerfully to the uttermost farthing and was none the worse for it such payments indeed leave us no poorer unless we choose to have it so the only intolerable tax being that which follows on the attempt to inherit opinions for when we have paid it we have nothing in exchange save something that is neither real
