chapter xxvii chapter xxviii chapter xxix chapter xxx chapter xxxi chapter xxxii chapter i the history of the circumstances about to be related began many years agoor so it seems in these days it began at least years before the world being rocked to and fro revealed in the pause between each of its heavings some startling suggestion of a new arrangement of its kaleidoscopic particles and then immediately a rearrangement and another and another until all belief in a permanency of design seemed lost and the inhabitants of the earth waited helplessly gazing at changing stars and colours in a degree of mental chaos its opening incidents may be dated from a period when people still had reason to believe in permanency and had indeed many of themsometimes through ingenuousness sometimes through stupidity of typeacquired a singular confidence in the importance and stability of their possessions desires ambitions and forms of conviction london at the time in common with other great capitals felt itself rather final though priding itself on being much more fluid and adaptable than it had been fifty years previously in speaking of itself it at least dealt with fixed customs and conditions and established facts connected with themwhich gave rise to brilliantor dullwitticisms one of these heard not infrequently was to the effect thatin londonone might live under an umbrella if one lived under it in the right neighbourhood and on the right side of the street which axiom is the reason that a certain child through the first six years of her life sat on certain days staring out of a window in a small dingy room on the top floor of a slice of a house on a narrow but highly fashionable london street and looked on at the passing of motors carriages and people in the dull afternoon grayness the room was exalted above its station by being called the day nursery and another room equally dingy and uninviting was known as the night nursery the slice of a house was inhabited by the very pretty mrs garethlawless its inordinate rent being reluctantly paid by herapparently with the assistance of those ravens who are expected to supply the truly deserving the rent was inordinate only from the standpoint of one regarding it soberly in connection with the character of the house itself which was a gaudy little kennel crowded between two comparatively stately mansions on one side lived an inordinately rich south african millionaire and on the other an inordinately exalted person of title which facts combined to form sufficient grounds for a certain inordinateness of rent mrs garethlawless was also it may be stated of the fibre which must live on the right side of the street or dissolve into nothingnesssince as nearly nothingness as an embodied entity can achieve had nature seemingly created her at the outset so light and airy was the fair slim physical presentation of her being to the earthly vision and so almost impalpably diaphanous the texture and form of mind and character to be observed by human perception that among such friendsand enemiesas so slight a thing could claim she was prettily known as feather her real name amabel was not half as charming and whimsical in its appropriateness feather she adored being called and as it was the fashion among the amazing if amusing circle in which she spent her life to call its acquaintances fantastic pet names selected from among the world of birds beasts and fishes or inanimate objectsfeather she floated through her curious existence and it so happened that she was the mother of the child who so often stared out of the window of the dingy and comfortless day nursery too much a child to be more than vaguely conscious in a chaotic way that a certain feeling which at times raged within her and made her little body hot and restless was founded on something like actual hate for a special man who had certainly taken no deliberate steps to cause her detestation feather had not been called by that delicious name when she married robert garethlawless who was a beautiful and irresponsibly rather than deliberately bad young man she was known as amabel darrel and the loveliest girl in the lovely corner of the island of jersey where her father a country doctor had begotten a large family of lovely creatures and brought them up on the appallingly inadequate proceeds of his totally inadequate practice pretty female things must be disposed of early lest their market value decline therefore a wellborn young man even without obvious resources represents a sail in the offing which is naturally welcomed as possibly belonging to a bark which may at least bear away a burden which the back carrying it as part of its pack will willingly shuffle on to other shoulders it is all very well for a man with six lovely daughters to regard them as capital if he has money or position or generous relations or if he has energy and an ingenious unfatigued mind but a man who is tired and neither clever nor important in any degree and who has reared his brood in one of the channel islands with a faded silly unattractive wife as his only aid in any difficulty is wise in leaving the whole hopeless situation to chance and luck sometimes luck comes without assistance butalmost invariablyit does not featherwho was then amabelthought robert garethlawless incredible good luck he only drifted into her summer by merest chance because a friends yacht in which he was wandering about came in for supplies a girl ariel in a thin white frock and with big larkspur blue eyes yearning at you under her flapping hat as she answers your questions about the best road to somewhere will not be too difficult about showing the way herself and there you are at a firstclass beginning the night after she met garethlawless in a lane whose banks were thick with bluebells amabel and her sister alice huddled close together in bed and talked almost pantingly in whispers over the possibilities which might reveal themselvesgod willingthrough a further acquaintance with mr garethlawless they were eager and breathlessly anxious but they were youngyoung in their eagerness and amabel was full of delight in his good looks he is so handsome alice she whispered actually hugging her not with affection but exultation and he cant be more than twentysix or seven and im sure he liked me you know that way a man has of looking at youone sees it even in a place like this where there are only curates and things he has brown eyeslike dark bright water in pools oh alice if he should alice was not perhaps as enthusiastic as her sister amabel had seen him first and in the darrel household there was a sort of unwritten not always observed code flimsily founded on first come first served just at the outset of an acquaintance one might say hands off as it were but not for long it doesnt matter how pretty one is they seldom do alice grumbled and he maynt have a farthing alice whispered amabel almost agonizingly i wouldnt care a farthingif only he would have i a farthinghave you a farthinghas anyone who ever comes here a farthing he lives in london hed take me away to live even in a back street in london would be heaven and one mustas soon as one possibly canone must and oh with another hug which this time was a shudder think of what doris harmer had to do think of his thick red old neck and his horrid fatness and the way he breathed through his nose doris said that at first it used to make her ill to look at him shes got over it whispered alice shes almost as fat as he is now and shes loaded with pearls and things i shouldnt have to get over anything said amabel if this one would i could fall in love with him in a minute did you hear what father said alice brought out the words rather slowly and reluctantly she was not eager on the whole to yield up a detail which after all added glow to possible prospects which from her point of view were already irritatingly glowing yet she could not resist the impulse of excitement no you didnt hear you were out of the room what about something about him i hope it wasnt horrid how could it be he said alice drawled with a touch of girlishly spiteful indifference that if he was one of the poor garethlawlesses he hadnt much chance of succeeding to the title his unclelord lawdoris only fortyfive and he has four splendid healthy boysperfect little giants oh i didnt know there was a title how splendid exclaimed amabel rapturously then after a few moments innocent maiden reflection she breathed with sweet hopefulness from under the sheet children so often have scarlet fever or diphtheria and you know they say those very strong ones are more likely to die than the other kind the vicar of sheen lost four all in a week and the vicar died too the doctor said the diphtheria wouldnt have killed him if the shock hadnt helped alicewho had a teaspoonful more brain than her sisterburst into a fit of giggling it was necessary to smother by stuffing the sheet in her mouth oh amabel she gurgled you are such a donkey you would have been silly enough to say that even if people could have heard you suppose he had why should he care said amabel simply one cant help thinking things if it happened he would be the earl of lawdor and she fell again into sweet reflection while alice giggled a little more then she herself stopped and thought also after all perhaps one had to be practical the tenor of her thoughts was such that she did not giggle again when amabel broke the silence by whispering with tremulous soft devoutness alicedo you think that praying really helps ive prayed for things but i never got them answered alice but you know what the vicar said on sunday in sermon about ask and ye shall receive perhaps you havent prayed in the right spirit amabel suggested with true piety shall weshall we try let us get out of bed and kneel down get out of bed and kneel down yourself was alices sympathetic rejoinder you wouldnt take that much trouble for me amabel sat up on the edge of the bed in the faint moonlight and her white nightgown she was almost angelic she held the end of the long fair soft plait hanging over her shoulder and her eyes were full of reproach i think you ought to take some interest she said plaintively you know there would be more chances for you and the othersif i were not here ill wait until you are not here replied the unstirred alice but amabel felt there was no time for waiting in this particular case a yacht which came in might so soon put out she knelt down clasping her slim young hands and bending her forehead upon them in effect she implored that divine wisdom might guide mr robert garethlawless in the much desired path she also made divers promises because nothing is so easy as to promise things she ended with a gently fervent appeal thatif her prayer were grantedsomething might happen which would result in her becoming a countess of lawdor one could not have put the request with greater tentative delicacy she felt quite uplifted and a trifle saintly when she rose from her knees alice had actually fallen asleep already and she sighed quite tenderly as she slipped into the place beside her almost as her lovely little head touched the pillow her own eyes closed then she was asleep herselfand in the faintly moonlit room with the long soft plait trailing over her shoulder looked even more like an angel than before whether or not as a result of this touching appeal to the throne of grace robert garethlawless did in three months there was a wedding at the very ancient village church and the flowerlike bridesmaids followed a flower of a bride to the altar and later in the day to the station from where mr and mrs robert garethlawless went on their way to london perhaps alice and olive also knelt by the side of their white beds the night after the wedding for on that propitious day two friends of the bridegroomsone of them the owner of the yachtdecided to return again to the place where there were to be found the most nymphlike of pretty creatures a man had ever by any chance beheld such delicate little fair crowned heads such delicious little tiptilted noses and slim white throats such ripples of gay chatter and nonsense when a man has fortune enough of his own why not take the prettiest thing he sees so alice and olive were borne away also and poor mr and mrs darrel breathed sighs of relief and there were not only more chances but causes for bright hopefulness in the once crowded house which now had rooms to spare a certain inattention on the part of the deity was no doubt responsible for the fact that something did not happen to the family of lord lawdor on the contrary his four little giants of sons throve astonishingly and a few months after the garethlawless wedding lady lawdora trifle effusively as it werepresented her husband with twin male infants so robust that they were humorously known for years afterwards as the twin herculeses by that time amabel had become feather and despite roberts ingenious and carefully detailed method of living upon nothing whatever had many reasons for knowing that life is a back street in london is not a matter of beds of roses since the back street must be the right street and its accompaniments must wear an aspect of at least seeming to belong to the right order of detachment and fashionable ease one was always in debt and forced to keep out of the way of duns and obliged to pretend things and tell lies with aptness and outward gaiety sometimes one actually was so far driven to the wall that one could not keep most important engagements and the invention of plausible excuses demanded absolute genius the slice of a house between the two big ones was a rash feature of the honeymoon but a year of giving smart little dinners in it and going to smart big dinners from it in a smart if small brougham ended in a condition somewhat akin to the feat of balancing oneself on the edge of a sword then robin was born she was an intruder and a calamity of course nobody had contemplated her for a moment feather cried for a week when she first announced the probability of her advent afterwards however she managed to forget the approaching annoyance and went to parties and danced to the last hour continuing to be a great success because her prettiness was delicious and her diaphanous mentality was no strain upon the minds of her admirers male and female that a feather should become a parent gave rise to much wit of light weight when robin in the form of a bundle of lace was carried down by her nurse to be exhibited in the gaudy crowded little drawingroom in the slice of a house in the mayfair street it was the head of the house of coombe who asked the first question about her what will you do with her he inquired detachedly the frequently referred to babe unborn could not have presented a gaze of purer innocence than did the lovely feather her eyes of larkspur blueness were clear of any thought or intention as spring water is clear at its unclouded best her ripple of a laugh was clear alsoenchantingly clear do repeated what is it people do with babies i suppose the nurse knows i dont i wouldnt touch her for the world she frightens me she floated a trifle nearer and bent to look at her i shall call her robin she said her name is really roberta as she couldnt be called robert people will turn round to look at a girl when they hear her called robin besides she has eyes like a robin i wish shed open them and let you see by chance she did open them at the momentquite slowly they were dark liquid brown and seemed to be all lustrous iris which gazed unmovingly at the object in of focus that object was the head of the house of coombe she is staring at me there is antipathy in her gaze he said and stared back unmovingly also but with a sort of cold interest chapter ii the head of the house of coombe was not a title to be found in burke or debrett it was a fine irony of the heads own and having been accepted by his acquaintances was not infrequently used by them in their light moments in the same spirit the peerage recorded him as a marquis and added several lesser attendant titles when english society was respectable even to stodginess at times was his point of view to be born the head of the house was a weighty and aweinspiring thing in fearful private denunciatory interviews with ones parents and governors it was brought up against one as a final argument against immoral conduct such as debt and not going to church as the head of the house one was called upon to be an example in the country one appeared in ones pew and announced oneself a miserable sinner in loud tones one had to invite the rector to dinner with regularity and the ladies of ones family gave tea and flannel petticoats and baby clothes to cottagers men and women were known as ladies and gentlemen in those halcyon days one represented thingsparties in parliamentbenevolent societies and british hospitality in the form of astounding long dinners at which one drank healths and made speeches in roseate youth one danced the schottische and the polka and the round waltz which lord byron denounced as indecent to recall the vigour of his poem gives rise to a smilewhen one chances to sup at a cabaret he was considered very amusing when he analyzed his own mental attitude towards his world in general i was born somewhat too late and somewhat too early he explained in his light rather cold and detached way i was born and educated at the closing of one era and have to adjust myself to living in another i was as it were cradled among treasured relics of the ethics of the georges and queen charlotte and queen victoria in her bloom i was in my bloom in the days when ladies were reproved for wearing dresses cut too low at drawing rooms such training gives curious interest to fashions in which bodices are unconsidered trifles and greek nymphs who dance with bare feet and beautiful bare legs may be ones own relations i trust i do not seem even in the shadowiest way to comment unfavourably i merely look on at the rapidities of change with unalloyed interest as the head of the house of coombe i am not sure what i am an example ofor to which is why i at times regard myself in that capacity with a slightly ribald lightness the detachment of his question with regard to the newborn infant of the airily irresponsible feather was in entire harmony with his attitude towards the singular incident of life as illustrated by the world the flesh and the devil by none of which he wasas far as could be observedeither impressed disturbed or prejudiced his own experience had been richly varied and practically unlimited in its opportunities for pleasure sinful or unsinful indulgence mitigated or unmitigated wickedness the gathering of strange knowledge and the possible ignoring of all dull boundaries this being the case a superhuman charity alone could have forborne to believe that his opportunities had been neglected in the heyday of his youth wealth and lack of limitations in themselves would have been quite enough to cause the nonconformist victorian mind to regard a youngor middleagedmale as likely to represent a fearsome moral example but these three temptations combined with good looks and a certain mental brilliance were so inevitably the concomitants of elegant iniquity that the results might be taken for granted that the various worlds in which he lived in various lands accepted him joyfully as an interesting and desirable of more or less abominably sinful personage the head of the house of coombeeven many years before he became its headregarded with the detachment which he had even much earlier begun to learn why should it be in the least matter what people thought of one why should it in the least matter what one thought of oneselfand thereforewhy should one think at all he had begun at the outset a brilliantly happy young pagan with this simple theory after the passing of some years he had not been quite so happy but had remained quite as pagan and retained the theory which had lost its first fine careless rapture and gained a secret bitterness he had not married and innumerable stories were related to explain the reason why they were most of them quite false and none of them quite true when he ceased to be a young man his delinquency was much discussed more especially when his father died and he took his place as the head of his family he was old enough rich enough important enough for marriage to be almost imperative but he remained unmarried in addition he seemed to consider his abstinence entirely an affair of his own are you as wicked as people say you are a reckless young woman once asked him she belonged to the younger set which was that season trying recklessness in a tentative way as a new fashion i really dont know it is so difficult to decide he answered i could tell better if i knew exactly what wickedness is when i find out i will let you know so good of you to take an interest thirty years earlier he knew that a young lady who had heard he was wicked would have perished in flames before immodestly mentioning the fact to him but might have delicately attempted to offer first aid to reformation by approaching with sweetness the subject of going to church the reckless young woman looked at him with an attention which he was far from being blind enough not to see was increased by his answer i never know what you mean she said almost wistfully neither do i was his amiable response and i am sure it would not be worth while going into really we neither of us know what we mean perhaps i am as wicked as i know how to be and i may have painful limitationsor i may not after his fathers death he spent rather more time in london and rather less in wandering over the face of the globe but by the time he was forty he knew familiarly far countries and near and was intimate with most of the peoples thereof he could have found his way about blindfolded in the most distinctive parts of most of the great cities he had seen and learned many things the most absorbing to his mind had been the ambitions and changes of nations statesmen rulers and those they ruled or were ruled by courts and capitals knew him and his opportunities were such as gave him all ease as an onlooker he was outwardly of the type which does not arouse caution in talkers and he heard much which was suggestive even to illumination from those to whom he remained unsuspected of being a man who remembered things long and was astute in drawing conclusions the fact remained however that he possessed a remarkable memory and one which was not a ragbag filled with unassorted and particoloured remnants but a large and orderly space whose contents were catalogued and filed and well enclosed from observation he was also given to the mental argument which follows a point to its conclusion as a mere habit of mind he saw and knew well those who sat and pondered with knit brows and cautiously hovering hand at the great chessboard which is formed by the map of europe he found an enormous interest in watching their play it was his fortune as a result of his position to know persons who wore crowns and a natural incident in whose lives it was to receive the homage expressed by the uncovering of the head and the bending of the knee at forty he looked back at the time when the incongruousness the abnormality and the unsteadiness of the foundations on which such personages stood first struck him the realization had been in its almost sacrilegious novelty and daring a sort of thunderbolt passing through his mind he had at the time spoken of it only to one person i have no moral or ethical views to offer he had said i only see the thingas it iswill disintegrate i am so at sea as to what will take its place that i feel as if the prospect were rather horrible one has had the old landmarks and been impressed by the old pomp and picturesqueness so many centuries that one cannot see the earth without them there have been kings even in the cannibal islands as a statesman or a diplomat he would have seen far but he had been too much occupied with life as an entertainment too selfindulgent for work of any order he freely admitted to himself that he was a worthless person but the fact did not disturb him having been born with a certain order of brain it observed and worked in spite of him thereby adding flavour and interest to existence but that was all it cannot be said that as the years passed he quite enjoyed the fact that he knew he was rarely spoken of to a stranger without its being mentioned that he was the most perfectly dressed man in london he rather detested the idea though he was aware that the truth was unimpeachable the perfection of his accompaniments had arisen in his youth from a secret feeling for fitness and harmony texture and colour gave him almost abnormal pleasure his expression of this as a masculine creature had its limits which resulted in a concentration on perfection even at fiveandtwenty however he had never been called a dandy and even at fiveandforty no one had as yet hinted at beau brummel though by that time men as well as women frequently described to each other the cut and colour of the garments he wore and tailors besought him to honour them with crumbs of his patronage in the ambitious hope that they might mention him as a client and the simple fact that he appeared in a certain colour or cut set it at once on its way to become a fashion to be seized upon worn and exaggerated until it was dropped suddenly by its originator and lost in the oblivion of cheap imitations and cheap tailor shops the first exaggeration of the harmony he had created and the original was seen no more feather herself had a marvellous trick in the collecting of her garments it was a trick which at times barely escaped assuming the proportions of absolute creation her passion for selfadornment expressed itself in ingenious combination and quite startling uniqueness of line now and then her slim fairness and ashgold gossamer hair carried airily strange tilts and curves of little or large hats or daring tints other women could not sustain but invariably strove to imitate however disastrous the results beneath soft drooping or oddly flopping brims hopelessly unbecoming to most faces hers looked out quaintly lovely as a pictured childs wearing its grandmothers bonnet everything draped itself about or clung to her in entrancing folds which however whimsical were never grotesque things are always becoming to me she said quite simply but often i stick a few pins into a dress to tuck it up here and there or if i give a hat a poke somewhere to make it crooked they are much more becoming people are always asking me how i do it but i dont know how i bought a hat from cerise last week and i gave it two little thumps with my fistone in the crown and one in the brim and they made it wonderful the maid of the most grand kind of person tried to find out from my maid where i bought it i wouldnt let her tell of course she created fashions and was imitated as was the head of the house of coombe but she was enraptured by the fact and the entire power of such gray matter as was held by her small brain cells was concentrated upon her desire to evolve new fantasies and amazements for her world before he had been married for a year there began to creep into the mind of bob garethlawless a fearsome doubt remotely hinting that she might end by becoming an awful bore in the course of timeparticularly if she also ended by being less pretty she chattered so incessantly about nothing and was such an emptyheaded extravagant little fool in her insistence on clothesclothesclothesas if they were the breath of life after watching her for about two hours one morning as she sat before her mirror directing her maid to arrange and rearrange her hair in different stylesin delicate puffs and curls and straying ringssoft bands and loopsin braids and coilshe broke forth into an uneasy short laugh and expressed himselfthough she did not know he was expressing himself and would not have understood him if she had if you have a souland im not at all certain you have he said its divided into a dressmakers and a hairdressers and a milliners shop its full of tumbled piles of hats and frocks and diamond combs its an awful mess feather i hope its a shoe shop and a jewellers as well she laughed quite gaily and a lacemakers i need every one of them its a rag shop he said it has nothing but chiffons in it if ever i do think of souls i think of them as silly gauzy things floating about like little balloons was her cheerful response thats an idea he answered with a rather louder laugh yours might be made of pink and blue gauze spangled with those things you call paillettes the fancy attracted her if i had one like thatwith a pleased creative air it would look rather ducky floating from my shoulderor even my hator my hair in the evenings just held by a tiny sparkling chain fastened with a diamond pinand with lovely little pink and blue streamers with the touch of genius she had at once relegated it to its place in the scheme of her universe and robert laughed even louder than before you mustnt make me laugh she said holding up her hand i am having my hair done to match that quakery thin pale mousey dress with the tiny poke bonnetand i want to try my face too i must look sweet and demure you mustnt really laugh when you wear a dress and hat like that you must only smile some months earlier bob would have found it difficult to believe that she said this entirely without any touch of humour but he realized now that it was so said he had some sense of humour of his own and one of his reasons for vaguely feeling that she might become a bore was that she had none whatever it was at the garden party where she wore the thin quakery mousey dress and tiny poke bonnet that the head of the house of coombe first saw her it was at the place of a fashionable artist who lived at hampstead and had a garden and a few fine old trees it had been feathers special intention to strike this note of delicate dim colour every other woman was blue or pink or yellow or white or flowered and she in her filmy coolness of unusual hue stood out exquisitely among them other heads wore hats broad or curved or flopping hers looked like a little nuns or an imaginary portrait of a delicious young greatgrandmother she was more arresting than any other female creature on the emerald sward or under the spreading trees when coombes eyes first fell upon her he was talking to a group of people and he stopped speaking someone standing quite near him said afterwards that he had for a second or so become palealmost as if he saw something which frightened him who is that under the copper beechbeing talked to by harlow he inquired feather was in fact listening with a gentle air and with her eyelids down drooped to the exact line harmonious with the angelic little poke bonnet it is mrs robert garethlawlessfeather we call her he was answered was there ever anything more artful than that startling little smoky dress if it was flame colour one wouldnt see it as quickly one wouldnt look at it as long said coombe one is in danger of staring and the little hator bonnetwhich pokes and is fastened under her pink ear by a satin bow held by a loose pale bud will someone rescue me from staring by leading me to her it wont be staring if i am talking to her please the paleness appeared again as on being led across the grass he drew nearer to the copper beech he was still rather pale when feather lifted her eyes to him her eyes were so shaped by nature that they looked like an angels when they were lifted there are eyes of that particular cut but he had not talked to her fifteen minutes before he knew that there was no real reason why he should ever again lose his colour at the sight of her he had thought at first there was with the perception which invariably marked her sense of fitness of things she had begun in the course of the fifteen minutesalmost before the colour had quite returned to his facethe story of her husbands idea of her soul as a balloon of pink and blue gauze spangled with paillettes and of her own inspiration of wearing it floating from her shoulder or her hair by the light sparkling chainand with delicate ribbon streamers she was much delighted with his laughthough she thought it had a rather cracked harsh sound she knew he was an important person and she always felt she was being a success when people laughed exquisite he said i shall never see you in the future without it but wouldnt it be necessary to vary the colour at times oh yesto match things seriously i couldnt wear a pink and blue one with this glancing over the smoky mousey thing or paillettes oh nonot paillettes he agreed almost with gravity the harsh laugh having ended one couldnt imagine the exact colour in a moment one would have to think she reflected perhaps a misty dim bluey thinglike the edge of a raincloudscarcely a colour at all for an instant her eyes were softly shadowed as if looking into a dream he watched her fixedly then a woman who was a sort of angel might look like that when she was asking herself how much her pure soul might dare to pray for then he laughed again and feather laughed also many practical thoughts had already begun to follow each other hastily through her mind it would be the best possible thing for them if he really admired her bob was having all sorts of trouble with people they owed money to bills were sent in again and again and disagreeable letters were written her dressmaker and milliner had given her most rude hints which could indeed be scarcely considered hints at all she scarcely dared speak to their smart young footman who she knew had only taken the place in the slice of a house because he had been told that it might be an opening to better things she did not know the exact summing up at the agency had been as follows theyre a good looking pair and hes lord lawdors nephew theyre bound to have their fling and smart people will come to their house because shes so pretty theyll last two or three years perhaps and youll open the door to the kind of people who remember a well setup young fellow if he shows he knows his work above the usual the more men of the class of the head of the house of coombe who came in and out of the slice of a house the more likely the owners of it were to get good invitations and continued credit feather was aware besides which she thought ingenuously if he was rich he would no doubt lend bob money she had already known that certain men who liked her had done it she did not mind it at all one was obliged to have money this was the beginning of an acquaintance which gave rise to much argument over teacups and at dinner parties and in boudoirseven in corners of feathers own gaudy little drawingroom the argument regarded the degree of coombes interest in her there was always curiosity as to the degree of his interest in any womanespecially and privately on the part of the woman herself casual and shallow observers said he was quite infatuated if such a thing were possible to a man of his temperament the more concentrated of mind said it was not possible to a man of his temperament and that any attraction feather might have for him was of a kind special to himself and that he alone could explain itand he would not remained however the fact that he managed to see a great deal of her it might be said that he even rather followed her about and more than one among the specially concentrated of mind had seen him on occasion stand apart a little and look at herwatch herwith an expression suggesting equally profound thought and the profound intention to betray his private meditations in no degree there was no shadow of profundity of thought in his treatment of her he talked to her as she best liked to be talked to about herself her successes and her clothes which were more successful than anything else he went to the little but exceedingly lively dinners the garethlawlesses gave and though he was understood not to be fond of dancing now and then danced with her at balls feather was guilelessly doubtless concerning him she was quite sure that he was in love with her her idea of that universal emotion was that it was a matter of clothes and propinquity and loveliness and that if one were at all clever one got things one wanted as a result of it her overwhelming affection for bob and his for her had given her life in london and its entertaining accompaniments her frankness in the matter of this desirable capture when she talked to her husband was at once light and friendly of course you will be able to get credit at his tailors as you know him so well she said when i persuaded him to go with me to madame hlnes last week she was quite amiable he helped me to choose six dresses and i believe she would have let me choose six more does she think he is going to pay for them asked bob it doesnt matter what she thinks feather laughed very prettily doesnt it not a bit i shall have the dresses whats the matter rob you look quite red and cross ive had a headache for three days he answered and i feel hot and cross i dont care about a lot of things you say feather dont be silly she retorted i dont care about a lot of things you sayand do too for the matter of that robert garethlawless who was sitting on a chair in her dressingroom grunted slightly as he rubbed his red and flushed forehead theres asort of limit he commented he hesitated a little before he added sulkily to the things onesays that sounds like alice was her undisturbed answer she used to squabble at me because i said things but i believe one of the reasons people like me is because i make them laugh by saying things lord coombe laughs he is a very good person to know she added practically somehow he counts dont you recollect how before we knew himwhen he was abroad so longpeople used to bring him into their talk as if they couldnt help remembering him and what he was like i knew quite a lot about himabout his cleverness and his manners and his way of keeping women off without being rudeand the things he says about royalties and the aristocracy going out of fashion and about his clothes i adore his clothes and im convinced he adores mine she had in fact at once observed his clothes as he had crossed the grass to her seat under the copper beech she had seen that his fine thinness was inimitably fitted and presented itself to the eye as that final note of perfect line which ignores any possibility of comment he did not wear thingsthey were expressions of his mental subtleties feather on her part knew that she wore her clothescarried them about with herhowever beautifully i like him she went on i dont know anything about political parties and the state of europe so i dont understand the things he says which people think are so brilliant but i like him he isnt really as old as i thought he was the first day i saw him he had a haggard look about his mouth and eyes then he looked as if a spangled pink and blue gauze soul with little floating streamers was a relief to him the child robin was a year old by that time and staggered about uncertainly in the dingy little day nursery in which she passed her existence except on such occasions as her nursewho had promptly fallen in love with the smart young footmancarried her down to the kitchen and servants hall in the basement where there was an earthy smell and an abundance of cockroaches the servants hall had been given that name in the catalogue of the fashionable agents who let the home and it was as cramped and grimy as the two topfloor nurseries the next afternoon robert garethlawless staggered into his wifes drawingroom and dropped on to a sofa staring at her and breathing hard feather he gasped dont know whats up with me i believe imawfully ill i cant see straight cant think he fell over sidewise on to the cushions so helplessly that feather sprang at him dont rob dont she cried in actual anguish lord coombe is taking us to the opera and to supper afterwards im going to wear she stopped speaking to shake him and try to lift his head oh do try to sit up she begged pathetically just try dont give up till afterwards but she could neither make him sit up nor make him hear he lay back heavily with his mouth open breathing stertorously and quite insensible it happened that the head of the house of coombe was announced at that very moment even as she stood wringing her hands over the sofa he went to her side and looked at garethlawless have you sent for a doctor he inquired hesonly just done it she exclaimed its more than i can bear you said the prince would be at the supper after the opera and were you thinking of going he put it to her quietly i shall have to send for a nurse of course she began he went so far as to interrupt her you had better not goif youll pardon my saying so he suggested not go not go at all she wailed not go at all was his answer and there was such entire lack of encouragement in it that feather sat down and burst into sobs in few than two weeks robert was dead and she was left a lovely penniless widow with a child chapter iii two or three decades earlier the prevailing sentiment would have been that poor little mrs garethlawless and her situation were pathetic her acquaintances would sympathetically have discussed her helplessness and absolute lack of all resource so very pretty so young the mother of a dear little girlleft with no income how very sad what could she do the elect would have paid her visits and sitting in her darkened drawingroom earnestly besought her to trust to her maker and suggested the scriptures as suitable reading some of themrare and strange souls even in their timewould have known what they meant and meant what they said in a way they had as yet only the power to express through the medium of a certain shibboleth the rest would have used the same forms merely because shibboleth is easy and always safe and creditable but to feathers immediate circle a multiplicity of engagements fevers of eagerness in the attainment of pleasures and ambitions anxieties small and large terrors and a whirl of days left no time for the regarding of pathetic aspects the tiny house up whose staircasetucked against a wallone had seemed to have the effect of crowding even when one went alone to make a call suddenly ceased to represent hilarious little parties which were as entertaining as they were up to date and noisy the most daring things london gossiped about had been said and done and worn there novel social ventures had been trieddancing and songs which seemed almost startling at firstbut which were gradually being generally adopted there had always been a great deal of laughing and talking of nonsense and the bandying of jokes and catch phrases and feather fluttering about and saying delicious silly things at which her hearers shouted with glee such a place could not suddenly become pathetic it seemed almost indecent for robert garethlawless to have dragged death nakedly into their midstto have died in his bed in one of the little bedrooms to have been put in his coffin and carried down the stairs scraping the wall and sent away in a hearse nobody could bear to think of it feather could bear it less than anybody else it seemed incredible that such a trick could have been played her she shut herself up in her stuffy little bedroom with its shrimp pink frills and draperies and cried lamentably at first she cried as a child might who was suddenly snatched away in the midst of a party then she began to cry because she was frightened numbers of cards with sympathy had been left at the front door during the first week after the funeral they had accumulated in a pile on the salver but very few people had really come to see her and while she knew they had the excuse of her recent bereavement she felt that it made the house ghastly it had never been silent and empty things had always been going on and now there was actually not a sound to be heardno one going up and down stairsrobs room cleared of all his belongings and left orderly and emptythe drawingroom like a gay little tomb without an occupant how long would it be before it would be full of people againhow long must she wait before she could decently invite anyoneit was really at this point that fright seized upon her her brain was not given to activities of reasoning and followed no thought far she had not begun to ask herself questions as to ways and means rob had been winning at cards and had borrowed some money from a new acquaintance so no immediate abyss had yawned at her feet but when the thought of future festivities rose before her a sudden check made her involuntarily clutch at her throat she had no money at all bills were piled everywhere perhaps now robert was dead none of the shops would give her credit she remembered hearing rob come into the house swearing only the day before he was taken ill and it had been because he had met on the doorstep a collector of the rent which was long overdue and must be paid she had no money to pay it none to pay the servants wages none to pay the household bills none to pay for the monthly hire of the brougham would they turn her into the streetwould the servants go awaywould she be left without even a carriage what could she do about clothes she could not wear anything but mourning now and by the time she was out of mourning her old clothes would have gone out of fashion the morning on which this aspect of things occurred to her she was so terrified that she began to run up and down the room like a frightened little cat seeing no escape from the trap it is caught in its awfulits awfulits awful broke out between her sobs what can i do i cant do anything theres nothing to do its awfulits awfulits awful she ended by throwing herself on the bed crying until she was exhausted she had no mental resources which would suggest to her that there was anything but crying to be done she had cried very little in her life previously because even in her days of limitation she had been able to get more or less what she wantedthough of course it had generally been less and crying made ones nose and eyes red on this occasion she actually forgot her nose and eyes and cried until she scarcely knew herself when she got up and looked in the glass she rang the bell for her maid and sat down to wait her coming tonson should bring her a cup of beef tea its time for lunch she thought im faint with crying and she shall bathe my eyes with rosewater it was not tonsons custom to keep her mistress waiting but today she was not prompt feather rang a second time and an impatient third and then sat in her chair and waited until she began to feel as she felt always in these dreadful days the dead silence of the house it was the thing which most struck terror to her soulthat horrid stillness the servants whose place was in the basement were too much closed in their gloomy little quarters to have made themselves heard upstairs even if they had been inclined to during the last few weeks feather had even found herself wishing that they were less well trained and would make a little noisedo anything to break the silence the room she sat inrobs awful little room adjoiningwhich was awful because of what she had seen for a moment lying stiff and hard on the bed before she was taken away in hystericswere dread enclosures of utter silence the whole house was dumbthe very street had no sound in it she could not endure it how dare tonson she sprang up and rang the bell again and again until its sound came back to her pealing through the place then she waited again it seemed to her that five minutes passed before she heard the smart young footman mounting the stairs slowly she did not wait for his knock upon the door but opened it herself how dare tonson she began i have rung four or five times how dare she the smart young footmans manner had been formed in a good school it was attentive impersonal i dont know maam he answered what do you mean what does she mean where is she feather felt almost breathless before his unperturbed good style i dont know maam he answered as before then with the same unbiassed bearing added none of us know she has gone away feather clutched the door handle because she felt herself swaying away away the words were a faint gasp she packed her trunk yesterday and carried it away with her on a fourwheeler about an hour ago maam feather dropped her hand from the knob of the door and trailed back to the chair she had left sinking into it helplessly whowho will dress me she half wailed i dont know maam replied the young footman his excellent manner presuming no suggestion or opinion whatever he added however cook maam wishes to speak to you tell her to come to me here feather said and ii want a cup of beef tea yes maam with entire respect and the door closed quietly behind him it was not long before it was opened again cook had knocked and feather had told her to come in most cooks are stout but this one was not she was a thin tall woman with square shoulders and a square face somewhat reddened by constant proximity to fires she had been trained at a cooking school she carried a pile of small account books but she brought nothing else i wanted some beef tea cook said feather protestingly there is no beef tea maam said cook there is neither beef nor stock nor liebig in the house whywhy not stammered feather and she stammered because even her lack of perception saw something in the womans face which was new to her it was a sort of finality she held out the pile of small books here are the books maam was her explanation perhaps as you dont like to be troubled with such things you dont know how far behind they are nothing has been paid for months its been an everyday fight to get the things that was wanted its not an agreeable thing for a cook to have to struggle and plead ive had to do it because i had my reputation to think of and i couldnt send up rubbish when there was company feather felt herself growing pale as she sat and stared at her cook drew near and laid one little book after another on the small table near her thats the butchers book she said hes sent nothing in for three days weve been living on leavings hes sent his last he says and he means it this is the bakers hes not been for a week i made up rolls because i had some flour left its done nowand hes done this is groceries and mercom fees wrote to mr garethlawless when the last months supply came that it would be the last until payment was made this is winesand coal and woodand laundryand milk and here is wages maam which cant go on any longer feather threw up her hands and quite wildly oh go awaygo away she cried if mr lawless were here he isnt maam cook interposed not fiercely but in a way more terrifying than any ferocity could have beena way which pointed steadily to the end of things as long as theres a gentleman in a house theres generally a sort of a prospect that things may be settled some way at any rate theres someone to go and speak your mind to even if you have to give up your place but when theres no gentleman and nothingand nobodyrespectable people with their livings to make have got to protect themselves the woman had no intention of being insolent her simple statement that her employers death had left nothing and nobody was prompted by no consciously ironic realization of the diaphanousness of feather as for the rest she had been professionally trained to take care of her interests as well as to cook and the ethics of the days of her grandmother when there had been servants with actual affections had not reached her oh go away go awaay feather almost shrieked i am going maam so are edward and emma and louisa its no use waiting and giving the months notice we shouldnt save the months wages and the tradespeople wouldnt feed us we cant stay here and starve and its a time of the year when places has to be looked for you cant hold it against us maam its better for you to have us out of the house tonightwhich is when our boxes will be taken away then was feather seized with a panic for the first time in her life she found herself facing mere common facts which rose before her like a solid wall of stonenot to be leapt or crept under or bored through or slipped round she was so overthrown and bewildered that she could not even think of any clever and rapidly constructed lie which would help her indeed she was so aghast that she did not remember that there were such things as lies do you mean she cried out that you are all going to leave the housethat there wont be any servants to wait on methat theres nothing to eat or drinkthat i shall have to stay here aloneand starve we should have to starve if we stayed answered cook simply and of course there are a few things left in the pantry and closets and you might get in a woman by the day you wont starve maam youve got your family in jersey we waited because we thought mr and mrs darrel would be sure to come my father is ill i think hes dying my mother could not leave him for a moment perhaps hes dead now feather wailed youve got your london friends maam feather literally beat her hands together my friends can i go to peoples houses and knock at their front door and tell them i havent any servants or anything to eat can i do that can i and she said it as if she were going crazy the woman had said what she had come to say as spokeswoman for the rest it had not been pleasant but she knew she had been quite within her rights and dealt with plain facts but she did not enjoy the prospect of seeing her little fool of a mistress raving in hysterics you mustnt let yourself go maam she said youd better lie down a bit and try to get quiet she hesitated a moment looking at the pretty ruin who had risen from her seat and stood trembling its not my place of course tomake suggestions she said quietly buthad you ever thought of sending for lord coombe maam feather actually found the torn film of her mind caught for a second by something which wore a form of reality cook saw that her tremor appeared to verge on steadying itself coombe she faintly breathed as if to herself and not to cook coombe his lordship was very friendly with mr lawless and he seemed fond ofcoming to the house was presented as a sort of added argument if youll lie down ill bring you a cup of tea maamthough it cant be beef feather staggered again to her bed and dropped flat upon itflat as a slim little pancake in folds of thin black stuff which hung and floated i cant bring you cream said cook as she went out of the room louisa has had nothing but condensed milksince yesterdayto give miss robin ohh groaned feather not in horror of the tea without cream though that was awful enough in its significance but because this was the first time since the falling to pieces of her world that she had given a thought to the added calamity of robin chapter iv if one were to devote ones mental energies to speculation as to what is going on behind the noncommittal fronts of any row of houses in any great city the imaginative mind might be led far bricks mortar windows doors steps which lead up to the threshold are what are to be seen from the outside nothing particular may be transpiring within the walls or tragedies crimes hideous suffering may be enclosed the conclusion is obvious to banalitybut as suggestive as banalso suggestive in fact that the hypersensitive and too imaginative had better for their own comforts sake leave the matter alone in most cases the existing conditions would not be altered even if one knocked at the door and insisted on entering with drawn sword in the form of attendant policeman the outside of the slice of a house in which feather lived was still rather fresh from its last decorative touching up it had been painted cream colour and had white doors and windows and green window boxes with variegated vinca vines trailing from them and pink geraniums dark blue lobelia and ferns filling the earth stuffed in by the florist who provided such adornments passersby frequently glanced at it and thought it a nice little house whose amusing diminutiveness was a sort of attraction it was rather like a new dolls house no one glancing at it in passing at the closing of this particular day had reason to suspect that any unaccustomed event was taking place behind the creamcoloured front the front door brasses had been polished the windowboxes watered and no cries for aid issued from the rooms behind them the house was indeed quiet both inside and out inside it was indeed even quieter than usual the servants preparation for departure had been made gradually and undisturbedly there had been exhaustive quiet discussion of the subject each night for weeks even before robert garethlawless illness the smart young footman edward who had means of gaining practical information had constituted himself a sort of private detective he had in time learned all that was to be learned this it had made itself clear to him on investigation was not one of those cases when to wait for evolutionary family events might be the part of discretion there were no prospects aheadnone at all matters would only get worse and the whole thing would end in everybody not only losing their unpaid back wages but having to walk out into the street through the door of a disgraced household whose owners would be turned out into the street also when their belongings were sold over their heads better get out before everything went to pieces and there were unpleasantnesses there would be unpleasantnesses because there was no denying that the tradespeople had been played tricks with mrs garethlawless was only one of a lot of pretty daughters whose father was a poor country doctor in jersey he had had a stroke himself and his widow would have nothing to live on when he died that was what mrs lawless had to look to as to lord lawdor edward had learned from those who did know that he had never approved of his nephew and that hed said he was a fool for marrying and had absolutely refused to have anything to do with him he had six boys and a girl now and big estates werent what they had been everyone knew there was only one thing left for cook and edward and emma and louisa to do and that was to get out without any talk or argument shes not one that wont find someone to look after her ended edward somebody or other will take her up because theyll be sorry for her but us lot arent widows and orphans no ones going to be sorry for us or care a hang what weve been let in for the longer we stay the longer we wont be paid he was not a particularly depraved or cynical young footman but he laughed a little at the end of his speech theres the marquis he added hes been running in and out long enough to make a good bit of talk nows his time to turn up after she had taken her cup of tea without cream feather had fallen asleep in reaction from her excited agitation it was in accord with the inevitable trend of her being that even before her eyes closed she had ceased to believe that the servants were really going to leave the house it seemed too ridiculous a thing to happen she was possessed of no logic which could lead her to a realization of the indubitable fact that there was no reason why servants who could neither be paid nor provided with food should remain in a place the mild stimulation of the tea also gave rise to the happy thought that she would not give them any references if they behaved badly it did not present itself to her that references from a house of cards which had ignominiously fallen to pieces and which henceforth would represent only shady failure would be of no use so she fell asleep when she awakened the lights were lighted in the streets and one directly across the way threw its reflection into her bedroom it lit up the little table near which she had sat and the first thing she saw was the pile of small account books the next was that the light which revealed them also fell brightly on the glass knob of the door which led into roberts room she turned her eyes away quickly with a nervous shudder she had a horror of the nearness of robs room if there had been another part of the house in which she could have slept she would have fled to it as soon as he was taken ill but the house was too small to have parts the tiny drawingrooms piled themselves on top of the diningroom the masters bedrooms on top of the drawingrooms and the nurseries and attics where robin and the servants slept one on the other at the top of the house so she had been obliged to stay and endure everything robs cramped quarters had always been full of smart boots and the smell of cigars and mens clothes he had moved about a good deal and had whistled and laughed and sworn and grumbled they had neither of them had bad tempers so that they had not quarrelled with each other they had talked through the open door when they were dressing and they had invented clever tricks which helped them to get out of money scrapes and they had gossiped and made fun of people and now the door was locked and the room was a sort of horror she could never think of it without seeing the stiff hard figure on the bed the straight close line of the mouth and the white hard nose sharpened and narrowed as robs had never been somehow she particularly could not bear the recollection of the sharp unnatural modeling of the hard white nose she could not bear it she found herself recalling it the moment she saw the light on the door handle and she got up to move about and try to forget it it was then that she went to the window and looked down into the street probably attracted by some slight noise though she was not exactly aware that she had heard anything she must have heard something however two fourwheeled cabs were standing at the front door and the cabman assisted by edward were putting trunks on top of them they were servants trunks and cook was already inside the first cab which was filled with paper parcels and odds and ends even as her mistress watched emma got in carrying a sedate bandbox she was the houseparlourmaid and a sedate person the first cab drove away as soon as its door was closed and the cabman mounted to his seat louisa looking wholly unprofessional without her nurses cap and apron and wearing a tailormade navy blue costume and a hat with a wing in it entered the second cab followed by edward intensely suggesting private life and possible connection with a bank the second cab followed the first and feather having lost her breath looked after them as they turned the corner of the street when they were quite out of sight she turned back into the room the colour had left her skin and her eyes were so wide stretched and her face so drawn and pinched with abject terror that her prettiness itself had left her theyve goneall of them she gasped she stopped a moment her chest rising and falling then she added even more breathlessly theres no one left in the house itsempty this was what was going on behind the creamcoloured front the white windows and green flowerboxes of the slice of a house as motors and carriages passed it that evening on their way to dinner parties and theatres and later as the policeman walked up and down slowly upon his beat inside a dim light in the small hall showed a remote corner where on a peg above a decorative seat hung a mans hat of the highest gloss and latest form and on the next peg a smart evening overcoat they had belonged to robert garethlawless who was dead and needed such things no more the same dim light showed the steep narrowness of the whiterailed staircase mounting into gruesome little corners of shadows while the miniature drawingrooms illumined only from the street seemed to await an explanation of dimness and chairs unfilled combined with unnatural silence it would have been the silence of the tomb but that it was now and then broken by something like a half smothered shriek followed by a sort of moaning which made their way through the ceiling from the room above feather had at first run up and down the room like a frightened cat as she had done in the afternoon afterwards she had had something like hysterics falling face downward upon the carpet and clutching her hair until it fell down she was not a person to be judgedshe was one of the unexplained incidents of existence the hour has passed when the clearly moral can sum up the responsibilities of a creature born apparently without brain or soul or courage those who aspire to such morals as are expressed by fairnessmere fairnessare much given to hesitation courage had never been demanded of feather so far she had none whatever and now she only felt panic and resentment she had no time to be pathetic about robert being too much occupied with herself robert was deadshe was aliveherein an empty house with no money and no servants she suddenly and rather awfully realized that she did not know a single person whom it would not be frantic to expect anything from nobody had money enough for themselves however rich they were the richer they were the more they needed it was when this thought came to her that she clutched her hands in her hair the pretty and smart women and agreeable more or less good looking men who had chattered and laughed and made love in her drawingrooms were chattering laughing and making love in other houses at this very momentor they were at the theatre applauding some fashionable actormanager at this very momentwhile she lay on the carpet in the dark and every little room in the house had horror shut inside its closed doorsparticularly roberts room which was so hideously close to her own and where there seemed still to lie moveless on the bed the stiff hard figure it was when she recalled this that the unnatural silence of the drawingrooms was intruded upon by the brief halfstifled hysteric shriek and the moaning which made its way through the ceiling she felt almost as if the door handle might turn and something stiff and cold try to come in so the hours went on behind the creamcoloured outer walls and the white windows and gay flowerboxes and the street became more and more silentso silent at last that when the policeman walked past on his beat his heavy regular footfall seemed loud and almost resounding to even vaguely put to herself any question involving action would not have been within the scope of her mentality even when she began to realize that she was beginning to feel faint for want of food she did not dare to contemplate going downstairs to look for something to eat what did she know about downstairs she had never there and had paid no attention whatever to louisas complaints that the kitchen and servants hall were small and dark and inconvenient and that cockroaches ran about she had cheerfully accepted the simple philosophy that london servants were used to these things and if they did their work it did not really matter but to go out of ones room in the horrible stillness and creep downstairs having to turn up the gas as one went and to face the basement steps and cockroaches scuttling away would be even more impossible than to starve she sat upon the floor her hair tumbling about her shoulders and her thin black dress crushed id give almost anything for a cup of coffee she protested feebly and theres no use in ringing the bell her mother ought to have come whether her father was ill or not he wasnt dead robert was dead and her mother ought to have come so that whatever happened she would not be quite alone and something could be done for her it was probably this tender thought of her mother which brought back the recollection of her wedding day and a certain wedding present she had received it was a pretty silver travelling flask and she remembered that it must be in her dressingbag now and there was some cognac left in it she got up and went to the place where the bag was kept cognac raised your spirits and made you go to sleep and if she could sleep until morning the house would not be so frightening by daylightand something might happen the little flask was almost full neither she nor robert had cared much about cognac she poured some into a glass with water and drank it because she was unaccustomed to stimulant it made her feel quite warm and in a few minutes she forgot that she had been hungry and realized that she was not so frightened it was such a relief not to be terrified it was as if a pain had stopped she actually picked up one or two of the account books and glanced at the totals if you couldnt pay bills you couldnt and nobody was put in prison for debt in these days besides she would not have been put in prisonrob wouldand rob was dead something would happensomething as she began to arrange her hair for the night she remembered what cook had said about lord coombe she had cried until she did not look as lovely as usual but after she had bathed her eyes with cold rosewater they began to seem only shadowy and faintly flushed and her fine ashgold hair was wonderful when it hung over each shoulder in wide soft plaits she might be a schoolgirl of fifteen a delicate lacy nightgown was one of the most becoming things one wore it was a pity one couldnt wear them to parties there was nothing the least indecent about them millicent hardwicke had been photographed in one of hers and no one had suspected what it was yes she would send a little note to coombe she knew madame hlne had only let her have her beautiful mourning because the things she had created were quite uniquethin gauzy black floating or clinging she had been quite happy the morning she gave hlne her orders tomorrow when she had slept through the night and it was broad daylight again she would be able to think of things to say in her letter to lord coombe she would have to be a little careful because he did not like things to bore himdeath and widows mighta littleat first she had heard him say once that he did not wish to regard himself in the light of a charitable institution it wouldnt do to frighten him away perhaps if he continued coming to the house and seemed very intimate the tradespeople might be managed she felt much less helpless and when she was ready for bed she took a little more cognac the flush had faded from her eyelids and bloomed in delicious rose on her cheeks as she crept between the cool sheets and nestled down on her pillow she had a delightful sense of increasing comfortcomfort what a beautiful thing it was to go to sleep and then she was disturbedstarted out of the divine doze stealing upon herby a shrill prolonged wailing shriek it came from the night nursery and at the moment it seemed almost worse than anything which had occurred all through the day it brought everything back so hideously she had of course forgotten robin againand it was robin and louisa had gone away with edward she had perhaps put the child to sleep discreetly before she went and now she had wakened and was screaming feather had heard that she was a child with a temper but by fair means or foul louisa had somehow managed to prevent her from being a nuisance the shrieks shocked her into sitting upright in bed their shrillness tearing through the utter soundlessness of the empty house brought back all her terrors and set her heart beating at a gallop ii wont she protested fairly with chattering teeth i wont i wont she had never done anything for the child since its birth she did not know how to do anything she had not wanted to know to reach her now she would be obliged to go out in the darkthe gasjet she would have to light was actually close to the outer door of roberts bedroomthe room if she did not die of panic while she was trying to light it she would have to make her way almost in the dark up the steep crooked little staircase which led to the nurseries and the awful little creatures screams would be going on all the time making the blackness and dead silence of the house below more filled with horror by contrastmore shut off and at the same time more likely to waken to some horror which was new ii couldnteven if i wanted to she quaked i darent i darent i wouldnt do itfor a million pounds and she flung herself down again shuddering and burrowing her head under the coverings and pillows she dragged over her ears to shut out the sounds the screams had taken on a more determined note and a fiercer shrillness which the still house heard well and made the most of but they were so far deadened for feather that she began beneath her soft barrier to protest pantingly i shouldnt know what to do if i went if no one goes near her shell cry herself to sleep itsits only temper ohh what a horrible wail itit sounds like aa lost soul but she did not stir from the bed she burrowed deeper under the bed clothes and held the pillow closer to her ears it did sound like a lost soul at times what panic possesses a baby who cries in the darkness alone no one will ever know and one may perhaps give thanks to whatever gods there be that the baby itself does not remember what awful woe of sudden unprotectedness when life exists only through protectionwhat piteous panic in the midst of black unmercifulness inarticulate sound howsoever wildly shrill can neither explain nor express robin knew only louisa warmth food sleep and waking or if she knew more she was not yet aware that she did she had reached the age when she generally slept through the night she might not have disturbed her mother until daylight but louisa had with forethought given her an infant sleeping potion it had disagreed with and awakened her she was uncomfortable and darkness enveloped her a cry or so and louisa would ordinarily have come to her sleepy and rather out of temper but knowing what to do in this strange night the normal cry of warning and demand produced no result no one came the discomfort continuedthe blackness remained black the cries became shrieksbut nothing followed the shrieks developed into prolonged screams no louisa no light no milk the blackness drew in closer and became a thing to be fought with wild little beating hands not a glimmernot a rustlenot a sound then came the cries of the lost soulalonealonein a black world of space in which there was not even another lost soul and then the panics of which there have been no records and never will be because if the panic stricken does not die in mysterious convulsions he or she grows away from the memory of a formless pastexcept that perhaps unexplained nightmares from which one wakens quaking with cold sweat may vaguely repeat the long hidden thing what the child robin knew in the dark perhaps the silent house which echoed her might curiously have known but the shrieks wore themselves out at last and sobs cameawful little sobs shuddering through the tiny breast and shaking the baby body a babys sobs are unspeakable thingsincredible things slower and slower robins camewith small deep gasps and chokings betweenand when an uninfantile druglike sleep came the bitter hopeless beaten little sobs went on but feathers head was still burrowed under the soft protection of the pillow chapter v the morning was a brighter one than london usually indulges in and the sun made its way into feathers bedroom to the revealing of its coral pink glow and comfort she had always liked her bedroom and had usually wakened in it to the sense of luxuriousness it is possible a pet cat feels when it wakens to stretch itself on a cushion with its saucer of cream awaiting it but she did not awaken either to a sense of brightness or luxury this morning she had slept it was true but once or twice when the pillow had slipped aside she had found herself disturbed by the faroff sound of the wailing of some little animal which had caused her automatically and really scarcely consciously to replace the pillow it had only happened at long intervals because it is nature that an exhausted baby falls asleep when it is worn out robin had probably slept almost as much as her mother feather staring at the pinkness around her reached at last with the assistance of a certain physical consciousness a sort of spiritless intention shes asleep now she murmured i hope she wont waken for a long time i feel faint i shall have to find something to eatif its only biscuits then she lay and tried to remember what cook had said about her not starving she said there were a few things left in the pantry and closets perhaps theres some condensed milk how do you mix it up if she cries i might go and give her some it wouldnt be so awful now its daylight she felt shaky when she got out of bed and stood on her feet she had not had a maid in her girlhood so she could dress herself much as she detested to do it after she had begun however she could not help becoming rather interested because the dress she had worn the day before had become crushed and she put on a fresh one she had not worn at all it was thin and soft also and black was quite startlingly becoming to her she would wear this one when lord coombe came after she wrote to him it was silly of her not to have written before though she knew he had left town after the funeral letters would be forwarded it will be quite bright in the diningroom now she said to encourage herself and tonson once said that the only places the sun came into below stairs were the pantry and kitchen and it only stayed about an hour early in the morning i must get there as soon as i can when she had so dressed herself that the reflection the mirror gave back to her was of the nature of a slight physical stimulant she opened her bedroom door and faced exploration of the deserted house below with a quaking sense of the proportions of the inevitable she got down the narrow stairs casting a frightened glance at the emptiness of the drawingrooms which seemed to stare at her as she passed them there was sun in the diningroom and when she opened the sideboard she found some wine in decanters and some biscuits and even a few nuts and some raisins and oranges she put them on the table and sat down and ate some of them and began to feel a little less shaky if she had been allowed time to sit longer and digest and reflect she might have reached the point of deciding on what she would write to lord coombe she had not the pen of a ready writer and it must be thought over but just when she was beginning to be conscious of the pleasant warmth of the sun which shone on her shoulders from the window she was almost startled our of her chair by hearing again stealing down the staircase from the upper regions that faint wail like a little cats just the momentthe very moment i begin to feel a little quietedand try to thinkshe begins again she cried out its worse then anything large crystal tears ran down her face and upon the polished table i suppose she would starve to death if i didnt give her some foodand then i should be blamed people would be horrid about it ive got nothing to eat myself she must at any rate manage to stop the crying before she could write to coombe she would be obliged to go down into the pantry and look for some condensed milk the creature had no teeth but perhaps she could mumble a biscuit or a few raisins if she could be made to swallow a little port wine it might make her sleepy the sun was paying its brief morning visit to the kitchen and pantry when she reached there but a few cockroaches scuttled away before her and made her utter a hysterical little scream but there was some condensed milk and there was a little warm water in a kettle because the fire was not quite out she imperfectly mixed a decoction and filled a bottle which ought not to have been downstairs but had been brought and left there by louisa as a result of tender moments with edward when she put the bottle and some biscuits and scraps of cold ham on a tray because she could not carry them all in her hands her sense of outrage and despair made her almost sob i am just like a servantcarrying trays upstairs she wept ii might be edwardoror louisa and her woe increased when she added in the diningroom the port wine and nuts and raisins and macaroons as viands which might somehow add to infant diet and induce sleep she was not sure of coursebut she knew they sucked things and liked sweets a baby left unattended to scream itself to sleep and awakening to scream itself to sleep again does not present to a resentful observer the flowerlike bloom and beauty of infancy when feather carried her tray into the night nursery and found herself confronting the disordered crib on which her offspring lay she felt the child horrible to look at its face was disfigured and its eyes almost closed she trembled all over as she put the bottle to its mouth and saw the fiercely hungry clutch of its hands it was old enough to clutch and clutch it did and suck furiously and starvinglyeven though actually forced to stop once or twice at first to give vent to a thwarted remnant of a scream feather had only seen it as downy whiteness and perfume in louisas arms or in its carriage it had been a singularly vivid and brillianteyed baby at whom people looked as they passed who will give her a bath wailed feather who will change her clothes someone must could a woman by the day do it cook said i could get a woman by the day and then she remembered that one got servants from agencies and where were the agencies and even a woman by the day would demand wages and food to eat and then the front door bell rang what could she dowhat could she do go downstairs and open the door herself and let everyone know let the ringer go on ringing until he was tired and went away she was indeed hard driven even though the wail had ceased as robin clutched her bottle to her breast and fed with frenzy let them go awaylet them and then came the wild thought that it might be somethingthe something which must happen when things were at their worst and if it had come and the house seemed to be empty she did not walk down the stairs she ran her heart beat until she reached the door out of breath and when she opened it stood their panting the people who waited upon the steps were strangers they were very nice looking and quite younga man and a woman very perfectly dressed the man took a piece of paper out of his pocketbook and handed it to her with an agreeable apologetic courtesy i hope we have not called early enough to disturb you he said we waited until eleven but we are obliged to catch a train at half past it is an order to view from carson bayle he added this because feather was staring at the paper carson bayle were the agents they had rented the house from it was carson bayles collector robert had met on the threshold and sworn at two days before he had been taken ill they were letting the house over her head and she would be turned out into the street the young man and woman finding themselves gazing at this exquisitely pretty creature in exquisite mourning felt themselves appallingly embarrassed she was plainly the widow carson had spoken of but why did she open the door herself and why did she look as if she did not understand indignation against carson bayle began to stir the young man beg pardon so sorry i am afraid we ought not to have come he protested agents ought to know better they said you were giving up the house at once and we were afraid someone might take it feather held the order to view in her hand and snared at them quite helplessly thereare nono servants to show it to you she said if you could waita few daysperhaps she was so lovely and madame hlnes filmy black creation was in itself such an appeal that the amiable young strangers gave up at once oh certainlycertainly do excuse us carson and bayle ought not to have we are so sorry good morning good morning they gave forth in discomfited sympathy and politeness and really quite scurried away having shut the door on their retreat feather stood shivering i am going to be turned out of the house i shall have to live in the street she thought where shall i keep my clothes if i live in the street even she knew that she was thinking idiotically of course if everything was taken from you and sold you would have no clothes at all and wardrobes and drawers and closets would not matter the realization that scarcely anything in the house had been paid for came home to her with a ghastly shock she staggered upstairs to the first drawingroom in which there was a silly pretty little buhl writing table she felt even more senseless when she sank into a chair before it and drew a sheet of notepaper towards her her thoughts would not connect themselves with each other and she could not imagine what she ought to say in her letter to coombe in fact she seemed to have no thoughts at all she could only remember the things which had happened and she actually found she could write nothing else there seemed nothing else in the world dear lord coombe trailed tremulously over the pagethe house is quite empty the servants have gone away i have no money and there is not any food and i am going to be turned out into the streetand the baby is crying because it is hungry she stopped there knowing it was not what she ought to say and as she stopped and looked at the words she began herself to wail somewhat as robin had wailed in the dark when she would not listen or go to her it was like a beggars lettera beggars telling him that she had no money and no foodand would be turned out for unpaid rent and that the baby was crying because it was starving its a beggars letterjust a beggars she cried out aloud to the empty room and its truue robins wail itself had not been more hopeless than hers was as she dropped her head and let it lie on the buhl table she was not however even to be allowed to let it lie there for the next instant there fell on her startled ear quite echoing through the house another ring at the doorbell and two steely raps on the smart brass knocker it was merely because she did not know what else to do having just lost her wits entirely that she got up and trailed down the staircase again when she opened the door lord coombethe apotheosis of exquisite fitness in form and perfect appointment as also of perfect expressionwas standing on the threshold chapter vi if he had meant to speak he changed his mind after his first sight of her he merely came in and closed the door behind him curious experiences with which life had provided him had added finish to an innate aptness of observation and a fine readiness in action if she had been of another type he would have saved both her and himself a scene and steered ably through the difficulties of the situation towards a point where they could have met upon a normal plane a very pretty woman with whose affairs one has nothing whatever to do and whose pretty home has been the perfection of modern smartness of custom suddenly opening her front door in the unexplained absence of a footman and confronting a visitor plainly upon the verge of hysteria suggests the necessity of promptness but feather gave him not a breaths space she was in fact not merely on the verge of her hysteria she had gone farther and here he was oh here he was she fell down upon her knees and actually clasped his immaculateness oh lord coombe lord coombe lord coombe she said it three times because he presented to her but the one idea he did not drag himself away from her embrace but he distinctly removed himself from it you must not fall upon your knees mrs lawless he said shall we go into the drawingroom iwas writing to you i am starvingbut it seemed too silly when i wrote it and its true her broken words were as senseless in their sound as she had thought them when she saw them written will you come up into the drawingroom and tell me exactly what you mean he said and he made her release him and stand upon her feet as the years had passed he had detached himself from so many weaknesses and their sequelae of emotion that he had felt himself a safely unreachable person he was not young and he knew enough of the disagreeableness of consequences to be adroit in keeping out of the way of apparently harmless things which might be annoying yet as he followed mrs garethlawless and watched her stumbling up the stairs like a punished child he was aware that he was abnormally in danger of pitying her as he did not wish to pity people the pity was also something apart from the feeling that it was hideous that a creature so lovely so shallow and so fragile should have been caught in the great wheels of life he knew what he had come to talk to her about but he had really no clear idea of what her circumstances actually were most people had of course guessed that her husband had been living on the edge of his resources and was accustomed to debt and duns but a lovely being greeting you by clasping your knees and talking about starvingin this particular street in mayfair led one to ask oneself what one was walking into feather herself had not known in fact neither had any other human being known that there was a special reason why he had drifted into seeming rather to allow her aboutwhy he had finally been counted among the frequenters of the narrow houseand why he had seemed to watch her a good deal sometimes with an expression of serious interestsometimes with an air of irritation and sometimes with no expression at all but there existed this reason and this it was and this alone which had caused him to appear upon her threshold and it had also been the power which had prevented his disengaging himself with more incisive finality when he found himself ridiculously clasped about the knees as one who played the part of an obdurate parent in a melodrama once in the familiar surroundings of her drawingroom her ashgold blondness and her black gauzy frock heightened all her effects so extraordinarily that he frankly admitted to himself that she possessed assets which would have modified most things to most men as for feather when she herself beheld him against the background of the same intimate aspects the effect of the sound of his voice the manner in which he sat down in a chair and a certain remotely dim hint in the hue of his clothes and an almost concealed note of some touch of colour which scarcely seemed to belong to anything wornwere so reminiscent of the days which now seemed past forever that she began to cry again he received this with discreet lack of melodrama of tone you mustnt do that mrs lawless he said or i shall burst into tears myself i am a sensitive creature oh do say feather instead of mrs lawless she implored sometimes you said feather i will say it now he answered if you will not weep it is an adorable name i feel as if i should never hear it again she shuddered trying to dry her eyes it is all over what is all over this turning a hopeless gaze upon the two tiny rooms crowded with knickknacks and nonsense the parties and the funand everything in the world i have only had some biscuits and raisins to eat todayand the landlord is going to turn me out it seemed almost too preposterous to quite credit that she was uttering naked truthand yet after a seconds gaze at her he repeated what he had said below stairs will you tell me exactly what you mean then he sat still and listened while she poured it all forth and as he listened he realized that it was the mere every day fact that they were sitting in the slice of a house with the creamcoloured front and the great lady in her mansion on one side and the millionaire and his splendours on the other which peculiarly added to a certain hint of gruesomeness in the situation it was not necessary to add colour and desperation to the story any effort feather had made in that direction would only have detracted from the nakedness of its stark facts they were quite enough in themselves in their normal inevitableness feather in her pale and totally undignified panic presented the whole thing with clearness which hadwithout being aided by heran actual dramatic value this in spite of her mental dartings to and from and dragging in of points and bits of scenes which were not connected with each other only a brain whose processes of inclusion and exclusion were final and rapid could have followed her coombe watched her closely as she talked no griefstricken young widowed loneliness and heartbreak were the background of her anguish she was her own background and also her own foreground the strength of the fine body laid prone on the bed of the room she held in horror the white rigid face whose good looks had changed to something she could not bear to remember had no pathos which was not concerned with the fact that robert had amazingly and unnaturally failed her by dying and leaving her nothing but unpaid bills this truth indeed made the situation more poignantly and finally squalid as she brought forth one detail after another there were bills which had been accumulating ever since they began their life in the narrow house there had been tradespeople who had been juggled with promises made and supported by adroit tricks and cleverly invented misrepresentations and lies which neither of the pair had felt any compunctions about and had indeed laughed over coombe saw it all though he also saw that feather did not know all she was telling him he could realize the gradually increasing pressure and anger at tricks which betrayed themselves and the gathering determination on the part of the creditors to end the matter in the only way in which it could be ended it had come to this before roberts illness and feather herself had heard of fierce interviews and had seen threatening letters but she had not believed they could mean all they implied since things had been allowed to go on so long she felt that they would surely go on longer in the same way there had been some serious threatening about the rent and the unpaidfor furniture roberts supporting idea had been that he might perhaps get something out of lawdor who wouldnt enjoy being the relation of a fellow who was turned into the street he ought to have done something feather complained robert would have been lord lawdor himself if his uncle had died before he had all those disgusting children she was not aware that coombe frequently refrained from saying things to herbut occasionally allowed himself not to refrain he did not refrain now from making a simple comment but he is extremely robust and he has the children six stalwart boys and a stalwart girl family feeling has apparently gone out of fashion as she wandered on with her story he mentally felt himself actually dragged into the shrimppink bedroom and standing an onlooker when the footman outside the door did not know where tonson had gone for a moment he felt conscious of the presence of some scent which would have been sure to exhale itself from draperies and wardrobe he saw cook put the account books on the small table he heard her he also comprehended her and feather at the window breathlessly watching the two cabs with the servants trunks on top and the servants respectably unprofessional in attire and going away quietly without an unpractical compunctionhe saw these also and comprehended knowing exactly why compunctions had no part in latterday domestic arrangements why should they when feather reached the point where it became necessary to refer to robin some fortunate memory of alices past warnings caused her to feelquite suddenlythat certain details might be eliminated she cried a little at first she said but she fell asleep afterwards i was glad she did because i was afraid to go to her in the dark was she in the dark i think so perhaps louisa taught her to sleep without a light there was none when i took her some condensed milk this morning there was only cconddensed milk to give her she shed tears and choked as she described her journey into the lower regions and the cockroaches scuttling away before her into their hidingplaces i must have a nurse i must have one she almost sniffed someone must change her clothes and give her a bath you cant coombe said i dropping her handkerchief howhow can i i dont know he answered and picked up the handkerchief with an aloof grace of manner it was really robin who was for feather the breakingpoint he thought she was in danger of flinging herself upon him again she caught at his arm and her eyes of larkspur blue were actually wild dont you see where i am how there is nothing and nobodydont you see yes i see he answered you are quite right there is nothing and nobody i have been to lawdor myself you have been to talk to him yesterday that was my reason for coming here he will not see you or be written to he says he knows better than to begin that sort of thing it may be that family feeling has not the vogue it once had but you may recall that your husband infuriated him years ago also england is a less certain quantity than it once wasand the man has a family he will allow you a hundred a year but there he draws the line a hundred a year feather breathed from her delicate shoulders hung floating scarflike sleeves of black transparency and she lifted one of them and held it out like a night moths wingthis cost forty pounds she said her voice quite faint and low a good nurse would cost forty a cookand a footman and a maidand a coachmanand the broughami dont know how much they would cost ohh she drooped forward upon her sofa and laid face downward on a cushionslim exquisite in line lost in despair the effect produced was that she gave herself into his hands he felt as well as saw it and considered she had no suggestion to offer no reserve there she was it is an incredible sort of situation he said in an even lowpitched tone rather as if he were thinking aloud but it is baldly real it is actually simple in a street in mayfair a woman and child might he hesitated a second and a wailed word came forth from the cushion starve he moved slightly and continued since their bills have not been paid the tradespeople will not send in food servants will not stay in a house where they are not fed and receive no wages no landlord will allow a tenant to occupy his property unless he pays rent it may sound inhumanbut it is only human the cushion in which feathers face was buried retained a faint scent of roberts cigar smoke and the fragrance brought back to her things she had heard him say dispassionately about lord coombe as well as about other men he had not been a puritanic or condemnatory person she seemed to see herself groveling again on the floor of her bedroom and to feel the darkness and silence through which she had not dared to go to robin not another night like that no no you must go to jersey to your mother and father coombe said a hundred a year will help you there in your own home then she sat upright and there was something in her lovely little countenance he had never seen before it was actually determination i have heard she said of poor girls who were drivenby starvation toto go on the streets iwould go anywhere before i would go back there anywhere he repeated his own countenance expressingor rather refusing to express something as new as the thing he had seen in her own anywhere she cried and then she did what he had thought her on the verge of doing a few minutes earliershe fell at his feet and embraced his knees she clung to him she sobbed her pretty hair loosened itself and fell about her in wild but enchanting disorder oh lord coombe oh lord coombe oh lord coombe she cried as she had cried in the hall he rose and endeavoured to disengage himself as he had done before this time with less success because she would not let him go he had the greatest possible objection to scenes mrs lawlessfeatheri beg you will get up he said but she had reached the point of not caring what happened if she could keep him he was a gentlemanhe had everything in the world what did it matter i have no one but you andand you always seemed to like me i would do anythinganyone asked me if they would take care of me i have always liked you very muchand i did amuse youdidnt i you liked to come here there was something poignant about her delicate distraught loveliness and in the remoteness of his being a shuddering knowledge that it was quite true that she would do anything for any man who would take care of her produced an effect on him nothing else would have produced also a fantastic and finely ironic vision of joseph and potiphars wife rose before him and the vision of himself as joseph irked a certain complexness of his mentality poignant as the thing was in its modern way it was also faintly ridiculous then robin awakened and shrieked again the sound which had gained strength through long sleep and also through added discomfort quite rang through the house what that sound added to the moment he himself would not have been able to explain until long afterwards but it singularly and impellingly added listen panted feather she has begun again and there is no one to go to her get up mrs lawless he said do i understand that you are willing that i should arrange this for you he helped her to her feet do you meanreally she faltered will youwill you her uplifted eyes were like a young angels brimming with crystal drops which slippedas a childs tears slipdown her cheeks she clasped her hands in exquisite appeal he stood for a moment quite still his mind fled far away and he forgot where he was and because of this the little simpletons shallow discretion deserted her if you were aa marrying man she said foolishlyalmost in a whisper he recovered himself i am not with a finality which cut as cleanly as a surgical knife something which was not the words was of a succinctness which filled her with new terror ii know she whimpered i only said if you were if i werein this instanceit would make no difference he saw the kind of slippery silliness he was dealing with and what it might transform itself into if allowed a loophole there must be no mistakes in her fright she saw him for a moment more distinctly than she had ever seen him before and hideous dread beset her lest she had blundered fatally there shall be none she gasped i always knew there shall be none at all do you know what you are asking me he inquired yes yesim not a girl you know ive been married i wont go home i cant starve or live in awful lodgings somebody must save me do you know what people will say his steady voice was slightly lower it wont be said to me rather wildly nobody mindsreally he ceased altogether to look serious he smiled with the light detached air his world was most familiar with nothey dont really he answered i had however a slight preference for knowing whether you would or not you flatter me by intimating that you would not he knew that if he had held out an arm she would have fallen upon his breast and wept there but he was not at the moment in the mood to hold out an arm he merely touched hers with a light pressure let us sit down and talk it over he suggested a hansom drove up to the door and stopped before he had time to seat himself hearing it he went to the window and saw a stout businesslike looking man get out accompanied by an attendant there followed a loud authoritative ringing of the bell and an equally authoritative rap of the knocker this repeated itself feather who had run to the window and caught sight of the stout man clutched his sleeve its the agent we took the house from we always said we were out its either carson or bayle i dont know which coombe walked toward the staircase you cant open the door she shrilled he has doubtless come prepared to open it himself he answered and proceeded at leisure down the narrow stairway the caller had come prepared by the time coombe stood in the hall a latchkey was put in the keyhole and being turned the door opened to let in carsonor baylewho entered with an air of angered determination followed by his young man the physical presence of the head of the house of coombe was always described as a subtly impressive one several centuries of rather careful breeding had resulted in his seeming to represent things by silent implication a man who has never found the necessity of explaining or excusing himself inevitably presents a front wholly unsuggestive of uncertainty the front coombe presented merely awaited explanations from others carsonor baylehad doubtless contemplated seeing a frightened servant trying to prepare a stammering obvious lie he confronted a tall thin man about whomeven if his clothes had been totally differentthere could be no mistake he stood awaiting an apology so evidently that carsonor baylebegan to stammer himself even before he had time to dismiss from his voice the suggestion of bluster it would have irritated coombe immensely if he had known that heand a certain overcoathad been once pointed out to the man at sandown and thatin consequence of the overcoathe vaguely recognized him ii beg pardon he began quite so said coombe some tenants came to look at the house this morning they had an order to view from us they were sent away my lordand decline to come back the rent has not been paid since the first half year there is no one now who can even pretend its going to be paid some step had to be taken quite so said coombe suppose you step into the diningroom he led the pair into the room and pointed to chairs but neither the agent nor his attendant was calm enough to sit down coombe merely stood and explained himself i quite understand he said you are entirely within your rights mrs garethlawless is naturally not able to attend to business for the presentas a friend of her late husbandsi will arrange matters for her i am lord coombe she does not wish to give up the house dont send any more possible tenants call at coombe house in an hour and i will give you a cheque there were a few awkward apologetic moments and then the front door opened and shut the hansom jingled away and coombe returned to the drawingroom robin was still shrieking she wants some more condensed milk he said dont be frightened go and give her some i know an elderly woman who understands children she was a nurse some years ago i will send her here at once kindly give me the account books my housekeeper will send you some servants the tradespeople will come for orders feather was staring at him wwill they she stammered wwill everything yeseverything he answered dont be frightened go upstairs and try to stop her i must go now i never heard a creature yell with such fury she turned away and went towards the second flight of stairs with a rather dazed air she had passed through a rather tremendous crisis and she was dazed he made her feel so she had never understood him for a moment and she did not understand him nowbut then she never did understand people and the whole situation was a new one to her if she had not been driven to the wall she would have been quite as respectable as she knew how to be coombe called a hansom and drove home thinking of many things and looking even more than usually detached he had remarked the facial expression of the short and stout man as he had got into his cab and he was turning over mentally his own exact knowledge of the views the business mind would have held and what the business countenance would have decently covered if hecoombehad explained in detail that he was so farin this particular casean entirely blameless character chapter vii the slice of a house from that time forward presented the external aspect to which the inhabitants of the narrow and fashionable street and those who passed through it had been accustomed such individuals as had anticipated beholding at some early day notices conspicuously placed announcing sale by auction elegant modern furniture were vaguely puzzled as well as surprised by the fact that no such notices appeared even inconspicuously also there did not draw up before the dooreven as the weeks went onhuge and heavy removal vans with their resultant litter their final note of farewell a to let in the front windows on the contrary the florist came and refilled the window boxes with an admirable arrangement of fresh flowers new and even more correct servants were to be seen ascending and descending the area step a young footman quite as smart as the departed edward opened the front door and attended mrs garethlawless to her perfect little brougham the tradespeople appeared promptly every day and were obsequiously respectful in manner evidently the household had not disintegrated as a result of the death of mr garethlawless as it became an established fact that the household had not fallen to pieces its frequenters gradually returned to it wearing indeed the air of people who had never really remained away from it there had been natural reasons enough for considerate absence from a house of bereavement and a desolate widow upon whose grief it would have been indelicate to intrude as feather herself had realized the circle of her intimates was not formed of those who could readily adjust themselves to entirely changed circumstances if you dance on a tight rope and the rope is unexpectedly withdrawn where are you you cannot continue dancing until the rope is restrung the rope however being apparently made absolutely secure it was not long before the dancing began again feathers mourning wonderfully shading itself from month to month was the joy of all beholders madame hlne treated her as a star gleaming through gradually dispersing clouds her circle watched her with secretly humorous interest as each fine veil of dimness was withdrawn the things she wears are priceless was said amiably in her own drawingroom where does she get them figure to yourself lawdor paying the bills she gets them from hlne said a long thin young man with a rather goodlooking narrow face and dark eyes peering through pince nez but i couldnt in places where entertainment as a means of existence proceed so to speak fast and furiously questions of taste are not dwelt upon at leisure you need not hesitate before saying anything you liked in any ones drawingroom so long as it was amusing enough to make somebodyif not everybodylaugh feather had made people laugh in the same fashion in the past the persons she most admired were always making sly little impudent comments and suggestions and the thwarted years on the island of jersey had in her case resulted in an almost hectic desire to keep pace her efforts had usually been successes because natures self had provided her with the manner of a silly pretty child who did not know how far she went shouts of laughter had often greeted her and the first time she had for a moment doubted her prowess was on an occasion when she had caught a glimpse of coombe who stared at her with an expression which she wouldjust for one secondhave felt might be horror if she had not been so sure it couldnt be and must of course be something elseone of the things nobody ever understood in him by the time the softly swathing veils of vaporous darkness were withdrawn and the tight rope assuring everyone of its permanent security became a trusted support feather at her crowded little parties and at other peoples bigger ones did not remain wholly unaware of the probability that even people who rather liked her made among themselves more or less witty comments upon her improved fortunes they were improved greatly bills were paid tradespeople were polite servants were respectful she had no need to invent excuses and lies she and robert had always kept out of the way of stodgy critical people so they had been intimate with none of the punctilious who might have withdrawn themselves from a condition of things they chose to disapprove accordingly she found no gaps in her circle those who had formed the habit of amusing themselves at her house were as ready as before to amuse themselves again the fact remained howevercuriously perhaps in connection with the usual slightness of all impressions made on herthat there was a memory which never wholly left her even when she tried to force it so far into the background of her existence that it might almost be counted as forgotten it had a trick of rising before her it was the memory of the empty house as its emptiness had struck to the centre of her being when she had turned from her bedroom window after watching the servants drive away in their cabs it was also the memory of the hours which had followedthe night in which nobody had been in any of the roomsno one had gone up or down the stairswhen all had seemed dark and hollowexcept the night nursery where robin screamed and her own room where she herself cowered under the bed clothes and pulled the pillow over her head but though the picture would not let itself be blotted out its effect was rather to intensify her sense of relief because she had slipped so safely from under the wheels of destiny sometimes she revealed artlessly to coombe while i am driving in the park on a fine afternoon when every one is out and the dresses look like the flower beds i let myself remember it just to make myself enjoy everything more by contrast the elderly woman who had been a nurse in her youth and who had been sent by lord coombe temporarily to replace louisa had not remained long in charge of robin she was not young and smart enough for a house on the right side of the right street and feather found a young person who looked exactly as she should when she pushed the childs carriage before her around the square the squareout of which the right street branchesand the gardens in the middle of the square to which only privileged persons were admitted by private key the basement kitchen and servants hall and the two top floor nurseries represented the world to the child robin for some years when she was old enough to walk in the street she was led by the hand over the ground she had travelled daily in her baby carriage her first memory of things was a memory of standing on the gravel path in the square gardens and watching some sparrows quarrel while andrews her nurse sat on a bench with another nurse and talked in low tones they were talking in a way robin always connected with servants and which she naturally accepted as being the method of expression of their speciesmuch as she accepted the mewing of cats and the barking of dogs as she grew older she reached the stage of knowing that they were generally saying things they did not wish her to hear she liked watching the sparrows in the gardens because she liked watching sparrows at all times they were the only friends she had ever known though she was not old enough to call them friends or to know what friends meant andrews had taught her by means of a system of her own to know better than to cry or to make any protesting noise when she was left alone in her ugly small nursery andrews idea of her duties did not involve boring herself to death by sitting in a room on the top floor when livelier entertainment awaited her in the basement where the cook was a woman of wide experience the housemaid a young person who had lived in gay country houses and the footman at once a young man of spirit and humour so robin spent many hours of the daytaking them altogetherquite by herself she might have more potently resented her isolations if she had ever known any other condition than that of a child in whom no one was in the least interested and in whom being good could only mean being passive under neglect and calling no ones attention to the fact that she wanted anything from anybody as a bird born in captivity lives in its cage and perhaps believes it to be the world robin lived in her nursery and knew every square inch of it with a deadly if unconscious sense of distaste and fatigue she was put to bed and taken up she was fed and dressed in it and once a daytwice perhaps if andrews choseshe was taken out of it downstairs and into the street that was all and that was why she liked the sparrows so much and sparrows are worth watching if you live in a nursery where nothing ever happens and where when you look out you are so high up that it is not easy to see the people in the world below in addition to which it seems nearly always raining robin used to watch them hopping about on the slate roofs of the homes on the other side of the street they fluttered their wings they picked up straws and carried them away she thought they must have houses of their own among the chimneysin places she could not see she fancied it would be nice to hop about on the top of a roof oneself if one were not at all afraid of falling she liked the chippering and chirping sounds the birds made became it sounded like talking and laughinglike the talking and laughing she sometimes wakened out of her sleep to lie and listen to when the lady downstairs had a party she often wondered what the people were doing because it sounded as if they liked doing it very much sometimes when it had rained two or three days she had a feeling which made her begin to cry to herselfbut not aloud she had once had a little black and blue mark on her arm for a week where andrews had pinched her because she had cried loud enough to be heard it had seemed to her that andrews twisted and pinched the bit of flesh for five minutes without letting it go and she had held her large hand over her mouth as she did it now you keep that in your mind she had said when she had finished and robin had almost choked in her awful little struggle to keep back all sound the one thing andrews was surest of was that nobody would come upstairs to the nursery to inquire the meaning of any cries which were not unearthly enough to disturb the household so it was easy to regulate the existence of her charge in such a manner as best suited herself just give her food enough and keep her from making silly noises when she wants what she doesnt get said andrews to her companions below stairs that one in the drawingroom isnt going to interfere with the nursery not her i know my business and i know how to manage her kind i go to her politely now and then and ask her permission to buy things from bests or libertys or some other good place she always stares a minute when i begin as if she scarcely understood what i was talking about and then she says oh yes i suppose she must have them and i go and get them i keep her as well dressed as any child in mayfair and shes been a beauty since she was a year old so she looks first rate when i wheel her up and down the street so the people can see shes well taken care of and not kept hidden away no one can complain of her looks and nobody is bothered with her thats all thats wanted of me i get good wages and i get them regular i dont turn up my nose at a place like this whatever the outside talk is who cares in these days anyway fashionable peoples broader minded than they used to be in queen victorias young days they tell me servants were no class that didnt live in families where they kept the commandments fat lot the commandments give any one trouble in these times said jennings the footman who was a wit theres one of em i could mention thats been broken till theres no bits of it left to keep if i smashed that plate until it was powder itd have to be swept into the dust din thats what happened to one or two commandments in particular well remarked mrs blayne the cook she dont interfere and he pays the bills prompt thatll do me instead of commandments if youll believe me my mother told me that in them queen victoria days ladies used to inquire about cold meat and ask what was done with the dripping civilisations gone beyond thatcommandments or no commandments hes precious particular about bills being paid volunteered jennings with the air of a man of the world i heard him having a row with her one day about some bills she hadnt paid shed spent the money for some nonsense and he was pretty stiff in that queer way of his quite right he was too id have been the same myself pulling up his collar and stretching his neck in a manner indicating exact knowledge of the natural sentiments of a marquis when justly annoyed what he intimated was that if them bills was not paid with the money that was meant to pay them the money wouldnt be forthcoming the next time jennings was rather pleased by the word forthcoming and therefore he repeated it with emphasis it wouldnt be forthcoming thatd frighten her was andrews succinct observation it did said jennings shed have gone in hysterics if he hadnt kept her down hes got a way with him coombe has andrews laughed a brief dry laugh do you know what the child calls her she said she calls her the lady downstairs shes got a sort of fancy for her and tries to get peeps at her when we go out i notice she always cranes her little neck if we pass a room she might chance to be in its her pretty clothes and her laughing that does it childrens drawn by bright colours and noise that sounds merry its my belief the child doesnt know she is her mother said mrs blayne as she opened an oven door to look at some rolls its my belief that if i told her she was she wouldnt know what the word meant it was me she got the name from andrews still laughed as she explained i used to tell her about the lady downstairs would hear if she made a noise or id say id let her have a peep at the lady downstairs if she was very good i saw she had a kind of awe of her though she liked her so much so it was a good way of managing her you maynt believe me but for a good bit i didnt take in that she didnt know there was such things as mothers and when i did take it in i saw there wasnt any use in trying to explain she wouldnt have understood how would you go about to explain a mother anyway suggested jennings id have to say that she was the person that had the right to slap your head if you didnt do what she told you id have to say that she was the woman that could keep you slaving at kitchen maids work fifteen hours a day said mrs blayne my mother was cook in a big house and trained me under her i never had one said andrews stiffly the truth was that she had taken care of eight infant brothers and sisters while her maternal parent slept raucously under the influence of beer when she was not quarrelling with her offspring jane the housemaid had passed a not uncomfortable childhood in the country and was perhaps of a soft nature id say that a mothers the one that you belong to and thats fond of you even if she does keep you straight she put in her mother isnt fond of her and doesnt keep herself straight said jennings so that wouldnt do and she doesnt slap her head or teach her to do kitchen maids work put in mrs blayne so yours is no use mr jennings and neither is mine miss andrews ll have to cook up an explanation of her own herself when she finds she has to she can get it out of a drury lane melodrama said jennings with great humour youll have to sit down some night miss andrews and say the time has come me cheeild when i must tell you all in this manner were mrs garethlawless and her maternal affections discussed below stairs the interesting fact remained that to robin the lady downstairs was merely a radiant and beautiful being who floated through certain rooms laughing or chattering like a bird and always wearing pretty clothes which were different each time one beheld her sometimes one might catch a glimpse of her through a door or if one pressed ones face against the window pane at the right moment she might get into her bright little carnage in the street below and after jennings had shut its door she might be seen to give a lovely flutter to her clothes as she settled back against the richly dark blue cushions it is a somewhat portentous thing to realize that a newborn human creature can only know what it is taught the teaching may be conscious or unconscious intelligent or idiotic exquisite or brutal the images presented by those surrounding it as its perceptions awaken day by day are those which record themselves on its soul its brain its physical being which is its sole means of expressing during physical life all it has learned that which automatically becomes the law at the dawning of newborn consciousness remains to its understanding the law of being the law of the universe to the cautious of responsibility this at times wears the aspect of an awesome thing suggesting however remotely that it might seem well perhaps to remove the shoes from ones feet as it were and tread with deliberate and delicate considering of ones steps as do the reverently courteous even on the approaching of an unknown altar this being acknowledged a scientific as well as a spiritual truth there remains no mystery in the fact that robin at six years oldwhen she watched the sparrows in the square gardensdid not know the name of the feeling which had grown within her as a result of her pleasure in the chance glimpses of the lady downstairs it was a feeling which made her eager to see her or anything which belonged to her it made her strain her child ears to catch the sound of her voice it made her long to hear andrews or the other servants speak of her and yet much too shy to dare to ask any questions she had found a place on the staircase leading to the nursery where by squeezing against the balustrade she could sometimes see the lady pass in and out of her pink bedroom she used to sit on a step and peer between the railing with beating heart sometimes after she had been put to bed for the night and andrews was safely entertained downstairs robin would be awakened from her first sleep by sounds in the room below and would creep out of bed and down to her special step and crouching in a hectic joy would see the lady come out with sparkling things in her hair and round her lovely very bare white neck and arms all swathed in tints and draperies which made her seem a vision of colour and light she was so radiant a thing that often the child drew in her breath with a sound like a little sob of ecstasy and her lip trembled as if she were going to cry but she did not know that what she felt was the yearning of a thing called lovea quite simple and natural common thing of which she had no reason for having any personal knowledge as she was unaware of mothers so she was unaware of affection of which andrews would have felt it to be superfluously sentimental to talk to her on the very rare occasions when the lady downstairs appeared on the threshold of the day nursery robinalways having been freshly dressed in one of her nicest frocksstood and stared with immense startled eyes and answered in a whisper the banal little questions put to her the lady appeared at such rare intervals and remained poised upon the threshold like a tropic plumaged bird for moments so brief that there never was time to do more than lose breath and gaze as at a sudden vision why she camewhen she did comerobin did not understand she evidently did not belong to the small dingy nurseries which grew shabbier every year as they grew steadily more grimy under the persistent london soot and fogs feather always held up her draperies when she came she would not have come at all but for the fact that she had once or twice been asked if the child was growing pretty and it would have seemed absurd to admit that she never saw her at all i think shes rather pretty she said downstairs shes round and she has a bright colouralmost too bright and her eyes are round too shes either rather stupid or shes shyand ones as bad as the other shes a child that stares if when andrews had taken her into the gardens she had played with other children robin would no doubt have learned something of the existence and normal attitude of mothers through the mere accident of childish chatter but it somehow happened that she never formed relations with the charges of other nurses she took it for granted for some time that this was because andrews had laid down some mysterious law andrews did not seem to form acquaintances herself sometimes she sat on a bench and talked a little to another nurse but she seldom sat twice with the same person it was indeed generally her custom to sit alone crocheting or sewing with a rather lofty and exclusive air and to call robin back to her side if she saw her slowly edging towards some other child my rule is to keep myself to myself she said in the kitchen and to look as if i was the one that would turn up noses if noses was to be turned up theres those that would snatch away their children if i let robin begin to make up to them some wouldnt of course but im not going to run risks im going to save my own pride but one morning when robin was watching her sparrows a nurse who was an old acquaintance surprised andrews by appearing in the gardens with two little girls in her charge they were children of nine and eleven and quite sufficient for themselves apart from the fact that they regarded robin as a baby and therefore took no notice of her they began playing with skipping ropes which left their nurse free to engage in delighted conversation with andrews it was conversation so delightful that robin was forgotten even to the extent of being allowed to follow her sparrows round a clump of shrubbery and therefore out of andrews sight though she was only a few yards away the sparrows this morning were quarrelsome and suddenly engaged in a fight pecking each other furiously beating their wings and uttering shrill protesting chipperings robin did not quite understand what they were doing and stood watching them with spellbound interest it was while she watched them that she heard footsteps on the gravel walk which stopped near her and made her look up to see who was at her side a big boy in highland kilts and bonnet and sporan was standing by her and she found herself staring into a pair of handsome deep blue eyes blue like the waters of a hillside tarn they were wide glowing friendly eyes and none like them had ever looked into hers before he seemed to her to be a very big boy indeed and in fact he was unusually tall and broad for his age but he was only eight years old and a simple enough child pagan robins heart began to beat as it did when she watched the lady downstairs but there was something different in the beating it was something which made her red mouth spread and curve itself into a smile which showed all her small teeth so they stood and stared at each other and for some strange strange reasoncreated perhaps with the creating of man and still hidden among the deep secrets of the universethey were drawn to each otherwanted each otherknew each other their advances were of course of the most primitiveas primitive and as much a matter of instinct as the nosing and sniffing of young animals he spread and curved his red mouth and showed the healthy whiteness of his own handsome teeth as she had shown her smaller ones then he began to run and prance round in a circle capering like a shetland pony to exhibit at once his friendliness and his prowess he tossed his curled head and laughed to make her laugh also and she not only laughed but clapped her hands he was more beautiful than anything she had ever seen before in her life and he was plainly trying to please her no child creature had ever done anything like it before because no child creature had ever been allowed by andrews to make friends with her he on his part was only doing what any other little boy animal would have doneexpressing his child masculinity by showing off before a little female but to this little female it had never happened before it was all beautifully elemental as does not too often happen two souls as well as two bodies were drawn towards each other by the magnet of being when he had exhibited himself for a minute or two he came back to her breathing fast and glowing my pony in scotland does that his name is chieftain he is a shetland pony and he is only that high he measured forty inches from the ground im called donal what are you called robin she answered her lips and voice trembling with joy he was so beautiful his hair was bright and curly his broad forehead was clear white where he had pushed back his bonnet with the eagle feather standing upright on it his strong legs and knees were white between his tartan kilt and his rolled back stockings the clasps which held his feather and the plaid over his shoulder were set with fine stones in rich silver she did not know that he was perfectly equipped as a little highland chieftain the head of his clan should be they began to play together and the unknown fates which do their work as they choose so wrought on this occasion as to cause andrews friend to set forth upon a journey through a story so exciting in its nature that its hearer was held spellbound and oblivious to her surroundings themselves once it is true she rose as in a dream and walked round the group of shrubs but the fates had arranged for that moment also robin was alone and was busily playing with some leaves she had plucked and laid on the seat of a bench for some mysterious reason she looked good for an hours safe occupation and andrews returned to her friends detailed and intimate version of a great country house scandal of which the papers were full because it had ended in the divorce court donal had at that special moment gone to pick some of the biggest leaves from the lilac bush of which the gardens contained numerous sooty specimens the leaves robin was playing with were some he had plucked first to show her a wonderful thing if you laid a leaf flat on the seat of the bench and were fortunate enough to possess a large pin you could prick beautiful patterns on the leafs greennessdots and circles and borders and tiny triangles of a most decorative order neither donal nor robin had a pin but donal had in his rolled down stocking a little dirk the point of which could apparently be used for any interesting purpose it was really he who did the decoration but robin leaned against the bench and looked on enthralled she had never been happy before in the entire course of her brief existence she had not known or expected any conditions other than those she was familiar withthe conditions of being fed and clothed kept clean and exercised but totally unloved and unentertained she did not even know that this nearness to another human creature the exchange of companionable looks which were like flashes of sunlight the mutual outbreaks of child laughter and pleasure were happiness to her what she felt the glow and delight of it had no name but she wanted it to go on and on never to be put an end to by andrews or anyone else the boy donal was not so unconscious he had been happy all his life what he felt was that he had liked this little girl the minute he saw her she was pretty though he thought her immensely younger than himself and when she had looked up at him with her round asking eyes he had wanted to talk to her and make friends he had not played much with boys and he had no haughty objection to girls who liked him this one did he saw at once through what means children so quickly convey to each otherwhile seeming scarcely to do more than playthe entire history of their lives and surroundings is a sort of occult secret it is not a matter of prolonged conversation perhaps images created by the briefest of unadorned statements produce on the unwritten tablets of the child mind immediate and complete impressions safe as the locked garden was andrews cannot have forgotten her charge for any very great length of time and yet before donal hearing his attendants voice from her corner left robin to join her and be taken home the two children knew each other intimately robin knew that donals home was in scotlandwhere there are hills and moors with stags on them he lived there with mother and he had been brought to london for a visit the person he called mother was a woman who took care of him and he spoke of her quite often robin did not think she was like andrews though she did not in the least know why on his part donal knew about the nurseries and the sparrows who hopped about on the slates of the houses opposite robin did not describe the nurseries to him but donal knew that they were ugly and that there were no toys in them and nothing to do also in some mystic fashion he realized that andrews would not let robin play with him if she saw them together and that therefore they must make the most of their time full of their joy in each other they actually embarked upon an ingenious infant intrigue which involved their trying to meet behind the shrubs if they were brought to the gardens the next day donal was sure he could come because his nurse always did what he asked of her he was so big now that she was not a real nurse but she had been his nurse when he was quite little and mother liked her to travel with them he had a tutor but he had stayed behind in scotland at braemarnie which was their house donal would come tomorrow and he would look for robin and when she saw him she must get away from andrews and they would play together again i will bring one of my picture books he said grandly can you read at all no answered robin adoring him what are picture books havent you any he blurted out no said robin she looked at the gravel walk reflecting a moment thoughtfully on the day nursery and the night nursery then she lifted her eyes to the glowing blueness of his and said quite simply i havent anything he suddenly remembered things his mother had told him about poor people perhaps she was poor could she be poor when her frock and hat and coat were so pretty it was not polite to ask but the thought made him love her more he felt something warm rush all over his body the truth if he had been old enough to be aware of it was that the entire simpleness of her acceptance of things as they were and a something which was unconsciousness of any cause for complaint moved his child masculinity enormously his old nurses voice came from her corner again i must go to nanny he said feeling somehow as if he had been running fast ill come tomorrow and bring two picture books he was a loving warm blooded child human thing and the expression of affection was to him a familiar natural impulse he put his strong little eightyearold arms round her and kissed her full on her mouth as he embraced her with all his strength he kissed her twice it was the first time for robin andrews did not kiss there was no one else it was the first time and nature had also made her a loving warm blooded human thing how beautiful he washow bighow strong his arms wereand how soft and warm his mouth felt she stood and gazed at him with wide asking eyes and laughed a little she had no words because she did not know what had happened dont you like to be kissed said donal uncertain because she looked so startled and had not kissed him back kissed she repeated with a small caught breath yees she knew now what it was it was being kissed she drew nearer at once and lifted up her face as sweetly and gladly as a flower lifts itself to the sun kiss me again she said quite eagerly as ingenuously and heartily as before he kissed her again and this time she kissed too when he ran quickly away she stood looking after him with smiling trembling lips uplifted joyfulwondering and amazed chapter viii when she went back to andrews she carried the pricked leaves with her she could not have left them behind from what source she had drawn a characterizing passionate though silent strength of mind and body it would be difficult to explain her mind and her emotions had been left utterly unfed but they were not of the inert order which scarcely needs feeding her feeling for the sparrows had held more than she could have expressed her secret adoration of the lady downstairs was an intense thing her immediate surrender to the desire in the first pair of human eyeschild eyes though they werewhich had ever called to her being for response was simple and undiluted rapture she had passed over her little soul without a moments delay and without any knowledge of the giving it had flown from her as a bird might fly from darkness into the sun eightyearold donal was the sun no special tendency to innate duplicity was denoted by the fact that she had acquired through her observation of andrews jennings jane and mrs blayne the knowledge that there were things it was best not to let other people know you were careful about them from the occult communications between herself and donal which had resulted in their intrigue there had of course evolved a realizing sense of the value of discretion she did not let andrews see the decorated leaves but put them into a small pocket in her coat her machiavellian intention was to slip them out when she was taken up to the nursery andrews was always in a hurry to go downstairs to her lunch and she would be left alone and could find a place where she could hide them andrews friend started when robin drew near to them the childs cheeks and lips were the colour of jacqueminot rose petals her eyes glowed with actual rapture my word thats a beauty if i ever saw one said the woman first sight makes you jump my word robin however did not know what she was talking about and in fact scarcely heard her she was thinking of donal she thought of him as she was taken home and she did not cease thinking of him during the whole rest of the day and far into the night when andrews left her she found a place to hide the pricked leaves and before she put them away she did what donal had done to hershe kissed them she kissed them several times because they were donals leaves and he had made the stars and lines on them it was almost like kissing donal but not quite so beautiful after she was put to bed at night and andrews left her she lay awake for a long time she did not want to go to sleep because everything seemed so warm and wonderful and she could think and think and think what she thought about was donals face his delightful eyes his white forehead with curly hair pushed back with his highland bonnet his plaid swung about when he ran and jumped when he held her tight the buttons of his jacket hurt her a little because they pressed against her body what was mother like did he kiss her what pretty stones there were in his clasps and buckles how nice it was to hear him laugh and how fond he was of laughing donal donal donal he liked to play with her though she was a girl and so little he would play with her tomorrow his cheeks were bright pink his hair was bright his eyes were bright he was all bright she tried to see into the blueness of his eyes again as it seemed when they looked at each other close to as she began to see the clear colour she fell asleep the power which had on the first morning guided robin to the seclusion behind the clump of shrubs and had provided andrews with an enthralling companion extended the next day an even more beneficient and complete protection andrews was smitten with a cold so alarming as to confine her to bed having no intention of running any risks whatsoever she promptly sent for a younger sister who temporarily being out of place came into the house as substitute she was a pretty young woman who assumed no special responsibilities and was fond of reading novels shes been trained to be no trouble anne shell amuse herself without bothering you as long as you keep her out andrews said of robin anne took lady audleys secret with her to the gardens and having led her charge to a shady and comfortable seat which exactly suited her she settled herself for a pleasant morning now you can play while i read she said to robin as they had entered the gardens they had passed not far from the gate a bench on which sat a highly respectable looking woman who was hemming a delicate bit of cambric and evidently in charge of two picture books which lay on the seat beside her a fine boy in highland kilts was playing a few yards away robin felt something like a warm flood rush over her and her joy was so great and exquisite that she wondered if anne felt her hand trembling anne did not because she was looking at a lady getting into a carriage across the street the marvel of that early summer morning in the gardens of a splendid but dingy london square was not a thing for which human words could find expression it was not an earthly thing or at least not a thing belonging to an earth grown old a child adam and eve might have known something like it in the garden of eden it was as clear and simple as spring water and as warm as the sun annes permission to play once given robin found her way behind the group of lilacs and snowballs donal would come not only because he was so big that nanny would let him do what he wanted to do but because he would do everything and anything in the world donal donal her heart was a mere babys heart but it beat as if she were seventeenbeat with pure rapture he was all bright and he would laugh and laugh the coming was easy enough for donal he had told his mother and nanny rejoicingly about the little girl he had made friends with and who had no picture books but he did not come straight to her he took his picture books under his arm and showing all his white teeth in a joyous grin set out to begin their play properly with a surprise he did not let her see him coming but stalked her behind the trees and bushes until he found where she was waiting and then thrust his face between the branches of a tall shrub near her and laughed the outright laugh she loved and when she turned she was looking straight into the clear blue she had tried to see when she fell asleep donal donal she cried like a little bird with but one note the lilac and the snowball were in blossom and there was a big hawthorn tree which smelt sweet and sweet they could not see the drift of smuts on the blossoms they only smelled the sweetness and sat under the hawthorn and sniffed and sniffed the sun was deliciously warm and a piano organ was playing beautifully not far away they sat close to each other so close that the picture book could lie open on both pairs of knees and the warmth of each young body penetrated the softness of the other sometimes donal threw an arm around her as she bent over the page love and caresses were not amazements to him he accepted them as parts of the normal joy of life to robin they were absolute wonder the pictures were delight and amazement in one donal knew all about them and told her stories she felt that such splendour could have emanated only from him it could not occur to her that he had not invented them and made the pictures he showed her robinson crusoe and robin hood the scent of the hawthorn and lilac intoxicated them and they laughed tremendously because robin hoods name was like robins own and he was a man and she was a girl they could scarcely stop laughing and donal rolled over and over on the grass half from unconquerable high spirits and half to make robin laugh still more he had some beautiful coloured glass marbles in his pocket and he showed her how to play with them and gave her two of the prettiest he could shoot them over the ground in a way to thrill the beholder he could hop on one leg as far as he liked he could read out of books do you like me he said once in a pause between displays of his prowess robin was kneeling upon the grass watching him and she clasped her little hands as if she were uttering a prayer oh yes yes she yearned yes yes i like you he answered i told my mother all about you he came to her and knelt by her side have you a mother he asked no shaking her head do you live with your aunt no i dont live with anybody he looked puzzled isnt there any lady in your house he put it to her she brightened a little relieved to think she had something to tell him theres the lady downstairs she said shes so prettyso pretty is she he stopped and shook his head she couldnt be your mother he corrected himself youd know about her she wears pretty clothes sometimes they float about and sparkle and she wears little crowns on her heador flowers she laughs robin described eagerly a great many people come to see her they all laugh sometimes they sing i lie in bed and listen does she ever come upstairs to the nursery inquired donal with a somewhat reflective air yes she comes and stands near the door and says is she quite well andrews she does not laugh then sheshe looks at me she stopped there feeling suddenly that she wished very much that she had more to tell what she was saying was evidently not very satisfactory he seemed to expect moreand she had no more to give a sense of emptiness crept upon her and for no reason she understood there was a little click in her throat does she only stand near the door he suggested as one putting the situation to a sort of crucial test does she never sit on a big chair and take you on her knee no no in a dropped voice she will not sit down she says the chairs are grubby doesnt she love you at all persisted donal doesnt she kiss you there was a thing she had known for what seemed to her a long timegod knows in what mysterious fashion she had learned it but learned it well she had that no human being but herself was aware of her knowledge was inevitable to whom could she have told it but donaldonal wanted to know all about her the little click made itself felt in her throat again sheshe doesnt like me her dropped voice was the whisper of one humbled to the dust by confession shedoesnt like me and the click became another thing which made her put up her arm over her eyesher round troubled child eyes which as she had looked into donals had widened with sudden bewildered tears donal flung his arms round her and squeezed his buttons into her tender chest he hugged her close he kissed her there was a choking in his throat he was hot all over she does like you she must like you ill make her he cried passionately shes not your mother if she was shed love you shed love you do mothers llove you the small voice asked with a half sob whatswhats love you it was not vulgar curiosity she only wanted to find out he loosed his embrace sitting back on his heels to stare dont you know she shook her head with soft meekness nno she answered big boys like himself did not usually play with such little girls but something had drawn him to her at their first moment of encounter she wasnt like any other little girls he felt it all the time and that was part of the thing which drew him he was not of course aware that the male thrill at being regarded as one who is a god had its power over the emotions she wasnt making silly fun and pretending she really didnt knowbecause she was different its liking very much its more he explained my mother loves me ii love you stoutly yes i love you thats why i kissed you when you cried she was so uplifted so overwhelmed with adoring gratitude that as she knelt on the grass she worshipped him i love you she answered him i love youlove you and she looked at him with such actual prayerfulness that he caught at her and with manly promptness kissed her againthis being mere nature because he was eight years old and she was six her tears flashed away and they both laughed joyously as they sat down on the grass again to talk it over he told her all the pleasant things he knew about mothers the world was full of them it seemedfull you belong to them from the time you were a baby he had not known many personally because he had always lived at braemarnie which was in the country in scotland there were no houses near his home you had to drive miles and miles before you came to a house or a castle he had not seen much of other children except a few who lived at the manse and belonged to the minister children had fathers as well as mothers fathers did not love you or take care of you quite as much as mothersbecause they were men but they loved you too his own father had died when he was a baby his mother loved him as much as he loved her she was beautiful butit seemed to reveal itselfnot like the lady downstairs she did not laugh very much though she laughed when they played together he was too big now to sit on her knee but squeezed into the big chair beside her when she read or told him stories he always did what his mother told him she knew everything in the world and so knew what he ought to do even when he was a big man he should do what his mother told him robin listened to every word with enraptured eyes and bated breath this was the story of love and life and it was the first time she had ever heard it it was as much a revelation as the kiss she had spent her days in the grimy nursery and her one close intimate had been a bony woman who had taught her not to cry employing the practical method of terrifying her into silence by pinching herknowing it was quite safe to do it it had not been necessary to do it often she had seen people on the streets but she had only seen them in passing by she had not watched them as she had watched the sparrows when she was taken down for a few minutes into the basement she vaguely knew that she was in the way and that mrs blaynes and andrews and jennings low voices and occasional sidelong look meant that they were talking about her and did not want her to hear i have no mother and no father she explained quite simply to donal no one kisses me no one donal said feeling curious has no one ever kissed you but me no she answered donal laughedbecause children always laugh when they do not know what else to do was that why you looked as if you were frightened when i said goodbye to you yesterday ii didnt know said robin laughing a little toobut not very much i wasnt frightened i liked you ill kiss you as often as you want me to he volunteered nobly im used to itbecause of my mother ill kiss you again now and he did it quite without embarrassment it was a sort of manly gratuity once anne with her book in her hand came round the shrubs to see how her charge was employing herself and seeing her looking at pictures with a handsomely dressed companion she returned to lady audleys secret feeling entirely safe the lilac and the hawthorn tree continued to breathe forth warmed scents of paradise in the sunshine the piano organ went on playing sometimes nearer sometimes farther away but evidently finding the neighbourhood a desirable one sometimes the children laughed at each other sometimes at pictures donal showed or stories he told or at his own extreme wit the boundaries were removed from robins world she began to understand that there was another larger one containing wonderful and delightful things she had known nothing about donal was revealing it to her in everything he said even when he was not aware that he was telling her anything when eve was formed from the rib of adam the information it was necessary for him to give her regarding her surroundings must have filled her with enthralling interest and a reverence which adored the planted enclosure which was the central feature of the soot sprinkled stately london square was as the garden of eden the garden of eden it remained for two weeks andrews cold was serious enough to require a doctor and her sister anne continued to perform their duties the weather was exceptionally fine and being a vain young woman she liked to dress robin in her pretty clothes and take her out because she was a beauty and attracted attention to her nurse as well as to herself mornings spent under the trees reading were entirely satisfactory each morning the children played together and each night robin lay awake and lived again the delights of the past hours each day she learned more wonders and her young mind and soul were fed there began to stir in her brain new thoughts and the beginning of questioning scotland braemarnie donals mother even the manse and the children in it combined to form a world of enchantment there were hills with stags living in them there were moors with purple heather and yellow brome and gorse birds built their nests under the bushes and donals pony knew exactly where to step even in the roughest places there were two boys and two girls at the manse and they had a father and a mother these things were enough for a new heaven and a new earth to form themselves around the centre of the whole universe was donal with his strength and his laugh and his eyes which were so alive and glowing that she seemed always to see them she knew nothing about the thing which was their somehownottobedenied allure they were asking eyesand eyes which gave the boy was in truth a splendid creature his body and beauty were perfect life and joyous perfect living his eyes asked other eyes for everything tell me more they said tell me more like me answer me let us give each other everything in the world he had always been well he had always been happy he had always been praised and loved he had known no other things during the first week in which the two children played together his mother whose intense desire it was to understand him observed in him a certain absorption of mood when he was not talking or amusing himself actively he began to fall into a habit of standing at the windows often with his chin in his hand looking out as if he were so full of thought that he saw nothing it was not an old habit it was a new one what are you thinking about donal she asked one afternoon he seemed to awaken as it were when he heard her he turned about with his alluring smile i am thinking it is funny he said it is funny that i should like such a little girl such a lot she is years and years younger than i am but i like her so it is such fun to tell her things he marched over to his mothers writing table and leaned against it what his mother saw was that he had an impassioned desire to talk about this child she felt it was a desire even a trifle abnormal in its eagerness she has such a queer house i think he explained she has a nurse and such pretty clothes and she is so pretty herself but i dont believe she has any toys or books in her nursery where is her mother she must be dead there is no lady in her house but the lady downstairs she is very pretty and is always laughing but she is not her mother because she doesnt like her and she never kisses her i think thats the queerest thing of all no one had ever kissed her till i did his mother was a woman given to psychological analysis her eyes began to dwell on his face with slightly anxious questioning did you kiss her she inquired yes i kissed her when i said good morning the first day i thought she didnt like me to do it but she did it was only because no one had ever done it before she likes it very much he leaned farther over the writing table and began to pour forth his smile growing and his eyes full of pleasure his mother was a trifle alarmedly struck by the feeling that he was talking like a young man in love who cannot keep his tongue still though in his case even the youngest manhood was years away and he made no effort to conceal his sentiments which a young man would certainly have striven to do shes got such a pretty little face and such a pretty mouth and cheeks he touched a jacqueminot rose in a vase they are the colour of that today a robin came with the sparrows and hopped about near us we laughed and laughed because her eyes are like the robins and she is called robin i wish you would come into the gardens and see her mother she likes everything i do i must come dear she answered nanny thinks she is lovely he announced she says i am in love with her am i mother you are too young to be in love she said and even when you are older you must not fall in love with people you know nothing about it was an unconscious bit of scotch cautiousness which she at once realized was absurd and quite out of place but she realized it because he stood up and squared his shoulders in an odd youngmannish way he had not flushed even faintly before and now a touch of colour crept under his fair skin but i do love her he said i do i cant stop and though he was quite simple and obviously little boylike she actually felt frightened for a moment chapter ix on the afternoon of the day upon which this occurred coombe was standing in feathers drawingroom with a cup of tea in his hand and wearing the look of a man who is given up to reflection i saw mrs muir today for the first time for several years he said after a silence she is in london with the boy is she as handsome as ever quite hers is not the beauty that disappears it is line and bearing and a sort of splendid grace and harmony what is the boy like coombe reflected again before he answered he isamazing one so seldom sees anything approaching physical perfection that it strikes one a sort of blow when one comes upon it suddenly face to face is he as beautiful as all that the greeks used to make statues of bodies like his they often called them godsbut not always the creative intention plainly was that all human beings should be beautiful and he is the expression of it feather was pretending to embroider a pink flower on a bit of gauze and she smiled vaguely i dont know what you mean she admitted with no abasement of spirit but if ever there was any intention of that kind it has not been carried out her smile broke into a little laugh as she stuck her needle into her work im thinking of henry she let drop in addition so was i it happened answered coombe after a second or so of pause henry was the next of kin who wasto coombes great objectionhis heir presumptive and was universally admitted to be a repulsive sort of person both physically and morally he had brought into the world a weakly and rickety framework and had from mere boyhood devoted himself to a life which would have undermined a hercules a relative may so easily present the aspect of an unfortunate incident over which one has no control this was the case with henry his character and appearance were such that even his connection with an important heritage was not enough to induce respectable persons to accept him in any form but if coombe remained without issue henry would be the head of the house how is his cough inquired feather frightful he is an emaciated wreck and he has no physical cause for remaining alive feather made three or four stitches does mrs muir know she said if mrs muir is conscious of his miserable existence that is all he answered she is not the woman to inquire of course she cannot help knowing thatwhen he is done withher boy takes his place in the line of succession oh yes shed know that put in feather it was coombe who smiled nowvery faintly you have a mistaken view of her he said you admire her very much feather bridled the figure of this big scotch creature with her line and her splendid grace and harmony was enough to make one bridle she doesnt admire me said coombe she is not proud of me as a connection she doesnt really want the position for the boy in her heart of hearts doesnt want it feathers exclamation was a little jeer only because she would not have dared a big one she is scotch early victorian in some things and extremely advanced in others he went on she has strong ideas of her own as to how he shall be brought up shes rather greek in her feeling for his being as perfect physically and mentally as she can help him to be she believes things it was she who said what you did not understandabout the creative intention i suppose she is religious feather said scotch people often are but their religion isnt usually like that creative intentions a new name for god i suppose i ought to know all about god ive heard enough about him my father was not a clergyman but he was very miserable and it made him so religious that he was almost one we were every one of us christened and catechized and confirmed and all that so gods rather an old story queer how oldfrom greenlands icy mountains to indias coral strand said coombe its an ancient searchthat for the ideawhether it takes form in metal or wood or stone well said feather holding her bit of gauze away from her the better to criticize the pink flower as almost a clergymans daughter i must say that if there is one thing god didnt do it was to fill the world with beautiful people and things as if it was only to be happy in it was made toto try us by suffering andthat sort of thing its aawhat dye call it something beginning with p probation suggested coombe regarding her with an expression of speculative interest her airy bringing forth of her glib timeworn little scraps of orthodoxyas one who fished them out of a bag of longdiscarded remnants of rubbishwas so true to type that it almost fascinated him for a moment yes thats itprobation she answered i knew it began with a p it means thorny paths and seas of blood and if you are religious you tread them with bleeding feet or swim them as the people do in hymns and you praise and glorify all the time youre doing it of course im not religious myself and i cant say i think its pleasantbut i do know every body beautiful and perfect indeed thats not religionits being irreligious good gracious think of the cripples and lepers and hunchbacks and the idea is that god made them allby way of entertaining himself he put it to her quietly well who else did said feather cheerfully i dont know he said certain things i heard mrs muir say suggested to one that it might be interesting to think it out did she talk to you about god at afternoon tea said feather its the kind of thing a religious scotch woman might do no she did not talk to me perhaps that was her mistake she might have reformed me she never says more to me than civility demands and it was not at tea i accidentally dropped in on the bethunes and found an oriental had been lecturing there mrs muir was talking to him and i heard her the man seemed to be a scholar and a deep thinker and as they talked a group of us stood and listened or asked questions how funny said feather it was not funny at all it was astonishingly calm and seriousand logical the logic was the new note i had never thought of reason in that connection reason has nothing to do with it you must have faith you must just believe what youre told not think at all thinking is wickednessunless you think what you hear preached feather was even a trifle delicately smug as she rattled off her orthodoxybut she laughed after she had done with it but it must have been funnya turk or a hindoo in a turban and a thing like a tea gown and mrs muir in her edinburgh looking clothes talking about god you are quite out of it coombe did not smile at all as he said it the oriental was as physically beautiful as donal muir is and mrs muirno other woman in the room compared with her perhaps people who think grow beautiful feather was not often alluring or coquettish in her manner to coombe but she tilted her head prettily and looked down at her flower through lovely lashes i dont think she said and i am not so bad looking no he answered coldly you are not at times you look like a young angel if mrs muir is like that she said after a brief pause i should like to know what she thinks of me no you would notneither should iif she thinks at all was his answer but you remember you said you did not mind that sort of thing i dont why should i it cant harm me her hint of a pout made her mouth entrancing but if she thinks good looks are the result of religiousness i should like to let her see robinand compare her with her boy i saw robin in the park last week and shes a perfect beauty last week said coombe she doesnt need anyone but andrews i should bore her to death if i went and sat in the nursery and stared at her no one does that sort of thing in these days but i should like to see mrs muir to see the two children together that could not easily be arranged i am afraid he said why not his answer was politely deliberate she greatly disapproves of me i have told you she is not proud of the relationship she does not like me you mean excuse me i mean exactly what i said in telling you that she has her own very strong views of the boys training and surroundings they may be ridiculous but that sort of thing need not trouble you feather held up her hand and actually laughed if robin meets him in ten years from nowthat for her very strong views of his training and surroundings and she snapped her fingers mrs muirs distaste for her sons unavoidable connection with the man he might succeed had a firm foundation she had been brought up in a scottish manse where her father dominated as an omnipotent and almost divine authority as a child of imagination she had not been happy but she had been obedient in her girlhood she had varied from type through her marriage with a young man who was a dreamer an advanced thinker an impassioned greek scholar and a lover of beauty after he had released her from her terrors of damnation they had been profoundly happy they were young and at ease and they read and thought together ardently they explored new creeds and cults and sometimes found themselves talking nonsense and sometimes discovering untrodden paths of wisdom they were youthful enough to be solemn about things at times and clever enough to laugh at their solemnity when they awakened to it helen muir left the reverent gloom of the life at the manse far behind despite her respect for certain meanings they beclouded i live in a new structure she said to her husband but it is built on a foundation which is like a solid subterranean chamber i dont use the subterranean chamber or go into it i dont want to but now and then echoesalmost noisesmake themselves heard in it sometimes i find i have listened in spite of myself she had always been rather grave about her little son and when her husbands early death left him and his dignified but not large estate in her care she realized that there lay in her hands the power to direct a life as she chose in as far as was humanly possible the pure blood and healthy tendencies of a long and fine ancestry expressing themselves in the boys splendid body and unusual beauty had set the minds of two imaginative people working from the first one of muirs deepest interests was the study of development of the race it was he who had planted in her mind that daringly fearless thought of a human perfection as to the intention of the creative cause they used to look at the child as he lay asleep and note the beauty of himhis hands his feet his torso the tint and texture and line of him this is what was meantin the plan for every human beinghow could there be scamping and inefficiency in creation it is we ourselves who have scamped and been incomplete in our thought and life here he is look at him but he will only develop as he isif living does not warp him this was what his father said his mother was at her gravest as she looked down at the little god in the crib its as if some power had thrust a casket of loose jewels into our hands and said it is for you to see that not one is lost she murmured then the looked up and smiled are we being solemnover a baby she said perhaps he was always even readier to smile than she was ive an idea however that theres enough to be solemn aboutnot too solemn but just solemn enough you are a beautiful thing fair helen why shouldnt he be like you neither of us will forget what we have just said through her darkest hours of young bereavement she remembered the words many times and felt as if they were a sort of light she might hold in her hand as she trod the paths of the afterwards which were in the days before her she lived with donal at braemarnie and lived for him without neglecting her duty of being the head of a household and an estate and also a good and gracious neighbour to things and people she kept watch over every jewel in his casket great and small he was so much a part of her religion that sometimes she realized that the echoes from the subterranean chamber were perhaps making her a little strict but she tried to keep guard over herself he was handsome and radiant with glowing health and vitality he was a friendly rejoicing creature and as full of the joy of life as a scampering moor pony he was clever enough but not too clever and he was friends with the world braemarnie was picturesquely ancient and beautiful it would be a home of sufficient ease and luxury to be a pleasure but no burden life in it could be perfect and also supply freedom coombe court and coombe keep were huge and castellated and demanded great things even if the head of the house had been a man to like and be proud ofthe accession of a beautiful young marquis would rouse the hounds of war so to speak and set them racing upon his track even the totally unalluring henry had been beset with temptations from his earliest years that he promptly succumbed to the first only brought forth others it did not seem fair that a creature so different a splendid fearless thing should be dragged from his hills and moors and fair heather and made to breathe the foul scent of things of whose poison he could know nothing she was not an ignorant childish woman in her fine aloof way she had learned much in her stays in london with her husband and in their explorings of foreign cities this was the reason for her views of her boys training and surroundings she had not asked questions about coombe himself but it had not been necessary once or twice she had seen feather by chance in spite of herself she had heard about henry now and then he was furbished up and appeared briefly at coombe court or at the keep it was always briefly because he inevitably began to verge on misbehaving himself after twentyfour hours had passed on his last visit to coombe house in town where he had turned up without invitation he had become so frightfully drunk that he had been barely rescued from the trifling faux pas of attempting to kiss a very young royal princess there were quite definite objections to henry helen muir was not proud of the coombe relationship and with unvaried and resourceful good breeding kept herself and her boy from all chance of being drawn into anything approaching an intimacy donal knew nothing of his prospects there would be time enough for that when he was older but in the meantime there should be no intercourse if it could be avoided she had smiled at herself when the echo had prompted her to the hint of a quaint caution in connection with his little boy flame of delight in the strange child he had made friends with but it had been a flame and though she had smiled she sat very still by the window later that night and she had felt a touch of weight on her heart as she thought it over there were wonderful years when one could give ones children all the things they wanted she was saying to herselfthe desires of their child hearts the joy of their child bodies their little raptures of delight those were divine years they were so safe then donal was living through those years now he did not know that any happiness could be taken from him he was hers and she was his it would be horrible if there were anything one could not let him keepin this early unshadowed time she was looking out at the spring night with all its stars lit and gleaming over the park which she could see from her window suddenly she left her chair and rang for nanny nanny she said when the old nurse came tell me something about the little girl donal plays with in the square gardens shes a bonny thing and finely dressed maam was the womans careful answer but i dont make friends with strange nurses and i dont think much of hers shes a young dawdler who sits novel reading and if master donal were a young pickpocket with the measles the child would be playing with him just the same as far as i can see the young woman sits under a tree and reads and the pretty little thing may do what she likes i keep my eye on them however and theyre in no mischief master donal reads out of his picture books and shows himself off before her grandly and she laughs and looks up to him as if he were a king every lad child likes a woman child to look up to him its pretty to see the pair of them theyre daft about each other just wee things in love at first sight donal has known very few girls those plain little things at the manse are too dull for him his mother said slowly this ones not plain and shes not dull nanny answered my word but shes like a bit of witch fire dancingwith her colour and her big silk curls in a heap donal stares at her like a young man at a beauty i wish maam we knew more of her forbears i must see her mrs muir said tomorrow ill go with you both to the gardens therefore the following day donal pranced proudly up the path to his trysting place and with him walked a tall lady at whom people looked as she passed she was fair like donal and had a small head softly swathed with lovely folds of hair also her eyes were very clear and calm donal was plainly proud and happy to be with her and was indeed prancing though his prance was broken by walking steps at intervals robin was waiting behind the lilac bushes and her nurse was already deep in the mystery of lady audley there she is cried donal and he ran to her my mother has come with me she wants to see you too and he pulled her forward by her hand this is robin mother this is robin he panted with elation and stood holding his prize as if she might get away before he had displayed her his eyes lifted to his tall mothers were those of an exultant owner robin had no desire to run away to adore anything which belonged to donal was only nature and this tall fair wonderful person was a mother no wonder donal talked of her so much the child could only look up at her as donal did so they stood hand in hand like little worshippers before a deity andrews sister in her pride had attired the small creature like a flower of spring her exquisiteness and her physical brilliancy gave mrs muir something not unlike a slight shock oh no wondersince she was like that she stooped and kissed the round cheek delicately donal wanted me to see his little friend she said i always want to see his playmates shall we walk round the garden together and you shall show me where you play and tell me all about it she took the small hand and they walked slowly robin was at first too much awed to talk but as donal was not awed at all and continued his prancing and the mother lady said pretty things about the flowers and the grass and the birds and even about the pony at braemarnie she began now and then to break into a little hop herself and presently into sudden ripples of laughter like a birds brief bubble of song the tall ladys hand was not like andrews or the hand of andrews sister it did not pull or jerk and it had a lovely feeling the sensation she did not know was happiness again welled up within her just one walk round the garden and then the tall lady sat down on a seat to watch them play it was wonderful she did not read or work she sat and watched them as if she wanted to do that more than anything else donal kept calling out to her and making her smile he ran backwards and forwards to her to ask questions and tell her what they were making up to play when they gathered leaves to prick stars and circles on they did them on the seat on which she sat and she helped them with new designs several times in the midst of her play robin stopped and stood still a moment with a sort of puzzled expression it was because she did not feel like robin two peoplea big boy and a ladyletting her play and talk to them as if they liked her and had time the truth was that mrs muirs eyes followed robin more than they followed donal their clear deeps yearned over her such a glowing vital little thing no wonder no wonder and as she grew older she would be more vivid and compelling with every year and donal was of her kind his strength his beauty his fearless happinessclaiming temperament how could onewith dignity and delicacyfind out why she had this obvious air of belonging to nobody donal was an exact little lad he had had foundation for his curious scraps of her story no motherno playthings or booksno one had ever kissed her and she dressed and soigne like this who was the lady downstairs a victoria was driving past the gardens it was going slowly because the two people in it wished to look at the spring budding out of hyacinths and tulips suddenly one of the paira sweetlyhued figure whose early season attire was hyacinthlike itselfspoke to the coachman stop here she said i want to get out as the victoria drew up near a gate she made a light gesture what do you think starling she laughed the very woman we are talking about is sitting in the gardens there i know her perfectly though i only saw her portrait at the academy years ago yes there she is mrs muir you know she clapped her hands and her laugh became a delighted giggle and my robin is playing on the grass near herwith a boy what a joke it must be the boy and i wanted to see the pair together coombe said couldnt be done and more than anything i want to speak to her lets get out they got out and this was why helen muir turning her eyes a moment from robin whose hand she was holding saw two women coming towards her with evident intention at least one of them had evident intention she was the one whose light attire produced the effect of being made of hyacinth petals because mrs muirs glance turned towards her robins turned also she started a little and leaned against mrs muirs knee her eyes growing very large and round indeed and filling with a sudden worshipping light it is she ecstatically sighed or rather gasped the lady downstairs feather floated near to the seat and paused smiling where is your nurse robin she said robin being always dazzled by the sight of her did not of course shine she is reading under the tree she answered tremulously she is only a few yards away said mrs muir she knows robin is playing with my boy and that i am watching them robin is your little girl amiably yes so kind of you to let her play with your boy dont let her bore you i am mrs garethlawless there was a little silencea delicate little silence i recognized you as mrs muir at once said feather unperturbed and smiling brilliantly i saw your portrait at the grosvenor yes said mrs muir gently she had risen and was beautifully tallthe line was perfect and she looked with a gracious calm into feathers eyes donal allured by the hyacinth petal colours drew near robin made an unconscious little catch at his plaid and whispered something is this donal feather said are you the lady downstairs please donal put in politely because he wanted so to know feathers pretty smile ended in the prettiest of outright laughs her maid had told her andrews story of the name yes i believe thats what she calls me its a nice name for a mother isnt it donal took a quick step forward are you her mother he asked eagerly of course i am donal quite flushed with excitement she doesnt know he said he turned on robin shes your mother you thought you hadnt one shes your mother but i am the lady downstairs too feather was immensely amused she was not subtle enough to know why she felt a perverse kind of pleasure in seeing the scotch woman standing so still and that it led her into a touch of vulgarity i wanted very much to see your boy she said yes still gently from mrs muir because of coombe you know we are such old friends how queer that the two little things have made friends too i didnt know i am so glad i caught a glimpse of you and that i had seen the portrait good morning goodbye children while she strayed airily away they all watched her she picked up her friend the starling who not feeling concerned or needed had paused to look at daffodils the children watched her until her victoria drove away the chiffon ruffles of her flowerlike parasol fluttering in the air mrs muir had sat down again and donal and robin leaned against her they saw she was not laughing any more but they did not know that her eyes had something like grief in them shes her mother donal cried shes lovely too but shesher mother and his voice and face were equally puzzled robins little hand delicately touched mrs muir isshe she faltered helen muir took her in her arms and held her quite close she kissed her yes she is my lamb she said shes your mother she was clear as to what she must do for donals sake it was the only safe and sane course butat this agethe child was a lamb and she could not help holding her close for a moment her little body was deliciously soft and warm and the big silk curls all in a heap were a fragrance against her breast chapter x donal talked a great deal as he pranced home feather had excited as well as allured him why hadnt she told robin she was her mother why did she never show her pictures in the nursery and hold her on her knee she was little enough to be held on knees did some mothers never tell their children and did the children never find out this was what he wanted to hear explained he took the gloved hand near him and held it close and a trifle authoritatively i am glad i know you are my mother he said i always knew he was not sure that the matter was explained very clearly not as clearly as things usually were but he was not really disturbed he had remembered a book he could show robin tomorrow and he thought of that there was also a game in a little box which could be easily carried under his arm his mother was thinking and he was used to that it came on her sometimes and of his own volition he always on such occasion kept as quiet as was humanly possible after he was asleep helen sent for nanny youre tired maam the woman said when she saw her im afraid youve a headache i have had a good deal of thinking to do since this afternoon her mistress answered you were right about the nurse the little girl might have been playing with any boy chance sent in her wayboys quite unlike donal yes maam and because she loved her and knew her face and voice nanny watched her closely you will be asstartledas i was by some queer chance the childs mother was driving by and saw us and came in to speak to me nannyshe is mrs garethlawless nanny did start she also reddened and spoke sharply and she came in and spoke to you maam things have altered and are altering every day mrs muir said society is not at all inflexible she has a smart set of her ownand she is very pretty and evidently well provided for easygoing people who choose to find explanations suggest that her husband was a relation of lord lawdors and him a canny scotchman with a new child a year yes my certie offered nanny with an acrid grimness mrs muirs hands clasped strongly as they lay on the table before her that doesnt come within my bailiewick she said in her quiet voice her life is her own and not mine words are the wind that blows she stopped just a moment and began again we must leave for scotland by the earliest train whatll he do the words escaped from the woman as if involuntarily she even drew a quick breath hes a strong feeling bairnstrong hell be stronger when he is a young man nanny desperately that is why i must act now there is no half way i dont want to be hard oh am i hardam i hard she cried out low as if she were pleading no maam you are not hes your own flesh and blood nanny had never before seen her mistress as she saw her in the next curious almost exaggerated moment her hand flew to her side hes my heart and my soul she said he is the very entrails of me and it will hurt him so and i cannot explain to him because he is too young to understand he is only a little boy who must go where he is taken and he cannot help himself itsunfair nanny was prone to become more scotch as she became moved but she still managed to look grim he canna help himsel she said an waur still you canna there was a moment of stillness and then she said i must go and pack up and walked out of the room donal always slept like a young roe in the bracken and in deep and rapturous ease he slept this night another perfectly joyful day had passed and his mother had liked robin and kissed her all was well with the world as long as he had remained awakeand it had not been longhe had thought of delightful things unfeverishly of robin somehow at braemarnie growing bigger very quicklybig enough for all sorts of gameslearning to ride chieftain even to gallop his mother would buy another pony and they could ride side by side robin would laugh and her hair would fly behind her if they went fast she would see how fast he could goshe would see him make chieftain jump they would have picnicscatch sight of deer and fawns delicately lifting their feet as they stepped she would always look at him with that nice look in her eyes and the little smile which came and went in a second she was quite different from the ministers little girls at the manse he liked herhe liked her he was wakened by a light in his room and by the sound of moving about he sat up quickly and found his mother standing by his bed and nanny putting things into a travelling bag he felt as if his mother looked taller than she had looked yesterdayand almost thinand her face was anxious andshy we let you sleep as late as we could donal she said you must get up quickly now and have breakfast something has happened we are obliged to go back to scotland by very early train there is not a minute to waste at first he only said back yes dear get up to braemarnie yes dear laddie he felt himself grow hot and cold away away he said again vaguely yes get up dear he was as she had said only a little boy and accustomed to do as he was told he was also a fine sturdy little scot with a pride of his own his breeding had been of the sort which did not include insubordinate scenes so he got out of bed and began to dress but his mother saw that his hands shook i shall not see robin he said in a queer voice she wont find me when she goes behind the lilac bushes she wont know why i dont come he swallowed very hard and was dead still for a few minutes though he did not linger over his dressing his mother felt that the whole thing was horrible he was acting almost like a young man even now she did not know how she could bear it she spoke to him in a tone which was actually rather humble if we knew where she lived youyou could write a little letter and tell her about it but we do not where she lives he answered her very low thats it and shes littleand she wont understand shes very littlereally there was a harrowingly protective note in his voice perhapsshell cry helen looking down at him with anguished eyeshe was buttoning his shoesmade an unearthly effort to find words but as she said them she knew they were not the right ones she will be disappointed of course but she is so little that she will not feel it as much as if she were bigger she will get over it darling very little girls do not remember things long oh how coarse and crass and stupid it soundedhow coarse and crass and stupid to say it to this small defiant scrap of what seemed the inevitable suffering of the world the clear blue of the eyes robin had dwelt in lifted itself to her there was something almost fierce in italmost like impotent hatred of something she wont he said and she actually heard him grind his little teeth after it he did not look like donal when he was dressed and sat at the breakfast table he did not eat much of his porridge but she saw that he determinedly ate some she felt several times as if he actually did not look like anybody she had ever seen and at the same time his fair hair his fair cheeks and the fair sturdy knees beneath his swinging kilt made him seem as much a little boy as she had ever known him it was his hot blue eyes which were different he obeyed her every wish and followed where she led when the train laboured out of the big station he had taken a seat in a corner and sat with his face turned to the window so that his back was towards her he stared and stared at the passing country and she could only see part of his cheek and the side of his neck she could not help watching them and presently she saw a hot red glow under the skin as if a flood had risen it subsided in a few moments but presently she saw it rise again this happened several times and he was holding his lip with his teeth once she saw his shoulders move and he coughed obstinately two or three times she knew that he would die before he would let himself cry but she wished he would descend to it just this once as the fields and hedges raced past and he was carried away away it might be that it was all his manhood she was saving for him he really made her heart stand still for a moment just as she was thinking this and saying it to herself almost fiercely he suddenly turned on her the blue of his eyes was flaming and the tide had risen again in his cheeks and neck it was a thing like rage she saw before hera childs rage and impotently fierce he cried out as if he were ending a sentence he had not finished when he spoke as he sat on the floor buttoning his shoes she has no one but me to remember he said no one but me had ever even kissed her she didnt know to her amazement he clenched both his savage young fists and shook them before him itll kill me he raged she could not hold herself back she caught at him with her arms and meant to drag him to her breast no no donal she cried darling nono but as suddenly as the queer unchildish thing had broken out did he remember himself and boy shame at his fantastic emotion overtook him he had never spoken like that to anyone before it was almost as bad as bursting out crying the red tide ebbed away and he withdrew himself awkwardly from her embrace he said not another word and sat down in his corner with his back turned toward the world that the lady downstairs who was so fond of laughing and who knew so many persons who seemed to laugh nearly all the time might have been joking about being her mother presented itself to robin as a vague solution of the problem the lady had laughed when she said it as people so often laughed at children perhaps she had only been amusing herself as grownup persons were apparently entitled to do even donal had not seemed wholly convinced and though his mother had said the lady downstairs wassomehow the subject had been changed at once mrs muir had so soon begun to tell them a story robin was not in the least aware that she had swiftly distracted their attention from a question any discussion of which would have involved explanations she could not have produced it would have been impossible to make it clear to any child she herself was helpless before the situation and therefore her only refuge was to make the two think of other things she had so well done this that robin had gone home later only remembering the brightly transitory episode as she recalled others as brief and bright when she had stared at a light and lovely figure standing on the nursery threshold and asking careless questions of andrews without coming in and risking the freshness of her draperies by contact with london topfloor grubbiness the child was in fact too full of the reality of her happiness with donal and donals mother to be more than faintly bewildered by a sort of visionary conundrum robin like donal slept perfectly through the night her sleep was perhaps made more perfect by fair dreams in which she played in the gardens and she and donal ran to and from the knees of the mother lady to ask questions and explain their games as the child had often in the past looked up at the sky so she had looked up into the clear eyes of the mother lady there was something in them which she had never seen before but which she kept wanting to see again then there came a queer bit of a dream about the lady downstairs she came dancing towards them dressed in hyacinths and with her arms full of daffodils she danced before donals motherdanced and laughed as if she thought they were all funny she threw a few daffodils at them and then danced away the daffodils lay on the gravel walk and they all looked at them but no one picked them up afterwardsin the dreammrs muir suddenly caught her in her arms and kissed her and robin was glad and felt warm all overinside and out she wakened smiling at the dingy ceiling of the dingy room there was but one tiny shadow in the world which was the fear that andrews would get well too quickly she was no longer in bed but was well enough to sit up and sew a little before the tiny fire in the atom of a servants room grate the doctor would not let her go out yet therefore anne still remained in charge founding ones hope on previous knowledge of annes habits she might be trusted to sit and read and show no untoward curiosity from her bed robin could see the sky was blue that meant that she would be taken out she lay as quiet as a mouse and thought of the joy before her until anne came to dress her and give her her breakfast well put on your rosecoloured smock this morning the girl said when the dressing began i like the hat and socks that match anne was not quite like andrews who was not talkative she made a conversational sort of remark after she had tied the white shoes youve got pretty little aristocratic legs of your own she said amiably i like my children to have nice legs robin was uplifted in spirit by the commendation but she hoped anne would put on her own things quickly sometimes she was rather a long time the one course however towards which discretion pointed as entirely safe was the continuance of being as quiet as a mouseeven quieter if such thing might beso that nothing might interfere with anything any one wanted to do to interfere would have been to attract attention and might lead to delay so she stood and watched the sparrows inoffensively until anne called her when she found herself out on the street her step was so light on the pavement that she was rather like a rose petal blown fluttering along by soft vagrant puffs of spring air under her flopping hat her eyes and lips and cheeks were so happy that more than one passerby turned head over shoulder to look after her your name ought to be rose anne giggled involuntarily as she glanced down at her because someone had stared she had not meant to speak but the words said themselves because the time was young june even london sky and air were wonderful stray breaths of fragrance came and went the green of the trees in the gardens was light and fresh and in the beddedout curves and stars and circles there were more flowers every hour so that it seemed as if blooming things with scents grew thick about ones feet it was no wonder one felt light and smiled back at nurses and governesses who looked up robin drew eyes became she was like a summer bloom suddenly appearing in the spring garden nanny was not sitting on the bench near the gate and donal was not to be seen amusing himself but he was somewhere just out of sight or if he had chanced to be late he would come very soon even if his mother could not come with himthough robin could not believe she would not to a child thing both happiness and despair cannot be conceived of except as lasting forever anne sat down and opened her book she had reached an exciting part and looked forward to a thoroughly enjoyable morning robin hopped about for a few minutes donal had taught her to hop and she felt it an accomplishment entangled in the meshes of the feathery golden if criminal ringlets of lady audley anne did not know when she hopped round the curve of the walk behind the lilac and snowball bushes once safe in her bit of enchanted land the child stood still and looked about her there was no kilted figure to be seen but it would come towards her soon with swinging plaid and eagles feather standing up grandly in its highland bonnet he would come soon perhaps he would come runningand the mother lady would walk behind more slowly and smile robin waited and lookedshe waited and looked she was used to waiting but she had never watched for anyone before there had never been any one or anything to watch for the newness of the suspense gave it a sort of deep thrill at first how long was at first she did not know she stoodand stoodand stoodand looked at every creature who entered the gate she did not see any one who looked in the least like donal or his mother or nanny there were nurses and governesses and children and a loitering lady or two there were never many people in the gardensonly those who had keys she knew nothing about time but at length she knew that on other mornings they had been playing together before this the small rosecoloured figure stood so still for so long that it began to look rigid and a nurse sitting at some distance said to another what is that child waiting for what length of time had passed before she found herself looking slowly down at her feet because of something the something which had drawn her eyes downward was that she had stood so long without moving that her tense feet had begun vaguely to hurt her and the ache attracted her attention she changed her position slightly and turned her eyes upon the gate again he was coming very soon he would be sure to run fast now and he would be laughing donal donal she even laughed a little low quivering laugh herself what is that child waiting for i should really like to know the distant nurse said again curiously if she had been eighteen years old she would have said to herself that she was waiting hours and hours she would have looked at a little watch a thousand times she would have walked up and down and round and round the garden never losing sight of the gateor any other point for that matterfor more than a minute each sound of the church clock striking a few streets away would have brought her young heart thumping into her throat but a child has no watch no words out of which to build hopes and fears and reasons arguments battling against anguish which growspalliations excuses robin could only wait in the midst of a slow dark rising tide of something she had no name for this slow rising of an engulfing flood she felt when pins and needles began to take possession of her feet when her legs ached and her eyes felt as if they had grown big and tightly strained donal donal donal who knows but that some echo of the terror against which she had fought and screamed on the night when she had lain alone in the dark in her cradle and feather had hid her head under the pillowcame back and closed slowly around and over her filling her inarticulate being with panic which at last reached its unbearable height she had not really stood waiting the entire morning but she was young enough to think that she had and that at any moment anne might come and take her away he had not come runninghe had not come laughinghe had not come with his plaid swinging and his feather standing high there came a moment when her strained eyes no longer seemed to see clearly something like a big lump crawled up into her throat something of the same sort happened the day she had burst into a wail of loneliness and andrews had pinched her panic seized her she clutched the breast of her rosecoloured frock and panicdriven turned and fled into a thick clump of bushes where there was no path and where even donal had never pierced that child has run away at last the distant nurse remarked id like to find out what she was waiting for the shrubs were part of the enclosing planting of the gardens the children who came to play on the grass and paths felt as if they formed a sort of forest because of this robin had made her frantic dash to their shelter no one would comeno one would see herno one would hear her beneath them it was almost dark bereft broken and betrayed a little mad thing she pushed her way into their shadow and threw herself face downward a small writhing rosecoloured heap upon the damp mould she could not have explained what she was doing or why she had given up all as if some tidal wave had overwhelmed her suddenly she knew that all her new world had goneforever and ever as it had come so it had gone as she had not doubted the permanence of its joy so she knew that the end had come only the wisdom of the occult would dare to suggest that from her child mate squaring his sturdy young shoulders against the world as the flying train sped on its way some wave of desperate inchoate thinking rushed backward there was nothing more he would not come back running he was gone there was no andrews to hear hidden in the shadow under the shrubs the rattle and roar of the street outside the railing drowned her mad little cries all she had never done before she did then her hands beat on the damp mould and tore at ither small feet beat it and dug into it she cried she sobbed the big lump in her throat almost strangled hershe writhed and did not know she was writhing her tears pouring forth wet her hair her face her dress she did not cry out donal donal because he was nowherenowhere if andrews had seen her she would have said she was in a tantrum but she was not the world had been torn away a long time afterwards as it seemed to her she crawled out from under the shrubs carrying her pretty flopping hat in her earthstained hand it was not pretty any more she had been lying on it and it was crushed and flat she crept slowly round the curve to anne seeing her anne sprang to her feet the rose was a piteous thing beaten to earth by a storm the childs face was swollen and stained her hair was tangled and damp there were dark marks of mould on her dress her hat her hands her white cheeks her white shoes were earthstained also and the feet in the rosecoloured socks dragged themselves heavilyslowly my gracious the young woman almost shrieked whats happened where have you been did you fall down ah my good gracious mercy me robin caught her breath but did not say a word you fell down on a flower bed where theyd been watering the plants almost wept anne you must have there isnt that much dirt anywhere else in the gardens and when she took her charge home that was the story she told andrews out of robin she could get nothing and it was necessary to have an explanation the truth of which she knew nothing was but the story of a childs awful dismay and a childs woe at one of lifes first betrayals it would be left behind by the days which came and wentit would passas all things pass but the everlasting hillsbut in this way it was that it came and wrote itself upon the tablets of a childs day chapter xi the childs always been well maam andrews was standing the image of exact correctness in her mistress bedroom while feather lay in bed with her breakfast on a convenient and decorative little table its been a thing ive prided myself on but i should say she isnt well now well i suppose its only natural that she should begin sometime remarked feather they always do of course i remember we all had things when we were children what does the doctor say i hope it isnt the measles or the beginning of anything worse no maam it isnt its nothing like a childs disease i could have managed that theres good private nursing homes for them in these days everything taken care of exactly as it should be and no trouble of disinfecting and isolating for the family i know what youd have wished to have done maam you do know your business andrews was feathers amiable comment thank you maam from andrews infectious things are easy managed if theyre taken away quick but the doctor said you must be spoken to because perhaps a change was needed you could take her to ramsgate or somewhere bracing said feather but what did he say he seemed puzzled maam thats what struck me when i told him about her not eatingand lying awake crying all nightto judge from her looks in the morningand getting thin and palehe examined her very careful and he looked queer and he said this child hasnt had a shock of any kind has she this looks like what we should call shockif she were older feather laughed how could a baby like that have a shock thats what i thought myself maam answered andrews a child thats had her hours regular and is fed and bathed and sleeps by the clock and goes out and plays by herself in the gardens well watched over hasnt any chance to get shocks i told him so and he sat still and watched her quite curious and then he said very slow sometimes little children are a good deal shaken up by a fall when they are playing do you remember any chance fall when she cried a good deal but you didnt of course said feather no maam i didnt i keep my eye on her pretty strict and shouldnt encourage wild running or playing i dont let her play with other children and shes not one of those stumbling falling children i told him the only fall i ever knew of her having was a bit of a slip on a soft flower bed that had just been wateredto judge from the state her clothes were in she had cried because shes not used to such things and i think she was frightened but there wasnt a scratch or a shadow of a bruise on her even that wouldnt have happened if id been with her it was when i was ill and my sister anne took my place anne thought at first that shed been playing with a little boy she had made friends withbut she found out that the boy hadnt come that morning a boy andrews was sharp enough to detect a new and interested note what boy she wouldnt have played with any other child if id been there said andrews i was pretty sharp with anne about it but she said he was an aristocratic looking little fellow was he in highland costume feather interrupted yes maam anne excused herself by saying she thought you must know something about him she declares she saw you come into the gardens and speak to his mother quite friendly that was the day before robin fell and ruined her rosecoloured smock and things but it wasnt through playing boisterous with the boybecause he didnt come that morning as i said and he never has since andrews on this found cause for being momentarily puzzled by the change of expression in her mistress face was it an odd little gleam of angry spite she saw and never has since has he mrs garethlawless said with a half laugh not once maam answered andrews and anne thinks it queer the child never seemed to look for him as if shed lost interest she just droops and drags about and doesnt try to play at all how much did she play with him well he was such a fine little fellow and had such a respectable elderly scotch looking woman in charge of him that anne owned up that she hadnt thought there was any objections to them playing together she says they were as well behaved and quiet as children could be andrews thought proper to further justify herself by repeating she didnt think there could be any objection there couldnt mrs garethlawless remarked i do know the boy he is a relation of lord coombes indeed maam with colourless civility anne said he was a big handsome child feather took a small bunch of hothouse grapes from her breakfast tray and after picking one off suddenly began to laugh good gracious andrews she said he was the shock how perfectly ridiculous robin had never played with a boy before and she fell in love with him the little things actually pining away for him she dropped the grapes and gave herself up to delicate mirth he was taken away and disappeared perhaps she fainted and fell into the wet flower bed and spoiled her frock when she first realized that he wasnt coming it did happen that morning admitted andrews smiling a little also it does seem funny but children take to each other in a queer way now and then ive seen it upset them dreadful when they were parted you must tell the doctor laughed feather then hell see theres nothing to be anxious about shell get over it in a week its five weeks since it happened maam remarked andrews with just a touch of seriousness five why so it must be i remember the day i spoke to mrs muir if shes that sort of child you had better keep her away from boys how ridiculous how lord coombehow people will laugh when i tell them she had paused a second becausefor that secondshe was not quite sure that coombe would laugh frequently she was of the opinion that he did not laugh at things when he should have done so but she had had a brief furious moment when she had realized that the boy had actually been whisked away she remembered the clearness of the fine eyes which had looked directly into hers the woman had been deciding then that she would have nothing to do with heror even with her child but the story of robin worn by a bereft nursery passion for a little boy whose mamma snatched him away as a brand from the burning was far too edifying not to be related to those who would find it delicious it was on the occasion a night or so later of a gathering at dinner of exactly the few elect ones whose power to find it delicious was the most highly developed that she related it it was a very little dinneronly four people one was the long thin young man with the good looking narrow face and dark eyes peering through a pince nezthe one who had said that mrs garethlawless got her wondrous clothes from hlne but that he couldnt his name was harrowby another was the starling who was a miss march who had some years earlier led the van of the girls who prostrated their relatives by becoming what was then called emancipated the sign thereof being the demanding of latchkeys and the setting up of bachelor apartments the relatives had astonishingly settled down with the unmoved passage of time and more modern emancipation had so far left latchkeys and bachelor apartments behind it that they began to seem almost oldfogeyish clara march however had progressed with her day the third diner was an adored young actor with a low veiled voice which combining itself with almond eyes and a sentimental and emotional curve of cheek and chin made the most commonplace lines sound yearningly impassioned he was not impassioned at allmerely fond of his pleasures and comforts in a way which would end by his becoming stout at present his figure was perfectexactly the thing for the uniforms of royal persons of ruritania and places of that ilkand the name by which programmes presented him was gerald vesey feathers house pleased him and she herself liked being spoken to in the veiled voice and gazed at by the almond eyes as though insuperable obstacles alone prevented soulstirring things from being said that she knew this was not true did not interfere with her liking it besides he adored and understood her clothes over coffee in the drawingroom coombe joined them he had not known of the little dinner and arrived just as feather was on the point of beginning her story you are just in time she greeted him i was going to tell them something to make them laugh will it make me laugh he inquired it ought to robin is in love she is five years old and she has been deserted and andrews came to tell me that she can neither eat nor sleep the doctor says she has had a shock coombe did not join in the ripple of amused laughter but as he took his cup of coffee he looked interested harrowby was interested too his dark eyes quite gleamed i suppose she is in bed by now he said if it were not so late i should beg you to have her brought down so that we might have a look at her im by way of taking a psychological interest im psychological myself said the starling but what do you mean feather are you in earnest andrews is feather answered she could manage measles but she could not be responsible for shock but she didnt find out about the love affair i found that outby mere chance do you remember the day we got out of the victoria and went into the gardens starling the time you spoke to mrs muir coombe turned slightly towards them feather nodded with a lightly significant air it was her boy she said and then she laughed and nodded at coombe he was quite as handsome as you said he was no wonder poor robin fell prostrate he ought to be chained and muzzled by law when he grows up but so ought robin threw in the starling in her brusque young mannish way but robins only a girl and shes not a parti laughed feather her eyes lifted to coombes held a sort of childlike malice after his mother knew she was miss garethlawless he was not allowed to play in the gardens again did she take him back to scotland they went back to scotland answered coombe and of course the boy was not left behind have you a child five years old asked vesey in his low voice of feather you it seems absurd to me said feather i never quite believe in her i dont said vesey shes impossible robin is a stimulating name put in harrowby is it too late to let us see her if shes such a beauty as starling hints she ought to be looked at feather actually touched the bell by the fireplace a sudden caprice moved her the love story had not gone off quite as well as she had thought it would and after all the child was pretty enough to show off she knew nothing in particular about her daughters hours but if she was asleep she could be wakened tell andrews she said to the footman when he appeared i wish miss robin to be brought downstairs they usually go to bed at seven i believe remarked coombe but of course i am not an authority robin was not asleep though she had long been in bed because she kept her eyes shut andrews had been deceived into carrying on a conversation with her sister anne who had come to see her robin had been lying listening to it she had begun to listen because they had been talking about the day she had spoiled her rosecoloured smock and they had ended by being very frank about other things as sure as you saw her speak to the boys mother the day before just so sure she whisked him back to scotland the next morning said andrews shes one of the kind thats particular lord coombes the reason she does not want her boy to see or speak to him if it can be helped she wont have itand when she found out is lord coombe as bad as they say put in anne with bated breath he must be pretty bad if a boy thats eight years old has to be kept out of sight and sound of him so it was lord coombe who had somehow done it he had made donals mother take him away it was lord coombe who was lord coombe it was because he was wicked that donals mother would not let him play with herbecause he was wicked all at once there came to her a memory of having heard his name before she had heard it several times in the basement servants hall and though she had not understood what was said about him she had felt the atmosphere of cynical disapproval of something they had said him and her as if he somehow belonged to the house on one occasion he had been high in the manner of some reproof to jennings who being enraged freely expressed his opinions of his lordships character and general reputation the impression made on robin then had been that he was a person to be condemned severely that the condemnation was the mere outcome of the temper of an impudent young footman had not conveyed itself to her and it was the impression which came back to her now with a new significance he was the causenot donal not donals motherbut this man who was so bad that servants were angry because he was somehow connected with the house as to his badness she heard andrews answer theres some that cant say enough against him badness is smart these days hes bad enough for the boys mother to take him away from its what he is in this house that does it she wont have her boy playing with a child like robin theneven as there flashed upon her bewilderment this strange revelation of her own unfitness for association with boys whose mothers took care of themjennings the young footman came to the door is she awake miss andrews he said looking greatly edified by andrews astonished countenance what on earth began andrews if she is jennings winked humorously shes to be dressed up and taken down to the drawingroom to be shown off i dont know whether its coombes idea or not hes there robins eyes flew wide open she forgot to keep them shut she was to go downstairs who wanted herwho andrews had quite gasped heres a new break out she exclaimed i never heard such a thing in my life shes been in bed over two hours id like to know she paused here because her glance at the bed met the dark liquidity of eyes wide open she got up and walked across the room you are awake she said you look as if you hadnt been asleep at all youre to get up and have your frock put on the lady downstairs wants you in the drawingroom two months earlier such a piece of information would have awakened in the child a delirium of delight but now her vitality was lowered because her previously unawakened little soul had soared so high and been so dashed down to cruel earth again the brilliancy of the lady downstairs had been dimmed as a candle is dimmed by the light of the sun she felt only a vague wonder as she did as andrews told herwonder at the strangeness of getting up to be dressed as it seemed to her in the middle of the night its just the kind of thing that would happen in a house like this grumbled andrews as she put on her frock just anything that comes into their heads they think theyve a right to do i suppose they have too if youre rich and aristocratic enough to have your own way why not take it i would myself the big silk curls all in a heap fell almost to the childs hips the frock andrews chose for her was a fairy thing she is a bit thin to be sure said the girl anne but it points her little face and makes her eyes look bigger if her mothers got a marquis i wonder what shell get said andrews shes got a lot before her this one when the child entered the drawingroom andrews made her go in alone while she held herself properly a few paces back like a lady in waiting the room was brilliantly lighted and seemed full of colour and people who were laughing there were pretty things crowding each other everywhere and there were flowers on all sides the lady downstairs in a sheathlike sparkling dress and only a glittering strap seeming to hold it on over her fair undressed shoulders was talking to a tall thin man standing before the fireplace with a gold cup of coffee in his hand as the little thing strayed in with her rather rigid attendant behind her suddenly the laughing ceased and everybody involuntarily drew a half startled breatheverybody but the tall thin man who quietly turned and set his coffee cup down on the mantel piece behind him is this what you have been keeping up your sleeve said harrowby settling his pince nez i told you said the starling you couldnt tell us veseys veiled voice dropped in softly it must be seen to be believed but still aside to feather i dont believe it enter my only child said feather come here robin come to your mother now was the time robin went to her and took hold of a very small piece of her sparkling dress are you my mother she said and then everybody burst into a peal of laughter feather with the rest she calls me the lady downstairs she said i really believe she doesnt know shes rather a stupid little thing amazing lack of filial affection said lord coombe he was not laughing like the rest and he was looking down at robin she thought him ugly and wicked looking vesey and harrowby were beautiful by contrast before she knew who he was she disliked him she looked at him askance under her eyelashes and he saw her do it before her mother spoke his name taking her by the tips of her fingers and leading her to him come and let lord coombe look at you she said so it revealed itself to her that it was hethis ugly onewho had done it and hatred surged up in her soul it was actually in the eyes she raised to his face and coombe saw it as he had seen the sidelong glance and he wondered what it meant shake hands with lord coombe feather instructed if you can make a curtsey make one she turned her head over her shoulders have you taught her to curtsey andrews but andrews had not and secretly lost temper at finding herself made to figure as a nurse who had been capable of omission outwardly she preserved rigid calm im afraid not maam i will at once if you wish it coombe was watching the inner abhorrence in the little face robin had put her hand behind her backshe who had never disobeyed since she was born she had crossed a line of development when she had seen glimpses of the new world through donals eyes what are you doing you silly little thing feather reproved her shake hands with lord coombe robin shook her head fiercely no no no no she protested feather was disgusted this was not the kind of child to display rude little thing andrews come and make her do itor take her upstairs she said coombe took his gold coffee cup from the mantel she regards me with marked antipathy as she did when she first saw me he summed the matter up children and animals dont hate one without reason it is some remote iniquity in my character which the rest of us have not yet detected to robin he said i do not want to shake hands with you if you object i prefer to drink my coffee out of this beautiful cup but andrews was seething having no conscience whatever she had instead the pride of a female devil in her perfection in her professional duties that the child she was responsible for should stamp her with ignominious fourthratedness by conducting herself with as small grace as an infant costermonger was more than her special order of flesh and blood could bearand yet she must outwardly control the flesh and blood in obedience to her mistress command she crossed the room and bent down and whispered to robin she intended that her countenance should remain noncommittal but when she lifted her head she met coombes eyes and realized that perhaps it had not she added to her whisper nursery instructions in a voice of sugar be pretty mannered miss robin my dear and shake hands with his lordship each person in the little drawingroom saw the queer flame in the childfacecoombe himself was fantastically struck by the sudden thought that its expression might have been that of an obstinate young martyr staring at the stake robin shrilled out her words andrews will pinch meandrews will pinch me butnono and she kept her hand behind her back oh miss robin you naughty child cried andrews with pathos your poor andrews that takes such care of you horrid little thing feather pettishly exclaimed take her upstairs andrews she shall not come down again harrowby settling his pince nez a little excitedly in the spurred novelty of his interest murmured if she doesnt want to go she will begin to shriek this looks as if she were a little termagant but she did not shriek when andrews led her towards the door the ugly one with the wicked face was the one who had done it he filled her with horror to have touched him would have been like touching some wild beast of prey that was all she went with andrews quite quietly will you shake hands with me said the starling goodnaturedly as she passed i hope she wont snub me she dropped aside to harrowby robin put out her hand prettily shake mine suggested harrowby and she obeyed him and mine smiled vesey with his best allure she gave him her hand and as a result of the allure probably a tiny smile flickered about the corners of her mouth he did not look wicked i remain an outcast remarked coombe as the door closed behind the little figure i detest an illmannered child said feather she ought to be slapped we used to be slapped if we were rude she said andrews would pinch her is pinching the customary discipline it ought to be she deserves it feather was quite out of temper but andrews is too good to her she is a perfect creature and conducts herself like a clock there has never been the slightest trouble in the nursery you see how the child looksthough her face isnt quite as round as it was she laughed disagreeably and shrugged her white undressed shoulders i think its a little horrid myselfa child of that age fretting herself thin about a boy chapter xii but though she had made no protest on being taken out of the drawingroom robin had known that what andrews softsounding whisper had promised would take place when she reached the nursery she was too young to feel more than terror which had no defense whatever she had no more defense against andrews than she had had against the man who had robbed her of donal they were both big and powerful and she was nothing but out of the wonders she had begun to know there had risen in her before almost inert little being a certain stirring for a brief period she had learned happiness and love and woe and this evening inchoate rebellion against an enemy andrews led by the hand up the narrow topstory staircase something she had never led before she was quite unaware of this and as she mounted each step her temper mounted also and it was the temper of an incensed personal vanity abnormally strong in this particular woman when they were inside the nursery and the door was shut she led robin to the middle of the small and gloomy room and released her hand now my lady she said im going to pay you out for disgracing me before everybody in the drawingroom she had taken the child below stairs for a few minutes before bringing her up for the night she had stopped in the kitchen for something she wanted for herself she laid her belongings on a chest of drawers and turned about im going to teach you a lesson you wont forget she said what happened next turned the woman quite sick with the shock of amazement the child had in the past been a soft puppet she had been automatic obedience and gentleness privately andrews had somewhat looked down on her lack of spirit though it had been her own best asset the outbreak downstairs had been an abnormality and now she stood before her with hands clenched her little face wild with defiant rage ill scream ill scream ill scream she shrieked andrews actually heard herself gulp but she sprang up and forward youll scream she could scarcely believe her own feelingsnot to mention the evidence of her ears youll scream the next instant was more astonishing still robin threw herself on her knees and scrambled like a cat she was under the bed and in the remotest corner against the wall she was actually unreachable and she lay on her back kicking madly hammering her heels against the floor and uttering piercing shrieks as something had seemed to let itself go when she writhed under the bushes in the gardens so did something let go now in her overstrung little mind there ruled for this moment the feeling that if she was to be pinched she would be pinched for a reason andrews knelt by the side of the bed she had a long strong thin arm and it darted beneath and clutched but it was not long enough to attain the corner where the kicking and screaming was going on her temper became fury before her impotence and her hideous realization of being made ridiculous by this baby of six two floors below the afterglow of the little dinner was going on suppose even far echoes of the screams should be heard and make her more ridiculous still she knew how they would laugh and her mistress would make some silly joke about robins being too much for her her fury rose so high that she had barely sense to realize that she must not let herself go too far when she got hold of the child get hold of her she would and pay her outmy word she would pay her out you little devil she said between her teeth wait till i get hold of you and robin shrieked and hammered more insanely still the bed was rather a low one and it was difficult for any one larger than a child to find room beneath it the correct and naturally rigid andrews lay flat upon her stomach and wriggled herself partly under the edge just far enough for her long and strong arm and equally long and strong clutching fingers to do their work in her present state of mind andrews would have broken her back rather than not have reached the creature who so defied her the strong fingers clenched a flying petticoat and dragged at it fiercelythe next moment they clutched a frantic foot with a power which could not be broken away from a jerk and a remorseless dragging over the carpet and robin was out of the protecting darkness and in the gas light again lying tumbled and in an untidy torn little heap on the nursery floor andrews was panting but she did not loose her hold as she scrambled without a rag of professional dignity to her feet my word she breathlessly gave forth ive got you now ive got you now she so looked that to robin she seemedlike the ugly man downstairsa sort of wicked wild beast whose mere touch would have been horror even if it did not hurt and the child knew what was coming she felt herself dragged up from the floor and also dragged between andrews knees which felt bony and hard as iron there was no getting away from them andrews had seated herself firmly on a chair holding her between the iron knees she put her large hand over her mouth it was a hand large enough to cover more than her mouth only the panicstricken eyes seemed to flare wide and lustrous above it youll scream she said youll hammer on the floor with your heels youll behave like a wildcatyou thats been like a kitten youve never done it before and youll never do it again if it takes me three days ill make you remember and then her hand droppedand her jaw dropped and she sat staring with a furious sick white face at the open doorwhich she had shut as she came in the top floor had always been so safe the nursery had been her own autocratic domain there had been no human creature to whom it would have occurred to interfere that was it she had been actually safe unheard in the midst of the struggle the door had been opened without a knock there on the threshold as stiff as a ramrod and with his hateful eyes uncovering their gleam lord coombe was standingno other than lord coombe having a sharp working knowledge of her world andrews knew that it was all up he had come upstairs deliberately she knew what he had come for he was as clever as he was bad and he had seen something when he glanced at her in the drawingroom now he had heard and seen her as she dragged robin from under the bed hed come up for thatfor some queer evil reason of his own the promptings of a remote gutter training made her feel a desire to use language such as she still had wisdom enough to restrain you are a very great fool young woman he said you have nothing but your character as a nurse to live on a scene in a police court would ruin you there is a society which interferes with nursery torture robin freed from the iron grasp had slunk behind a chair he was there again andrews body automatically responsive to rule and habit rose from its seat and stood before this member of a class which required an upright position she knew better than to attempt to excuse or explain she had heard about the society and she knew publicity would spell ruin and starvation she had got herself into an appalling mess being caughtthere you were but that this evilreputationed swell should actually have been awakened by some whim to notice and follow her up was past her as she would have put it you were going to pinch herby instalments i suppose he said you inferred that it might last three days when she said you wouldin the drawingroomit occurred to me to look into it what are your wages thirty pounds a year my lord go tomorrow morning to benby who engaged you for mrs garethlawless he will be at his office by nine and will pay you what is owed to youand a months wages in lieu of notice the mistress began andrews i have spoken to mrs garethlawless it was a lie serenely told feather was doing a new skirt dance in the drawingroom she is engaged pack your box jennings will call a cab it was the utter idiotic hopelessness of saying anything to him which finished her you might as well talk to a front door or a street lamp any silly thing you might try wouldnt even reach his ears he had no ears for you you didnt matter enough shall i leave her hereas she is she said denoting robin undress her and put her to bed before you pack your box absolutely certain fine cold modulations in the voice which stood for his special plane of breeding had their effect on her grovelling though raging soul he was so exactly what he was and what she was not and could never attain i will stay here while you do it then go no vocabulary of the servants hall could have encompassed the fine phrase grand seigneur but when mrs blayne and the rest talked of him in their least resentful and more amiable moods they unconsciously made efforts to express the quality in him which these two words convey he had ways of his own men that paid a pretty womans bills and kept her going in luxury jennings and mrs blayne and the others knew something about they sometimes began well enough but as time went on they forgot themselves and got into the way of being familiar and showing they realized that they paid for things and had their rights most of them began to be almost like husbandsspeak slighting and sharp and be a bit stiff about accountseven before servants they ran in and out orafter a whilebegan to stay away and not show up for weeks he was differentso different that it was queer queer it certainly was that he really came to the place very seldom wherever they met it didnt noticeably often happen in the slice of a house he came as if he were a visitor he took no liberties everything was punctiliously referred to mrs garethlawless mr benby who did everything conducted himself outwardly as if he were a sort of man of business in mrs garethlawlesss employ it was open to the lenient to believe that she depended on some mysterious private income there were people who preferred to try to believe this but there were those who in some occult way knew exactly where her income came from there were in fact hypercritical persons who did not know or notice her but she had quite an entertaining smart circle which neither suspicions nor beliefs prevented from placing her in their visiting lists coombe did keep it up in the most perfect manner some of them said admiringly among themselves he showed extraordinarily perfect taste many fashionable open secrets accepted by a brilliant world were not half so fastidiously managed andrews knew he had unswervingly lied when he said he had spoken to mrs garethlawless but he never failed to place her in the position of authority that he should have presented himself on the nursery floor was amazingly abnormal enough to mean some state of mind unregulated by all natural rules him andrews thought that never steps out of a visitors place in the drawingroom turning up on the third floor without a word one thing she knew and that came first behind all the polite show he was the head of everything and he was one that youd better not give back a sound to if you knew what was good for yourself whatever people said against his character he was one of the grand and high ones a word from himever so quietand youd be done for she was shaking with fear inwardly but she undressed robin and put her in bed laying everything away and making things tidy for the night this is the night nursery i suppose coombe had said when she began he put up his glasses and looked the uninviting little room over he scrutinized it and she wondered what his opinion of it might be yes my lord the day nursery is through that door he walked through the door in question and she could see that he moved slowly about it examining the few pieces of furniture curiously still with his glass in his eye she had finished undressing robin and had put her in her bed before he came back into the sleeping apartment by that time exhausted by the unknown tempest she had passed through the child had dropped asleep in spite of herself she was too tired to remember that her enemy was in the next room i have seen the child with you several times when you have not been aware of it coombe said to her before he went downstairs she has evidently been well taken care of as far as her body is concerned if you were not venomousif you had merely struck her when you lost your temper you might have had another trial i know nothing about children but i know something about the devil and if ever the devil was in a womans face and voice the devil was in yours when you dragged the little creature from under the bed if you had dared you would have killed her look after that temper young woman benby shall keep an eye on you if you take another place as nurse and i shall know where you are my lord andrews gasped you wouldnt overlook a woman and take her living from her and send her to starvation i would take her living from her and send her to starvation without a shadow of compunction was the reply made in the fine gentlemans cultivated voice if she were capable of what you were capable of tonight you are i judge about forty and though you are lean you are a powerful woman the child is i believe barely six and then looking down at her through his glass he addedto her quite shuddering astonishmentin a tone whose very softness made it really awful to her damn you damn you illi swear ill never let myself go again my lord the woman broke out devoutly i dont think you will it would cost you too much he said then he went down the steep crooked little staircase quite soundlessly and andrews rather white and breathless went and packed her trunk robintired baby as she wasslept warm and deeply chapter xiii it was no custom of his to outstay other people in fact he usually went away comparatively early feather could not imagine what his reason could be but she was sure there was a reason she was often disturbed by his reasons and found it difficult to adjust herself to them howeven if one had a logically brilliant mindcould one calculate on a male being who seemed not exactly to belong to the race of men as a result of the skirt dancing the furniture of the empty drawingroom was a little scattered and untidy but feather had found a suitable corner among cushions on a sofa after everyone had gone leaving coombe alone with her she wished he would sit down but he preferred to stand in his still uncomfortable way i know you are going to tell me something she broke the silence i am when i went out of the room i did not drive round to my club as i said i found myself obliged to i went upstairs to the third floorto the nursery feather sat quite upright you went up to the nursery if this was the reason for his staying what on earth had he come upon in the region of the third floor and how ridiculously unlike him to allow himself to interfere could it be andrews and jennings surely andrews was too oldthis passed across her mind in a flash you called andrews to use her authority with the child when she would not shake hands with me the little creature for some reason of her own evidently feels an antipathy to me that interested me and i watched her as andrews whispered in her ear the womans vanity was stung i realized that she whispered a threat a hint of actual ferocity showed in her eyes in spite of herself robin turned pale andrews was quite right children must be punished when they are rude feather felt this at once silly and boring what did he know about such matters the child said andrews will pinch me and i caught andrews eye and knew it was truealso that she had done it before i looked at the womans long thin strong fingers they were cruel fingers i do not take liberties as a rule but i took a liberty i excused myself and climbed three flights of stairs never had feather been so surprised in her life she looked like a bewildered child butwhat could it matter to you she said in soft amaze i dont know his answer came after a moments pause i have caprices of mood certain mental images made my temperature rise momentarily it did matter one is like that at times andrews feline face and her muscular fingersand the childs extraordinarily exquisite fleshgave me a seconds furious shudder feather quite broke in upon him are youare you fond of children no he was really abrupt i never thought of such a thing in my lifeas being fond of things that was whati mean i thought so feather faltered as if in polite acquiescence with a quite natural fact coombe proceeded as i went up the stairs i heard screams and i thought that the pinching had begun i got up quickly and opened the door and found the woman lying flat on the floor by the bed dragging out the child who had hidden under it the womans face was devilish and so was her voice i heard her threats she got on her feet and dragged the child up and held her between her knees she clapped her hand over mouth to stifle her shrieks there i stopped her she had a fright at sight of me which taught her something he ended rather slowly i took the great liberty of ordering her to pack her box and leave the housecourse with a slight bow using you as my authority andrews cried feather aghast has shegone would you have kept her he inquired its true thatthat pinching feathers voice almost held tears really hard pinching isis not proper but andrews has been invaluable everyone says robin is better dressed and better kept than other children and she is never allowed to make the least noise one wouldnt if one were pinched by those devilish sinewy fingers every time one raised ones voice yes she has gone i ordered her to put her charge to bed before she packed i did not leave her alone with robin in fact i walked about the two nurseries and looked them over he had walked about the night nursery and the day nursery hethe head of the house of coombe whose finely acrid summing up of things they were all secretly afraid of if the truth were known they stood for her smart feverishly pleasurechasing set in their way they half unconsciously tried to propitiate something in him always without producing the least effect her mental vision presented to her his image as he had walked about the horrid little rooms his somewhat stiffly held head not much below the low ceilings he had taken in shabby carpets furniture faded walls general dim dinginess its an unholy den for anything to spend its days inthat third floor he made the statement detachedly in a way if shes six she has lived six years thereand known nothing else all london top floors are like it said feather and they are all nurseries and school roomswhere there are children his faintly smiling glance took in her girlchild slimness in its glittering sheaththe zephyr scarf floating from the snow of her bared lovelinessher delicate soft chin deliciously lifted as she looked up at him how would you like it he asked but i am not a child in pretty protest children areare different you look like a child he suddenly said queerlyas if the aspect of her caught him for an instant and made him absentminded sometimesa woman does not often she bloomed into a kind of delighted radiance you dont often pay me compliments she said that is a beautiful one robinmakes it more beautiful it isnt a compliment he answered still watching her in the slightly absent manner it isa tragic truth he passed his hand lightly across his eyes as if he swept something away and then both looked and spoke exactly as before i have decided to buy the long lease of this house it is for sale he said casually i shall buy it for the child for robin said feather helplessly yes for robin itit would be an incomewhatever happened it is in the very heart of mayfair she said because in her astonishmentalmost consternationshe could think of nothing else he would not buy it for her he thought her too silly to trust but if it were robinsit would be hers also a girl couldnt turn her own mother into the street amid the folds of her narrow being hid just one spark of shrewdness which came to life where she herself was concerned two or three roomsnot large onescan be added at the back he went on i glanced out of a window to see if it could be done incomprehensible as he was one might always be sure of a certain princeliness in his inexplicable methods he never was personal or mean an addition to the slice of a house that really was generous entrancement filled her that really is kind of you she murmured gratefully it seems too much to ask you did not ask it was his answer but i shall benefit by it nothing could be nicer these rooms are so much too small glancing about her in flushed rapture and my bedroom is dreadful im obliged to use robs for a dressingroom the new rooms will be for robin he said an excellent method he had discovered of entirely detaching himself from the excitements and emotions of other persons removed the usual difficulties in the way of disappointingspeaking truths toor embarrassing people who deserved it it was this method which had utterly cast down the defences of andrews feather was so wholly left out of the situation that she was actually almost saved from its awkwardness when one is six he explained one will soon be sevenninetwelve then the teens begin to loom up and one cannot be concealed in cupboards on a top floor even before that time a governess is necessary and even from the abyss of my ignorance i see that no respectable woman would stand either the night or the day nursery your daughter oh dont call her that cried feather my daughter it sounds as if she were eighteen she felt as if she had a sudden hideous little shock six years had passed since bob died a daughter a school girl with long hair and long legs to keep out of the way a grownup girl to drag about with one never would she do it three sixes are eighteen coombe continued as was impressed upon one in early years by the multiplication table i never saw you so interested in anything before feather faltered climbing steep narrow horrid stairs to her nursery dismissing her nurse she paused a second because a very ugly little idea had clutched at her it arose from and was complicated with many fantastic half formed secret resentments of the past it made her laugh a shade hysterical are you going to see that she is properly brought up and educated so that ifanyone important falls in love with her she can make a good match hers was quite a hideous little mind he was telling himselffearful in its latter day casting aside of all such small matters as taste and feeling people stripped the garments from things in these days he laughed inwardly at himself and his unwitting these days senile severity mouthed just such phrases were they not his own days and the outcome of a past which had considered itself so much more decorous had not boldly questionable attitudes been held in those other days how long was it since the prince regent himself had flourished it was only that these days brought it all close against ones eyes but this exquisite creature had a hideous little mind of her own whatsoever her day later he confessed to himself that he was unprepared to see her spring to her feet and stand before him absurdly fantastically near being impassioned you think i as too silly to see anything she broke forth but i do seea long way sometimes i cant bear it but i doi do i shall have a grownup daughter she will be the kind of girl everyone will look atand someoneimportantmay want to marry her but oh he was reminded of the day when she had fallen at his feet and clasped his rigid and reluctant knees this was something of the same feeble desperation of mood oh why couldnt someone like that have wanted to marry me see she was like a pathetic fairy as she spread her nymphlike arms how pretty i am his gaze held her a moment in the singular fashion with which she had become actually familiar becauseat long intervalsshe kept seeing it again he quite gently took her fingers and returned her to her sofa please sit down again he requested it will be better she sat down without another imbecile word to say as for him he changed the subject with your permission benby will undertake the business of the lease and the building he explained the plans will be brought to you we will go over them together if you wish there will be decent rooms for robin and her governess the two nurseries can be made fit for human beings to live in and used for other purposes the house will be greatly improved it was nearly three oclock when feather went upstairs to her dozing maid because after he had left her she sat some time in the empty untidy little drawingroom and gazed straight before her at a painted screen on which shepherdesses and swains were dancing in a watteau glade infested by flocks of little loves chapter xiv when from robins embarrassed young consciousness there had welled up the hesitating confession shedoesnt like me she could not of course have found words in which to make the reasons for her knowledge clear but they had for herself no obscurity the fair being who at rare intervals fluttered on the threshold of her world had a way of looking at her with a shade of aloof distaste in her always transient gaze the unadorned fact was that feather did not like her she had been outraged by her advent a baby was absurdly out of the picture so far as her mind encompassed a future she saw herself flitting from flower to flower of smart pleasures and successes somehow with more money and more exalted invitationssomething vaguelyhaving happened to the entire lawdor progeny and she therefore occupying a position in which it was herself who could gracefully condescend to others there was nothing so stodgy as children in the vision when the worst came to the worst she had been consoled by the thought that she had really managed the whole thing very cleverly it was easier of course to so arrange such things in modern days and in town the day nursery and the night nursery on the third floor a smartlooking young woman who knew her business who even knew what to buy for a child and where to buy it without troubling any one simplified the situation andrews had been quite wonderful nobody can bother one about a healthy handsome child who is seen meticulously cared for and beautifully dressed being pushed or led or carried out in the open air every day but there had arrived the special morning when she had seen a child who so stood out among a dozen children that she had been startled when she recognized that it was robin andrews had taken her charge to hyde park that day and feather was driving through the row on her way to a knightsbridge shop first her glance had been caught by the hair hanging to the little hipsextraordinary hair in which andrews herself had a pride then she had seen the slender exquisitely modeled legs and the dancing sway of the small body a wonderfully cut stitched and fagotted smock and hat she had of course taken in at a flash when the child suddenly turned to look at some little girls in a pony cart the amazing damask of her colour and form and depth of eye had given her another slight shock she realized that what she had thrust lightly away in a corner of her third floor produced an unmistakable effect when turned out into the light of a gay world the creature was tall toofor six years old was she really six it seemed incredible ten more years and she would be sixteen mrs heppelbevill had a girl of fifteen who was a perfect catastrophe she read things and had begun to talk about her right to be a woman emily heppelbevill was only thirtyseventhree years from forty feather had reached the stage of softening in her disdain of the women in their thirties she had found herself admitting thatin these daysthere were women of forty who had not wholly passed beyond the pale into that outer darkness where there was weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth but there was no denying that this six year old baby with the dancing step gave onealmost hystericallyto think her imagination could notnever had and never would she have allowed it tograsp any belief that she herself could change a feather no but a creature of sixteen eighteenwith eyes that shapewith lashes an inch longwith yards of hairstanding by ones side in ten years it was ghastly coombe in his cold perfunctory way climbing the crooked narrow stairs dismissing andrewslooking over the roomsdismissing them so to speak and then remaining after the rest had gone to reveal to her a new abnormal moodthat in itself alone was actually horrible it was abnormal and yet he had always been more or less like that in all things despite everythingeverythinghe had never been in love with her at all at first she had believed he wasthen she had tried to make him care for her he had never failed her he had done everything in his grand seigneur fashion nobody dare make gross comment upon her but while he saw her loveliness as only such a man couldshe had gradually realized that she had never had even a chance with him she could not even think that if she had not been so silly and frightened that awful day six years ago and had not lost her head he might have admired her more and more and in the end asked her to marry him he had said there must be no mistakes and she had not been allowed to fall into making one the fact that she had not had finally made her feel the power of a certain fascination in him she thought it was a result of his special type of looks his breeding the wonderful clothes he worebut it was in truth his varieties of inaccessibility a girl might like him she had said to herself that nightshe sat up late after he left her a girl whowho had uptodate sense might modern people dont grow old as they used to at fiftyfive he wont be fat or bald and he wont have lost his teeth people have found out they neednt he will be as thin and straight as he is todayand nothing can alter his nose he will be ten years cleverer than he is now buying the house for a child of that agebuilding additional rooms for her in the fevered rapid deepdipping whirl of the life which was the only one she knew she had often seen rather trying things happenalmost unnatural changes in situations people had overcome the folly of being afraid to alter their minds and their views about what they had temporarily believed were permanent bonds and emotions bonds had become old fogeyish marriages went to pieces the parties in love affairs engaged in a sort of dance down the middle and turn other peoples partners the rearrangement of figures sometimes made for great witticism occasionally people laughed at themselves as at each other the admirers of engaging matrons had been known to renew their youth at the comingout balls of lovely daughters in their early teens and to end by assuming the flowery chains of a new allegiance time had of course been when such a volte face would have aroused condemnation and indignant discussion but a humorous leniency spent but little time in selecting terms of severity feather had known of several such contretemps ending in quite brilliant matches the enchanting mothers usually consoled themselves with great ease and if the party of each part was occasionally wittily pungent in her comments on the other everybody laughed and nobody had time to criticize a man who had had much to bestow and who preferred in youth to bestow it upon himself was not infrequently more in the mood for the sharing of marriage when years had revealed to him the distressing fact that he was not and had never been the centre of the universe which distressing fact is one so unfairly concealed from youth in bloom it was of course but as a vaguely outlined vision that these recognitions floated through what could only be alleged to be feathers mind because there was no other name for it the dark little staircase the rejected and despised third floor and coombe detachedly announcing his plans for the house had set theso to speakrather malarious mist flowing around her a trying thing was that it did not really dispel itself altogether but continued to hang about the atmosphere surrounding other and more cheerful things almost impalpably it added to the familiar feelingor lack of feelingwith regard to robin she had not at all hated the little thing it had merely been quite true that in an inactive way she had not liked her in the folds of the vague mist quietly floated the truth that she now liked her less benby came to see and talk to her on the business of the structural changes to be made he conducted himself precisely as though her views on the matter were of value and could not in fact be dispensed with he brought the architects plans with him and explained them with care they were clever plans which made the most of a limited area he did not even faintly smile when it revealed itself to him as it unconsciously did that mrs garethlawless regarded their adroit arrangement as a singular misuse of space which could have been much better employed for necessities of her own she was much depressed by the ground floor addition which might have enlarged her diningroom but which was made into a sittingroom for robin and her future governess and that is in addition to her schoolroom which might have been thrown into the drawingroombesides the new bedrooms which i needed so much she said the new nurse who is a highly respectable person explained benby could not have been secured if she had not known that improvements were being made the reconstruction of the third floor will provide suitable accommodations the special forte of dowson the new nurse was a sublimated respectability far superior to smartness she had been mystically produced by benby and her bonnets and jackets alone would have revealed her selection from almost occult treasures she wore bonnets and jackets not hats and coats in the calm days of her majesty nurses dressed as she does i do not mean in the riotous later years of her reignbut earlierwhen england dreamed in terms of crystal palaces and great exhibitions she can only be the result of excavation coombe said of her she was as proud of her respectability as andrews had been of her smartness this had in fact proved an almost insuperable obstacle to her engagement the slice of a house with its flocking in and out of chattering smart people in marvellous clothes was not the place for her nor was mrs garethlawless the mistress of her dreams but her husband had met with an accident and must be kept in a hospital and an invalid daughter must live by the seasideand suddenly when things were at their worst with her had come benby with a firm determination to secure her with wages such as no other place would offer besides which she had observed as she had lived things have changed she reflected soberly youve got to resign yourself and not be too particular she accepted the third floor as benby had said because it was to be rearranged and the night and day nurseries being thrown into one repainted and papered would make a decent place to live in at the beautiful little girl given into her charge she often looked in a puzzled way because she knew a good deal about children and about this one there was something odd her examination of opened drawers and closets revealed piles of exquisite garments of all varieties all perfectly kept in these dingy holes which called themselves nurseries she found evidence that money had been spent like water so that the child when she was seen might look like a small princess but she found no playthingno dolls or toys and only one picture book and that had donal written on the fly leaf and evidently belonged to someone else what exactly she would have done when she had had time to think the matter over she never knew because a few days after her arrival a tall thin gentleman coming up the front steps as she was going out with robin stopped and spoke to her as if he knew who she was you know the kind of things children like to play with nurse he said she respectfully replied that she had had long experience with young desires she did not know as yet who he was but there was that about him which made her feel that while there was no knowing what height his particular exaltation in the matter of rank might reach one would be safe in setting it high please go to one of the toy shops and choose for the child what she will like best dollsgamesyou will know what to select send the bill to me at coombe house i am lord coombe thank you my lord dowson answered with a sketch of a curtsey miss robin you must hold out your little hand and say thank you to his lordship for being so kind hes told dowson to buy you some beautiful dolls and picture books as a present robins eyelashes curled against her under brows in her wide still glance upward at him here was the one again she shut her hand tightly into a fist behind her back lord coombe smiled a littlenot much she does not like me he said it is not necessary that she should give me her hand i prefer that she shouldnt if she doesnt want to good morning dowson to the wellregulated mind of dowson this seemed treating too lightly a matter as serious as juvenile incivility she remonstrated gravely and at length with robin little girls must behave prettily to kind gentlemen who are friends of their mammas it is dreadful to be rude and not say thank you she said but as she talked she was vaguely aware that her words passed by the childs ears as the summer wind passed perhaps it was all a bit of temper and would disappear and leave no trace behind at the same time there was something queer about the little thing she had a listless way of sitting staring out of the window and seeming to have no desire to amuse herself she was too young to be listless and she did not care for her food dowson asked permission to send for the doctor and when he came he ordered sea air of course you can take her away for a few weeks mrs garethlawless said here she smiled satirically and added but i can tell you what it is all about the little minx actually fell in love with a small boy she met in the square gardens and when his mother took him from london she began to mope like a tiresome girl in her teens its ridiculous but is the real trouble oh said dowson the low and respectful interjection expressing a shade of disapproval children do have fancies maam shell get over it if we give her something else to think of the good woman went to one of the large toy shops and bought a beautiful doll a dolls house and some picture books when they were brought up to the day nursery robin was asleep after a rather long walk which dowson had decided would be good for her when she came later into the room after the things had been unpacked she regarded them with an expression of actual dislike isnt that a beautiful doll said dowson goodhumouredly and did you ever see such a lovely house it was kind lord coombe who gave them to you just you look at the picture books robin put her hands behind her back and would not touch them dowson who was a motherly creature with a great deal of commonsense was set thinking she began to make guesses though she was not yet sufficiently familiar with the household to guess from any firm foundation of knowledge of small things come here dear she said and drew the small thing to her knee is it because you dont love lord coombe she asked yes she answered but why said dowson when he is such a kind gentleman but robin would not tell her why and never did she never told any one until years had passed how this had been the beginning of a hatred the toys were left behind when she was taken to the seaside dowson tried to persuade her to play with them several times but she would not touch them so they were put away feeling that she was dealing with something unusual and being a kindly person dowson bought her some playthings on her own account they were simple things but robin was ready enough to like them did you give them to me she asked yes i did miss robin the child drew near her after a full minute of hesitation i will kiss you she said solemnly and performed the rite as wholesouledly as donal had done dear little mite exclaimed the surprised dowson dear me and there was actual moisture in her eyes as she squeezed the small body in her arms shes the strangest mite i ever nursed was her comment to mrs blayne below stairs it was so sudden and she did it as if shed never done it before id actually been thinking she hadnt any feeling at all no reason why she should have shes been taken care of by the clock and dressed like a puppet but shes not been treated human broke forth mrs blayne then the whole story was toldthe upstairs story with much vivid description and the mentioning of many names and the dotting of many is dowson had heard certain things only through vague rumour but now she knew and began to see her way she had not heard names before and the definite inclusion of lord coombes suggested something to her do you think the child could be jealous of his lordship she suggested she might if she knew anything about himbut she never saw him until the night she was taken down into the drawingroom shes lived upstairs like a little dog in its kennel well dowson reflected aloud it sounds almost silly to talk of a childs hating any one but that bit of a things eyes had fair hate in them when she looked up at him where he stood that was what puzzled me chapter xv before robin had been taken to the seaside to be helped by the bracing air of the norfolk coast to recover her lost appetite and forget her small tragedy she had observed that unaccustomed things were taking place in the house workmen came in and out through the mews at the back and brought ladders with them and tools in queer bags she heard hammerings which began very early in the morning and went on all day as andrews had trained her not to ask tiresome questions she only crept now and then to a back window and peeped out but in a few days dowson took her away when she came back to london she was not taken up the steep dark stairs to the third floor dowson led her into some rooms she had never seen before they were light and airy and had pretty walls and furniture a sittingroom on the ground floor had even a round window with plants in it and a canary bird singing in a cage may we stay here she asked dowson in a whisper we are going to live here was the answer and so they did at first feather occasionally took her intimates to see the additional apartments in perfect splendour is the creature put up and i with a bedroom like a coalhole and such drawingrooms as you see each time you enter the house she broke forth spitefully one day when she forgot herself she said it to the starling and harrowby who had been simply gazing about them in fevered mystification because the new development was a thing which must invoke some more or less interesting explanation at her outbreak all they could do was to gaze at her with impartial eyes which suggested question and feather shrugged pettish shoulders you knew i didnt do it how could i she said it is a queer whim of coombes of course it is not the least like him i call it morbid after which people knew about the matter and found it a subject for edifying and quite stimulating discussion there was something fantastic in the situation coombe was the last man on earth to have taken the slightest notice of the childs existence it was believed that he had never seen herexcept in long clothesuntil she had glared at him and put her hand behind her back the night she was brought into the drawingroom she had been adroitly kept tucked away in an attic somewhere and now behold an addition of several wonderful small rooms built furnished and decorated for her alone where she was to live as in a miniature palace attended by servitors coombe as a purveyor of nursery appurtenances was regarded with humour the general opinion being that the eruption of a volcano beneath his feet alone could have awakened his somewhat chill selfabsorption to the recognition of any childs existence to be exact we none of us really know anything in particular about his mental processes harrowby pondered aloud hes capable of any number of things we might not understand if he condescended to tell us about themwhich he would never attempt he has a remote brilliantly stored cynical mind he owns that he is of an inhuman selfishness i havent a suggestion to make but it sets one searching through the purlieus of ones mind for an approximately reasonable explanation why purlieus was the starlings inquiry harrowby shrugged his shoulders ever so lightly well one isnt searching for reasons founded on copybook axioms he shook his head coombe no there was a silence given to occult thought feather is really in a rage and is too feathery to be able to conceal it said starling feather would beinevitably harrowby lifted his nearsighted eyes to her curiously can you see feather in the futurewhen robin is ten years older i can the starling answered the years which followed were changing yearsgrowing years life and entertainment went on fast and furiously in all parts of london and in no part more rapidly than in the slice of a house whose front always presented an air of having been freshly decorated in spite of summer rain and winter soot and fog the plants in the window boxes seemed always in bloom being magically replaced in the early morning hours when they dared to hint at flagging mrs garethlawless it was said must be renewed in some such mysterious morning way as she merely grew prettier as she neared thirty and passed it women did in these days which last phrase had always been a useful one probably from the time of the flood old fogeys male and female had used it in the past as a means of scathingly unfavourable comparison growing flushed and almost gobbling like turkey cocks in their indignation now as a phrase it was a support and a mollifier in these days one knew better how to amuse oneself was more free to snatch at agreeable opportunity less in bondage to old fancies which had called themselves beliefs everything whirled faster and more lightlydanced twostepped instead of marching robin vaguely connected certain changes in her existence with the changes which took place in the fashion of sleeves and skirts which appeared to produce radical effects in the world she caught glimpses of sometimes sleeves were closely fitted to peoples arms then puffs sprang from them and grew until they were enormous and required delicate manipulation when coats were put on then their lavishness of material fell from the shoulder to the wrists and hung there swaying until some sudden development of skirt seemed to distract their attention from themselves and they shrank into unimportance and skirts changed instead afterwards sometimes figures were slim and encased in sheathlike draperies sometimes folds rippled about feet fullness crept here or there or disappeared altogether trains grew longer or shorter or wider or narrower cashmeres grosgrain silks and heavy satins were suddenly gone and chiffon wreathed itself about the world and took possession of it bonnets ceased to exist and hats were immense or tiny tall or flat tilted at the back at the side at the front worn over the face or dashingly rolled back from it feathers drooped or stood upright at heights which rose and fell and changed position with the changing seasons no garment or individual wore the same aspect for more than a months time it was necessary to change all things with a rapidity matching the change of moods and fancies which altered at the rate of the automobiles which dashed here and there and everywhere through country roads through town through remote places with an unsparing swiftness which set a new pace for the world i cannot hark back regretfully to stage coaches said lord coombe even i was not born early enough for that but in the days of my youth and innocence express trains seemed almost supernatural one could drive a pair of horses twenty miles to make a country visit but one could not drive back the same day ones circle had its limitations and degrees of intimacy now it is possible motor fifty miles to lunch and home to dine with guests from the remotest corners of the earth oceans are crossed in six days and the eager flit from continent to continent engagements can be made by cable and the truly enterprising can accept an invitation to dine in america on a fortnights notice telephones communicate in a few seconds and no one is secure from social intercourse for fifteen minutes acquaintances and correspondence have no limitations because all the inhabitants of the globe can reach one by motor or electricity in moments of fatigue i revert to the days of queen anne with pleasure while these changes went on robin lived in her own world in her own quarters at the rear of the slice of a house during the early years spent with dowson she learned gradually that life was a better thing than she had known in the dreary gloom of the third floor day and night nurseries she was no longer left to spend hours alone nor was she taken below stairs to listen blankly to servants talking to each other of mysterious things with which she herself and the lady downstairs and him were somehow connected her discovery of this fact being based on the dropping of voices and sidelong glances at her and sudden warning sounds from andrews she realized that dowson would never pinch her and the rooms she lived in were pretty and bright gradually playthings and picture books appeared in them which she gathered dowson presented her with she gathered this from dowson herself she had never played with the doll and by chance a day arriving when lord coombe encountered dowson in the street without her charge he stopped her again and spoke as before is the little girl well and happy nurse he asked quite well my lord and much happier than she used to be did she he hesitated slightly like the playthings you bought her dowson hesitated more than slightly but being a sensible woman and at the same time curious about the matter she spoke the truth she wouldnt play with them at all my lord i couldnt persuade her to what her childs fancy was i dont know neither do iexcept that it is founded on a distinct dislike said coombe there was a brief pause are you fond of toys yourself dowson he inquired coldly i am thatand i know how to choose them your lordship replied dowson with a large shrewd intelligence then oblige me by throwing away the doll and its accompaniments and buying some toys for yourself at my expense you can present them to miss robin as a personal gift she will accept them from you he passed on his way and dowson looked after him interestedly if she was his she thought i shouldnt be puzzled but shes notthat ive ever heard of hes got some fancy of his own the same as robin has though you wouldnt think it to look at him id like to know what it is it was a fancyan old old fancyit harked back nearly thirty yearsto the dark days of youth and passion and unending tragedy whose anguish as it then seemed could never passbut which nevertheless had faded with the years as they flowed by and yet left him as he was and had been he was not sentimental about it he smiled at himself drearilythough never at the memorywhen it rose again and through its vague power led him to do strange things curiously verging on the emotional and eccentric but even the childwho quite loathed him for some fantastic infant reason of her owneven the child had her part in it his soul oddly withdrew itself into a far remoteness as he walked away and piccadilly became a shadow and a dream dowson went home and began to pack neatly in a box the neglected doll and the toys which had accompanied her robin seeing her doing it asked a question are they going back to the shop no lord coombe is letting me give them to a little girl who is very poor and has to lie in bed because her back hurts her his lordship is so kind he does not want you to be troubled with them he is not angry he is too good to be angry that was not true thought robin he had done that thing she remembered goodness could not have done it only badness when dowson brought in a new doll and other wonderful things a little hand enclosed her wrist quite tightly as she was unpacking the boxes it was robins and the small creature looked at her with a questioning half appealing half fierce did he send them dowson they are a present from me dowson answered comfortably and robin said again i want to kiss you i like to kiss you i do to those given to psychical interests and speculations it might have suggested itself that on the night when the creature who had seemed to andrews a soft tissued puppet had suddenly burst forth into defiance and fearless shrillness some cerebral change had taken place in her from that hour her softness had become a thing of the past dowson had not found a baby but a brooding little passionate being she was neither insubordinate nor irritable but dowson was conscious of a certain intensity of temperament in her she knew that she was always thinking of things of which she said almost nothing only a sensible motherly curiosity such as dowsons could have made discoveries but a rare question put by the child at long intervals sometimes threw a faint light there were questions chiefly concerning mothers and their habits and customs they were such as in their very unconsciousness revealed a strange past history lights were most unconsciously thrown by mrs garethlawless herself her quite amiable detachment from all shadow of responsibility her brilliantly unending occupations her goings in and out the flocks of light almost noisy intimates who came in and out with her revealed much to a respectable person who had soberly watched the world the lady downstairs is my mother isnt she robin inquired gravely once yes my dear was dowsons answer a pause for consideration of the matter and then from robin all mothers are not alike dowson are they no my dear with wisdom though she was not yet seven life had so changed for her that it was a far cry back to the spring days in the square gardens she went back however back into that remote ecstatic past the lady downstairs is notalike she said at last donals mother loved him she let him sit in the same chair with her and read in picture books she kissed him when he was in bed jennings the young footman who was a humourist had of course heard witty references to robins love affair while in attendance and he had equally of course repeated them below stairs therefore dowson had heard vague rumours but had tactfully refrained from mentioning the subject to her charge who was donal she said now but quite quietly robin did not know that a confidante would have made her first agony easier to bear she was not really being confidential now but realizing dowsons comfortable kindliness she knew that it would be safe to speak to her he was a big boy she answered keeping her eyes on dowsons face he laughed and ran and jumped his eyes she stopped there because she could not explain what she had wanted to say about these joyous young eyes which were the first friendly human ones she had known he lives in scotland she began again his mother loved him he kissed me he went away lord coombe sent him dawson could not help her start lord coombe she exclaimed robin came close to her and ground her little fist into her knee until its plumpness felt almost bruised he is badbadbad and she looked like a little demon being a wise woman dowson knew at once that she had come upon a hidden child volcano and it would be well to let it seethe into silence she was not a clever person but long experience had taught her that there were occasions when it was well to leave a child alone this one would not answer if she were questioned she would only become stubborn and furious and no child should be goaded into fury dowson had of course learned that the boy was a relative of his lordships and had a strict scottish mother who did not approve of the slice of a house his lordship might have been concerned in the matteror he might not but at least dowson had gained a side light and how the little thing had cared actually as if she had been a grown girl dowson found herself thinking uneasily she was rendered even a trifle more uneasy a few days later when she came upon robin sitting in a corner on a footstool with a picture book on her knee and she recognized it as the one she had discovered during her first exploitation of the resources of the third floor nursery it was inscribed donal and robin was not looking at it alone but at something she held in her handsomething folded in a crumpled untidy bit of paper making a reason for nearing her corner dowson saw what the paper held the contents looked like the broken fragments of some dried leaves the child was gazing at them with a piteous bewildered faceso piteous that dowson was sorry do you want to keep those she asked yes with a caught breath yes i will make you a little silk bag to hold them in dowson said actually feeling rather piteous herself the poor little lamb with her picture book and her bits of broken dry leavesalmost like senna she sat down near her and robin left her footstool and came to her she laid the picture book on her lap and the senna like fragments of leaves on its open page donal brought it to show me she quavered he made pretty things on the leaveswith his dirk she recalled too muchtoo much all at once her eyes grew rounder and larger with inescapable woe donal did donal and suddenly she hid her face deep in dowsons skirts and the tempest broke she was so small a thingso inarticulateand these were her dead dowson could only catch her in her arms drag her up on her knee and rock her to and fro good lord good lord was her inward ejaculation and she not seven whatll she do when shes seventeen shes one of them theres no help for it was the beginning of an affection after this when dowson tucked robin in bed each night she kissed her she told her stories and taught her to sew and to know her letters using some discretion she found certain little playmates for her in the gardens but there were occasions when all did not go well and some pretty friendly child who had played with robin for a few days suddenly seemed to be kept strictly by her nurses side once when she was about ten years old a newcomer a dramatic and too richly dressed little person after a day of wonderful imaginative playing appeared in the gardens the morning following to turn an ostentatious cold shoulder what is the matter asked robin oh we cant play with you any more with quite a flounce superiority why not said robin becoming haughty herself we cant its because of lord coombe the little person had really no definite knowledge of how lord coombe was concerned but certain servants whisperings of names and mysterious phrases had conveyed quite an enjoyable effect of unknown iniquity connected with his lordship robin said nothing to dowson but walked up and down the paths reflecting and building a slow fire which would continue to burn in her young heart she had by then passed the round soft baby period and had entered into that phase when bodies and legs grow long and slender and small faces lose their first curves and begin to show sharper modeling accepting the situation in its entirety dowson had seen that it was well to first reach lord coombe with any need of the childs afterwards the form of presenting it to mrs garethlawless must be gone through but if she were first spoken to any suggestion might be forgotten or intentionally ignored dowson became clever in her calculations as to when his lordship might be encountered and whereas if by chance and therefore quite respectfully sometimes she remotely wondered if he himself did not make such encounters easy for her but his manner never altered in its somewhat stiff expressionless chill of indifference he never was kindly in his manner to the child if he met her dowson felt him at once casual and lofty robin might have been a bit of unconsidered rubbish the sight of which slightly bored him yet the singular fact remained that it was to him one must carefully appeal one afternoon feather swept him with one or two others into the sittingroom with the round window in which flowers grew robin was sitting at a low table making pothooks with a lead pencil on a piece of paper dowson had given her dowson had in fact set her at the task having heard from jennings that his lordship and the other afternoon tea drinkers were to be brought into the palace as feather ironically chose to call it jennings rather liked dowson and often told her little things she wanted to know it was because lord coombe would probably come in with the rest that dowson had set the low white table in the round windows and suggested the pothooks in course of time there was a fluttering and a chatter in the corridor feather was bringing some new guests who had not seen the place before this is where my daughter lives she is much grander than i am she said stand up miss robin and make your curtsey whispered dowson robin did as she was told and mrs garethlawless pretty brows ran up look at her legs she said shes growing like jack and the bean stalkthough i suppose it was only the bean stalk that grew shell stick through the top of the house soon look at her legs i ask you she always spoke as if the child were an inanimate object and she had by this time and by this means managed to sweep from robins mind all the old babyish worship of her loveliness and had planted in its place another feeling at this moment the other feeling surged and burned they are beautiful legs remarked a laughing young man jocularly but perhaps she does not particularly want us to look at them wait until she begins skirt dancing and everybody laughed at once and the child stood rigidthe object of their light ridiculenot herself knowing that her whole little being was cursing them aloud coombe stepped to the little table and bestowed a casual glance on the pencil marks what is she doing he asked as casually of dowson she is learning to make pothooks my lord dowson answered shes a child that wants to be learning things ive taught her her letters and to spell little words shes quickand old enough your lordship learning to read and write exclaimed feather presumption i call it i dont know how to read and writeleast i dont know how to spell do you know how to spell collie to the young man whose name was colin do you genevieve do you artie you cant betray me into vulgar boasting said collie who does in these days nobody but clerks at peter robinsons lord coombe doesbut thats his tiresome superior way said feather hes nearly forty years older than most of you that is the reason coombe commented dont deplore your youth and innocence they swept through the rooms and examined everything in them the truth was that theby this time well knownfact that the unexplainable coombe had built them made them a curiosity and a sort of secret source of jokes the party even mounted to the upper story to go through the bedrooms and it was while they were doing this that coombe chose to linger behind with dowson he remained entirely expressionless for a few moments dowson did not in the least gather whether he meant to speak to her or not but he did you meant he scarcely glanced at her that she was old enough for a governess yes my lord rather breathless in her hurry to speak before she heard the high heels tapping on the staircase again and one thats a good woman as well as clever if i may take the liberty a good one if if a good one would take the place dowson did not attempt refutation or apology she knew better he said no more but sauntered out of the room as he did so robin stood up and made the little charity bob of a curtsey which had been part of her nursery education she was too old now to have refused him her hand but he never made any advances to her he acknowledged her curtsey with the briefest nod not three minutes later the high heels came tapping down the staircase and the small gust of visitors swept away also chapter xvi the interview which took place between feather and lord coombe a few days later had its own special character a governess will come here tomorrow at eleven oclock he said she is a mademoiselle vall she is accustomed to the educating of young children she will present herself for your approval benby has done all the rest feather flushed to her finespun ashgold hair what on earth can it matter she cried it does not matter to you he answered it chancesfor the time beingto matter to me chances she flamed forthit was really a queer little flame of feeling thats it you dont really care its a capricejust because you see she is going to be pretty ill own he admitted that has a great deal to do with it it has everything to do with it she threw out if she had a snub nose and thick legs you wouldnt care for her at all i dont say that i do care for her without emotion the situation interests me here is an extraordinary little being thrown into the world she belongs to nobody she will have to fight for her own hand and she will have to fight by god with that dewy lure in her eyes and her curved pomegranate mouth she will not know but she will draw disaster then she had better not be taught anything at all said feather it would be an amusing thing to let her grow up without learning to read or write at all i know numbers of men who would like the novelty of it girls who know so much are a bore there are a few minor chances she ought to have said coombe a governess is one mademoiselle vall will be here at eleven i cant see that she promises to be such a beauty fretted feather shes the kind of good looking child who might grow up into a fat girl with staring black eyes like a barmaid occasionally pretty women do abhor their growing up daughters commented coombe letting his eyes rest on her interestedly i dont abhor her with pathos touched with venom but a big lumping girl hanging about ogling and wanting to be ogled when she is passing through that silly age and sometimes you speak to me as a man speaks to his wife when he is tired of her i beg your pardon coombe said you make me feel like a person who lives over a shop at knightsbridge or in bijou mansion off regents park but he was deeply aware that as an outcome of the anomalous position he occupied he not infrequently felt exactly this that a governess chosen by coombethough he would seem not to appear in the matterwould preside over the new rooms feather knew without a shadow of doubt a certain almost silent and always highbred dominance over her existence she accepted as the inevitable even while she fretted helplessly without him she would be tossed a broken butterfly into the gutter she knew her london no one would pick her up unless to break her into smaller atoms and toss her away again the freedom he allowed her after all was wonderful it was because he disdained interference but there was a line not to be crossedthere must not even be an attempt at crossing it why he cared about that she did not know you must be like csars wife he said rather grimly after an interview in which he had given her a certain unsparing warning and i am nobodys wife what did csars wife do she asked nothing and he told her the story and when she had heard him tell it she understood certain things clearly mademoiselle vall was an intelligent mature frenchwoman she presented herself to mrs garethlawless for inspection and in ten minutes realized that the power to inspect and sum up existed only on her own side this pretty woman neither knew what inquiries to make nor cared for such replies as were given being swift to reason and practical in deduction mademoiselle vall did not make the blunder of deciding that this light presence argued that she would be under no supervision more serious the excellent benby one was made aware acted and the excellent benby one was made aware acted under clearly defined orders milord coombeamong other things the best dressed and perhaps the least comprehended man in londonwas concerned in this though on what grounds practical persons could not explain to themselves his connection with the narrow house on the right side of the right street was entirely comprehensible the lenient felt nothing blatant or objectionable about it mademoiselle vall herself was not disturbed by mere rumour the education manner and morals of the little girl she could account for these alone were to be her affair and she was competent to undertake their superintendence therefore she sat and listened with respectful intelligence to the birdlike chatter of mrs garethlawless what a pretty woman the silhouette of a jeune fille mrs garethlawless felt that on her part she had done all that was required of her im afraid shes rather a dull child mademoiselle she said in farewell you know childrens ways and youll understand what i mean she has a trick of staring and saying nothing i confess i wish she wasnt dull it is impossible madame that she should be dull said mademoiselle with an agreeably implicating smile oh but quite impossible we shall see not many days had passed before she had seen much at the outset she recognized the effect of the little girl with the slender legs and feet and the dozen or so of points which go to make a beauty the intense eyes first and the deeps of them they gave one furiously to think before making up ones mind then she noted the perfection of the rooms added to the smartly inconvenient little house where had the child lived before the addition had been built thought and actual architectural genius only could have done this light and even as much sunshine as london will vouchsafe had been arranged for comfort convenience luxury had been provided perfect colour and excellent texture had evoked actual charm its utter unlikeness to the quarters london usually gives to children even of the fortunate class struck mademoiselle vall at once madame garethlawless had not done this who then had the good dowson she at once affiliated with she knew the excellence of her type as it had revealed itself to her in the best peasant class trustworthy simple but of kindly shrewd good sense and with the power to observe dowson was not a chatterer or given to gossip but as a silent observer she would know many things and in time when they had become friendly enough to be fully aware that each might trust the other gentle and careful talk would end in unconscious revelation being made by dowson that the little girl was almost singularly attached to her nurse she had marked early there was something unusual in her manifestations of her feeling the intense eyes followed the woman often as if making sure of her presence and reality the first day of mademoiselles residence in the place she saw the little thing suddenly stop playing with her doll and look at dowson earnestly for several moments then she left her seat and went to the kind creatures side i want to kiss you dowie she said to be sure my lamb answered dowson and laying down her mending she gave her a motherly hug after which robin went back contentedly to her play the frenchwoman thought it a pretty bit of childish affectionateness but it happened more than once during the day and at night mademoiselle commented upon it she has an affectionate heart the little one she remarked madame her mother is so pretty and full of gaieties and pleasures that i should not have imagined she had much time for caresses and the nursery even by this time dowson had realized that with mademoiselle she was upon safe ground and was in no danger of betraying herself to a gossip she quietly laid down her sewing and looked at her companion with grave eyes her mother has never kissed her in her life that i am aware of she said has never mademoiselle ejaculated never just as you see her she is mademoiselle dowson said any sensible woman would know when she heard her talk about her child i found it all out bit by bit when first i came here im going to talk plain and have done with it her first six years she spent in a sort of dog kennel on the top floor of this house no sun no real fresh air two little holes that were dingy and gloomy to dull a childs senses not a toy or a bit of colour or a picture but clothes fine enough for buckingham palace childrenand enough for six fed and washed and taken out every day to be shown off and a bad nurse missa bad one that kept her quiet by pinching her black and blue mon dieu mon dieu that little angel cried mademoiselle covering her eyes dowson hastily wiped her own eyes she had shed many a motherly tear over the child it was a relief to her to open her heart to a sympathizer black and blue she repeated and laughing and dancing and all sorts of fast fun going on in the drawingrooms she put out her hand and touched mademoiselles arm quite fiercely the little thing didnt know she had a mother she didnt know what the word meant i found that out by her innocent talk she used to call her the lady downstairs mon dieu cried the frenchwoman again what a woman she first heard of mothers from a little boy she met in the square gardens he was the first child she had been allowed to play with he was a nice child and he had a good mother i only got it bit by bit when she didnt know how much she was telling me he told her about mothers and he kissed herfor the first time in her life she didnt understand but it warmed her little heart shes never forgotten mademoiselle even started slightly in her chair being a clever frenchwoman she felt drama and all its subtle accompaniments is that why she began it is answered dowson stoutly a kiss isnt an ordinary thing to her it means something wonderful shes got into the way of loving me bless her and every now and then its my opinion she suddenly remembers her lonely days when she didnt know what love was and it just wells up in her little heart and she wants to kiss me she always says it that way dowie i want to kiss you as if it was something strange and so to say sacred she doesnt know it means almost nothing to most people thats why i always lay down my work and hug her close you have a good hearta good one said mademoiselle with strong feeling then she put a question who was the little boy he was a relation ofhis lordships his lordships cautiously the marquis lord coombe there was a few minutes silence both women were thinking of a number of things and each was asking herself how much it would be wise to say it was dowson who made her decision first and this time as before she laid down her work what she had to convey was the thing which above all others the frenchwoman must understand if she was to be able to use her power to its best effect a woman in my place hears enough talk was her beginning servants are given to it the servants hall is their theatre it doesnt matter whether tales are true or not so that theyre spicy but its been my way to credit just as much as i see and know and to say little about that if a woman takes a place in a house let her go or stay as suits her best but dont let her stay and either complain or gossip my business here is miss robin and ive found out for myself that theres just one person that in a queer unfeeling way of his own has a fancy for looking after her i say unfeeling because he never shows any human signs of caring for the child himself but if theres a thing that ought to be done for her and a body can contrive to let him know its needed itll be done downstairs talk that ive seemed to pay no attention to has let out that it was him that walked quietly upstairs to the nursery where hed never set foot before and opened the door on andrews pinching the child she packed her box and left that night he inspected the nurseries and in a few days an architect was planning these roomsfor miss robin and for no one else though there was others wanted them it was him that told me to order her books and playthingsand not let her know it because she hates him it was him i told she needed a governess and he found you mademoiselle vall had listened with profound attention here she spoke you say continually he or him he is lord coombe im not saying ive seen much of him considering dowson pausedits queer how seldom he comes here he goes abroad a good deal hes mixed up with the highest and its said hes in favour because hes satirical and clever hes one thats gossiped about and he cares nothing for whats said what business of mine is it whether or not he has all sorts of dens on the continent where he goes to racket he might be a bishop for all i see and hes the only creature in this world of the almightys that remembers that childs a human being just himlord coombe there mademoiselleive said a good deal more and more interestedly had the frenchwoman listened and with an increasing hint of curiosity in her intelligent eyes she pressed dowsons needleroughened fingers warmly you have not said too much it is well that i should know this of this gentleman as you say he is a man who is much discussed i myself have heard much of himbut of things connected with another part of his character it is true that he is in favour with great personages it is because they are aware that he has observed much for many years he is light and ironic but he tells truths which sometimes startle those who hear them jennings tells below stairs that he says things its queer for a lord to say jennings is a sharp young snip and likes to pick up things to repeat he believes that his lordships idea is that theres a time coming when the high ones will lose their places and thrones and kings will be done away with i wouldnt like to go that far myself said dowson gravely but i must say that theres not that serious respect paid to royalty that there was in my young days my word when queen victoria was in her prime with all her young family around hertheir little royal highnesses that were princes in their highland kilts and the princesses in their crinolines and hats with drooping ostrich feathers and broad satin streamersthe people just went wild when she went to a place to unveil anything when the empress eugenie and the prince imperial appeared it was the same thing said mademoiselle a trifle sadly one recalls it now as a dream passed awaythe champs lyses in the afternoon sunlightthe imperial carriage and the glittering escort trotting gailythe beautiful woman with the always beautiful costumesher charming smilethe emperor with his waxed moustache and saturnine face it meant so much and it went so quickly one moment she made a little gesture and it is goneforever an empire and all the splendour of it two centuries ago it could not have disappeared so quickly but now the world is older it does not need toys so much a republic is the peopleand there are more people than kings its things like that his lordship says according to jennings said dowson jennings is never quite sure hes in earnest he has a satirical wayand the company always laugh mademoiselle had spoken thoughtfully and as if half to her inner self instead of to dowson she added something even more thoughtfully now the same kind of people laughed before the french revolution she murmured im not scholar enough to know much about thatthat was a long time ago wasnt it dowson remarked a long time ago said mademoiselle dowsons reply was quite free from tragic reminiscence well i must say i like a respectable royal family myself she observed theres something solid and comfortable about itbesides the coronations and weddings and procession with all the pictures in the illustrated london news give me a nice wellbehaved royal family chapter xvii a nice wellbehaved royal family there had been several of them in europe for some time an appreciable number of them had prided themselves even a shade ostentatiously upon their domesticity the moral views of a few had been believed to border upon the high principles inscribed in copy books some however had not a more important power or so had veered from the exact following of these commendable axiomshad highhandedly behaved according to their royal will and tastes but what would you with a nation making proper obeisance before one from infancy with trumpets blaring forth joyous strains upon ones mere appearance on any scene with the proudest necks bowed and the most superb curtseys swept on ones mere passing by with all the splendour of the opera on gala night rising to its feet to salute ones mere entry into the royal or imperial box while the national anthem bursts forth with adulatory and triumphant strains only a keen and subtle sense of humour surely could curb errors of judgment arising from naturally mistaken views of ones own importance and value to the entire universe still there remained the fact that a number of them were wellbehaved and could not be complained of as bearing any likeness to the bloodthirsty tyrants and oppressors of past centuries the head of the house of coombe had attended the court functions and been received at the palaces and castles of most of them for in that aspect of his character of which mademoiselle vall had heard more than dowson he was intimate with wellknown and muchobserved personages and places a man born among those whose daily life builds as it passes at least a part of that which makes history and so records itself must needs find companions acquaintances enemies friends of varied character and if he be by chance a keen observer of passing panoramas can lack no material for private reflection and the accumulation of important facts that part of his existence which connected itself with the slice of a house on the right side of the mayfair street was but a small one a feature of the untranslatableness of his character was that he was seen there but seldom his early habit of crossing the channel frequently had gradually reestablished itself as years passed among his acquaintances his saturday to monday visits to continental cities remote or unremote were discussed with humour possibly upon these discussions were finally founded the rumours of which dowson had heard but which she had impartially declined to credit lively conjecture inevitably figured largely in their arguments and when persons of unrestrained wit devote their attention to airy persiflage much may be included in their points of view of these conjectural discussions no one was more clearly aware than coombe himself and the finished facilityeven felicityof his evasion of any attempt at delicately valued cross examination was felt to be inhumanly exasperating in one of the older squares which still remained stately through the splendour of modern fashion had waned in its neighbourhood there was among the gloomy though imposing houses one in particular upon whose broad doorstepsyears before the garethlawlesses had appeared in londonlord coombe stood oftener than upon any other at times his brougham waited before it for hours and at others he appeared on foot and lifted the heavy knocker with a special accustomed knock recognized at once by any footman in waiting in the hall who hearing it knew that his mistressthe old dowager duchess of dartewould receive this visitor if no other the interior of the house was of the type which having from the first been massive and richly sombre had mellowed into a darker sombreness and richness as it had stood unmoved amid london years and fogs the grandeur of decoration and furnishing had been too solid to depreciate through decay and its owner had been of no fickle mind led to waver in taste by whims of fashion the rooms were huge and lofty the halls and stairways spacious the fireplaces furnished with immense grates of glittering steel which held in winter beds of scarlet glowing coal kept scarlet glowing by a special footman whose being so to speak depended on his fidelity to his task there were many rooms whose doors were kept closed because they were apparently never used there were others as little used but thrown open warmed and brightened with flowers each day because the duchess chose to catch glimpses of their cheerfulness as she passed them on her way up or downstairs the house was her own property and after her widowhood when it was emptied of her children by their admirable marriages and she herself became dowager and later a confirmed rheumatic invalid it became doubly her home and was governed by her slightest whim she was not indeed an old woman of caprices but her tastes not being those of the later day in which she now lived were regarded as a shade eccentric being firmly defined i will not have my house glaring with electricity as if it were a shop in my own rooms i will be lighted by wax candles large onesas many as you please she said i will not be rung up by telephone my servants may if they like it is not my affair to deprive them of the modern inconveniences if they find them convenient my senility does not take the form of insisting that the world shall cease to revolve upon its axis it formed that habit without my assistance and it is to be feared that it would continue it in the face of my protests it was in fact solely that portion of the world affecting herself alone which she preferred to retain as it had been in the brilliant early years of her life she had been a great beauty and also a wit in the court over which queen victoria had reigned she had possessed the delicate high nose the soft full eyes the polished forehead the sloping white shoulders from which scarves floated or india shawls gracefully drooped in the books of beauty of the day her carriage had been noble her bloom perfect and when she had driven through the streets in attendance on her royal mistress the populace had always chosen her as the pick of em all young as she had then been elderly statesmen had found her worth talking to not as a mere beauty in her teens but as a creature of singular brilliance and clarity of outlook upon a world which might have dazzled her youth the most renowned among them had said of her before she was twenty that she would live to be one of the cleverest women in europe and that she had already the logical outlook of a just man of fifty she married early and was widowed in middle life in her later years rheumatic fever so far disabled her as to confine her to her chair almost entirely her sons and daughter had homes and families of their own to engage them she would not allow them to sacrifice themselves to her because her life had altered its aspect i have money friends good servants and a house i particularly like she summed the matter up i may be condemned to sit by the fire but i am not condemned to be a bore to my inoffensive family i can still talk and read and i shall train myself to become a professional listener this will attract i shall not only read myself but i will be read to a strong young man with a nice voice shall bring magazines and books to me every day and shall read the best things aloud delightful people will drop in to see me and will be amazed by my fund of information it was during the first years of her enforced seclusion that coombes intimacy with her began he had known her during certain black days of his youth and she had comprehended things he did not tell her she had not spoken of them to him but she had silently given him of something which vaguely drew him to her side when darkness seemed to overwhelm him the occupations of her life left her in those earlier days little leisure for close intimacies but when she began to sit by her fire letting the busy world pass by he gradually became one of those who dropped in in one of the huge rooms she had chosen for her own daily use by the welltended fire in its shining grate she had created an agreeable corner where she sat in a chair marvellous for ease and comfort enclosed from draughts by a fire screen of antique chinese lacquer a table by her side and all she required within her reach upon the table stood a silver bell and at its sound her companion her reader her maid or her personally trained footman came and went quietly and promptly as if summoned by magic her life itself was simple but a certain almost royal dignity surrounded her loneliness her companion miss brent an intelligent mature woman who had known a hard and pinched life found at once comfort and savour in it it is not i who am expensivethis in one of her talks with coombe but to live in a house of this size well kept by excellent servants who are satisfied with their lot is not a frugal thing a cap of tea for those of my friends who run in to warm themselves by my fire in the afternoon a dinner or so when i am well enough to sit at the head of my table represent almost all i now do for the world naturally i must see that my tea is good and that my dinners cannot be objected to nevertheless i sit here in my chair and save moneyfor what among those who warmed themselves by her fire this man had singularly become her friend and intimate when they had time to explore each others minds they came upon curious discoveries of hidden sympathies and mutual comprehensions which were rich treasures they talked of absorbing things with frankness he came to sit with her when others were not admitted because she was in pain or fatigued he added to neither her fatigue nor her pain but rather helped her to forget them for what he answered on this day why not for your grandchildren they will have too much money there are only four of them they will make great marriages as their parents did she said she paused a second before she added unless our world revolution has broken into flame by that timeand there are no longer any great marriages to make for among the many things they dwelt on in their talks along was the chessboard which was the map of europe over which he had watched for many years certain hands hover in tentative experimenting as to the possibilities of the removal of the pieces from one square to another she too from her youth had watched the game with an interest which had not waned in her maturity and which in her days of sitting by the fire had increased with every move the hovering hands made she had been familiar with political parties and their leaders she had met heroes and statesmen she had seen an unimportant prince become an emperor who from his green and boastful youth aspired to rule the world and whose theatrical obsession had been the sly jest of unwary nations too carelessly sure of the advance of civilization and too indifferently selfindulgent to realize that a monomaniac even if treated as a source of humour is a perilous thing to leave unwatched she had known france in all the glitter of its showy empire and had seen its imperial glories dispersed as mist russia she had watched with curiosity and dread on the day when the ruler who had bestowed freedom on millions of his people met his reward in the shattering bomb which tore him to fragments she had been in st petersburg a king who had been assassinated she had known well and had well liked an empress whom a frenzied madman had stabbed to the heart had been her friend her years had been richly full of varied events giving a strong and farseeing mind reason for much unspoken thought of the kind which leaps in advance of its days experience and exact knowledge she had learned when to speak and when to be silent and she oftener chose silence but she had never ceased gazing on the world with keen eyes and reflecting upon its virtues and vagaries its depths and its shallows with the help of a clear and temperate brain by her fire she sat an attracting presence though only fine strong lines remained of beauty ravaged by illness and years the polished forehead was furrowed by the chisel of suffering the delicate high nose springing from her waxen sunken face seemed somewhat eaglelike but the face was still brilliant in its intensity of meaning and the carriage of her head was still noble not able to walk except with the assistance of a cane her once exquisite hands stiffened almost to uselessness she held her court from her throne of mere power and strong charm on the afternoons when people ran in to warm themselves by her fire the talk was never dull and was often wonderful there were those who came quietly into the room fresh from important scenes where subjects of weight to nations were being argued closelyperhaps almost fiercely sometimes the argument was continued over cups of perfect tea near the chair of the duchess and howsoever far it led she was able brilliantly to follow with the aid of books and pamphlets and magazines and the strong young man with the nice voice who was her reader she kept pace with each step of the march of the world it was however the modern note in her recollections of her worlds march in days long past in which coombe found mental food and fine flavour the phrase in these days expressed in her utterance neither disparagement nor regret she who sat in state in a drawingroom lighted by wax candles did so as an affair of personal preference and denied no claim of higher brilliance to electric illumination driving slowly through hyde park on sunny days when she was able to go out her highswung barouche hinted at no lofty disdain of petrol and motor power at the close of her youths century she looked forward with thrilled curiosity to the dawning wonders of the next if the past had not held so much one might not have learned to expect more was her summing up on a certain afternoon when he came to report himself after one of his absences from england the most important discovery of the last fifty years has been the revelation that no man may any longer assume to speak the last word on any subject the next manalmost any next manmay evolve more before that period all elderly persons were final in their dictum they said to each otherand particularly to the youngit has not been done in my timeit was not done in my grandfathers time it has never been done it never can be done the note of today is since it has never been done it will surely be done soon said coombe ah we who began life in the most assured and respectable of reigns and centuries she answered him have seen much but these others will see more crinolines mushroom hats and large families seemed to promise a decorum peaceful to dullness but there have been battles murders and sudden deaths there have been almost supernatural inventions and discoveriesthere have been marvels of new doubts and faiths when one sits and counts upon ones fingers the amazements the th century has provided one gasps and gazes with wide eyes into the future i for one feel rather as though i had seen a calm milch cow saunteringat first slowlyalong a path gradually evolve into a tigera genie with a hundred heads containing all the marvels of the worlda flying dragon with a thousand eyes oh we have gone fast and far and we shall go faster and farther coombe added that is it she answered are we going too fast at least so fast that we forget things it would be well for us to remember he had come in that day with a certain preoccupied grimness of expression which was not unknown to her it was generally after one of his absences that he looked a shade grim such as she inquired such as catastrophes in the history of the world which forethought and wisdom might have prevented the french revolution is the obvious type of figure which lies close at hand so one picks it up the french revolutionits reign of terrorthe orgies of carnagethe cataclysms of agonyneed not have been but they were to put it in words of one syllable what was her involuntary exclamation you are seeking such similes as the french revolution who knows how far a madness may reach and what reign of terror may take form he sat down and drew an atlas towards him it always lay upon the table on which all the duchess desired was within reach it was fat convenient of form and agreeable to look at in its cover of dull green leather coombes gesture of drawing it towards him was a familiar one it was frequently used as reference the atlas again she said yes just now i can think of little else i have realized too much the continental journey had lasted a month he had visited more countries than one in his pursuit of a study he was making of the way in which the wind was blowing particular straws for long he had found much to give thought to in the trend of movement in one special portion of the chessboard it was that portion of it dominated by the ruler of whose obsession too careless nations made sly jest this man he had known from his arrogant and unendearing youth he had looked on with unbiassed curiosity at his development into arrogance so much greater than its proportions touched the grotesque the rest of the world had looked on also but apparently merely in the casual way which goodnaturedly smiles and leaves to every maneven an emperorthe privilege of his own eccentricities coombe had looked on with a difference so also had his friend by her fireside this mans square of the chessboard had long been the subject of their private talks and a cause for the drawing towards them of the green atlas the moves he made the methods of his ruling the significance of these methods were the evidence they collected in their frequent arguments coombe had early begun to see the whole thing as a processa lifelong labour which was a means to a monstrous end there was a certain thing he believed of which they often spoke as it he spoke of it now through three weeks i have been marking how it grows he said a whole nation with the entire power of its commerce its education its science its religion guided towards one aim is a curious study the very babes are born and bred and taught only that one thought may become an integral part of their being the most innocent and blue eyed of them knows without a shadow of doubt that the world has but one reason for existencethat it may be conquered and ravaged by the country that gave them birth i have both heard and seen it she said one has smiled in spite of oneself in listening to their simple everyday talk in little schoolsin large onesin little churches and in imposing ones their faith is taught and preached coombe answered sometimes one cannot believe ones hearing it is all so ingenuously and frankly unashamedthe mouthing boasting and threats of their piety there exists for them no god who is not the modest henchman of their emperor and whose attention is not rivetted on their prowess with admiration and awe apparently they are his business and he is well paid by being allowed to retain their confidence a lack of any sense of humour is a disastrous thing commented the duchess the people of other nations may be foolsdoubtless we all arebut there is no other which proclaims the fact abroad with such guileless outbursts of raucous exultation and even weyou and i who have thought more than others he said restlessly even we forget and half smile there has been too much smiling she picked up an illustrated paper and opened it at a page filled by an ornate picture see she said it is because he himself has made it so easy with his amazing portraits of his big boots and swords and eruption of dangling orders how can one help but smile when one finds him glaring at one from a newspaper in his superwarlike attitude defying the universe with his comic moustachios and their ferocious waxed and bristling ends no one can scarcely believe that a man can be stupid enough not to realize that he looks as if he had deliberately made himself up to represent a sort of terrific military bogey intimating that at he may pounce and say boo there lies the peril his pretensions seem too grotesque to be treated seriously and while he should be watched as a madman is watched he is given a lifetime to we attack on a world that has ceased to believe in the sole thing which is real to himself you are fresh from observation there was new alertness in her eyes though she had listened before i tell you it grows he gave back and lightly struck the table in emphasis do you remember carlyle the french revolution again yes do you recall this do not fires fevers seeds chemical mixtures go on growing observe too that each grows with a rapidity proportioned to the madness and unhealthiness there is in it a ruler who in an unaggressive age such as this can concentrate his life and his peoples on the one ambition of plunging the world in an ocean of blood in which his own monomania can bathe in triumphgood god there is madness and unhealthiness to flourish in the world she said yesit will be the world see he said with a curve of the finger which included most of the map of europe here are countries engagedlike the bandarlogin their own affairs quarrelling snatching things from each other blustering or amusing themselves with transitory pomps and displays of power here is a huge empire whose immense halfsavage population has seethed for centuries in its hidden boiling cauldron of rebellion oh it has seethed and only cruelties have repressed it now and then it has boiled over in assassination in high places and one has wondered how long its autocratic splendour could hold its own here are small fierce helpless nations overrun and outraged into a chronic state of secret everready hatred here are innocent small countries defenceless through their position and size here is france rich careless supermodern and cynic here is england comfortable to stolidity prosperous and secure to dullness in her own half belief in a world civilization which no longer argues in terms of blood and steel and herein a wellentrenched position in the midst of it allwithin but a few hundreds of miles of weakness complicity disastrous unreadiness and panicstricken uncertainty of purpose sits this man of one dreamwho believes god himself his vassal here he sits yes his one dream he has had no other the duchess was poring over the map also they were as people pondering over a strange and terrible game it is his monomania it possessed him when he was a boy what napoleon hoped to accomplish he has believed he could attain by concentrating all the power of people upon preparation for itand by not flinching from pouring forth their blood as if it were the refuse water of his gutters yesthe bloodthe blood the duchess shuddered he would pour it forth without a qualm coombe touched the map first at one point and then at another see he said again and this time savagely this empire flattered and entangled by cunning this country irritated this deceived this drawn into argument this and this and this treated with professed friendship these tricked and juggled withand then when his plans are ripe and he is made drunk with belief in himselfjust one sodden insult or monstrous breach of faith which all humanity must leap to resentand there is our world revolution the duchess sat upright in her chair why did you let your youth pass she said if you had begun early enough you could hare made the country listen to you why did you do it for the same reason that all selfish grief and pleasure and indifference let the world go by and i am not sure they would have listened i speak freely enough now in some quarters they listen but they do nothing there is a warning in the fact that as he has seen his youth leave him without giving him his opportunity he has been a disappointed man inflamed and made desperate at the outset he felt that he must provide the world with some fiction of excuse as his obsession and arrogance have swollen he sees himself and his ambition as reason enough no excuse is needed deutschland uber allesis sufficient he pushed the map away and his fire died down he spoke almost in his usual manner the conquest of the world he said he is a great fool what would he do with his continents if he got them what indeed pondered her grace continentseven kingdoms are not like kittens in a basket or puppies to be trained to come to heel it is part of his monomania that he can persuade himself that they are little more coombes eyeglasses had been slowly swaying from the ribbon in his fingers he let them continue to sway a moment and then closed them with a snap he is a great fool he said but weoh my friendand by we i mean the rest of the map of europewe are much greater fools a mad dog loose among us and we sitand smile and this was in the days before the house with the creamcoloured front had put forth its first geraniums and lobelias in feathers window boxes robin was not born chapter xviii in the added suite of rooms at the back of the house robin grew through the years in which it was growing also on the occasion when her mother saw her she realized that she was not at least going to look like a barmaid at no period of her least refulgent moment did she verge upon this type dowie took care of her and mademoiselle vall educated her with the assistance of certain masters who came to give lessons in german and italian why only german and italian and french said feather why not latin and greek as well if she is to be so accomplished it is modern languages one needs at this period they ought to be taught in the board schools coombe replied they are not accomplishments but workmans tools nationalities are not separated as they once were to be familiar with the language of ones friendsand ones enemiesis a protective measure what country need one protect oneself against when all the kings and queens are either married to each others daughters or cousins or take tea with each other every year or so just think of the friendliness of germany for instance i do said coombe very often that is one of the reasons i choose german rather than latin and greek julius csar and nero are no longer reasons for alarm is the kaiser with his seventeen children and his respectable frau giggled feather all that he cares about is that women shall be made to remember that they are born for nothing but to cook and go to church and have babies one doesnt wonder at the clothes they wear it was not a month after this however when lord coombe again warming himself at his old friends fire gave her a piece of information the german teacher herr wiese has hastily returned to his own country he said she lifted her eyebrows inquiringly he found himself suspected of being a spy was his answer with most excellent reason some firstrate sketches of fortifications were found in a box he left behind him in his haste the countryall countriesare sown with those like him mild spectacled students and clerks in warehouses and manufactories are weighing and measuring resources roundfaced middleaged governesses are making notes of conversation and of any other thing which may be useful in time of warif they were caught at what are now their simple daily occupationsthey would be placed against a wall and shot as it is they are allowed to play about among us and slip away when some fellow workers hint suggests it is time german young men are much given to spending a year or so here in business positions the duchess wore a thoughtful air that has been going on for a decade or so one recognizes their teuton type in shops and in the streets they say they come to learn the language and commercial methods not long ago a pompous person who is the owner of a big shop pointed out to me three of them among his salesmen coombe said he plumed himself on his astuteness in employing them said they worked for low wages and cared for very little else but finding out how things were done in england it wasnt only business knowledge they were after he said they went about everywhereinto factories and dock yards and public buildings and made funny little notes and sketches of things they didnt understandso that they could explain them in germany in his fatuous insular way it pleased him to regard them rather as a species of aborigines benefiting by english civilization the english ass and the german ass are touchingly alike the shade of difference is that the english asss sublime selfsatisfaction is in the german ass selfglorification the english ass smirks and plumes himself the german ass blusters and bullies and defies do you think of engaging another german master for the little girl the duchess asked the question casually i have heard of a quiet young woman who has shown herself thorough and wellbehaved in a certain family for three years perhaps she also will disappear some day but for the present she will serve the purpose as he had not put into words to others any explanation of the story of the small smart establishment in the mayfair street so he had put into words no explanation to her that she was aware of its existence he knew but what she thought of it or imagined he himself thought of it he had not at any period inquired whatsoever her point of view might be he knew it would be unbiassed clear minded and wholly just she had asked no question and made no comment the rapid whirligig existence of the wellknown fashionable groups including in their circles varieties of the mrs garethlawless type were to be seen at smart functions and to be read of in newspapers and fashion reports if ones taste lay in the direction of a desire to follow their movements the time had passed when pretty women of her kind were cut off by severities of opinion from the delights of a world they had thrown their dice daringly to gain the worldly old axiom be virtuous and you will be happy had been ironically paraphrased too often please yourself and you will be much happier than if you were virtuous was a practical reading but for a certain secret which she alone knew and which no one would in the least have believed if she had proclaimed it from the housetops feather would really have been entirely happy and after all the fly in her ointment was merely an odd sting a fantastic fate had inflicted on her vanity and did not in any degree affect her pleasures so many people lived in glass houses that the habit of throwing stones had fallen out of fashion as an exercise there were those too whose houses of glass adroitly given the air of being respectable conservatories engendered in the dwellers therein a leniency towards other vitreous constructions as a result of this last circumstance there were times when quite stately equipages drew up before mrs garethlawless door and visiting cards bearing the names of acquaintances much to be desired were left upon the salver presented by jennings again as a result of this circumstance feather employed some laudable effort in her desire to give her own glass house the conservatory aspect her little parties became less noisy if they still remained lively she gave an afternoon now and then to which literary people and artists and persons who did things were invited she was pretty enough to allure an occasional musician to do something some new poet to read or recite fashionable people were asked to come and hear and talk to them and in this way she threw out delicate fishing lines here and there and again and again drew up a desirable fish of substantial size sometimes the vague rumour connected with the name of the head of the house of coombe was quite forgotten and she was referred to amiably as that beautiful creature mrs garethlawless she was left a widow when she was nothing but a girl if she hadnt had a little money of her own and if her husbands relatives hadnt taken care of her she would have had a hard time of it she is amazingly clever at managing her small income they added her tiny house is one of the jolliest little places in londonalways full of good looking people and amusing things but before robin was fourteen she had found out that the house she lived in was built of glass and that any chance stone would break its panes even if cast without particular skill in aiming she found it out in various ways but the seed from which all things sprang to the fruition of actual knowledge was the child tragedy through which she had learned that donal had been taken from herbecause his mother would not let him love and play with a little girl whose mother let lord coombe come to her housebecause lord coombe was so bad that even servants whispered secrets about him her first interpretation of this had been that of a mere baby but it had filled her being with detestation of him and curious doubts of her mother donals mother who was good and beautiful would not let him come to see her and kept donal away from him if the lady downstairs was good too then why did she laugh and talk to him and seem to like him she had thought this over for hourssometimes wakening in the night to lie and puzzle over it feverishly then as time went by she had begun to remember that she had never played with any of the children in the square gardens it had seemed as though this had been because andrews would not let her but if she was not fit to play with donal perhaps the nurses and governesses and mothers of the other children knew about it and would not trust their little girls and boys to her damaging society she did not know what she could have done to harm themand oh how could she have harmed donalbut there must be something dreadful about a child whose mother knew bad peoplesomething which other children could catch like scarlet fever from this seed other thoughts had grown she did not remain a baby long a fervid little brain worked for her picked up hints and developed suggestions set her to singularly alert reasoning which quickly became too mature for her age the quite horrid little girl who flouncingly announced that she could not be played with any more because of lord coombe set a spark to a train after that time she used to ask occasional carefully considered questions of dowson and mademoiselle vall which puzzled them by their vagueness the two women were mutually troubled by a moody habit she developed of sitting absorbed in her own thoughts and with a concentrated little frown drawing her brows together they did not know that she was silently planning a subtle cross examination of them both whose form would be such that neither of them could suspect it of being anything but innocent she felt that she was growing cunning and deceitful but she did not care very much she possessed a clever and determined though very young brain she loved both dowson and mademoiselle but she must find out about things for herself and she was not going to harm or trouble them they would never know she had found out whatsoever she discovered she would keep to herself but one does not remain a baby long and one is a little girl only a few years and even during the few years one is growing and hearing and seeing all the time after that one is beginning to be a rather big girl and one has seen books and newspapers and overheard scraps of things from servants if one is brought up in a convent and allowed to read nothing but literature selected by nuns a degree of aloofness from knowledge may be counted uponthough even convent schools it is said encounter their difficulties in perfect discipline robin in her small palace was well taken care of but her library was not selected by nuns it was chosen with thought but it was the library of modern youth mademoiselle valls theories of a girls education were not founded on a belief that until marriage she should be led about by a string blindfolded and with ears stopped with wax that results in a bleating lambs being turned out of its fold to make its way through a jungle full of wild creatures and pitfalls it has never heard of she said in discussing the point with dowson she had learned that lord coombe agreed with her he as well as she chose the books and his taste was admirable its inclusion of an unobtrusive care for girlhood did not preclude the exercise of the intellect an early developed passion for reading led the child far and wide fiction history poetry biography opened up vistas to a naturally quick and eager mind mademoiselle found her a clever pupil and an affectioninspiring little being even from the first she always felt however that in the depths of her something held itself hiddensomething she did not speak of it was some thought which perhaps bewildered her but which something prevented her making clear to herself by the asking of questions mademoiselle vall finally became convinced that she never would ask the questions arrived a day when feather swept into the palace with some visitors they were two fair and handsome little girls of thirteen and fourteen whose mother having taken them shopping found it would suit her extremely well to drop then somewhere for an hour while she went to her dressmaker feather was quite willing that they should be left with robin and mademoiselle until their own governess called for them here are eileen and winifred erwyn robin she said bringing them in talk to them and show them your books and things until the governess comes dowson give them some cakes and tea mrs erwyn was one of the most treasured of feathers circle her little girls governess was a young frenchwoman entirely unlike mademoiselle vall eileen and winifred saw life from their schoolroom windows as an open book why not since their governess and their mothers french maid conversed freely and had rather penetrating voices even when they were under the impression that they lowered them out of deference to blameless youth eileen and winifred liked to remain awake to listen as long as they could after they went to bed they themselves had large curious eyes and were given to whispering and giggling they talked a good deal to robin and assumed fashionable little grown up airs they felt themselves mature creatures as compared to her since she was not yet thirteen they were so familiar with personages and functions that robin felt that they must have committed to memory every morning the column in the daily telegraph known as london day by day she sometimes read it herself because it was amusing to her to read about parties and weddings and engagements but it did not seem easy to remember winifred and eileen were delighted to display themselves in the character of instructresses they entertained robin for a short time but after that she began to dislike the shared giggles which so often broke out after their introduction of a name or an incident it seemed to hint that they were full of amusing information which they held back then they were curious and made remarks and asked questions she began to think them rather horrid we saw lord coombe yesterday said winifred at last and the unnecessary giggle followed we think he wears the most beautiful clothes we ever saw you remember his overcoat winnie said eileen he matches soand yet you dont know exactly how he matches and she giggled also he is the best dressed man in london winifred stated quite grandly i think he is handsome so do mademoiselle and florine robin said nothing at all what dowson privately called her secret look made her face very still winifred saw the look and not understanding it or her became curious dont you she said no robin answered he has a wicked face and hes old too you think hes old because youre only about twelve inserted eileen children think everybody who is grownup must be old i used to but now people dont talk and think about age as they used to mademoiselle says that when a man has distinction he is always youngand nicer than boys winifred who was persistent broke in as to his looking wicked i daresay he is wicked in a sort of interesting way of course people say all sorts of things about him when he was quite young he was in love with a beautiful little royal princessor she was in love with himand her husband either killed her or she died of a broken hearti dont know which mademoiselle vall had left them for a short time feeling that they were safe with their tea and cakes and would feel more at ease relieved of her presence she was not long absent but eileen and winifred being avid of gossip and generally eliminated subjects got in their work with quite fevered haste they liked the idea of astonishing robin eileen bent forward and lowered her voice they do say that once captain thorpe was fearfully jealous of him and people wonder that he wasnt among the corespondents the word corespondent filled her with selfgratulation even though she only whispered it corespondents said robin they both began to whisper at oncequite shrilly in their haste they knew mademoiselle might return at any moment the great divorce case you know the thorpe divorce case the papers are so full of we get the under housemaid to bring it to us after mademoiselle has done with it its so exciting havent you been reading it oh no i havent answered robin and i dont know about corespondents but if they are anything horrid i daresay he was one of them and at that instant mademoiselle returned and dowson brought in fresh cakes the governess who was to call for her charges presented herself not long afterwards and the two enterprising little persons were taken away i believe shes jealous of lord coombe eileen whispered to winifred after they reached home so do i said winifred wisely she cant help but know how he adores mrs garethlawless because shes so lovely he pays for all her pretty clothes its silly of her to be jealouslike a baby robin sometimes read newspapers though she liked books better newspapers were not forbidden her she been reading an enthralling book and had not seen a paper for some days she at once searched for one and finding it sat down and found also the thorpe divorce case it was not difficult of discovery as it filled the principal pages with dramatic evidence and amazing revelations dowson saw her bending over the spread sheets hoteyed and intense in her concentration what are you reading my love she asked the little flaming face lifted itself it was unhappy obstinate resenting it wore no accustomed child look and dowson felt rather startled im reading the thorpe divorce case dowie she answered deliberately and distinctly dowie came close to her its an ugly thing to read my lamb she faltered dont you read it such things oughtnt to be allowed in newspapers and youre a little girl my own dear robins elbow rested firmly on the table and her chin firmly in her hand her eyes were not like a birds im nearly thirteen she said im growing up nobody can stop themselves when they begin to grow up it makes them begin to find out things i want to ask you something dowie now lovey dowie began with tremor both she and mademoiselle had been watching the innocent growing up and fearing a time would come when the widening gaze would see too much had it come as soon as this robin suddenly caught the kind womans wrists in her hands and held them while she fixed her eyes on her the childish passion of dread and shyness in them broke dowsons heart because it was so ignorant and young im growing up theres somethingi must know something i never knew how to ask about it before it was so plain to dowson that she did not know how to ask about it now someone said that lord coombe might have been a corespondent in the thorpe case these wicked children gasped dowie theyre not children at all everybodys horrid but you and mademoiselle cried robin brokenly she held the wrists harder and ended in a sort of outburst if my father were alivecould he bring a divorce suitand would lord coombe dowson burst into open tears and then so did robin she dropped dowsons wrists and threw her arms around her waist clinging to it in piteous repentance no i wont she cried out i oughtnt to try to make you tell me you cant im wicked to you poor dowiedarling dowie i want to kiss you dowie let melet me she sobbed childishly on the comfortable breast and dowie hugged her close and murmured in a choked voice my lamb my pet lamb chapter xix mademoiselle vall and dowson together realized that after this the growing up process was more rapid it always seems incredibly rapid to lookers on after thirteen but these two watchers felt that in robins case it seemed unusually so robin had always been interested in her studies and clever at them but suddenly she developed a new concentration and it was of an order which her governess felt denoted the secret holding of some object in view she devoted herself to her lessons with a quality of determination which was new she had previously been absorbed but not determined she made amazing strides and seemed to aspire to a thoroughness and perfection girls did not commonly aim atespecially at the frequently rather preoccupied hour of blossoming mademoiselle encountered in her an eagerness that shewho knew girlswould have felt it optimistic to expect in most cases she wanted to work over hours she would have read too much if she had not been watched and gently coerced she was not distracted by the society of young people of her own age she indeed showed a definite desire to avoid such companionship what she said to mademoiselle vall one afternoon during a long walk they took together held its own revelation for the older woman they had come upon the two erwyns walking with their attendant in kensington gardens and seeing them at some distance robin asked her companion to turn into another walk i dont want to meet them she said hurriedly i dont think i like girls perhaps its horrid of mebut i dont i dont like those two a few minutes later after they had walked in an opposite direction she said thoughtfully perhaps the kind of girls i should like to know would not like to know me from the earliest days of her knowledge of lord coombe mademoiselle vall had seen that she had no cause to fear lack of comprehension on his part with a perfection of method they searched each others intelligence it had become understood that on such occasions as there was anything she wished to communicate or inquire concerning mr benby in his private room was at mademoiselles service and there his lordship could also be met personally by appointment there have been no explanations mademoiselle vall said to dowson he does not ask to know why i turn to him and i do not ask to know why he cares about this particular child it is taken for granted that is his affair and not mine i am paid well to take care of robin and he knows that all i say and do is part of my taking care of her after the visit of the erwyn children she had a brief interview with coombe in which she made for him a clear sketch it was a sketch of unpleasant little minds avid and curious on somewhat exotic subjects little minds awake to rather common claptrap and gossipy pinchbeck interests yesunpleasant luckless little persons i quite understand they never appeared before they will not appear again thank you mademoiselle he said the little girls did not appear again neither did any others of their type and the fact that feather knew little of other types was a sufficient reason for robins growing up without companions of her own age shes a lonely child after all mademoiselle said she always was answered dowie but shes fond of us bless her heart and it isnt loneliness like it was before we came she is not unhappy she is too blooming and full of life mademoiselle reflected we adore her and she has many interests it is only that she does not know the companionship most young people enjoy perhaps as she has never known it she does not miss it the truth was that if the absence of intercourse with youth produced its subtle effect on her she was not aware of any lack and a certain uncompanioned habit of mind which gave her much time for dreams and thought was accepted by her as a natural condition as simply as her babyhood had accepted the limitations of the day and night nurseries she was not a selfconscious creature but the time came when she became rather disturbed by the fact that people looked at her very often as she walked in the streets sometimes they turned their heads to look after her occasionally one person walking with another would say something quietly to his or her companion and they even paused a moment to turn quite round and look the first few times she noticed this she flushed prettily and said nothing to mademoiselle vall who was generally with her but after her attention had been attracted by the same thing on several different days she said uneasily am i quite tidy mademoiselle quite mademoiselle answeredjust a shade uneasy herself i began to think that perhaps something had come undone or my hat was crooked she explained those two women stared so then two men in a hansom leaned forward and one said something to the other and they both laughed a little mademoiselle hurriedly now there are three young men quite indignantly dont let them see you notice thembut i think it rude they were carelessly joyous and not strictly wellbred youths who were taking a holiday together and their rudeness was quite unintentional and without guile they merely stared and obviously muttered comments to each other as they passed each giving the hasty unconscious touch to his young moustache which is the automatic sign of pleasurable observation in the human male if she had had companions of her own age she would have known all about it long ago mademoiselle was thinking her intelligent view of such circumstances was that the simple fact they arose from couldwith perfect tasteonly be treated simply it was a mere fact therefore why be prudish and affected about it they did not intend any rudeness she said after they had gone by they are not much more than boys and not perfectly behaved people often stare when they see a very pretty girl i am afraid i do it myself you are very pretty quite calmly and as one speaking without prejudice robin turned and looked at her and the colour which was like a jacqueminot rose flooded her face she was at the flushing age her gaze was interested speculative and a shade startledmerely a shade oh she said brieflynot in exclamation exactly but in a sort of acceptance then she looked straight before her and went on walking with the lovely slightly swaying buoyant step which in itself drew attracted eyes after her if i were a model governess such as one read of long before you were born mademoiselle vall continued i should feel it my duty to tell you that beauty counts for nothing but that is nonsense it counts a great dealwith some women it counts for everything such women are not lucky one should thank heaven for it and make the best of it without exaggerated anxiety both dowie and i who love you are grateful to le bon dieu that you are pretty i have sometimes thought i was pretty when i saw myself in the glass said robin with unexcited interest it seemed to me that i looked pretty but at the same time i couldnt help knowing that everything is a matter of taste and that it might be because i was conceited you are not conceited answered the frenchwoman i dont want to be said robin i want to bea serious person withwith a strong character mademoiselles smile was touched with affectionate doubt it had not occurred to her to view this lovely thing in the light of a strong character though after all what exactly was strength she was a warm intensely loving love compelling tender being having seen much of the world and of humanity and inhumanity mademoiselle vall had had moments of being afraid for herparticularly when by chance she recalled the story dowson had told her of the bits of crushed and broken leaves a serious person she said and strong because i must earn my own living said robin i must be strong enough to take care of myself i am going to be a governessor something here it was revealed to mademoiselle as in a flash was the reason why she had applied herself with determination to her studies this had been the object in view for reasons of her own she intended to earn her living with touched interest mademoiselle vall waited wondering if she would be frank about the reason she merely said aloud a governess perhaps there may be something else i can do i might be a secretary or something like that girls and women are beginning to do so many new things her charge explained herself i do not want to besupported and given money i mean i do not wantother peopleto buy my clothes and foodand things the newspapers are full of advertisements i could teach children i could translate business letters very soon i shall be old enough to begin girls in their teens do it she had laid some of her cards on the table but not all poor child she was not going into the matter of her really impelling reasons but mademoiselle vall was not dull and her affection added keenness to her mental observations also she had naturally heard the story of the thorpe lawsuit from dowson inevitably several points suggested themselves to her mrs garethlawless she began reasonably but robin stopped her by turning her face full upon her once more and this time her eyes were full of clear significance she will let me go she said you know she will let me go mademoiselle darling you know she will there was a frank comprehension and finality in the words which made a full revelation of facts mademoiselle herself had disliked even to allow to form themselves into thoughts the child knew all sorts of things and felt all sorts of things she would probably never go into details but she was extraordinarily harrowingly aware she had been learning to be aware for years this had been the secret she had always kept to herself if you are planning this mademoiselle said as reasonably as before we must work very seriously for the next few years how long do you think it will take asked robin she was nearing sixteenbursting into glowing blossoma radiant touching thing whom one only could visualize in flowering gardens in charming enclosing rooms figuratively embraced by every mature and kind arm within reach of her this presented itself before mademoiselle vall with such vividness that it was necessary for her to control a sigh when i feel that you are ready i will tell you she answered and i will do all i can to help youbefore i leave you oh robin gasped in an involuntarily childish way ihadnt thought of that how could i live without youand dowie i know you had not thought of it said mademoiselle affectionately you are only a dear child yet but that will be part of it you know a governess or a secretary or a young lady in an office translating letters cannot take her governess and maid with her oh said robin again and her eyes became suddenly so dewy that the person who passed her at the moment thought he had never seen such wonderful eyes in his life so much of her was still child that the shock of this sudden practical realization thrust the mature and determined part of her being momentarily into the background and she could scarcely bear her alarmed pain it was true that she had been too young to face her plan as she must but after the long walk was over and she found herself in her bedroom again she was conscious of a sense of being relieved of a burden she had been wondering when she could tell mademoiselle and dowie of her determination she had not liked to keep it a secret from them as if she did not love them but it had been difficult to think of a way in which to begin without seeming as if she thought she was quite grown upwhich would have been silly she had not thought of speaking today but it had all come about quite naturally as a result of mademoiselles having told her that she was really very prettyso pretty that it made people turn to look at her in the street she had heard of girls and women who were like that but she had never thought it possible that she she had of course been looked at when she was very little but she had heard andrews say that people looked because she had so much hair and it was like curled silk she went to the dressing table and looked at herself in the glass leaning forward that she might see herself closely the face which drew nearer and nearer had the effect of some tropic flower because it was so alive with colour which seemed to palpitate instead of standing still her soft mouth was warm and brilliant with it and the darkness of her eyes wasas it had always beenlike dew her brow were a slender black velvet line and her lashes made a thick softening shadow she saw they were becoming she cupped her round chin in her hands and studied herself with a desire to be sure of the truth without prejudice or self conceit the whole effect of her was glowing and she felt the glow as others did she put up a finger to touch the velvet petal texture of her skin and she saw how prettily pointed and slim her hand was yes that was prettyand her hairthe way it grew about her forehead and ears and the back of her neck she gazed at her young curve and colour and flame of lifes first beauty with deep curiosity singularly impersonal for her years she liked it she began to be grateful as mademoiselle had said she and dowie were yes if other people liked it there was no use in pretending it would not count if i am going to earn my living she thought with entire gravity it may be good for me if i am a governess it will be useful because children like pretty people and if i am a secretary and work in an office i daresay men like one to be pretty because it is more cheerful she mentioned this to mademoiselle vall who was very kind about it though she looked thoughtful afterwards when a few days later mademoiselle had an interview with coombe in benbys comfortable room he appeared thoughtful also as he listened to her recital of the incidents of the long walk during which her charge had revealed her future plans she is a nice child he said i wish she did not dislike me so much i understand her villain as she thinks me i am not a genuine villain he added with his cold smile but he was saying it to himself not to mademoiselle this she saw butsingularly perhapsshe spoke as if in reply of that i am aware he turned his head slightly with a quick unprepared movement yes he said would your lordship pardon me if i should say that otherwise i should not ask your advice concerning a very young girl he slightly waved his hand i should have known thatif i had thought of it i do know it mademoiselle vall bowed the fact she said that she seriously thinks that perhaps beauty may be an advantage to a young person who applies for work in the office of a man of business because it may seem bright and cheerful to him when he is tired and out of spiritsthat gives one furiously to think yes to me she said it milordwith the eyes of a little dove brooding over her young i could see herlifting them like an angel to some elderly vaurien who would merely think her a born cocotte here coombes rigid face showed thought indeed good god he muttered quite to himself good god in a low breathless voice villain or saint he knew not one world but many we must take care of her he said next she is not an insubordinate child she will do nothing yet i have told her she is not yet ready mademoiselle vall answered i have also promised to tell her when she isand to help her god help her if we do not he said she is on the whole as ignorant as a little sheepand butchers are on the lookout for such as she is they suit them even better than the little things whose tendencies are perverse from birth an old man with an evil character may be able to watch over her from a distance mademoiselle regarded him with grave eyes which took in his tall thin erectness of figure his bearing the perfection of his attire with its unfailing freshness which was not newness do you call yourself an old man milord she asked i am not decrepityears need not bring that was his answer but i believe i became an old man before i was thirty i have grown no olderin that which is really agesince then in the moments silence which followed his glance met mademoiselle valls and fixed itself i am not old enoughor young enoughto be enamoured of mrs garethlawless little daughter he said you need not be told that but you have heard that there are those who amuse themselves by choosing to believe that i am a few light and not too cleanminded fools she admitted without flinching no man can do worse for himself than to explain and deny he responded with a smile at once hard and fine let them continue to believe it chapter xx sixteen passed by with many other things much more disturbing and important to the world than a girls birthday seventeen was gone with passing events more complicated still and increasingly significant but even the owners of the hands hovering over the chessboard which was the map of europe did not keep a watch on all of them as close as might have been kept with advantage girls in their teens are seldom interested in political and diplomatic conditions and robin was not fond of newspapers she worked well and steadily under mademoiselles guidance and her governess realized that she was not losing sight of her plans for self support she was made aware of this by an occasional word or so and also by a certain telepathic union between them little as she cared for the papers the child had a habit of closely examining the advertisements every day she read faithfully the columns devoted to those who want employment or are wanted by employers i look at all the paragraphs which begin wanted a young lady or a young woman or a young person and those which say that a young person or a young woman or a young lady desires a position i want to find out what is oftenest needed she had ceased to be disturbed by the eyes which followed her or opened a little as she passed she knew that nothing had come undone or was crooked and that untidiness had nothing to do with the matter she accepted being looked at as a part of everyday life a certain friendliness and pleasure in most of the glances she liked and was glad of sometimes men of the flushed middleaged or elderly type displeased her by a sort of boldness of manner and gaze but she thought that they were only silly giddy old things who ought to go home to their families and stay with them mademoiselle or dowie was nearly always with her but as she was not a french jeune fille this was not because it was supposed that she could not be trusted out alone but because she enjoyed their affectionate companionship there was one man however whom she greatly disliked as young girls will occasionally dislike a member of the opposite sex for no special reason they can wholly explain to themselves he was an occasional visitor of her mothersa personable young prussian officer of high rank and title he was blonde and military and goodlooking he brought his bearing and manner from the court at berlin and the click of his heels as he brought them smartly together when he made his perfect automatic bow was one of the things robin knew she was reasonless in feeling she detested in him it makes me feel as if he was not merely bowing as a a man who is a gentleman does she confided to mademoiselle vall but as if he had been taught to do it and to call attention to it as if no one had ever known how to do it properly before it is so flourishing in its stiff way that its rather vulgar that is only personal fancy on your part commented mademoiselle i know it is admitted robin but uneasily but that isnt what i dislike in him most its his eyes i suppose they are handsome eyes they are blue and fullrather too full they have a queer swift stareas if they plunged into other peoples eyes and tried to hold them and say something secret all in one second you find yourself getting red and trying to look away i dont said mademoiselle astutelybecause she wanted to hear the rest without asking too many questions robin laughed just a little you have not seen him do it i have not seen him do it myself very often he comes to call onmammashe never said motherwhen he is in london he has been coming for two or three seasons the first time i saw him i was going out with dowie and he was just going upstairs because the hall is so small we almost knocked against each other and he jumped back and made his bow and he stared so that i felt silly and half frightened i was only fifteen then and since then mademoiselle vall inquired when he is here it seems as if i always meet him somewhere twice when frulein hirsch was with me in the square gardens he came and spoke to us i think he must know her he was very grand and condescendingly polite to her as if he did not forget she was only a german teacher and i was only a little girl whose mamma he knew but he kept looking at me until i began to hate him you must not dislike people without reason you dislike lord coombe they both make me creep lord coombe doesnt plunge his eyes into mine but he makes me creep with his fishy coldness i feel as if he were like satan in his still way that is childish prejudice and nonsense perhaps the other is too said robin but they both make me creep nevertheless i would rather die than be obliged to let one of them touch me that was why i would never shake hands with lord coombe when i was a little child you think frulein hirsch knows the baron mademoiselle inquired further i am sure she does several times when she has gone out to walk with me we have met him sometimes he only passes us and salutes but sometimes he stops and says a few words in a stiff magnificent way but he always bores his eyes into mine as if he were finding out things about me which i dont know myself he has passed several times when you have been with me but you may not remember mademoiselle vall chanced however to recall having observed the salute of a somewhat haughty masculine person whose military bearing in itself was sufficient to attract attention so markedly did it suggest the clanking of spurs and accoutrements and the high lift of a breast bearing orders he is count von hillern and i wish he would stay in germany said robin frulein hirsch had not been one of those who returned hastily to her own country giving no warning of her intention to her employers she had remained in london and given her lessons faithfully she was a plain young woman with a large nose and pimpled colourless face and shy eyes and manner robin had felt sure that she stood in awe of the rank and military grandeur of her fellow countryman she looked shyer than ever when he condescended to halt and address her and her chargeso shy indeed that her glances seemed furtive robin guessed that she admired him but was too humble to be at ease when he was near her more than once she had started and turned red and pale when she saw him approaching which had caused robin to wonder if she herself would feel as timid and overpowered by her superiors if she became a governess clearly a man like count von hillern would then be counted among her superiors and she must conduct herself becomingly even if it led to her looking almost stealthy she had on several occasions asked frulein certain questions about governesses she had inquired as to the age at which one could apply for a place as instructress to children or young girls frulein hirsch had begun her career in germany at the age of eighteen she had lived a serious life full of responsibilities at home as one of a large family and she had perhaps been rather mature for her age in england young women who wished for situations answered advertisements and went to see the people who had inserted them in the newspapers she explained sometimes the results were very satisfactory frulein hirsch was very amiable in her readiness to supply information robin did not tell her of her intention to find work of some sortprobably governessingbut the young german woman was possessed of a mind made in germany and was quite well aware of innumerable things her charge did not suspect her of knowing one of the things she knew best was that the girl was a child she was not a child herself and she was an abjectly bitter and wretched creature who had no reason for hope she lived in small lodgings in a street off abbey road and in a drawer in her dressing table she kept hidden a photograph of a prussian officer with cropped blond head and handsome prominent blue eyes arrogantly gazing from beneath heavy lids which drooped he was of the type the german woman young and slim or mature and stout privately worships as a god whose relation to any woman can only be that of a modern jove stooping to command service in his teens he had become accustomed to the female eye which lifts itself adoringly or casts the furtively excited glance of admiration or appeal it was the way of mere nature that it should be sothe wise provision of a masculine god whose world was created for the supply and pleasure of males especially males of the prussian army whose fixed intention it was to dominate the world and teach it obedience to such a man so thoroughly well trained in the comprehension of the power of his own rank and values a young woman such as frulein hirschsubservient and without beautywas an unconsidered object to be as little regarded as the pavement upon which one walks the pavement had its uses and such women had theirs they could at least obey the orders of those heaven had placed above them and if they showed docility and intelligence might be re warded by a certain degree of approval a presumption which would have dared to acknowledge to the existence of the hidden photograph could not have been encompassed by the being of frulein hirsch she was in truth secretly enslaved by a burning secret heartwringing passion which sometimes as she lay on her hard bed at night forced from her thin chest hopeless sobs which she smothered under the bedclothes figuratively she would have licked the boots of her conquering god if he would have looked at herjust lookedas if she were human but such a thing could not have occurred to him he did not even think of her as she thought of herself torturinglyas not young not in any degree goodlooking not geboren not even female he did not think of her at all except as one of those born to serve in such manner as their superiors commanded she was in england under orders because she was unobtrusive looking enough to be a safe person to carry on the work she had been given to do she was cleverer than she looked and could accomplish certain things without attracting any attention whatsoever von hillern had given her instructions now and then which had made it necessary for him to see and talk to her in various places the fact that she had before her the remote chance of seeing him by some chance gave her an object in life it was enough to be allowed to stand or sit for a short time near enough to have been able to touch his sleeve if she had had the mad audacity to do it to quail before his magnificent glance to hear his voice to almost touch his strong white hand when she gave him papers to see that he deigned sometimes to approve of what she had done to assure him of her continued obedience with servile politeness she was not a nice woman or a good one and she had from her birth accepted her place in her world with such finality that her desires could not at any time have been of an elevated nature if he had raised a haughty hand and beckoned to her she would have followed him like a dog under any conditions he chose to impose but he did not raise his hand and never would because she had no attractions whatsoever and this she knew so smothered her sobs in her bed at night or lay awake fevered with anticipation when there was a vague chance that he might need her for some reason and command her presence in some deserted park or country road or cheap hotel where she could take rooms for the night as if she were a passing visitor to london one nightshe had taken cheap lodgings for a week in a side street in obedience to ordershe came in about nine oclock dressed in a manner whose object was to dull the effect of his grandeur and cause him to look as much like an ordinary englishman as possible but when the door was closed and he stood alone in the room with her she saw with the blissful pangs of an abjectly adoring woman that he automatically resumed his magnificence of bearing his badly fitting overcoat removed he stood erect and drawn to his full height so dominating the small place and her idolatrously cringing being that her heart quaked within her oh to dare to cast her unloveliness at his feet if it were only to be trampled upon and die there no small sense of humour existed in her brain to save her from her pathetic idiocy romantic humility and touching sacrifice to the worshipped one were the ideals she had read of in verse and song all her life only through such servitude and sacrifice could woman gain mans loveand even then only if she had beauty and the gifts worthy of her idols acceptance it was really his unmitigated arrogance she worshipped and crawled upon her poor largejointed knees to adore her education her very religion itself had taught that it was the sign of his nobility and martial high breeding even the women of his own class believed something of the same sortthe more romantic and sentimental of them rather enjoying being mastered by it to frulein hirschs mental vision he was a sublimated and more dazzling german rochester and she herself a more worthy because more submissive jane eyre ach gott his highheld cropped headhis so beautiful white handshis proud eyes which deigned to look at her from their drooping lids his presence filled the shabby room with the atmosphere of a palace he asked her a few questions he required from her certain notes she had made without wasting a word or glance he gave her in detail certain further orders he stood by the table and it was therefore necessary that she should approach himshould even stand quite near that she might see clearly a sketch he made hastilyimmediately afterwards tearing it into fragments and burning it with a match she was obliged to stand so near him that her skirt brushed his trouser leg his nearness and a vague scent of cigar smoke mingled with the suggestion of some masculine soap or essence were so poignant in their effect that she trembled and water rose in her eyes in factand despite her terrified effort to control it a miserable tear fell on her cheek and stood there because she dared not wipe it away because he realized with annoyance that she was trembling he cast a cold inquiring glance at her and saw the tear then he turned away and resumed his examination of her notes he was not here to make inquiries as to whether a sheep of a woman was crying or had merely a cold in her head ach grovelled poor hirsch in her secret soulhis patrician control of outward expression and his indifference to all small and paltry things it was part not only of his aristocratic breeding but of the splendour of his military training it was his usual custom to leave her at once when the necessary formula had been gone through tonightshe scarcely dared to believe ithe seemed to have some reason for slight delay he did not sit down or ask frulein hirsch to do sobut he did not at once leave the room he lighted a quite marvellous cigardeigning a slight wave of the admired hand which held it designating that he asked permission oh if she dared have darted to him with a match he stood upon the hearth and asked a casualsounding question or so regarding her employer her household her acquaintances her habits the sole link between them was the asking of questions and the giving of private information and therefore the matter of taste in such matters did not count as a factor he might ask anything and she must answer perhaps it was necessary for her to seek some special knowledge among the guests mrs garethlawless received but training having developed in her alertness of mind led her presently to see that it was not mrs garethlawless he was chiefly interested inbut a member of her familythe very small family which consisted of herself and her daughter it was robin he was enclosing in his network of questions and she had seen him look at robin when he had passed or spoken to them an illuminating flash brought back to her that he had cleverly found out from her when they were to walk together and where they were to go she had not been quick enough to detect this before but she saw it now girls who looked like thatyes but it could not beserious an english girl of such familywith such a mother a momentary caprice such as all young men of his class amused themselves with and forgotbut nothing permanent it would not indeed be approved in those high places where obedience was the first commandment of the decalogue but he did not go he even descended a shade from his inaccessible plane it was not difficult for him to obtain details of the odd loneliness of the girls position frulein hirsch was quite ready to explain that in spite of the easy morals and leniency of rank and fashion in england she was a sort of little outcast from sacred inner circles there were points she burned to make clear to him and she made them so she was in secret fiercely desirous that he should realize to the utmost that whatsoever rashness this young flame of loveliness inspired in him it was not possible that he could regard it with any shadow of serious intention she had always disliked the girl and now her weak mildness and humility suddenly transformed themselves into something elsea sort of maternal wolfishness it did not matter what happened to the girland whatsoever befell or did not befall her shemathilde hirschcould neither gain nor lose hope through it but if she did not displease him and yet saved him from final disaster he would perhaps be grateful to herand perhaps speak with approvalor remember itand his noble mother most certainly wouldif she ever knew but behind and under and through all these specious reasonings was the hot choking burn of the mad jealousy only her type of luckless woman can knowand of whose colour she dare not show the palest hint i have found out that for some reason she thinks of taking a place as governess she said suggest that she go to berlin there are good places there was his answer if she should go her mother will not feel any anxiety about her returned frulein hirsch if then some young man she meets in the street makes love to her and they run away together she will not be pursued by her relatives frulein hirschs flat mouth looked rather malicious her mother is too busy to pursue her and there is no one elseunless it were lord coombe who is said to want her himself von hillern shrugged his fine shoulders at his age after the mother that is like an englishman upon this frulein hirsch drew a step nearer and fixed her eyes upon his as she had never had the joy of fixing them before in her life she dared it now because she had an interesting story to tell him which he would like to hear it was like an englishman lord coombe had the character of being one of the worst among them but was too subtle and clever to openly offend people it was actually said that he was educating the girl and keeping her in seclusion and that it was probably his colossal intention to marry her when she was old enough he had no heir of his ownand he must have beauty and innocence innocence and beauty his viciousness would have pah exclaimed von hillern it is youth which requires such thingsand takes them that is all imbecile london gossip no he would not run after her if she ran away he is a proud man and he knows he would be laughed at and he could not get her back from a young manwho was her lover her lover how it thrilled the burning heart her poor flat chest panted above with what triumphant knowledge of such things he said it no he could not she answered her eyes still on his no one could he laughed a little confidently but almost with light indifference if she were missing no particular search would be made then he said she is pretty enough to suit berlin he seemed to think pleasantly of something as he stood still for a moment his eyes on the floor when he lifted them there was in their blue a hint of ugly exulting though mathilde hirsch did not think it ugly he spoke in a low voice it will be an excitinga colossal day when we come to londonas we shall it will be as if an ocean had collected itself into one huge mountain of a wave and swept in and overwhelmed everything there will be confusion then and the rushing up of untrained soldiersand shoutsand yells and zeppelins dropping bombs she so far forgot herself as to pant out and buildings crashing and pavements and people smashed westminster and the palaces rocking and fat fools running before bayonets he interrupted her with a short laugh uglier than the gleam in his eyes he was a trifle excited and all the women running about screaming and trying to hide and being pulled out we can take any of their pretty little high nosed women we chooseany of them yes she answered biting her lip no one would take her she knew he put on his overcoat and prepared to leave her as he stood at the door before opening it he spoke in his usual tone of mere command take her to kensington gardens tomorrow afternoon he said sit in one of the seats near the round pond and watch the children sailing their boats i shall not be there but you will find yourself near a quiet elegant woman in mourning who will speak to you you are to appear to recognize her as an old acquaintance follow her suggestions in everything after this he was gone and she sat down to think it over chapter xxi she saw him again during the following week and was obliged to tell him that she had not been able to take her charge to kensington gardens on the morning that he had appointed but that as the girl was fond of the place and took pleasure in watching the children sailing their boats on the round pond it would be easy to lead her there he showed her a photograph of the woman she would find sitting on a particular bench and he required she should look at it long enough to commit the face to memory it was that of a quietly elegant woman with gentle eyes she will call herself lady etynge he said you are to remember that you once taught her little girl in paris there must be no haste and no mistakes it be well for them to meetby accidentseveral times later he aid to her when lady etynge invites her to go to her house you will of course go with her you will not stay lady etynge will tell you what to do in words he did not involve himself by giving any hint of his intentions so far as expression went he might have had none whatever her secret conclusion was that he knew if he could see the girl under propitious circumstancesat the house of a clever and sympathetic acquaintance he need have no shadow of a doubt as to the result of his efforts to please her he knew she was a lonely romantic creature who had doubtless read sentimental books and been allured by their heroes she was of course just ripe for young peerings into the land of love making his had been no peerings thought the pale hirsch sadly what girlor womancould resist the alluring demand of his drooping eyes if he chose to allow warmth to fill them thinking of it she almost gnashed her teeth did she not see how he would look bending his high head and murmuring to a woman who shook with joy under his gaze had she not seen it in her own forlorn hopeless dreams what did it matter if what the world calls disaster befell the girl frulein hirsch would not have called it disaster any woman would have been paid a thousand times over his fancy might last a few months perhaps he would take her to berlinor to some lovely secret spot in the mountains where he could visit her what heavenwhat heaven she wept hiding her face on her hot dry hands but it would not last longand he would again think only of the immense workthe august machine of which he was a mechanical partand he would be obliged to see and talk to her mathilde hirsch having forgotten the rest she could only hold herself decently in check by telling herself again and again that it was only natural that such things should come and go in his magnificent life and that the sooner it began the sooner it would end it was a lovely morning when her pupil walked with her in kensington gardens and quite naturally strolled towards the round pond robin was happy because there were flutings of birds in the air gardeners were stuffing crocuses and hyacinths into the flower beds there were little sweet scents floating about and so it was spring she pulled a bare looking branch of a lilac bush towards her and stooped and kissed the tiny brown buttons upon it half shyly i cant help it when i see the first ones swelling on the twigs they are working so hard to break out into green she said one loves everything at this timeeverything look at the children round the pond that fat little boy in a reefer and brown leather leggings is bursting with joy let us go and praise his boat frulein they went and robin praised the boat until its owner was breathless with rapture frulein hirsch standing near her looked furtively at all the benches round the circle giving no incautiously interested glance to any one of them in particular presently however she said i think that is lady etynge sitting on the third bench from here i said to you that i had heard she was in london i wonder if her daughter is still in the convent at tours when robin returned she saw a quiet woman in perfect mourning recognize frulein hirsch with a a bow and smile which seemed to require nearer approach we must go and speak to her frulein hirsch said i know she wil wish me to present you she is fond of young girlsbecause of hlne robin went forward prettily the woman was gentle looking and attracting she had a sweet manner and was very kind to frulein hirsch she seemed to know her well and to like her her daughter hlne was still in the convent at tours but was expected home very shortly she would be glad to find that frulein hirsch was in london i have turned the entire top story of my big house into a pretty suite for her she has a fancy for living high above the street smiled lady etynge indulgently perhaps she was a mother person robin thought both her looks and talk were kind and she was very nice in her sympathetic interest in the boats and the childrens efforts to sail them i often bring my book here and forget to read because i find i am watching them she said they are so eager and so triumphant when a boat gets across the pond she went away very soon and robin watched her out of sight with interest they saw her again a few days later and talked a little more she was not always near the pond when they came and they naturally did not go there each time they walked together though frulein hirsch was fond of sitting and watching the children she had been to take tea with her former employer she told robin one day and she was mildly excited by the preparations for hlne who had been educated entirely in a french convent and was not like an english girl at all she had always been very delicate and the nuns seemed to know how to take care of her and calm her nerves with their quiet ways her mother is rather anxious about her coming to london she has of course no young friends here and she is so used to the quiet of convent life the frulein explained that is why the rooms at the top of the house have been arranged for her she will hear so little sound i confess i am anxious about her myself lady etynge is wondering if she can find a suitable young companion to live in the house with her she must be a young lady and perfectly educatedand with brightness and charm not a person like myself but one who can be treated as an equal and a friendalmost a playmate it would be an agreeable position commented robin thoughtfully extremely so answered frulein hirsch hlne is a most lovable and affectionate girl and lady etynge is rich enough to pay a large salary hlne is her idol the suite of rooms is perfect in germany girls are not spoiled in that way it is not considered good for them it was quite natural since she felt an interest in hlne that on their next meeting robin should find pleasure in sitting on the green bench near the girls mother and hear her speak of her daughter she was not diffuse or intimate in her manner hlne first appeared in the talk as a result of a polite inquiry made by frulein hirsch robin gathered as she listened that this particular girl was a tenderly loved and cared for creature and was herself gentle and intelligent and loving she sounded like the kind of a girl one would be glad to have for a friend robin wondered and wonderedif she would do perhaps out of tactful consideration for the feelings of frulein hirsch who would not dobecause she was neither bright nor pretty nor a girllady etynge touched but lightly on her idea that she might find a sort of sublimated young companion for her daughter it would be difficult to advertise for what one wants she said yes to state that a girl must be clever and pretty and graceful and attractive would make it difficult for a modest young lady to write a suitable reply said frulein hirsch grimly and both lady etynge and robin smiled among your own friends lady etynge said to robin a little pathetically in her yearning do you know of anyonewho might know of anyone who would fit in sometimes there are poor little cousins you know or girls who have an independent spirit and would like to support themselves said the frulein there are such girls in these advanced times i am afraid i dont know anyone answered robin modesty also prevented her from saying that she thought she did she herself was well educated she was good tempered and well bred and she had known for some time that she was pretty perhaps frulein hirsch may bring you in to have tea with me some afternoon when you are out lady etynge said kindly before she left them i think you would like to see hlnes rooms i should be glad to hear what another girl thinks of them robin was delighted perhaps this was a way opening to her she talked to mademoiselle vall about it and so glowed with hope that mademoiselles heart was moved do you think i might go she said do you think there is any chance that i might be the right person am i nice enoughand well enough educated and are my manners good she did not know exactly where lady etynge lived but believed it was one of those big houses in a certain dignified place they both knewa corner house she was sure becauseby mere chanceshe had one day seen lady etynge go into such a house as if it were her own she did not know the number but they could ask frulein frulein hirsch was quite ready with detail concerning her former patroness and her daughter she obviously admired them very much her manner held a touch of respectful reverence she described hlnes disposition and delicate nerves and the perfection of the nuns treatment of her she described the beauty of the interior of the house its luxury and convenience and the charms of the suite of apartments prepared for hlne she thought the number of the house was no a lady etynge was the kindest employer she had ever had she believed that miss garethlawless and hlne would be delighted with each other if they met and her impression was that lady etynge privately hoped they would become friends her mild flat face was so modestly amiable that mademoiselle vall who always felt her unattractive femininity pathetic was a little moved by her evident pleasure in having been the humble means of providing robin with acquaintances of an advantageous kind no special day had been fixed upon for the visit and the cup of tea robin was eager in secret and hoped lady etynge would not forget to remind them of her invitation she did not forget one afternoonthey had not seen her for several days and had not really expected to meet her because they took their walk later than usualthey found her just rising from her seat to go home as they appeared our little encounters almost assume the air of appointments she said this is very nice but i am just going away i am sorry to say i wonder she paused a moment and then looked at frulein hirsch pleasantly i wonder if in about an hour you would bring miss garethlawless to me to have tea and tell me if she thinks hlne will like her new rooms you said you would like to see them brightly to robin you are very kind i should like it so much was robins answer frulein hirsch was correctly appreciative of the condescension shown to her her manner was the perfection of the exact shade of unobtrusive chaperonship there was no improper suggestion of a mistaken idea that she was herself a guest or indeed anything in fact but a proper appendage to her charge robin had never been fond of frulein as she was fond of mademoiselle and dowie still she was not only an efficient teacher but also a good walker and very fond of long tramps which mademoiselle was really not strong enough for but which robins slender young legs rejoiced in the two never took cabs or buses but always walked everywhere they walked on this occasion and about an hour later arrived at a large corner house in berford place a tall and magnificently built footman opened the door for them and they were handed into a drawing room much grander than the one robin sometimes glanced into as she passed it when she was at home a quite beautiful tea equipage awaited them on a small table but lady etynge was not in the room what a beautiful house to live in said robin but do you know the number isnt a i looked as we came in and it is no is it i ought to have been more careful answered frulein hirsch it is wrong to be careless even in small matters almost immediately lady etynge came in and greeted them with a sort of gentle delight she drew robin down on to a sofa beside her and took her hand and gave it a light pat which was a caress now you really are here she said i have been so busy that i have been afraid i should not have time to show you the rooms before it was too late to make a change if you thought anything might be improved i am sure nothing can improve them said robin more dewyeyed than usual and even a thought breathless because this was really a sort of adventure and she longed to ask if by any chance she would do and she was so afraid that she might lose this amazingly good opportunity merely because she was too young and inexperienced to know how she ought to broach the subject she had not thought yet of asking mademoiselle vall how it should be done she was not aware that she looked at lady etynge with a heavenly little unconscious appeal which made her enchanting lady etynge looked at her quite fixedly for an instant what a child you are and what a colour your cheeks and lips are she said you are muchmuch prettier than hlne my dear she got up and brought a picture from a side table to show it to her i think she is lovely she said is it became i am her mother oh no not because you are her mother exclaimed robin she is angelic she was rather angelic with her delicate uplifted face and her communion veil framing it mistily the picture was placed near them and robin looked at is many times as they took their tea to be a companion to a girl with a face like that would be almost too much to ask of ones luck there was actual yearning in robins heart suddenly she realized that she had missed something all her life without knowing that she missed it it was the friendly nearness of youth like her own how she hoped that she might make lady etynge like her after tea was over lady etynge spoke pleasantly to frulein hirsch i know that you wanted to register a letter there is a postoffice just around the corner would you like to go and register it while i take miss garethlawless upstairs you have seen the rooms you will only be away a few minutes frulein hirsch was respectfully appreciative again the letter really was important it contained money which she sent monthly to her parents this month she was rather late and she would be very glad to be allowed to attend to the matter without losing a post so she went out of the drawingroom and down the stairs and robin heard the front door close behind her with a slight thud she had evidently opened and closed it herself without waiting for the footman the upper rooms in london houseseven in the large onesare usually given up to servants bedrooms nurseries and school rooms stately staircases become narrower as they mount and the climber gets glimpses of apartments which are frequently bare whatsoever their use and if not grubby in aspect are dull and uninteresting but in lady etynges house it was plain that a good deal had been done stairs had been altered and widened walls had been given fresh and delicate tints and one laid ones hand on cream white balustrades and trod on soft carpets a good architect had taken interest in the problems presented to him and the result was admirable partitions must have been removed to make rooms larger and of better shape nothing could be altered without spoiling it exclaimed robin standing in the middle of a sitting room all freshness and exquisite colourthe very pictures on the wall being part of the harmony all that a girl would want or love was there there was nothing left undoneunremembered the soft chesterfield lounge which was not too big and was placed near the fire the writing table the books the piano of satinwood inlaid with garlands the lamp to sit and read by how glad she must be to come back to anyone who loves her so said robin here was a quilted basket with three persian kittens purring in it and she knelt and stroked their fluffiness bending her slim neck and showing how prettily the dark hair grew up from it it was perhaps that at which lady etynge was looking as she stood behind her and watched her the girlnymph slenderness and flexibility of her leaning body was almost touchingly lovely there were several other rooms and each one was in its way more charming than the other a library in dresden blue and white and with peculiarly pretty windows struck the last note of cosiness all the rooms had pretty windows with rather small square panes enclosed in white frames it was when she was in this room that robin took her courage in her hands she must not let her chance go by lady etynge was so kind she wondered if it would seem gauche and too informal to speak now she stood quite upright and still though her voice was not quite steady when she began lady etynge she said you remember what frulein hirsch said about girls who wish to support themselves ii am one of them i want very much to earn my own living i think i am well educated i have been allowed to read a good deal and my teachers mademoiselle vall and frulein hirsch say i speak and write french and german well for an english girl if you thought i could be a suitable companion for miss etynge ishould be very happy how curiously lady etynge watched her as she spoke she did not look displeased but there was something in her face which made robin afraid that she was perhaps after all not the girl who was fortunate enough to quite do she felt her hopes raised a degree however when lady etynge smiled at her do you know i feel that is very pretty of you she said it quite delights meas i am an idolizing motherthat my mere talk of hlne should have made you like her well enough to think you might care to live with her and i confess i am modern enough to be pleased with your wishing to earn your own living i must said robin i must i could not bear not to earn it she spoke a little suddenly and a flag of new colour fluttered in her cheek when hlne comes you must meet if you like each other as i feel sure you will and if mrs garethlawless does not objectif it remains only a matter of being suitableyou are suitable my dearyou are suitable she touched robins hand with the light pat which was a caress and the child was radiant oh you are kind to me the words broke from her involuntarily and it is such good fortune thank you thank you lady etynge the flush of her joy and relief had not died out before the footman who had opened the door appeared on the threshold he was a handsome young fellow whose eyes were not as professionally impassive as his face a footman had no right to dart a swift side look at one as people did in the street he did dart such a glance robin saw and she was momentarily struck by its being one of those she sometimes objected to otherwise his manner was without flaw he had only come to announce to his mistress the arrival of a caller when lady etynge took the card from the salver her expression changed she even looked slightly disturbed oh i am sorry she murmured i must see her lifting her eyes to robin it is an old friend merely passing through london how wicked of me to forget that she wrote to say that she might dash in at any hour please pled robin prettily i can run away at once frulein hirsch must have come back please the lady asked me particularly to say that she has only a few minutes to stay as she is catching a train the footman decorously ventured if that is the case lady etynge said even relievedly i will leave you here to look at things until i come back i really want to talk to you a little more about yourself and hlne i cant let you go she looked back from the door before she passed through it amuse yourself my dear and then she added hastily to the man have you remembered that there was something wrong with the latch william see if it needs a locksmith very good my lady she was gone and robin stood by the sofa thrilled with happiness and relief how wonderful it was that through mere lucky chance she had gone to watch the children sailing their boats and that frulein hirsch had seen lady etynge what good luck and how grateful she was the thought which passed through her mind was like a little prayer of thanks how strange it would be to be really intimate with a girl like herselfor rather like hlne it made her heart beat to think of it how wonderful it would be if hlne actually loved her and she loved hlne something sprang out of some depths of her being where past things were hidden the something was a deadly little memory donal donal it would beif she loved hlne and hlne loved heras new a revelation as donal oh she remembered she heard the footman doing something to the latch of the door which caused it to make a clicking sound he was obeying orders and examining it as she involuntarily glanced at him hebending over the door handleraised his eyes sideways and glanced at her it was an inexcusable glance from a domestic because it was actually as if he were taking the liberty of privately summing her uptaking her points in for his own entertainment she so resented the unprofessional bad manners of it that she turned away and sauntered into the dresden blue and white library and sat down with a book she was quite relieved when only a few minutes later he went away having evidently done what he could the book she had picked up was a new novel and opened with an attentionarresting agreeableness which led her on in fact it led her on further and for a longer time than she was aware of it was her way to become wholly absorbed in books when they allured her she forgot her surroundings and forgot the passing of time this was a new book by a strong man with the gift which makes alive people places things the ones whose lives had taken possession of his being in this story were throbbing with vital truth she read on and on because from the first page she knew them as actual pulsating human creatures they looked into her face they laughed she heard their voices she cared for every trivial thing that happened to themto any of them if one of them picked a flower she saw how he or she held it and its scent was in the air having been so drawn on into a sort of unconsciousness of all else it was inevitable that when she suddenly became aware that she did not see her page quite clearly she should withdraw her eyes from her page and look about her as she did so she started from her comfortable chair in amazement and some alarm the room had become so much darker that it must be getting late how careless and silly she had been where was frulein hirsch i am only a strange girl and lady etynge might so easily have forgotten me passed through her mind her friend may have stayed and they may have had so much to talk about that of coarse i was forgotten but frulein hirschhow could she then remembering the subservient humility of the fruleins mind she wondered if it could have been possible that she had been too timid to do more than sit waitingin the hall perhapsafraid to allow the footman to disturb lady etynge by asking her where her pupil was the poor meek silly thing i must get away without disturbing anyone she thought i will slip downstairs and snatch frulein hirsch from her seat and we will go quietly out i can write a nice note to lady etynge tomorrow and explain i hope she wont mind having forgotten me i must make her feel sure that it did not matter in the least ill tell her about the book she replaced the book on the shelf from which she had taken it and passed through into the delightful sitting room the kittens were playing together on the hearth having deserted their basket one of them gave a soft airy pounce after her and caught at her dress with tiny claws rolling over and over after his ineffectual snatch she had not heard the footman close the door when he left the room but she found he must have done so as it was now shut when she turned the handle it did not seem to work well because the door did not open as it ought to have done she turned it again and gave it a little pull but it still remained tightly shut she turned it again still with no result and then she tried the small latch perhaps the man had done some blundering thing when he had been examining it she remembered hearing several clicks she turned the handle again and again there was no key in the keyhole so he could not have bungled with the key she was quite aghast at the embarrassment of the situation how can i get out without disturbing anyone if i cannot open the door she said how stupid i shall seem to lady etynge she wont like it a girl who could forget where she wasand then not be able to open a door and be obliged to bang until people come suddenly she remembered that there had been a door in the bedroom which had seemed to lead out into the hall she ran into the room in such a hurry that all three kittens ran frisking after her she saw she had not been mistaken there was a door she went to it and turned the handle breathless with excitement and relief but the handle of that door also would not open it neither would the latch and there was no key oh she gasped oh then she remembered the electric bell near the fireplace in the sitting room there was one by the fireplace here also no she would ring the one in the sitting room she went to it and pressed the button she could not hear the ghost of a sound and one could generally hear something like one she rang again and waited the room was getting darker oh how could frulein hirschhow could she she waitedshe waited fifteen minutes by her little watchtwenty minutesand in their passing she rang again she rang the bell in the library and the one in the bedroomeven the one in the bathroom lest some might be out of order she slowly ceased to be embarrassed and selfreproachful and began to feel afraid though she did not know quite what she was afraid of she went to one of the windows to look at her watch again in the vanishing light and saw that she had been ringing the bells for an hour she automatically put up a hand and leaned against the white frame of one of the decorative small panes of glass as she touched it she vaguely realized that it was of such a solidity that it felt not like wood but iron she drew her hand away quickly feeling a sweep of unexplainable fearyes it was fear and why should she so suddenly feel it she went back to the door and tried again to open itas ineffectively as before then she began to feel a little cold and sick she returned to the chesterfield and sat down on it helplessly it seems as ifi had been locked in she broke out in a faint bewildered wail of a whisper oh whydid they lock the doors chapter xxii she had known none of the absolute horrors of life which were possible in that underworld which was not likely to touch her own existence in any form why had argued mademoiselle vall should one fill a white young mind with ugly images which would deface with dark marks and smears and could only produce unhappiness and perhaps morbid broodings one does not feel it is wise to give a girl an education in crime one would not permit her to read the newgate calendar for choice she will be protected by those who love her and what she must discover she will discover that is life which was why her first discovery that neither door could be opened did not at once fill her with horror her first arguments were merely those of a girl who though her brain was not inactive pulp had still a protected girls outlook she had been overwhelmed by a sense of the awkwardness of her position and by the dread that she would be obliged to disturb and almost inevitably embarrass and annoy lady etynge of course there had been some bungling on the part of the impudent footmanperhaps actually at the moment when he had given his sidelong leer at herself instead of properly attending to what he was trying to do that the bedroom was locked might be the result of a dozen ordinary reasons the first hint of an abnormality of conditions came after she had rung the bells and had waited in vain for response to her summons there were servants whose business it was to answer bells at once if all the bells were out of order why were they out of order when hlne was to return in a few days and her apartment was supposed to be complete even to the kittenseven to the kittens it seems as if i had been locked in she had whispered to the silence of the room why did they lock the doors then she said and her heart began to thump and race in her side it has been done on purpose they dont intend to let me outfor some horrible reason perhaps even her own growing panic was not so appalling as a sudden rushing memory of lady etynge which at this moment overthrew her lady etynge lady etynge she saw her gentle face and almost affectionately watching eyes she heard her voice as she spoke of hlne she felt the light pat which was a caress no no she gasped it because her breath had almost left her no no she couldnt no one could there is nothing as wickedas that bat even as she cried out the overthrow was utter and she threw herself forward on the arm of the couch and sobbedsobbed with the passion she had only known on the day long ago when she had crawled into the shrubs and groveled in the earth it was the same kind of passionthe shaken and heartriven woe of a creature who has trusted and hoped joyously and has been forever betrayed the face and eyes had been so kind the voice so friendly oh how could even the wickedest girl in the world have doubted their sincerity unfortunatelyor fortunatelyshe knew nothing whatever of the mental processes of the wicked girls of the world which was why she lay broken to pieces sobbingsobbing not at the moment because she was a trapped thing but because lady etynge had a face in whose gentleness her heart had trusted and rejoiced when she sat upright again her own face as she lifted it would have struck a perceptive onlooker as being as it were the face of another girl it was tearstained and wild but this was not the cause of its change the soft bird eyes were differentsuddenly amazingly older than they had been when she had believed in hlne she had no experience which could reveal to her in a moment the monstrousness of her danger but all she had ever read or vaguely gathered of law breakers and marauders of society collected itself into an advancing tidal wave of horror she rose and went to the window and tried to open it but it was not intended to open the decorative panes were of small size and of thick glass her first startled impression that the white framework seemed to be a painted metal was apparently founded on fact a strong person might have bent it with a hammer but he could not have broken it she examined the windows in the other rooms and they were of the same structure they are made like that she said to herself stonily to prevent people from getting out she stood at the front one and looked down into the broad stately place it was a long way to look down and even if the window could be opened ones voice would not be heard the street lamps were lighted and a few people were to be seen walking past unhurriedly in the big house almost opposite they are going to give a party there is a red carpet rolled out carriages are beginning to drive up and here on the top floor there is a girl locked upand they dont know she said it aloud and her voice sounded as though it were not her own it was a dreadful voice and as she heard it panic seized her nobody knewnobody her mother never either knew or cared where she was but dowie and mademoiselle always knew they would be terrified frulein hirsch had perhaps been told that her pupil had taken a cab and gone home and she would return to her lodgings thinking she was safe thenonly at this moment and with a suddenness which produced a sense of shockshe recalled that it was frulein hirsch who had presented her to lady etynge frulein hirsch herself it was she who had said she had been in her employ and had taught hlnehlne it was she who had related anecdotes about the convent at tours and the nuns who were so wise and kind robins hand went up to her forehead with a panicstricken gesture frulein hirsch had made an excuse for leaving her with lady etyngeto be brought up to the top of the house quite aloneand locked in frulein hirsch had known and there came back to her the memory of the furtive eyes whose sly adoring sidelooks at count von hillern had alwaysthough she had tried not to feel itbeen somehow glances she had dislikedyes disliked it was hereby the thread of frulein hirschthat count von hillern was drawn into her mind once there it was as if he stood near herquite closelooking down under his heavy drooping lids with stealthy plunging eyes it had always been when frulein hirsch had walked with her that they had met himalmost as if by arrangement there were only two people in the world who mightbecause she herself had so hated themdislike and choose in some way to punish her one was count von hillern the other was lord coombe lord coombe she knew was bad vicious did the things people only hinted at without speaking of them plainly a sense of instinctive revolt in the strength of her antipathy to von hillern made her feel that he must be of the same order if either of them came into this room now and locked the door behind him i could not get out she heard herself say it aloud in the strange girls dreadful voice as she had heard herself speak of the party in the big house opposite she put her soft slim hand up to her soft slim throat i could not get out she repeated she ran to the door and began to beat on its panels by this time she knew it would be no use and yet she beat with her hands until they were bruised and then she snatched up a book and beat with that she thought she must have been beating half an hour when she realized that someone was standing outside in the corridor and the someone said in a voice she recognized as belonging to the leering footman may as well keep still miss you cant hammer it down and no ones going to bother taking any notice and then his footsteps retired down the stairs she involuntarily clenched her hurt hands and the shuddering began again though she stood in the middle of the room with a rigid body and her head thrown fiercely back if there are people in the world as hideousand monstrous as thislet them kill me if they want to i would rather be killed than live they would have to kill me and she said it in a frenzy of defiance of all mad and base things on earth her peril seemed to force her thought to delve into unknown dark places in her memory and dig up horrors she had forgottennewspaper stories of crime old melodramas and mystery romances in which people disappeared and were long afterwards found buried under floors or in cellars it was said that the berford place houses winch were old ones had enormous cellars under them perhaps other girls have disappeared and now are buried in the cellars she thought and the dreadful young voice added aloud because they would have to kill me one of the persian kittens curled up in the basket wakened because he heard it and stretched a sleepy paw and mewed at her coombe house was one of the old ones wearing somewhat the aspect of a stately barrack with a fine entrance its court was enclosed at the front by a stone wall outside which passing london roared in low tumult the court was surrounded by a belt of shrubs strong enough to defy the rain of soot which fell quietly upon them day and night the streets were already lighted for the evening when mademoiselle vall presented herself at the massive front door and asked for lord coombe the expression of her face and a certain intensity of manner caused the seriouslooking head servant who wore no livery to come forward instead of leaving her to the footmen his lordship engaged witha business personand must not be disturbed he said he is also going out he will see me replied mademoiselle vall if you give him this card he will see me she was a plainly dressed woman but she had a manner which removed her entirely from the class of those who merely came to importune there was absolute certainty in the eyes she fixed with steadiness on the mans face he took her card though he hesitated if he does not see me she added he will be very much displeased will you come in maam and take a seat for a moment he ventured i will inquire the great hall was one of londons most celebrated a magnificent staircase swept up from it to landings whose walls were hung with tapestries the world knew in a gilded chair like a throne mademoiselle vall sat and waited but she did not wait long the seriouslooking man without livery returned almost immediately he led mademoiselle into a room like a sort of study or apartment given up to business matters mademoiselle vall had never seen lord coombes ceremonial evening effect more flawless tall thin and finely straight he waited in the centre of the room he was evidently on the point of going out and the lighttextured satinlined overcoat he had already thrown on revealed through a suggestion of being winged that he wore in his lapel a delicately fresh creamcoloured carnation a respectable middleclass looking man with a steady bluntfeatured face had been talking to him and stepped quietly aside as mademoiselle entered there seemed to be no question of his leaving the room coombe met his visitor half way something has alarmed you very much he said robin went out with frulein hirsch this afternoon she said quickly they went to kensington gardens they have not come backand it is nine oclock they are always at home by six will you sit down he said the man with the steady face was listening intently and she realized he was doing so and that somehow it was well that he should i do not think there is time for any one to sit down she said speaking more quickly than before it is not only that she has not come back frulein hirsch has presented her to one of her old employersa lady etynge robin was delighted with her she has a daughter who is in france marguerite staying with her aunt in paris suddenly put in the voice of the bluntfeatured man from his side of the room hlne at a covent in tours corrected mademoiselle turning a paling countenance towards him and then upon coombe lady etynge spoke of wanting to engage some nice girl as a companion to her daughter who is coming home robin thought she might have the good fortune to please her she was to go to lady etynges house to tea sine afternoon and be shown the rooms prepared for hlne she thought the mother charming did she mention the address coombe asked at once the house was in berford placea large house at a corner she chanced to see lady etynge go into it one day or we should not have known she did not notice the number frulein hirsch thought it was a i have looked through the blue book lord coombethrough the peeragethrough the directory there is no lady etynge and there is no a in berford place that is why i came here the man who had stood aside stepped forward again it was as if he answered some sign though lord coombe at the moment crossed the hearth and rang the bell scotland yard knows that maam said the man weve had our eyes on that house for two weeks and this kind of thing is what we want the double brougham was coombes order to the servant who answered his ring then he came back to mademoiselle mr barkstow is a detective he said among the other things he has done for me he has for some time kept a casual eye on robin she is too lovely a child and too friendless to be quite safe there are blackguards who know when a girl has not the usual family protection he came here to tell me that she had been seen sitting in kensington gardens with a woman scotland yard has reason to suspect a black un said barkstow savagely if shes the one we think she isa black poisonous sly one with a face that no girl could suspect coombes still countenance was so deadly in the slow lividness which mademoiselle saw began to manifest itself that she caught his sleeve with a shaking hand shes nothing but a baby she said she doesnt know what a baby she is i can see her eyes frantic with terror shed go mad good god he said in a voice so low it scarcely audible he almost dragged her out of the room though as they passed through the hall the servants only saw that he had given the lady his armand two of the younger footmen exchanged glances with each other which referred solely to the inimitableness of the cut of his evening overcoat when they entered the carriage barkstow entered with them and mademoiselle vall leaned forward with her elbows on her knees and her face clutched in her hands she was trying to shut out from her mental vision a memory of robins eyes ifif frulein hirsch isnot true she broke out once count von hillern is concerned it has come upon me like a flash why did i not see before the party at the big house where the red carpet was rolled across the pavement was at full height when they drove into the place their brougham did not stop at the corner but at the end of the line of waiting carriages coombe got out and looked up and down the thoroughfare it must be done quietly there must be no scandal he said the policeman on the beat is an enormous fellow you will attend to him barkstow and barkstow nodded and strolled away coombe walked up the place and down on the opposite side until he was within a few yards of the corner house when he reached this point he suddenly quickened his footsteps because he saw that someone else was approaching it with an air of intention it was a man not quite as tall as himself but of heavier build and with square held shoulders as the man set his foot upon the step coombe touched him on the arm and said something in german the man started angrily and then suddenly stood quite still and erect it will be better for us to walk up the place together lord coombe said with perfect politeness if he could have been dashed down upon the pavement and his head hammered in with the handle of a sword or if he could have been run through furiously again and again either or both of these things would have been done but neither was possible it also was not possible to curse aloud in a fashionable london street such curses as one uttered must be held in ones foaming mouth between ones teeth count von hillern knew this better than most men would have known it here was one of those english swine with whom germany would deal in her own way later they walked back together as if they were acquaintances taking a casual stroll there is nothing which would so infuriate yourmasteras a disgraceful scandal lord coombes highbred voice suggested undisturbedly the high honour of a german officerthe knightly bearing of a wearer of the uniform of the all highestthat sort of thing you know all that sort of thing von hillern ground out some low spoken and quite awful german words if he had not been trappedif he had been in some quiet bystreet the man walking ahead of us is a detective from scotland yard the particularly heavy and rather martial tread behind us is that of a policeman much more muscular than either of us there is a ball going on in the large house with the red carpet spread across the pavement i know the people who are giving it there are a good many coachmen and footmen about most of them would probably recognize me it became necessary for count von hillern actually to wipe away certain flecks of foam from his lips as he ground forth again more varied and awful sentiments in his native tongue you are going back to berlin said coombe coldly if we english were not such fools you would not be here you are of course not going into that house von hillern burst into a derisive laugh you are going yourself he said you are a wornout old roue but you are mad about her yourself in your senile way you should respect my age and decrepitude answered coombe a certain pity for my gray hairs would become your youth shall we turn here or will you return to your hotel by some other way he felt as if the man might a burst a blood vessel if he were obliged to further restrain himself von hillern wheeled at the corner and confronted him there will come a day he almost choked der tag naturally the chill of coombes voice was a sound to drive this particular man at this particular damnablythwarted moment raving mad and not to be able to go mad not to be able swine of a doddering englishman who would envy youtrembling on your lean shankswhatsoever you can buy for yourself i spit on youspit dont said coombe you are sputtering to such an extent that you really are you know von hillern whirled round the corner coombe left alone stood still a moment i was in time he said to himself feeling somewhat nauseated by extraordinary luck i was in time in earlier days one would have said something about provadence and he at once walked back chapter xxiii it was not utterly dark in the room though robin after passing her hands carefully over the walls had found no electric buttons within reach nor any signs of candles or matches elsewhere the night sky was clear and brilliant with many stars and this gave her an unshadowed and lighted space to look at she went to the window and sat down on the floor huddled against the wall with her hands clasped round her knees looking up she did this in the effort to hold in check a rising tide of frenzy which threatened her perhaps if she could fix her eyes on the vault full of stars she could keep herself from going out of her mind though perhaps it would be better if she did go out of her mind she found herself thinking a few seconds later after her first entire acceptance of the hideous thing which had happened to her she had passed through nerve breaking phases of terrorstricken imaginings the old story of the drowning man across whose brain rush all the images of life came back to her she did not know where or when or how she had ever heard or read of the ghastly incidents which came trooping up to her and staring at her with dead or mad eyes and awful faces perhaps they were old nightmaresperhaps a kind of delirium had seized her she tried to stop their coming by saying over and over again the prayers dowie had taught her when she was a child and then she thought with a sob which choked her that perhaps they were only prayers for a safe little creature kneeling by a white bedand did not apply to a girl locked up in a top room which nobody knew about only when she thought of mademoiselle vall and dowie looking for herwith all london spread out before their helplessnessdid she cry after that tears seemed impossible the images trooped by too close to her the passion hidden within her beingwhich had broken out when she tore the earth under the shrubbery and which with torture staring her in the face had leaped in the childs soul and body and made her defy andrews with shrieksleaped up within her now she became a young fury to whom a mad fight with monstrous death was nothing she told herself that she was strong for a girlthat she could tear with her nails she could clench her teeth in a flesh she could shriek she could battle like a young madwoman so that they would be forced to kill her this was one of the images which rose up before her again and yet again a hideoushideous thing which would not remain away she had not had any food since the afternoon cup of tea and she began to feel the need of it if she became faint she lifted her face desperately as she said it and saw the immense blue darkness powdered with millions of stars and curving over heras it curved over the hideous house and all the rest of the world how highhow immensehow fathomlessly still it washow it seemed as if there could be nothing elsethat nothing else could be real her hands were clenched together hard and fiercely as she scrambled to her knees and uttered a of prayernot a childsrather the cry of a young fury making a demand perhaps a girl is nothing she cried a girl locked up in a room but perhaps she is somethingshe may be real too save mesave me but if you wont save me let me be killed she knelt silent after it for a few minutes and then she sank down and lay on the floor with her face on her arm how it was possible that even young and wornout as she was such peace as sleep could overcome her at such a time one cannot say but in the midst of her torment she was asleep but it was not for long she wakened with a start and sprang to her feet shivering the carriages were still coming and going with guests for the big house opposite it could not be late though she seemed to have been in the place for yearslong enough to feel that it was the hideous centre of the whole earth and all sane and honest memories were a dream she thought she would begin to walk up and down the room but a sound she heard at this very instant made her stand stock still she had known there would be a sound at lastshe had waited for it all the timeshe had known of course that it would come but she had not even tried to guess whether she would hear it early or late it would be the sound of the turning of the handle of the locked door it had come there it was the click of the lock first and then the creak of the turned handle she went to the window again and stood with her back against it so that her body was outlined against the faint light would the person come in the dark or would he carry a light something began to whirl in her brain what was the low pumping thump she seemed to hear and feel at the same time it was the awful thumping of her heart the door openednot stealthily but quite in the ordinary way the person who came in did not move stealthily either he came in as though he were making an evening call how tall and straight his body was with a devilish elegance of line against the background of light in the hall she thought she saw a white flower on his lapel as his overcoat fell back the leering footman had opened the door for him turn on the lights a voice she knew gave the order the leering footman obeyed touching a spot high on the wall she had vaguely and sickeningly felt almost sure that it would be either count von hillern or lord coombeand it was not count von hillern the cold wicked facethe ironic eyes which made her creepthe absurd elderly perfection of dresseven the flawless flowermade her flash quake with repulsion if satan came into the room he might look like that and make ones revolting being quake so i thoughtit might be you the strange girls voice said to him aloud robin he said he was moving towards her and as she threw out her madly clenched little hands he stopped and drew back why did you think i might come he asked because you are the kind of a man who would do the things only devils would do i have hatedhatedhated you since i was a baby come and kill me if you like call the footman back to help you if yon like i cant get away kill mekill mekill me she was lost in her frenzy and looked as if she were mad one moment he hesitated and then he pointed politely to the sofa go and sit down please he suggested it was no more then a courteous suggestion i shall remain here i have no desire to approach youif youll pardon my saying so but she would not leave the window it is natural that you should be overwrought he said this is a damnable thing you are too young to know the worst of it you are the worst of it she cried you no as the chill of his even voice struck her she wondered if he were really human von hillern would have been the worst of it i stopped him at the front door and knew how to send him away now listen my good child hate me as ferociously as you like that is a detail you are in the house of a woman whose name stands for shame and infamy and crime what are you doing in it she cried again in a place where girls are trappedand locked up in top roomsto be killed i came to take you away i wish to do it quietly it would be rather horrible if the public discovered that you have spent some hours here if i had not slipped in when they were expecting von hillern and if the servants were not accustomed to the quiet entrance of well dressed men i could not have got in without an open row and the calling of the policemenwhich i wished to avoid also the woman downstairs knows me and realized that i was not lying when i said the house was surrounded and she was on the point of being run in she is a woman of broad experience and at once knew that she might as well keep quiet despite his cold eyes and the bad smile she hated despite his almost dandified meticulous attire and the festal note of his white flower which she hated with the resthe was perhaps not lying to her perhaps for the sake of her mother he had chosen to save herand being the man he was he had been able to make use of his past experiences she began to creep away from the window and she felt her legs all at once shaking under her by the time she reached the chesterfield sofa she fell down by it and began to cry a sort of hysteria seized her and she shook from head to foot and clutched at the upholstery with weak hands which clawed she was indeed an awful piteous sight he was perhaps not lying but she was afraid of him yet i told the men who are waiting outside that if i did not bring you out in half an hour they were to break into the house i do not wish them to break in we have not any time to spare what you are doing is quite natural but you must try and get up he stood by her and said this looking down at her slender wrung body and lovely groveling head he took a flask out of his overcoat pocketand it was a gem of goldsmiths art he poured some wine into its cup and bent forward to hold it out to her drink this and try to stand on your feet he said he knew better than to try to help her to riseto touch her in any way seeing to what the past hours had reduced her he knew better there was mad fear in her eyes when she lifted her head and threw out her hand again no no she cried out no i will drink nothing he understood at once and threw the wine into the grate i see he said you might think it might be drugged you are right it might be i ought to have thought of that he returned the flask to his pocket listen again you must the time will soon be up and we must not let those fellows break in and make a row that will collect a crowd we must go at once mademoiselle vall is waiting for you in my carriage outside you will not be afraid to drink wine she gives you mademoiselle she stammered yes in my carriage which is not fifty yards from the house can you stand on your feet she got up and stood but she was still shuddering all over can you walk downstairs if you cannot will you let me carry you i am strong enoughin spite of my years i can walk she whispered will you take my arm she looked at him for a moment with awful brokenspirited eyes yes i will take your arm he offered it to her with rigid punctiliousness of manner he did not even look at her he led her out of the room and down the three flights of stairs as they passed by the open drawingroom door the lovely woman who had called herself lady etynge stood near it and watched them with eyes no longer gentle i have something to say to you madam he said when i place this young lady in the hands of her governess i will come back and say it is her governess frulein hirsch asked the woman lightly no she is doubtless on her way back to berlinand von hillern will follow her there was only the first floor flight of stairs now robin could scarcely see her way but lord coombe held her up firmly and in a few moments more the leering footman grown pale opened the large door they crossed the pavement to the carriage and she was helped in and fell almost insensible across mademoiselle valls lap and was caught in a strong arm which shook as she did ma chrie she heard the good god oh the goodgood godand lord coombe lord coombe coombe had gone back to the house four men returned with him two in plain clothes and two heavilybuilt policemen they remained below but coombe went up the staircase with the swift lightness of a man of thirty he merely stood upon the threshold of the drawingroom this was what he said and his face was entirely white his eyes appalling my coming back to speak to you issuperfluousand the result of pure fury i allow it to myself as mere shameless indulgence more is known against you than thisthings which have gone farther and fared worse you are not young and you are facing years of life in prison your head will be shavedyour hands worn and blackened and your nails broken with the picking of oakum you will writhe in hopeless degradation until you are done for you will have time in the night blackness if of your cell to rememberto see facesto hear cries women such as you should learn what hell on earth means you will learn when he ended the woman hung with her back to the wall she had staggered against her mouth opening and shutting helplessly but letting forth no sound he took out an exquisitely fresh handkerchief and touched his forehead because it was damp his eyes were still appalling but his voice suddenly dropped and changed i have allowed myself to feel like a madman he said it has been a rich experiencegood for such a soul as i own he went downstairs and walked home because his carriage had taken robin and mademoiselle back to the slice of a house chapter xxiv von hillern made no further calls on mrs garethlawless his return to berlin was immediate and frulein hirsch came no more to give lessons in german later coombe learned from the man with the steady bluntfeatured face that she had crossed the channel on a night boat not many hours after von hillern had walked away from berford place the exact truth was that she had been miserably prowling about the adjacent streets held in the neighbourhood by some selftorturing morbidness half thwarted helpless passion half triumphing hatred of the young thing she had betrayed up and down the streets she had gone round and round wringing her lean fingers together and tasting on her lips the salt of tears which rolled down her cheekstears of torment and rage there was the bitterness of death in what by a mere trick of chance came about as she turned a corner telling herself for the hundredth time that she must go home she found herself face to face with a splendid figure swinging furiously along she staggered at the sight of the tigerish rage in the white face she recognized with a gasp it was enough merely to behold it he had met with some disastrous humiliation as for him the direct intervention of that heaven whose special care he was had sent him a woman to punishwhich so far was at least one thing arranged as it should be he knew so well how he could punish her with his mere contempt and displeasureas he could lash a spaniel crawling at his feet he need not deign to tell her what had happened and he did not he merely drew back and stood in stiff magnificence looking down at her it is through some folly of yours he dropped in a voice of vitriol women are always foolish they cannot hold their tongues or think clearly return to berlin at once you are not of those whose conduct i can commend to be trusted in the future he was gone before she could have spoken even if she had dared sobbing gasps caught her breath as she stood and watched him striding pitilessly and superbly away with what seemed to her abject soul the swing and tread of a martial god her streaming tears tasted salt indeed she might never see him againeven from a distance she would be disgraced and flung aside as a blundering woman she had obeyed his every word and done her straining best as she had licked the dust at his feetbut he would never cast a glance at her in the future or utter to her the remotest word of his high commands she so reeled as she went her wretched way that a goodnatured policeman said to her as he passed steady on my girl best get home and go to bed to mrs garethlawless it was stated by coombe that frulein hirsch had been called back to germany by family complications that august orders should recall count von hillern was easily understood such magnificent persons never shone upon society for any length of time that feather had been making a country home visit when her daughter had faced tragedy was considered by lord coombe as a fortunate thing we will not alarm mrs garethlawless by telling her what has occurred he said to mademoiselle vall what we most desire is that no one shall suspect that the hideous thing took place a person who was forgetful or careless might unintentionally let some word escape which what he meant and what mademoiselle vall knew he meantalso what he knew she knew he meantwas that a woman who was a heartless fool without sympathy or perception would not have the delicacy to feel that the girl must be shielded and might actually see a sort of ghastly joke in a story of mademoiselle valls sacrosanct charge simply walking out of her enshrining arms into such a galere as the most rackety and adventurous of pupils could scarcely have been led into such a point of view would have been quite possible for feathereven probable in the slightly spiteful attitude of her light mind she was away from home only you and i and dowie know answered mademoiselle let us remain the only persons who know said coombe robin will say nothing they both knew that she had been feverish and ill for several days and dowie had kept her in bed saying that she had caught cold neither of the two women had felt it possible to talk to her she had lain staring with a deadly quiet fixedness straight before her saying next to nothing now and then she shuddered and once she broke into a mad heartbroken fit of crying which she seemed unable to control everything is changed she said to dowie and mademoiselle who sat on either side of her bed sometimes pressing her head down onto a kind shoulder sometimes holding her hand and patting it i shall be afraid of everybody forever people who have sweet faces and kind voices will make me shake all over oh she seemed so kindso kind it was dowie whose warm shoulder her face hidden on this time and dowie was choked with sobs she dared not let loose she could only squeeze hard and kiss the silk curls all in a heappoor tumbled curls no longer a childs aye my lamb she managed to say dowies poor pet lamb its the knowing that kind eyeskind ones she broke off panting its the knowing i didnt know before i knew nothing now its all over im afraid of all the world not all chrie breathed mademoiselle she sat upright against her pillows the mirror on a dressing table reflected her imageher blooming tearwet youth framed in the wonderful hair falling a shadow about her she stared at the reflection hard and questioningly i suppose her voice was pathos itself in its helplessness it is because what you once told me about being pretty is true a girl who looks like that pointing her finger at the glass need not think she can earn her own living i loathe it in fierce resentment at some bitter injustice it is like being a person under a curse at this dowie broke down openly and let her tears run fast no no you mustnt say it or think it my dearie she wept it might call down a blight on it you a young thing like a garden flower and someonesomewheregod bless himthat some dayll glory in itand youll glory too somewhere he issomewhere let none of them look at me cried robin i loathe them too i hate everythingand everybodybut you twojust you two mademoiselle took her in her arms this time when she sobbed again mademoiselle knew how at this hour it seemed to her that all her world was laid bare forever more when the worst of the weeping was over and she lay quiet but for the deep catching breaths which lifted her breast in slow childish shudders at intervals she held mademoiselle valls hand and looked at her with a faint wry smile you were too kind to tell me what a stupid little fool i was when i talked to you about taking a place in an office she said i know now that you would not have allowed me to do the things i was so sure i could do it was only my ignorance and conceit i cant answer advertisements any bad person can say what they choose in an advertisement if that woman had advertised she would have described hlne and there was no hlne one of the shuddering catches of her breath broke in here after it she said with a pitiful girlishness of regret ii could see hlne i have known so few people well enough to love them no girls at all i thoughperhapswe should begin to love each other i cant bear to think of thatthat she never was alive at all it leaves a sort of empty place when she had sufficiently recovered herself to be up again mademoiselle vall said to her that she wished her to express her gratitude to lord coombe i will if you wish it she answered dont you feel that it is proper that you should do it do you not wish it yourself inquired mademoiselle robin looked down at the carpet for some seconds i know she at last admitted that it is proper but i dont wish to do it no said mademoiselle vall robin raised her eyes from the carpet and fixed them on her it is because ofreasons she said it is part of the horror i want to forget even you maynt know what it has done to me perhaps i am turning into a girl with a bad mind bad thoughts keep swooping down on melike great black ravens lord coombe saved me but i think hideous things about him i heard andrews say he was bad when i was too little to know what it meant now i know i remember that he knew because he chose to knowof his own free will he knew that woman and she knew him how did he know her she took a forward step which brought her nearer to mademoiselle i never told you but i will tell you now she confessed when the door opened and i saw him standing against the light ii did not think he had come to save me mon dieu breathed mademoiselle in soft horror he knows i am pretty he is an old man but he knows frulein hirsch once made me feel actually sick by telling me in her meek sly careful way that he liked beautiful girls and the people said he wanted a young wife and had his eye on me i was rude to her because it made me so furious how did he know that woman so well you see how bad i have been made he knows nearly all europe he has seen the dark corners as well as the bright places perhaps he has saved other girls from her he brought her to punishment and was able to do it because he has been on her track for some time you are not badbut unjust you have had too great a shock to be able to reason sanely just yet i think he will always make me creep a little said robin but i will say anything you think i ought to say on an occasion when feather had gone again to make a visit in the country mademoiselle came into the sitting room with the round window in which plants grew and coombe followed her robin looked up from her book with a little start and then stood up i have told lord coombe that you wishthat i wish you to thank him mademoiselle vall said i came on my own part to tell you that any expression of gratitude is entirely unnecessary said coombe i must be grateful i am grateful robins colour slowly faded as she said it this was the first time she had seen him since he had supported her down the staircase which mounted to a place of hell there is nothing to which i should object so much as being regarded as a benefactor he answered definitely but with entire lack of warmth the role does not suit me being an extremely bad man he said it as one who speaks wholly without prejudice my experience is wide i chance to know things the woman who called herself lady etynge is of a class whichwhich does not count me among its clients i had put certain authorities on her trackwhich was how i discovered your whereabouts when mademoiselle vall told me that you had gone to take tea with her mere chance you see dont be grateful to me i beg of you but to mademoiselle vall why faltered robin vaguely repelled as much as ever did it matter to you because he answeredoh the cold inhumanness of his gray eyeyou happened to live inthis house i thought that was perhaps the reason she saidand she felt that he made her creep even a shade more i beg your pardon she added suddenly remembering please sit down thank you as he sat i will because i have something more to say to you robin and mademoiselle seated themselves also and listened there are many hideous aspects of existence which are not considered necessary portions of a girls education he began they ought to be put in robin and her voice was as hard as it was young it was a long and penetrating look he gave her i am not an instructor of youth i have not been called upon to decide i do not feel it my duty to go even now into detail you need not broke in the hard young voice i know everything in the world im black with knowing mademoiselle will discuss that point with you what you have unfortunately been forced to learn is that it is not safe for a girleven a girl without beautyto act independently of older people unless she has found out how to guard herself againstdevils the words broke from him sharply with a sudden incongruous hint of ferocity which was almost startling you have been frightened he said next and you have discovered that there are devils but you have not sufficient experience to guard yourself against them i have been so frightened that i shall be a cowarda coward all my life i shall be afraid of every face i seethe more to be trusted they look the more i shall fear them i hate every one in the world her quite wonderful eyesso they struck lord coombeflamed with a childs outraged anguish a thunder shower of tears broke and rushed down her cheeks and he rose and walking quietly to the window full of flowers stood with his back to her for a few moments she neither cared nor knew whether it was because her hysteric emotion bored or annoyed him or because he had the taste to realize that she would not wish to be looked at unhappy youth can feel no law but its own but all was over during the few moments and he turned and walked back to his chair you want very much to do some work which will insure your entire independenceto take some situation which will support you without aid from others you are not yet prepared to go out and take the first place which offers you have beenas you saytoo hideously frightened and you know there are dangers in wandering about unguided mademoiselle vall turning his head perhaps you will tell her what you know of the duchess of darte upon which mademoiselle vall took hold of her hand and entered into a careful explanation she is a great personage of whom there can be no doubt she was a lady of the court she is of advanced years and an invalid and has a liking for those who are pretty and young she desires a companion who is well educated and young and fresh of mind the companion who had been with her for many years recently died if you took her place you would live with her in her town house and go with her to the country after the season your salary would be liberal and no position could be more protected and dignified i have seen and talked to her grace myself and she will allow me to take you to her if you desire to go do not permit the fact that she has known me for many years to prejudice you against the proposal said coombe you might perhaps regard it rather as a sort of guarantee of my conduct in the matter she knows the worst of me and still allows me to retain her acquaintance she was brilliant and full of charm when she was a young woman and she is even more so now because she isof a rarity if i were a girl and might earn my living in her service i should feel that fortune had been good to megood robins eyes turned from one of them to the otherfrom coombe to mademoiselle vall and from mademoiselle to coombe pathetically youyou seewhat has been done to me she said a few weeks ago i should have known that god was providing for metaking care of me and nowi am still afraid i feel as if she would see thatthat i am not young and fresh any more but black with evil i am afraid of heri am afraid of you to coombe and of myself coombe rose evidently to go away but you are not afraid of mademoiselle vall he put it to her she will provide the necessary references for the duchess i will leave her to help you to decide robin rose also she wondered if she ought not to hold out her hand perhaps he saw her slight movement he himself made none i remember you objected to shaking hands as a child he said with an impersonal civil smile and the easy punctiliousness of his bow made it impossible for her to go further chapter xxv some days before this the duchess of darte had driven out in the morning to make some purchases and as she had sat in her large landau she had greatly missed miss brent who had always gone with her when she had made necessary visits to the shops she was not fond of shopping and miss brent had privately found pleasure in it which had made her a cheerful companion to the quiet elderly woman whose life previous to her service with this great lady had been spent in struggles with poverty the mere incident of entering shops and finding eager salesmen springing forward to meet her with bows and amiable offers of ministration was to the end of her days an almost thrilling thing the duchess bought splendidly though quietly knowing always what she wanted she merely required that it be produced and after silently examining it gave orders that it should be sent to her there was a dignity in her decision which was impressive she never gave trouble or hesitated the staffs of employees in the large shops knew and reveled in her while they figuratively bent the knee miss brent had been a happy satisfied woman while she had lived she had died peacefully after a brief and as it seemed at first unalarming illness at one of her employers country houses to which she had been amiably sent down for a holiday every kindness and attention had been bestowed upon her and only a few moments before she fell into her last sleep she had been talking pleasantly of her mistress she is a very great lady miss hallam she had said to her nurse shes the last of her kind i often think very great ladies seem to have gone outif you know what i mean theyve gone out the duchess had in fact said of brent as she stood a few days later beside her coffin and looked down at her contentedly serene face something not unlike what brent had said of herself you were a good friend brent my dear she murmured i shall always miss you i am afraid there are no more like you left she was thinking of her all the morning as she drove slowly down to bond street and piccadilly as she got out of her carriage to go into a shop she was attracted by some photographs of beauties in a window and paused to glance at them many of them were beauties whom she knew but among them were some of societys latest discoveries the particular photographs which caught her eye were two which had evidently been purposely placed side by side for an interesting reason the reason was that the two women while obviously belonging to periods of some twenty years apart as the fashion of their dress proved were in face and form so singularly alike that they bewilderingly suggested that they were the same person both were exquisitely nymphlike fair and large eyed and both had the fine light hair which is capable of forming itself into a halo the duchess stood and looked at them for the moment spellbound she slightly caught her breath she was borne back so swiftly and so far her errand in the next door shop was forgotten she went into the one which displayed the photographs i wish to look at the two photographs which are so much alike she said to the man behind the counter he knew her as most people did and brought forth the photographs at once many people are interested in them your grace he said it was the amazing likeness which made me put them beside each other yes she answered it is almost incredible she looked up from the beautiful young being dressed in the mode of twenty years past this iswas she corrected herself and paused the man replied in a somewhat dropped voice he evidently had his reasons for feeling it discreet to do so yeswas she died twenty years ago the young princess alixe of x he said there was a sad story your grace no doubt remembers it was a good deal talked about yes she replied and said no more but took up the modern picture it displayed the same almost floating airiness of type but in this case the original wore diaphanous wisps of spangled tulle threatening to take wings and fly away leaving the girl slimness of arms and shoulders bereft of any covering whatsoever this one is she questioned a mrs garethlawless a widow with a daughter though she looks in her teens shes older than the princess was but shes kept her beauty as ladies know how to in these days its wonderful to see them side by side but its only a few that saw her highness as she was the season she came with the prince to visit at windsor in queen victorias day did your grace he checked himself feeling that he was perhaps somewhat exceeding bond street limits yes i saw her said the duchess if these are for sale i will take them both im selling a good many of them people buy them because the likeness makes them a sort of curiosity mrs garethlawless is a very modern lady and she is quite amused the duchess took the two photographs home with her and looked at them a great deal afterwards as she sat in her winged chair they were on her table when coombe came to drink tea with her in the afternoon when he saw them he stood still and studied the two faces silently for several seconds did you ever see a likeness so wonderful he said at last never she answered or an unlikeness that is the most wonderful of allthe unlikeness it is the same body inhabited by two souls from different spheres his next words were spoken very slowly i should have been sure you would see that he commented i lost my breath for a second when i saw them side by side in the shop windowand the next moment i lost it again because i sawwhat i speak ofthe utter world wide apartness it is in their eyes she she touched the silver frame enclosing the young princess was a little sainta little spirit there never was a young human thing so transparently pure the rigid modeling of his face expressed a thing which himself recognizing its presence he chose to turn aside as he moved towards the mantel and leaned on it the same thing caused his voice to sound hoarse and low as he spoke in answer saying something she had not expected him to say its unexpectedness in fact produced in her an effect of shock and she was the possession of a brute incarnate mad with unbridled lust and drink and abnormal furies she was a child saint and shook with terror before him he killed her i believe he did she said unsteadily after a breath space of pause many people believed so though great effort was made to silence the stories but there were too many stories and they were so unspeakable that even those in high places were made furiously indignant he was not received here at court afterwards his own emperor could not condone what he did public opinion was too strong the stories were true answered the hoarse low voice i myself by royal command was a guest at the schloss in the bavarian alps when it was known that he struck her repeatedly with a dog whip she was going to have a child one night i was wandering in the park in misery and i heard shrieks which sent me in mad search i do not know what i should have done if i had succeeded but i tried to force an entrance into the wing from which the shrieks came i was met and stopped almost by open violence the sounds ceased she died a week later but the most experienced lying could not hide some things even royal menials may have human blood in their veins it was known that there were hideous marks on her little dead body we heard we heard whispered the duchess he killed her but she would have died of horror if he had not struck her a blow she began to die from the hour the marriage was forced upon her i saw that when she was with him at windsor you were in attendance on him the duchess said after a little silence that was when i first knew you yes she had added the last sentence gravely and his reply was as grave though his voice was still hoarse you were sublime goodness and wisdom when a woman through the sheer quality of her silence saves a man from slipping over the verge of madness he does not forget while i was sane i dared scarcely utter her name if i had gone mad i should have raved as madmen do for that reason i was afraid i knew speech was the greatest danger she answered him she was a princess of a royal housepoor little angeland she had a husband whose vileness and violence all europe knew how dared they give her to him for reasons of their own and because she was too humbly innocent and obedient to rebel the duchess did not ask questions the sublime goodness of which he had spoken had revealed its perfection through the fact that in the long past days she had neither questioned nor commented she had given her strong souls secret support to him and in his unbearable hours he had known that when he came to her for refuge while she understood his need to the uttermost she would speak no word even to himself but today though she asked no question her eyes waited upon him as it were this was because she saw that for some unknown reason a heavy veil had rolled back from the past he had chosen to keep hidden even from himself as it were more than from others speech is always the most dangerous thing he said only the silence of years piled one upon the other will bury unendurable things even thought must be silenced i have lived a lifetime since his words began to come very slowlyas she listened she felt as if he were opening a grave and drawing from its depths long buried things since the night when i met her alone in a wood in the park of the schloss andlost hold of myselflost it utterly the duchess withered hands caught each other in a clasp which was almost like a passionate exclamation there was such a night and i was youngyoungnot an iron bound vieillard then when one is young ones anguish is the deluge which ends the world forever i had lain down and risen up and spent every hour in growing torture for months i had been forced to bind myself down with bands of iron when i found myself without warning face to face with her alone in the night stillness of the wood the bands broke she had dared to creep out in secret to hide herself and her heartbroken terror in the silence and darkness alone i knew it without being told i knew and i went quite mad for the time i was only a boy i threw myself face downward on the earth and sobbed embracing her young feet both of them were quite silent for a few moments before he went on she was not afraid he said even with something which was like a curious smile of tender pity at the memory afterwardswhen i stood near her tremblingshe even took my hand and held it once she kissed it humbly like a little child while her tears rained down never before was there anything as innocently heartbreaking she was so piteously grateful for love of any kind and so heart wrung by my misery he paused again and looked down at the carpet thinking then he looked up at her directly i need not explain to you you will know i was twentyfive my heart was pounding in my side my blood thudded through my veins every atom of natural generous manhood in my being was wild with fury at the brutal wrong done her exquisiteness and she she was a young novice fresh from a convent and very pious the duchess quiet voice put in you understand he answered she knelt down and prayed for her own soul as well as mine she thanked god that i was kind and would forgive her and go awayand only remember her in my prayers she believed it was possible it was not but i kissed the hem of her white dress and left her standing alonea little saint in a woodland shrine that was what i thought deliriously as i staggered off it was the next night that i heard her shrieks then she died the duchess knew what else had diedthe high adventure of youth and joy of life in him the brilliant spirit which had been himself and whose utter withdrawal from his being had left him as she had seen him on his return to london in those days which now seemed a memory of a past life in a world which had passed also he had appeared before her late one afternoon and she had for a moment been afraid to look at him because she was struck to the depths of her being by a sense of seeing before her a body which had broken the link holding it to life and walked the earth the crowded streets the ordinary rooms where people gathered a dead thing even while it moved it gazed out of dead eyes and the years had passed and though they had been friends he had never spoken until now such a thing must be buried in a tomb covered with a heavy stone and with a seal set upon it i am unsealing a tomb he said then after a silence he added i have of cause a reason she bent her head because she had known this must be the case there is a thing i wish you to understand every woman could not i shall understand because i know you will i need not enter into exact detail you will not find what i say abnormal there had been several pauses during his relation once or twice he had stopped in the middle of a sentence as if for calmer breath or to draw himself back from a past which had suddenly become again a present of torment too great to face with modern steadiness he took breath so to speak in this manner again the years pass the agony of being young passes one slowly becomes another man he resumed i am another man i could not be called a creature of sentiment i have given myself interests in existencemany of them but the sealed tomb is under ones feet not to allow oneself to acknowledge its existence consciously is ones affair butthe devil of chance sometimes chooses to play tricks such a trick was played on me he glanced down at the two pictures at which she herself was looking with grave eyes it was the photograph of feather he took up and set a strange questioning gaze upon when i saw this he said thisexquisitely smiling at me under a green tree in a sunny gardenthe tomb opened under my feet and i stood on the brink of ittwentyfive again you cannot possibly put it into words the duchess said you need not i know for he had become for the moment almost livid even to her who so well knew him it was a singular thing to see him hastily set down the picture and touch his forehead with his handkerchief she knew he was about to tell her his reason for this unsealing of the tomb when he sat down at her table he did so he did not use many phrases but in making clear his reasons he also made clear to her certain facts which most persons would have ironically disbelieved but no shadow of a doubt passed through her mind because she had through a long life dwelt interestedly on the many variations in human type she was extraordinarily interested when he ended with the story of robin i do not know exactly why it matters to mei am quoting her mother he explained but it happens that i am determined to stand between the child and what would otherwise be the inevitable it is not that she has the slightest resemblance toto anyonewhich might awaken memory it is not that she and her mother are of totally different types and her detestation of me is unconquerable she believes me to be the worst of men when i entered the room into which the woman had trapped her she thought that i came as one of the creatures damnable clients you will acknowledge that my position presents difficulties in the way of explanation to a girlto most adults in fact her childish frenzy of desire to support herself arises from her loathing of the position of accepting support from me i sympathize with her entirely mademoiselle vall is an intelligent woman the duchess said as though thinking the matter out send her to me and we will talk the matter over then she can bring the child chapter xxvi as a result of this her grace saw mademoiselle vall alone a few mornings later and talked to her long and quietly their comprehension of each other was complete before their interview was at an end the duchess interest in the adventure she was about to enter into had become profound the sooner she is surrounded by a new atmosphere the better was one of the things the frenchwoman had said the prospect of an arrangement so perfect and so secure fills me with the profoundest gratitude it is absolutely necessary that i return to my parents in belgium they are old and failing in health and need me greatly i have been sad and anxious for months because i felt that it would be wickedness to desert this poor child i have been torn in two now i can be at peacethank the good god bring her to me tomorrow if possible the duchess said when they parted i foresee that i may have something to overcome in the fact that i am lord coombes old friend but i hope to be able to overcome it she is a babyshe is of great beautyshe has a passionate little soul of which she knows nothing mademoiselle vall said it with an anxious reflectiveness i have been afraid if i were her mother her eyes sought those of the older woman but she has no mother her grace answered her own eyes were serious she knew something of girls of young things of the rush and tumult of young life in them and of the outlet it demanded a baby who was of great beauty and of a passionate soul was no trivial undertaking for a rheumatic old duchess butbring her to me she said so was robin brought to the tall early victorian mansion in the belatedly stately square and the chief thought in her mind was that though mere good manners demanded under the circumstances that she should come to see the dowager duchess of darte and be seen by her if she found that she was like lord coombe she would not be able to endure the prospect of a future spent in her service howsoever desirable such service might outwardly appear this desirableness mademoiselle vall had made clear to her she was to be the companion of a personage of great and mature charm and grace who desired not mere attendance but something more which something included the warmth and fresh brightness of happy youth and bloom she would do for her employer the things a young relative might do she would have a suite of rooms of her own and a freedom as to hours and actions which greater experience on her part would have taught was not the customary portion meted out to a paid companion but she knew nothing of paid service and a preliminary talk of coombes with mademoiselle vall had warned her against allowing any suspicion that this earning a living had been too obviously ameliorated her life is unusual she herself is unusual in a most dignified and beautiful way you will it might almost be said hold the position of a young lady in waiting was mademoiselles gracefully put explanation when after they had been ushered into the room where her grace sat in her beautiful and mellow corner by the fire robin advanced towards the highbacked chair what the old woman was chiefly conscious of was the eyes which seemed all lustrous iris there was uncommon appeal and fear in them the blackness of their setting of upcurled lashes made them look babyishly wide mademoiselle vall has told me of your wish to take a position as companion the duchess said after they were seated i want very much said robin to support myself and mademoiselle thinks that i might fill such a place if i am not considered too young you are not too youngfor me i want something young to come and befriend me am i too old for you her smile had been celebrated fifty years earlier and it had not changed a smile does not she was not like lord coombe in any degree however remote she did not belong to his world robin thought if i can do well enough the things you require done she answered blushing her jacqueminot rose blush i shall be grateful if you will let me try to do them mademoiselle will tell you that i have no experience but that i am one who tries well mademoiselle has answered all my questions concerning your qualifications so satisfactorily that i need ask you very few such questions as she asked were not of the order robin had expected she led her into talk and drew mademoiselle vall into the conversation it was talk which included personal views of books old gardens and old houses people pictures and evenlightlypolitics robin found herself quite incidentally as it were reading aloud to her an italian poem she ceased to be afraid and was at ease she forgot lord coombe the duchess listening and watching her warmed to her task of delicate investigation and saw reason for anticipating agreeably stimulating things she was not taking upon herself a merely benevolent duty which might assume weight and become a fatigue in fact she might trust coombe for that after all it was he who had virtually educated the childlittle as she was aware of the singular fact it was he who had dragged her forth from her dog kennel of a top floor nursery and quaintly incongruous as it seemed had found her a respectable woman for a nurse and an intelligent person for a governess and companion as if he had been a domesticated middle class widower with a little girl to play mother to she saw in the situation more than others would have seen in it but she saw also the ironic humour of it coombewith the renowned cut of his overcoatthe perfection of his line and scarcely to be divined suggestions of huecoombe she did not avoid all mention of his name during the interview but she spoke of him only casually and though the salary she offered was an excellent one it was not inordinate robin could not feel that she was not being accepted as of the class of young persons who support themselves selfrespectingly though even the most modest earned income would have represented wealth to her ignorance before they parted she had obtained the position so pleasantly described by mademoiselle vall as being something like that of a young lady in waiting but i am really a companion and i will do everythingeverything i can so that i shall be worth keeping she thought seriously she felt that she should want to be kept if lord coombe was a friend of her employers it was because the duchess did not know what others knew and her house was not his houseand the hideous thing she had secretly loathed would be at an end she would be supporting herself as decently and honestly as mademoiselle or dowie had supported themselves all their lives with an air of incidentally recalling a fact the duchess said after they had risen to leave her mademoiselle vall tells me you have an elderly nurse you are very fond of she seems to belong to a class of servants almost extinct i love her robin falteredbecause the sudden reminder brought back a pang to her there was a look in her eyes which faltered also she loves me i dont know how but there she stopped such women are very valuable to those who know the meaning of their type i myself am always in search of it my dear miss brent was of it though of a different class but most people do not know said robin it seems oldfashioned to themand its beautiful dowie is an angel i should like to secure your dowie for my housekeeper and myselfone of the greatest powers of the celebrated smile was its power to convince a competent person is needed to take charge of the linen if we can secure an angel we shall be fortunate a day or so later she said to coombe in describing the visit the childs face is wonderful if you could but have seen her eyes when i said it it is not the mere beauty of size and shape and colour which affect one it is something else she is a little flame of feeling the something else was in the sound of her voice as she answered she will be in the same house with me sometimes perhaps i may see her and talk to her oh how grateful i am she might even see and talk to her as often as she wished it revealed itself and when she and mademoiselle got into their hansom cab to drive away she caught at the frenchwomans hand and clung to it her eyelashes wet it is as if there must be goodness which takes care of one she said i used to believe in it sountil i was afraid of all the world dowie means most of all i did not know how i could bear to let her go away and since her husband and her daughter died she has no one but me i should have had no one but her if you had gone back to belgium mademoiselle and now she will be safe in the same house with me perhaps the duchess will keep her until she dies i hope she will keep me until i die i will be as good and faithful as dowie and perhaps the duchess will live until i am quite oldand not pretty any more and i will make economies as you have made them mademoiselle and save all my salaryand i might be able to end my days in a little cottage in the country mademoiselle was conscious of an actual physical drag at her heartstrings the pulsating glow of her young loveliness had never been more moving and oh the sublime certainty of her unconsciousness that life lay between this hour and that day when she was quite old and not pretty any more and having made economies could die in a little cottage in the country she believed in her vision as she had believed that donal would come to her in the garden upon feather the revelation that her daughter had elected to join the ranks of girls who were mysteriously determined to be responsible for themselves produced a curious combination of effects it was presented to her by lord coombe in the form of a simple impersonal statement which had its air of needing no explanation she heard it with eyes widening a little and a smile slowly growing having heard she broke into a laugh a rather highpitched treble laugh really she said she is really going to do it to take a situation she wants to be independent and live her own life what a jokefor a girl of mine she was either really amused or chose to seem so what do you think of it she asked when she stopped laughing her eyes had curiosity in them i like it he answered of course i ought to have remembered that you helped her to an early victorian duchess shes one without a flawthe dowager duchess of darte the most conscientiously careful mother couldnt object its almost like entering into the kingdom of heavenin a dull way she began to laugh again as if amusing images rose suddenly before her and what does the duchess think of it she said after her laughter had ceased again how does she reconcile herself to the idea of a companion whose mother she wouldnt have in her house we need not enter into that view of the case you decided some years ago that it did not matter to you whether early victorian duchesses included you in their visiting lists or did not more modern ones do i believequite beautiful and amusing ones but for that reason i want this one and those like her they would bore me but i want them i want them to come to my house and be polite to me in their stuffy way i want to be invited to their hideous dinner parties and see them sitting round their tables in their awful family jewels talking of the sad deaths of kings thats shakespeare you know i heard it last night at the theatre why do you want it coombe inquired when i ask you why you show your morbid interest in robin you say you dont know i dont knowbut i do want it she suddenly flushed she even showed her small teeth for an extraordinary moment she looked like a little cat robin will hare it she cried grinding a delicate fist into the palm on her knee shes not eighteen and shes a beauty and shes taken up by a perfectly decent old duchess shell have everything the dowager will marry her to someone important youll help she turned on him in a flame of temper you are capable of marrying her yourself there was a a brief but entire silence it was broken by his saying she is not capable of marrying me there was brief but entire silence again and it was he who again broke it his manner at once cool and reasonable it is better not to exhibit this kind of feeling let us be quite frank there are few things you feel more strongly than that you do not want your daughter in the house when she was a child you told me that you detested the prospect of having her on your hands she is being disposed of in the most easily explained and enviable manner its trueits true feather murmured she began to see advantages and the look of a little cat died out or at least modified itself into that of a little cat upon whom dawned prospects of cream no mood ever held her very long she wont come back to stay she said the duchess wont let her i can use her rooms and i shall be very glad to have them theres at least some advantage in figuring as a sort of dame aux camelias chapter xxvii the night before robin went away as she sat alone in the dimness of one light thinking as girls nearly always sit and think on the eve of a change because to youth any change seems to mean the final closing as well as the opening of ways the door of her room was opened and an exquisite and nymphlike figure in pale green stood exactly where the rays of the reading lamp seemed to concentrate themselves in an effort to reveal most purely its delicately startling effect it was her mother in a dress whose springlike tint made her a sort of slim dryad she looked so pretty and young that robin caught her breath as she rose and went forward it is your aged parent come to give you her blessing said feather i was wondering if i might come to your room in the morning robin answered feather seated herself lightly she was not intelligent enough to have any real comprehension of the mood which had impelled her to come she had merely given way to a secret sense of resentment of something which annoyed her she knew however why she had put on the springleaf green dress which made her look like a girl she was not going to let robin feel as if she were receiving a visit from her grandmother she had got that far we dont know each other at all do we she said no answered robin she could not remove her eyes from her loveliness she brought up such memories of the lady downstairs and the desolate child in the shabby nursery mothers are not as intimate with their daughters as they used to be when it was a sort of virtuous fashion to superintend their rice pudding and lecture them about their lessons we have not seen each other often no said robin feathers laugh had again the rather high note coombe had noticed you havent very much to say have you she commented and you stare at me as if you were trying to explain me i dare say you know that you have big eyes and that theyre a good colour but i may as well hint to you that men do not like to be stared at as if their deeps were being searched drop your eyelids robins lids dropped in spite of herself because she was startled but immediately she was startled again by a note in her mothers voicea note of added irritation dont make a habit of dropping them too often it broke out or it will look as if you did it to show your eyelashes girls with tricks of that sort are always laughed at alison carr lives sideways became she has a pretty profile coombe would have recognized the little cat look if he had been watching her as she leaned back in her chair and scrutinized her daughter the fact was that she took in her every point being an astute censor of other womens charms stand up she said robin stood up because she could not well refuse to do so but she coloured because she was suddenly ashamed youre not little but youre not tall her mother said thats against you its the fashion for women to be immensely tall now du mauriers pictures in punch and his idiotic trilby did it clothes are made for giantesses i dont care about it myself but a girls rather out of it if shes much less than six feet high you can sit down a more singular interview between mother and daughter had assuredly rarely taken place as she looked at the girl her resentment of her increased each moment she actually felt as if she were beginning to lose her temper you are what pious people call going out into the world she went on in moral books mothers always give advice and warnings to their girls when theyre leaving them i can give you some warnings you think that because you have been taken up by a dowager duchess everything will be plain sailing youre mistaken you think because you are eighteen and pretty men will fall at your feet i would rather be hideous cried suddenly passionate robin i hate men the silly pretty thing who was responsible for her being grew sillier as her irritation increased thats what girls always pretend but the youngest little idiot knows it isnt true its men who count it makes me laugh when i think of themand of you you know nothing about them and they know everything about you a clever man can do anything he pleases with a silly girl are they all bad robin exclaimed furiously theyre none of them bad theyre only men and thats my warning dont imagine that when they make love to you they do it as if you were the old duchess granddaughter you will only be her paid companion and thats a different matter i will not speak to one of them robin actually began youll be obliged to do what the duchess tells you to do laughed feather as she realized her obvious power to dull the glitter and glow of things which she had felt the girl must be dazzled and uplifted unduly by she was rather like a spiteful schoolgirl entertaining herself by spoiling an envied holiday for a companion old men will run after you and you will have to be nice to them whether you like it or not a queer light came into her eyes lord coombe is fond of girls just out of the schoolroom but if he begins to make love to you dont allow yourself to feel too much flattered robin sprang toward her do you think i dont abhor lord coombe she cried out forgetting herself in the desperate cruelty of the moment havent i reason but there she remembered and stopped but feather was not shocked or alarmed years of looking things in the face had provided her with a mental surface from which tilings rebounded on the whole it even amused her and suited her book that robin should take this tone oh i suppose you mean you know he admires me and pays bills for me where would you have been if he hadnt done it hes been a sort of benefactor i know nothing but that even when i was a little child i could not bear to touch his hand cried robin then feather remembered several things she had almost forgotten and she was still more entertained i believe youve not forgotten through all these years that the boy you fell so indecently in love with was taken away by his mother because lord coombe was your mothers admirer and he was such a sinner that even a baby was contaminated by him donal muir is a young man by this time i wonder what his mother would do now if he turned up at your mistress housethats what she is you know your mistressand began to make love to you she laughed outright youll get into all sorts of messes but that would be the nicest one robin could only stand and gaze at her her moments fire had died down without warning out of the past a wave rose and overwhelmed her then and there it bore with it the wild woe of the morning when a child had waited in the spring sun and her world had fallen into nothingness it came backthe brokenhearted anguish the utter helpless desolation as if she stood in the midst of it again as if it had never passed it was a reincarnation she could not bear it do you hate meas i hate lord coombe she cried out do you want unhappy things to happen to me oh mother why she had never said mother before nature said it for her here the piteous appeal of her youth and lonely young rush of tears was almost intolerably sweet through some subtle cause it added to the thing in her which feather resented and longed to trouble and to hurt you are a spiteful little cat she sprang up to exclaim standing close and face to face with her you think i am an old thing and that im jealous of you because youre pretty and a girl you think women past thirty dont count youll find out mrs muir will count and shes forty if shes a day her sons such a beauty that people go mad over him and he worships herand hes her slave i wish you would get into some mess you couldnt get out of dont come to me if you do the wide beauty of robins gaze and her tear wet bloom were too much feather was quite close to her the spiteful schoolgirl impulse got the better of her dont make eyes at me like that she cried and she actually gave the rose cheek nearest her a sounding little slap there she exclaimed hysterically and she turned about and ran out of the room crying herself robin had parted from mademoiselle vall at charing cross station on the afternoon of the same day but the night before they had sat up late together and talked a long time in effect mademoiselle had said also you are going out into the world but she had not approached the matter in mrs garethlawless mood one may have charge of a girl and be her daily companion for years but there are certain things the very years themselves make it increasingly difficult to say to her and after all why should one state difficult things in exact phrases unless one lacks breeding and is curious anxious she had been at times but not curious so it was that even on this night of their parting it was not she who spoke it was after a few minutes of sitting in silence and looking at the fire that robin broke in upon the quiet which had seemed to hold them both i must learn to remember always that i am a sort of servant i must be very careful it will be easier for me to realize that i am not in my own house than it would be for other girls i have not allowed dowie to dress me for a good many weeks i have learned how to do everything for myself quite well but dowie will be in the house with you and the duchess is very kind every night i have begun my prayers by thanking god for leaving me dowie the girl said i have begun them and ended them with the same words she looked about her and then broke out as if involuntarily i shall be away from here i shall not wear anything or eat anything or sleep on any bed i have not paid for myself these rooms are very pretty we have been very comfortable here mademoiselle said suddenly she felt that if she waited a few moments she would know definitely things she had previously only guessed at have you no little regrets no answered robin no she stood upon the hearth with her hands behind her mademoiselle felt as if her fingers were twisting themselves together and the frenchwoman was peculiarly moved by the fact that she looked like a slim jeune fille of a creature saying a lesson the lesson opened in this wise i dont know when i first began to know that i was different from all other children she said in a soft hot voiceif a voice can express heat perhaps a child who has nothingnothingis obliged to begin to think before it knows what thoughts are if they play and are loved and amused they have no time for anything but growing and being happy you never saw the dreadful little rooms upstairs dowie has told me of them said mademoiselle another child might have forgotten them i never shall ii was so little and they were full of something awful it was loneliness the first time andrews pinched me was one day when the thing frightened me and i suddenly began to cry quite loud i used to stare out of the window andi dont know when i noticed it firsti could see the children being taken out by their nurses and there were always two or three of them and they laughed and talked and skipped the nurses used to laugh and talk too andrews never did when she took me to the gardens the other nurses sat together and chattered and their children played games with other children once a little girl began to talk to me and her nurse called her away andrews was very angry and jerked me by my arm and told me that if ever i spoke to a child again she would pinch me devil exclaimed the frenchwoman i used to think and think but i could never understand how could i a baby cried mademoiselle vall and she got up and took her in her arms and kissed her chre petite ange she murmured when she sat down again her cheeks were wet robins were wet also but she touched them with her handkerchief quickly and dried them it was as if she had faltered for a moment in her lesson did dowie ever tell you anything about donal she asked hesitatingly something he was the little boy you played with yes he was the first human creature she said it very slowly as if trying to find the right words to express what she meant the first human creature i had ever known you see mademoiselle hehe knew everything he had always been happy he belonged to people and things i belonged to nobody and nothing if i had been like him he would not have seemed so wonderful to me i was in a kind of delirium of joy if a creature who had been deaf dumb and blind had suddenly awakened and seeing on a summer day in a world full of flowers and sunit might have seemed to them as it seemed to me you have remembered it through all the years said mademoiselle like that it was the first time i became alive one could not forget it we only played as children play butit was a delirium of joy i could not bear to go to sleep at night and forget it for a moment yes i remember itlike that there is a dream i have every now and then and it is more real thanthan this is with a wave of her hand about her i am always in a real garden playing with a real donal and his eyeshis eyes she paused and thought there is a look in them that is likeit is just likethat first morning the change which passed over her face the next moment might have been said to seem to obliterate all trace of the childish memory he was taken away by his mother that was the beginning of my finding out she said i heard andrews talking to her sister and in a baby way i gathered that lord coombe had sent him i hated lord coombe for years before i found out that he hadntand that there was another reason after that it took time to puzzle things out and piece them together but at last i found out what the reason had been then i began to make plans these are not my rooms glancing about her again these are not my clothes with a little pull at her dress im not a strong character mademoiselle as i wanted to be but i havent one little regretnot one she kneeled down and put her arms round her old friends waist lifting her face im like a leaf blown about by the wind i dont know what it will do with me where do leaves go one never knows really she put her face down on mademoiselles knee then and cried with soft bitterness when she bade her goodbye at charing cross station and stood and watched the train until it was quite out of sight afterwards she went back to the rooms for which she felt no regrets and before she went to bed that night feather came and gave her farewell maternal advice and warning chapter xxviii that a previously scarcely suspected daughter of mrs garethlawless had become a member of the household of the dowager duchess of darte stirred but a passing wave of interest in a circle which was not that of mrs garethlawless herself and which upon the whole but casually acknowledged its curious existence as a modern abnormality also the attitude of the duchess herself was composedly free from any admission of necessity for comment i have no pretty young relative who can be spared to come and live with me i am fond of things pretty and young and i am greatly pleased with what a kind chance put in my way she said in her discussion of the situation with coombe she measured it with her customary fine acumen forty years ago it could not have been done the girl would have been made uncomfortable and outside things could not have been prevented from dragging themselves in filial piety in the mass would have demanded that the mother should be accounted for now a genial knowledge of a variety in mothers leaves mrs garethlawless to play about with her own probably quite amusing set once poor robin would have been held responsible for her and so should i my position would have seemed to defy serious moral issues but we have reached a sane habit of detaching people from their relations a nice condition we should be in if we had not you of course know that henry died suddenly in some sort of fit at ostend coombe said it as if in a form of reply she had naturally become aware of it when the rest of the world did but had not seen him since the event one did not suppose his constitution would have lasted so long she answered you are more fortunate in young donal muir have you seen him and his mother i made a special journey to braemarnie and had a curious interview with mrs muir when i say curious i dont mean to imply that it was not entirely dignified it was curious only because i realize that secretly she regards with horror and dread the fact that her boy is the prospective head of the house of coombe she does not make a jest of it as i have had the temerity to do its a cheap defense this trick of making an eternal jest of things but it is a defense and one has formed the habit she has never done ithelen muir his friend said on the whole i believe she at times knows that she has been too grave she was a beautiful creature passionately in love with her husband when such a husband is taken away from such a woman and his child is left it often happens that the flood of her love is turned into one current and that it is almost overwhelming she is too sane to have coddled the boy and made him effeminatewhat has she done instead he is a splendid young highlander he would be too goodlooking if he were not as strong and active as a young stag all she has done is to so fill him with the power and sense of her charm that he has not seen enough of the world or learned to care for it she is the one woman on earth for him and life with her at braemarnie is all he asks for your difficulty will be that she will not be willing to trust him to your instructions i have not as much personal vanity as i may seem to have coombe said i put all egotism modestly aside when i talked to her and tried to explain that i would endeavour to see that he came to no harm in my society my heir presumptive and i must see something of each other and he must become intimate with the prospect of his responsibilities more will be demanded of the next marquis of coombe than has been demanded of me and it will be demanded not merely hoped for or expected and it will be the overwhelming forces of fate which will demand itnot mere tenants or constituents or the general public have you any views as to what will be demanded was her interested question none neither has anyone else who shares my opinion no one will have any until the readjustment comes but before the readjustment there will be the pouring forth of bloodthe blood of magnificent lads like donal muirperhaps his own bloodmy god and there may be left no head of the house of coombe from the duchess there will be many a house left without its headhouses great and small and if the peril of it were more generally foreseen at this date it would be less perilous than it is lads like that said the old duchess bitterly lads in their strength and joy and bloom it is hideous in all their young virility and promise for a next generationthe strong young fathers of forever unborn millions its damnable and it will be so not only in england but all over a blood drenched world it was in this way they talked to each other of the black tragedy for which they believed the worlds stage already being set in secret and though there were here and there others who felt the ominous inevitability of the raising of the curtain the rest of the world looked on in careless indifference to the significance of the open training of its actors and even the resounding hammerings of its stage carpenters and builders in these days the two discussed the matter more frequently and even in the tone of those who waited for the approach of a thing drawing nearer every day each time the head of the house of coombe made one of his socalled week end visits to the parts an englishman can reach only by crossing the channel he returned with new knowledge of the special direction in which the wind veered in the blowing of those straws he had so long observed with absorbed interest above all the common sounds of daily human life one hears in that one land the rattle and clash of arms and the unending thudding tread of marching feet he said after one such visit two generations of men creatures bred and born and trained to live as parts of a huge death dealing machine have resulted in a monstrous construction each man is a part of it and each parts greatest ambition is to respond to the shouted word of command as a mechanical puppet responds to the touch of a spring to each unit of the millions love of his own country means only hatred of all others and the belief that no other should be allowed existence the sacred creed of each is that the immensity of germany is such that there can be no room on the earth for another than itself blood and iron will clear the world of the inferior peoples to the masses that is their gods will their god is an understudy of their kaiser you are not saying that as part of the trick of making a jest of things i wish to god i were the poor huge inhuman thing he has built does not know that when he was a boy he did not play at war and battles as other boys do but as a creature obsessed he has played at soldiers with his people as his toys throughout all his morbid lifeand he has hungered and thirsted as he has done it a bible lay upon the table and the duchess drew it towards her there is a verse here she said i will find it she turned the pages and found it listen know this and lay it to thy heart this day jehovah is god in heaven above and on the earth beneath there is none else that is a power which does not confine itself to germany or to england or france or to the map of europe it is the law of the universeand even wilhelm the second cannot bend it to his almighty will there is none else there is none else repeated coombe slowly if there existed a human being with the power to drive that home as a truth into his delirious brain i believe he would die raving mad to him there is no first cause which was not made in germany and it is one of his most valuable theatrical assets it is part of his paraphernalialike the jangling of his sword and the glitter of his orders he shakes it before his people to arrest the attention of the simple and honest ones as one jingles a rattle before a child there are those among them who are not so readily attracted by terms of blood and iron but they will be called upon to shed blood and to pour forth their own there will be young things like donal muirlads with ruddy cheeks and with white bodies to be torn to fragments she shuddered as she said it i am afraid she said i am afraid so am i coombe answered of what is coming what a fool i have been how long will it be before other men awaken to say the same thing each mans folly is his own shame he drew himself stiffly upright as a man might who stood before a firing squad i had a life to live or to throw away because i was hideously wounded at the outset i threw it aside as done for i said there is neither god nor devil vice nor virtue love nor hate i will do and leave undone what i choose i had power and brain and money a man who could see clearly and who had words to choose from might have stood firmly in the place to which he was born and have spoken in a voice which might have been listened to he might have fought against folly and blindness and lassitude i deliberately chose privately to sneer at the thought of lifting a hand to serve any thing but the cold fool who was myself life passes quickly it does not turn back he ended with a short harsh laugh this is fear he said fear clears a mans mind of rubbish and nonessentials it is because i am afraid that i accuse myself and it is not for myself or you but for the whole world which before the end comes will seem to fall into fragments you have been seeing ominous signs the duchess said leaning forward and speaking low there have been affectionate visits to vienna there is a certain thing in the airin the arrogance of the bearing of men clanking their sabres as they stride through the streets there is an exultant eagerness in their eyes things are said which hold scarcely concealed braggart threats they have always been given to that sort of thingbut now it strikes one as a thing unleashedor barely leashed at all the background of the sound of clashing arms and the thudding of marching feet is more unendingly present one cannot get away from it the great munition factories are working night and day in the streets in private houses in the shops one hears and recognizes signs they are signs which might not be clear to one who has not spent years in looking on with interested eyes but i have watched too long to see only the surface of things the nation is waiting for somethingwaiting what will be the pretextwhat the duchess pondered any pretext will door noneexcept that germany must have what she wants and that she is strong enough to take itafter forty years of building her machine and we others have built none we almost deserve whatever comes to us the old womans face was darkly grave in three villages where i chance to be lord of the manor i have by means of my own set lads drilling and training it is supposed to be a form of amusement and an eccentric whim of mine and it is a change from eternal cricket i have given prizes and made an occasional speech on the ground that english brawn is so enviable a possession that it ought to develop itself to the utmost when i once went to the length of adding that each englishman should be muscle fit and ready in case of englands sudden need i saw the lads grin cheerfully at the thought of england in any such unenglish plight their innocent swaggering belief that the country is always ready for everything moved my heart of stone and it is men like myself who are to blamenot merely men of my class but men of my kind those who have chosen to detach themselves from everything but the living of life as it best pleased their tastes or served their personal ambitions are we going to be taught that man cannot argue without including his fellow man are we going to be forced to learn it she said yesforced nothing but force could reach us the race is an undeveloped thing a few centuries later it will have evolved another sense this century may see the first huge stepbecause the power of a cataclysm sweeps it forward he turned his glance towards the opening door robin came in with some letters in her hand he was vaguely aware that she wore an aspect he was unfamiliar with the girl of mrs garethlawless had in the past as it went without saying expressed the final note of priceless simplicity and mode the more finely simple she looked the more priceless the unfamiliarity in her outward seeming lay in the fact that her quiet dun tweed dress with its lines of white at neck and wrists was not priceless though it was well made it in fact unobtrusively suggested that it was meant for service rather than for adornment her hair was dressed closely and her movements were very quiet coombe realized that her greeting of him was delicately respectful i have finished the letters she said to the duchess i hope they are what you want sometimes i am afraid dont be afraid said the duchess kindly you write very correct and graceful little letters they are always what i want have you been out today not yet robin hesitated a little have i your permission to ask mrs james if it will be convenient to her to let dowie go with me for an hour yes as kindly as before for two hours if you like i shall not drive this afternoon thank you said robin and went out of the room as quietly as she had entered it when the door closed the duchess was smiling at lord coombe i understand her she said she is sustained and comforted by her pretty air of servitude she might use dowie as her personal maid and do next to nothing but she waits upon herself and punctiliously asks my permission to approach mrs james the housekeeper with any request for a favour her one desire is to be sure that she is earning her living as other young women do when they are paid for their work i should really like to pet and indulge her but it would only make her unhappy i invent tasks for her which are quite unnecessary for years the little shutup soul has been yearning and praying for this opportunity to stand honestly on her own feet and she can scarcely persuade herself that it has been given to her it must not be spoiled for her i send her on errands my maid could perform i have given her a little room with a serious business air it is full of files and papers and she sits in it and copies things for me and even looks over accounts she is clever at looking up references i have let her sit up quite late once or twice searching for detail and dates for my use it made her bloom with joy you are quite the most delightful woman in the world said coombe quite chapter xxix in the serious little room the duchess had given to her robin built for herself a condition she called happiness she drew the spiritual substance from which it was made from her pleasure in the books of reference closely fitted into their shelves in the files for letters and more imposing documents in the varieties of letter paper and envelopes of different sizes and materials which had been provided for her use in case of necessity you may not use the more substantial ones often but you must be prepared for any unexpected contingency the duchess had explained thereby smoothing her pathway by the suggestion of responsibilities the girl did not know the extent of her employers consideration for her but she knew that she was kind with a special grace and comprehension a subtle truth she also did not recognize was that the remote flame of her own being was fiercely alert in its readiness to leap upward at any suspicion that her duties were not worth the payment made for them and that for any reason which might include lord coombe she was occupying a position which was a sinecure she kept her serious little room in order herself dusting and almost polishing the reference books arranging and rearranging the files with such exactness of system that she couldas is the vaunt of the model of orderly perfectionlay her hand upon any document in the dark she was punctualitys self and held herself in readiness at any moment to appear at the duchess side as if a magician had instantaneously transported her there before the softly melodious private bell connected with her room had ceased to vibrate the correctness of her deference to the convenience of mrs james the housekeeper in her simplest communication with dowie quite touched that respectable persons heart shes a young lady mrs james remarked to dowie and a credit to you and her governess mrs dowson young ladies have gone almost out of fashion mademoiselle vall had spent her governessing days among the highest my own places were always with gentlepeople nothing ever came near her that could spoil her manners a good heart she was born with was the civil reply of dowie nothing ever came near her mrs james politely checked what she became conscious was a sort of unconscious exclamation nothing said dowie going on with her sheet hemming steadily robin wrote letters and copied various documents for the duchess she went shopping with her and executed commissions to order she was allowed to enter into correspondence with the village schoolmistress and the wife of the vicar at darte norham and to buy prizes for notable decorum and scholarship in the school and baby linen and blankets for the maternity bag and other benevolences she liked buying prizes and the baby clothes very much becausethough she was unaware of the facther youth delighted in youngness and the fulfilling of young desires even oftener and more significantly than ever did eyes turn towards hertry to hold herslook after her eagerly when she walked in the streets or drove with the duchess in the highswung barouche more and more she became used to it and gradually she ceased to be afraid of it and began to feel it nearly alwaysthere were sometimes exceptionsa friendly thing she saw friendliness in it because when she caught sight as she so often did of young things like herself passing in pairs laughing and talking and turning to look into each others eyes her being told her that it was sweet and human and inevitable they always turned and looked at each otherthese pairsand then they smiled or laughed or flushed a little as she had not known when first she recognized as she looked down into the street from her nursery window that the children nearly always passed in twos or threes and laughed and skipped and talked so she did not know when she first began to notice these joyous young pairs and a certain touch of exultation in them and feel that it was sweet and quite a simple common natural thing her noting and being sometimes moved by it was as natural as her pleasure in the opening of spring flowers or the new thrill of spring birdsbut she did not know that either the brain which has worked through many years in unison with the soul to which it was apportioned has evolved a knowledge which has deep cognizance of the universal law the brain of the old duchess had so worked keeping pace always with its guide never visualizing the possibility of working alone also never falling into the abyss of that human folly whose conviction is that all that one sees and gives a special name to is all that existsor that the names accepted by the world justly and clearly describe qualities yearnings moods as they are this had developed within her wide perception and a wisdom which was sane and kind to tenderness as she drove through the streets with robin beside her she saw the following eyes she saw the girls soft friendly look at the young creatures who passed her glowing and uplifted by the joy of life and she was moved and even disturbed after her return from one particular mornings outing she sent for dowie you have taken care of miss robin since she was a little child she began she was not quite six when i first went to her your grace you are not of the women who only feed and bathe a child and keep her well dressed you have been a sort of mother to her ive tried to your grace ive loved her and watched over her and shes loved me i do believe that is why i want to talk to you about her dowie if you were the woman who merely comes and goes in a childs life i could not she isa very beautiful young thing dowie from her little head to her slim bits of feet your grace no one knows better than i do the duchess renowned smile revealed itself a beautiful young thing ought to see and know other beautiful young things and make friends with them that is one of the reasons for their being put in the world since she has been with me she has spoken to no one under forty has she never had young friends never your grace once twoyoung baggageswere left to have tea with her and they talked to her about divorce scandals and corespondents she never wanted to see them again dowies face set itself in lines of perfectly correct inexpressiveness and she added they set her asking me questions i couldnt answer and she broke down because she suddenly understood why no your grace shes not known those of her own age she isof the ignorance of a child the duchess thought it out slowly she thinks not poor lamb but she is dowie answered the duchess eyes met hers and they looked at each other for a moment dowie tried to retain a noncommittal steadiness and the duchess observing the intention knew that she was free to speak lord coombe confided to me that she had passed through a hideous danger which had made a lasting impression on her she said in a low voice he told me because he felt it would explain certain reserves and fears in her sometimes she wakes up out of nightmares about it said dowie and she creeps into my room shivering and i take her into my bed and hold her in my arms until shes over the panic she says the worst of it is that she keeps thinking that there may have been other girls trapped like herand that they did not get away the duchess was very thoughtful she saw the complications in which such a horror would involve a girls mind if she consorted with other young things and talked nonsense with them and shared their pleasures she would forget it she said ah exclaimed dowie thats it the question in the duchess eyes when she lifted them required an answer and she gave it respectfully the thing that happened was only the last touch put to what shed gradually been finding out as she grew from child to young girl the ones she would like to knowshe said it in plain words once to mademoisellemight not want to know her i must take the liberty of speaking plain your grace or its no use me speaking at all she holds it deep in her mind that shes a sort of young outcast i must convince her that she is not it was the beginning of what the duchess had meant to say but she actually found herself pausing held for the moment by dowies quiet civil eye was your grace in your kindness thinking was what the excellent woman said yes that i would invite young people to meet herhelp them to know each other and to make friends and even as she said it she was conscious of being slightly under the influence of dowies wise gaze your grace only knows those young people she would like to know it was a mere simple statement people are not as censorious as they once were her graces tone was intended to reply to the suggestion lying in the words which had worn the air of statement without comment some are not but some are dowie answered theres two worlds in london now your grace one is your graces and one is mrs garethlawless i have heard say there are others between but i only know those two the duchess pondered again you are thinking that what miss robin said to mademoiselle vall might be truein mine and perhaps you are not altogether wrong even if you are not altogether right until i went to take care of miss robin i had only had places in families mrs garethlawless set didnt touch anywhere what im remembering is that there was astrictnessshown sometimes even when it seemed a bit harsh among the servants the older ones said that is was because of the new sets and their fast wicked ways one of my young ladies once met another young lady about her own ageshe was just fifteenat a charity bazaar and they made friends and liked each other very much the young ladys mother was one there was a lot of talk about in connection with a person of very high stationthe highest your graceand everyone knew the girl was a lovely little creature and beautifully behaved it was said her mother wanted to push her into the world she couldnt get into herself the acquaintance was stopped your graceit was put a stop to at once and my poor little young lady quite broke her heart over it and i heard it was much worse for the other i will think this over the duchess said it needs thinking over i wished to talk to you because i have seen that she has fixed little ideas regarding what she thinks is suited to her position as a paid companion and she might not be prepared i wish you to see that she has a pretty little frock or so which she could wear if she required them she has two your grace dowie smiled affectionately as she said it one for evening and one for special afternoon wear in case your grace needed her to attend you for some reason they are as plain as she dare make them but when she puts one on she cant help giving it a look yesshe would give it all it needed her grace said thank you dowie you may go with her sketch of a respectful curtsey dowie went towards the door as she approached it her step became slower before she reached it she had stopped and there was a remarkable look on her facea suddenly heroic look she turned and made several steps backward and paused again which unexpected action caused the duchess to turn to glance at her when she glanced her grace recognized the heroic look and waited with a consciousness of some slight new emotion within herself for its explanation your grace dowie began asking god himself to give courage if she was doing right and to check her if she was making a mistake when your grace was thinking of the parents of other young ladies and gentlemendid it come to you to put it to yourself whether youd be willing she caught her breath but ended quite clearly respectfully reasonably lady kathrynlord halwyn lady kathryn was the duchess young granddaughter lord halwyn was her extremely goodlooking grandson who was in the army the duchess understood what the heroic look had meant and her respect for it was great its intention had not been to suggest inclusion of george and kathryn in her plan it had only with pure justice put it to her to ask herself what her own personal decision in such a matter would be you do feel as if you were her mother she said and you are a practical clearminded woman it is only if i myself am willing to take such a step that i have a right to ask it of other people lady lothwell is the mother i must speak to first her children are mine though i am a mere grandmother lady lothwell was her daughter and though she was not regarded as victorian either of the early or the middle periods dowie as she returned to her own comfortable quarters wondered what would happen chapter xxx what did occur was not at all complicated it would not have been possible for a woman to have spent her girlhood with the cleverest mother of her day and have emerged from her training either obstinate or illogical lady lothwell listened to as much of the history of robin as her mother chose to tell her and plainly felt an amiable interest in it she knew much more detail and gossip concerning mrs garethlawless than the duchess herself did she had heard of the child who was kept out of sight and she had been somewhat disgusted by a vague story of lord coombes abnormal interest in it and the ugly hint that he had an object in view it was too unpleasantly morbid to be true of a man her mother had known for years of course you were not thinking of anything large or formal she said after a moment of smiling hesitation no i am not launching a girl into society i only want to help her to know a few nice young people who are goodnatured and wellmannered she is not the ordinary old ladys companion and if she were not so strict with herself and with me i confess i should behave towards her very much as i should behave to kathryn if you could spare her to live with me she is a heartwarming young thing because i am known to have one of my eccentric fancies for her and because after all her father was well connected her present position will not be the obstacle she is not the first modern girl who has chosen to support herself but isnt she much too pretty much but she doesnt flaunt it but heartwarmingand too pretty dearest mamma lady lothwell laughed again she can do no harm to kathryn but i own that if george were not at present quite madly in love with a darling being at least fifteen years older than himself i should pause to reflect mrs stacy will keep him steadymrs alan stacy you knowthe one with the magnificent henna hair and the eyes that droop no boy of twentytwo can resist her they call her adorers the infant school a small dinner and a small danceand george and kathryn may be the beginning of an interesting experiment it would be pretty and kind of you to drop in during the course of the evening are you hoping toperhapsmake a marriage for her lady lothwell asked the question a shade disturbedly you are so amazing mamma darling that i know you will do it if you believe in it you seem to be able to cause the things you really want to evolve from the universe she is the kind of girl whose place in the universe is in the home of some young man whose own place in the universe is in the heart and soul and life of her kind of girl they ought to carry out the will of god by falling passionately in love with each other they ought to marry each other and have a large number of children as beautiful and rapturously happy as themselves they would assist in the evolution of the race oh mamma how delightful you always are for a really brilliant woman you are the most adorable dreamer in the world dreams are the only things which are true the rest are nothing but visions angel her daughter laughed a little adoringly as she kissed her i will do whatever you want me to do i always did didnt i its your way of making one see what you see when you are talking that does it it was understood before they parted that kathryn and george would be present at the small dinner and the small dance and that a few other agreeable young persons might be trusted to join them and that lady lothwell and perhaps her husband would drop in its your being almost early victorian mamma which makes it easy for you to initiate things you will initiate little miss lawless it was rather neat of her to prefer to drop the gareth there has been less talk in late years of the different classes keeping their placesupper and lower classes really strikes one as vulgar we may keep our places the duchess said we may hold on to them as firmly as we please it is the places themselves which are moving my dear it is not unlike the beginning of a landslide robin went to dowies room the next evening and stood a moment in silence watching her sewing before she spoke she looked anxious and even pale her grace is going to give a party to some young people dowie she said she wishes me to be present ii dont know what to do what you must do my dear is to put on your best evening frock and go downstairs and enjoy yourself as the other young people will her grace wants you to see someone your own age was dowies answer but i am not like the others i am only a girl earning her living as a companion how do i know her grace knows dowie said and what she asks you to do it is your duty to doand do it prettily robin lost even a shade more colour do you realize that i have never been to a party in my lifenot even to a childrens party dowie i shall not know how to behave myself you know how to talk nicely to people and you know how to sit down and rise from your chair and move about a room like a quiet young lady you dance like a fairy you wont be asked to do anything more the duchess reflected robin aloud slowly would not let me come downstairs if she did not know that people wouldbe kind lady kathryn and lord halwyn are coming they are her own grandchildren dowie said how did you know that robin inquired robins colour began to come back its not what usually happens to girls in situations she said her grace herself isnt what usually happens said dowie there is no one like her for high wisdom and kindness having herself awakened to the truth of this confidenceinspiring fact robin felt herself supported by it one knew what farsighted perception and clarity of experienced vision this one woman had gained during her many years of life if she had elected to do this thing she had seen her path clear before her and was not offering a gift which awkward chance might spoil or snatch away from the hand held out to receive it a curious slow warmth began to creep about robins heart and in its mounting gradually fill her being it was true she had been taught to dance to move about and speak prettily she had been taught a great many things which seemed to be very carefully instilled into her mind and body without any special reason she had not been aware that lord coombe and mademoiselle vall had directed and discussed her training as if it had been that of a young royal person whose equipment must be a flawless thing if the dowager duchess of darte had wished to present her at court some fair morning she would have known the length of the train she must wear where she must make her curtseys and to whom and to what depth how to kiss the royal hand and how to manage her train when she retired from the presence when she had been taught this she had asked mademoiselle vall if the training was part of every girls education and mademoiselle had answered it is best to know everythingeven ceremonials which may or may not prove of use it all forms part of a background and prevents one from feeling unfamiliar with customs when she had passed the young pairs in the streets she had found an added interest in them because of this background she could imagine them dancing together in fairy ball rooms whose lights and colours her imagination was obliged to construct for her out of its own fabric she knew what the girls would look like if they went to a drawing room and she often wondered if they would feel shy when the page spread out their lovely peacock tails for them and left them to their own devices it was mere nature that she should have pondered and pondered and sometimes unconsciously longed to feel herself part of the flood of being sweeping past her as she stood apart on the brink of the river the warmth about her heart made it beat a little faster she opened the door of her wardrobe when she found herself in her bedroom the dress hung modestly in its corner shrouded from the penetration of london fogs by clean sheeting it was only white and as simple as she knew how to order it but mademoiselle had taken her to a young french person who knew exactly what she was doing in all cases and because the girl had the supple lines of a wood nymph and the eyes of young antelope she had evolved that which expressed her as a petal expresses its rose robin locked her door and took the dress down and found the silk stockings and slippers which belonged to it she put them all on standing before her long mirror and having left no ungiven last touch she fell a few steps backward and looked at herself turning and balancing herself as a bird might have done she turned lightly round and round yes i am she said i amvery the next instant she laughed at herself outright how silly how silly she said almost everybody ismore or less i wonder if i remember the new steps for she had been taught the new stepsthe new walking and swayings and pauses and sudden swirls and swoops and her new dress was as short as other fashionable girls dresses were but in her case revealed a haunting delicacy of contour and line so before her mirror she danced alone and as she danced her lips parted and her breast rose and fell charmingly and her eyes lighted and glowed as any girls might have done or as a joyous girl nymphs might have lighted as she danced by a pool in her forest seeing her loveliness mirrored there something was awakening as something had awakened when donal had kissed a child under the soot sprinkled london trees chapter xxxi the whole day before the party was secretly exciting to robin she knew how much more important it seemed to her than it really was if she had been six years old she might have felt the same kind of uncertain thrills and tremulous wonders she hid herself behind the window curtains in her room that she might see the men putting up the crimson and white awning from the door to the carriage step the roll of red carpet they took from their van had a magic air the ringing of the door bell which meant that things were being delivered the extra moving about of servants the florists men who went into the drawingrooms and brought flowers and big tropical plants to rearrange the conservatory and fill corners which were not always decoratedeach and every one of them quickened the beating of her pulses if she had belonged in her past to the ordinary cheerful world of children she would have felt by this time no such elation but she had only known of the existence of such festivities as childrens parties because once a juvenile ball had been given in a house opposite her mothers and she had crouched in an almost delirious little heap by the nursery window watching carriages drive up and deposit fluffy pink and white and blue children upon the strip of red carpet and had seen them led or running into the house she had caught sounds of strains of music and had shivered with rapturebut oh what worlds away from her the party had been she found her way into the drawingrooms which were not usually thrown open they were lofty and stately and seemed to her immense there were splendid crystaldropping chandeliers and side lights which she thought looked as if they would hold a thousand wax candles there was a delightfully embowered corner for the musicians it was all spacious and wonderful in its beautiful completenessits preparedness for pleasure she realized that all of it had always been waiting to be used for the happiness of people who knew each other and were young and ready for delight when the young lothwells had been children they had had dances and frolicking games with other children in the huge rooms and had kicked up their young heels on the polished floors at christmas parties and on birthdays how wonderful it must have been but they had not known it was wonderful as dowie dressed her the reflection she saw in the mirror gave back to her an intensified robin whose curved lips almost quivered as they smiled the soft silk of her hair looked like the night and the small rings on the back of her very slim white neck were things to ensnare the eye and hold it helpless you look your best my dear dowie said as she clasped her little necklace and it is a good best dowie was feeling tremulous herself though she could not have explained why she thought that perhaps it was because she wished that mademoiselle could have been with her robin kissed her when the last touch had been given im going to run down the staircase she said if i let myself walk slowly i shall have time to feel queer and shy and i might seem to creep into the drawingroom i mustnt creep in i must walk in as if i had been to parties all my life she ran down and as she did so she looked like a white bird flying but she was obliged to stop upon the landing before the drawingroom door to quiet a moment of excited breathing still when she entered the room she moved as she should and held her head poised with a delicately fearless air the duchesswho herself looked her best in her fine old ivory profiled waygave her a pleased smile of welcome which was almost affectionate what a perfect little frock she said you are delightfully pretty in it is it quite right said robin mademoiselle chose it for me it is quite right frightfully right george would say george will sit near you at dinner he is my grandsonlord halwyn you know and you will no doubt frequently hear him say things are frightfully something or other during the evening kathryn will say things are deevy or exquig i mention it because you may not know that she means exquisite and divine dont let it frighten you if you dont quite understand their language they are dear handsome things sweeping along in the rush of their bit of century i dont let it frighten me that their world seems to me an entirely new planet robin drew a little nearer her she felt something as she had felt years ago when she had said to dowie i want to kiss you dowie her eyes were pools of childish tenderness because she so well understood the infinitude of the friendly tact which drew her within its own circle with the light humour of its i dont let them frighten me you are kindkind to me she said and i am gratefulgrateful the extremely goodlooking young people who began very soon to drift into the brilliant big roomsingly or in pairs of brother and sisterfilled her with innocent delight they were so well built and gaily at ease with each other and their surroundings so perfectly dressed and finished the filmy narrowness of delicate frocks the shortness of skirts accentuated the youth and girlhood and added to it a sort of child fairylikeness kathryn in exquisite wisps of silverembroidered gauze looked fourteen instead of nearly twentyaided by a dimple in her cheek and a small tilted nose a girl in scarlet tulle was like a child out of a nursery ready to dance about a christmas tree everyone seemed so young and so suggested supple dancing perhaps because dancing was going on everywhere and all the world whether fashionable or unfashionable was driven by a passion for whirling swooping and inventing new postures and fantastic steps the young men had slim straight bodies and light movements their clothes fitted their suppleness to perfection robin thought they all looked as if they had had a great deal of delightful exercise and plenty of pleasure all their lives they were of that stream which had always seemed to be rushing past her in bright pursuit of alluring things which belonged to them as part of their existence but which had had nothing to do with her own youth now the stream had paused as if she had for the moment some connection with it the swift light she was used to seeing illuminate glancing eyes as she passed people in the street she saw again and again as new arrivals appeared kathryn was quite excited by her eyes and eyelashes and george hovered about there was a great deal of hovering at the dinner table sleek young heads held themselves at an angle which allowed of their owners seeing through or around or under floral decorations and alert young eyes showed an eager gleam after dinner was over and dancing began the duchess smiled shrewdly as she saw the gravitating masculine movement towards a certain point it was the point where robin stood with a small growing circle about her it was george who danced with her first he was tall and slender and flexible and his good shoulders had a military squareness of build he had also a nice square face and a warmly blue eye and knew all the latest steps and curves and unexpected swirls robin was an ozier wand and there was no swoop or dart or sudden sway and change she was not alert at the swing and lure of the music the swift movement the fluttering of airy draperies as slim sister nymphs flew past her set her pulses beating with sweet young joy a brief uncontrollable ripple of laughter broke from her before she had circled the room twice how heavenly it is she exclaimed and lifted her eyes to halwyns how heavenly they were not safe eyes to lift in such a way to those of a very young man they gave george a sudden enjoyable shock he had heard of the girl who was a sort of sublimated companion to his grandmother the duchess herself had talked to him a little about her and he had come to the party intending to behave very amiably and help the little thing enjoy herself he had also encountered before in houses where there were no daughters the smart wellborn young companion who was allowed all sorts of privileges because she knew how to assume tiresome little responsibilities and how to be entertaining enough to add cheer and spice to the life of the elderly and lonely sometimes she was a subtly appealing sort of girl and given to being sympathetic and to liking sympathy and quiet corners in conservatories or libraries and sometimes she was capable of scientific flirtation and required scientific management a man had to have his wits about him this one as she flew like a blown leaf across the floor and laughed up into his face with wide eyes produced a new effect and was a new kind its you who are heavenly he answered with a boys laugh you are like a featherand a willow wand you are light too she laughed back and you are like steel as well mrs alan stacy the lady with the magnificent henna hair had recently given less time to him being engaged in the preliminary instruction of a new member of the infant class such things will of course happen and though george had quite ingenuously raged in secret the circumstances left him free to hover and hovering was a pastime he enjoyed let us go on like this forever and ever he said sweeping half the length of the room with her and whirling her as if she were indeed a leaf in the wind forever and ever i wish we could but the music will stop she gave back music ought never to stopnever he answered but the music did stop and when it began again almost immediately another tall flexible young man made a lightning claim on her and carried her away only to hand her to another and he in his turn to another she was not allowed more than a moments rest and borne on the crest of the wave of young delight she did not need more young eyes were always laughing into hers and elating her by a special look of pleasure in everything she did or said or inspired in themselves how was she informed without phrases that for this exciting evening she was a creature without a flaw that the loveliness of her eyes startled those who looked into them that it was a thrilling experience to dance with her that somehow she was new and apart and wonderful no sleekhaired slim and straightbacked youth said exactly any of these things to her but somehow they were conveyed and filled her with a wondering realization of the fact that if they were true they were no longer dreadful and maddening since they only made people like and want to dance with one to dance to like people and be liked seemed so heavenly natural and rightto be only like air and sky and free happy breathing there was it was true a blissful little uplifted look about her which she herself was not aware of but which was singularly stimulating to the masculine beholder it only meant indeed that as she whirled and swayed and swooped laughing she was saying to herself at intervals this is what other girls feel like they are happy like this i am laughing and talking to people just as other girls do i am robin garethlawless but i am enjoying a party like thisa young party lady lothwell sitting near her mother watched the trend of affairs with an occasional queer interested smile well mamma darling she said at last as youth and beauty whirled by in a maelstrom of modern terpsichorean liveliness she is a great success i dont know whether it is quite what you intended or not the duchess did not explain what she had intended she was watching the trend also and thinking a good deal on the whole lady lothwell had scarcely expected that she would explain she rarely did she seldom made mistakes however kathryn in her scant gauzy strips of white and silver having drifted towards them at the moment stood looking on with a funny little disturbed expression on her small tiptilted face theres something about her grandmamma she said all the girls see it and no one knows what it is shes sitting out for a few minutes and just look at georgeand hal bruntonand captain willys they are all laughing of course and pretending to joke but they would like to eat each other up perhaps its her eyelashes she looks out from under them as if they were a curtain lady lothwells queer little smile became a queer little laugh yes it gives her a look of being ecstatically happy and yet almost shy and appealing at the same time men cant stand it of course none of them are trying to stand it answered little lady kathryn somewhat in the tone of a retort i dont believe she knows she does it lady lothwell said quite reflectively she does not know at all that is the worst of it commented the duchess then you see that there is a worst said her daughter the duchess glanced towards kathryn but fortunately the puzzled fret of the girls forehead was even at the moment melting into a smile as a young man of much attraction descended upon her with smiles of his own and carried her into the tango or fox trot or antelope galop whichsoever it chanced to be if she were really aware of it that would be the worst for other peoplefor us probably she could look out from under her lashes to sufficient purpose to call what she wanted and take and keep it as she is not aware it will make things less easy for herselfunder the circumstances the circumstance of being mrs garethlawless daughter is not an agreeable one said lady lothwell it might give some adventurous boys ideas when they had time to realize all it means do you know i am rather sorry for her myself i shouldnt be surprised if she were rather a dear little thing she looks tender and cuddlesome perhaps she is like the heroine of a sentimental novel i read the other day her chief slave said of her she walks into a mans heart through his eyes and sits down there and makes a warm place which will never get cold again rather nice i thought the duchess thought it rather nice also never get cold again she repeated what a heavenly thing to happen to a pair of creaturesif she paused and regarded robin who at the other side of the room was trying to decide some parlous question of dances to which there was more than one claimant she was sweetly puckering her brow over her card and round her were youthful male faces looking eager and even a trifle tense with repressed anxiety for the victory of the moment oh lady lothwell laughed as kitty says theres something about her and its not mere eyelashes you have let loose a germ among us mamma my sweet and you cant do anything with a germ when you have let it loose to quote kitty again look at george the music which came from the bower behind which the musicians were hidden seemed to gain thrill and wildness as the hours went on as the rooms grew warmer the flowers breathed out more reaching scent now and again robin paused for a moment to listen to strange delightful chords and to inhale passing waves of something like mignonette and lilies and apple blossoms in the sun she thought there must be some flower which was like all three in one the rushing stream was carrying her with it as it wentone of the happy petals on its surface could it ever cast her aside and leave her on the shore again while the violins went singing on and the thousand wax candles shone on the faint or vivid colours which mingled into a sort of lovely haze it did not seem possible that a thing so enchanting and so real could have an end at all all the other things in her life seemed less real tonight in the conservatory there was a marble fountain which had long years ago been brought from a palace garden in rome it was not as large as it was beautiful and it had been placed among palms and tropic ferns whose leaves and fronds it splashed merrily among and kept deliciously cool and wetlooking there was a quite intoxicating hothouse perfume of warm damp moss and massed flowers and it was the kind of corner any young man would feel it necessary to gravitate towards with a partner george led robin to it and she naturally sat upon the edge of the marble basin and as naturally drew off a glove and dipped her hand into the water splashing it a little because it felt deliciously cool george stood near at first and looked down at her bent head it was impossible not also to take in her small fine ear and the warm velvet white of the lovely little nape of her slim neck he took them in with elated appreciation he was not subtle minded enough to be aware that her reply to a casual remark he had made to her at dinner had had a remote effect upon him one of the loveliest creatures i ever saw was a mrs garethlawless he had said are you related to her i am her daughter robin had answered and with a slightly startled sensation he had managed to slip into amiably deft generalities while he had secretly wondered how much his grandmother knew or did not know an involuntary thought of feather had crossed his mind once or twice during the evening this was the girl who it was said had actually been saved up for old coombe ugly morbid sort of idea if it was true how had the duchess got hold of her and why and what was coombe really up to could he have some elderly idea of wanting a youngster for a wife occasionally an old chap did serve him right if some young chap took the wind out of his sails he was not a desperate character but he had been very intimate with mrs alan stacy and her friends and it had made him careless also robin had drawn himdrawn him more than he knew is it still heavenly he asked how pointed her fingers were and how soft and crushable her hand looked as it splashed like a childs more heavenly every minute she answered he laughed outright the heavenly thing is the way you are enjoying it yourself i never saw a girl light up a whole room before you throw out stars as you dance thats like a skyrocket robin laughed back and its because in all my life i never went to a dance before never you mean except to childrens parties there were no childrens parties this is the firstfirstfirst well i dont see how that happened but i am glad it did because its been a great thing for me to see you at your firstfirstfirst he sat down on the fountains edge near her i shall not forget it he said i shall remember it as long as i live said robin and she lifted her unsafe eyes again and smiled into his which made them still more unsafe perhaps it was because he was extremely young perhaps it was because he was immoral perhaps because he had never held a tight rein on his fleeting emotions even the next moment he felt that it was because he was an idiotbut suddenly he found he had let himself go and was kissing the warm velvet of the slim little napehad kissed it twice he had not given himself time to think what would happen as a result but what did happen was humiliating and ridiculous one furious splash of the curled hand flung water into his face and eyes and mouth while robin tore herself free from him and stood blazing with fury and woefor it was not only fury he saw youyou she cried and actually would have swooped to the fountain again if he had not caught her arm he was furious himselfat himself and at her youlittle fool he gasped what did you do that for even if i was a jackass there was nothing in it youre so pretty youve spoiled everything she flamed everythingeverything ive spoiled nothing ive only been a fooland its your own fault for being so pretty youve spoiled everything in the world now with a desolate horrible little sob now i can only go backback he had a queer idea that she spoke as if she were cinderella and he had made the clock strike twelve her voice had such absolute grief in it that he involuntarily drew near her i say he was really breathless dont speak like that i beg pardon ill grovel dontoh kathryncome here this last because at this difficult moment from between the banks of hothouse bloom and round the big palms his sister kathryn suddenly appeared she immediately stopped short and stared at them bothlooking from one to the other what is the matter she asked in a low voice oh come and talk to her george broke forth i feel as if she might scream in a minute and call everybody in ive been a lunatic and she has apparently never been kissed before tell hertell her youve been kissed yourself a queer little look revealed itself in kathryns face a delicate vein of her grandmothers wisdom made part of her outlook upon a rapidly moving and exciting world she had never been hidebound or dull and for a slight gauzy white and silver thing she was astute dont be impudent she said to george as she walked up to robin and put a cool hand on her arm hes only been silly youd better let him off she said she turned a glance on george who was wiping his sleeve with a handkerchief and she broke into a small laugh did she push you into the fountain she asked cheerfully she threw the fountain at me grumbled george i shall have to dash off home and change i would replied kathryn still cheerful you can apologize better when youre dry he slid through the palms like a snake and the two girls stood and gazed at each other robins flame had died down and her face had settled itself into a sort of hardness kathryn did not know that she herself looked at her as the duchess might have looked at another girl in the quite different days of her youth ill tell you something now hes gone she said i have been kissed myself and so have other girls i know boys like george dont really matter though of course its bad manners but who has got good manners things rush so that theres scarcely time for manners at all when an older man makes a snatch at you its sometimes detestable but to push him into the fountain was a good idea and she laughed again i didnt push him in i wish you had with a gleeful mischief the next moment however the hint of a worried frown showed itself on her forehead you see she said protestingly you are so frightfully pretty id rather be a leper robin shot forth but kathryn did not of course understand what nonsense she answered what utter rubbish you know you wouldnt come back to the ball room i came here because my mother was asking for george she turned to lead the way through the banked flowers and as she did so added something by the way somebody important has been assassinated in one of the balkan countries they are always assassinating people they like it lord coombe has just come in and is talking it over with grandmamma i can see they are quite excited in their quiet way as they neared the entrance to the ball room she paused a moment with a new kind of impish smile every girl in the room is absolutely shaky with thrills at this particular moment she said and every man feels himself bristling a little the very best looking boy in all england is dancing with sara studleigh he dropped in by chance to call and the duchess made him stay he is a kind of miracle of good looks and takingness robin said nothing she had plainly not been interested in the balkan tragedy and she as obviously did not care for the miracle you dont ask who he is said kathryn i dont want to know oh come you mustnt feel as sulky as that youll want to ask questions the moment you see him i did everyone does his name is donal muir hes lord coombes heir hell be the head of the house of coombe some day here he comes quite excitedly look it was one of the tricks of chanceor fateor whatever you will the dance brought him within a few feet of them at that very moment and the slow walking steps he was taking held himthey were some of the queer stealthy almost stationary steps of the argentine tango he was finely and smoothly fitted as the other youngsters were his blond glossed head was set high on a heroic column of neck he was broad of shoulder but not too broad slim of waist but not too slim long and strong of leg but light and supple and firm he had a fair open brow and a curved mouth laughing to show white teeth robin felt he ought to wear a kilt and plaid and that an eagles feather ought to be standing up from a chieftains bonnet on the fair hair which would have waved if it had been allowed length enough he was scarcely two yards from her now and suddenlyalmost as if he had been calledhe turned his eyes away from sara studleigh who was the little thing in christmas tree scarlet they were blue like the clear water in a tarn when the sun shines on it and they were still laughing as his mouth was straight into hers they laughedstraight into hers chapter xxxii through all aeons since all the worlds were made it is at least not unthinkable that in all the worlds of which our own atom is one there has ruled a force illimitable unconquerable and inexplicable and whichsoever its world and whatsoever the sign denoting or the name given it the forcethe thing has been the same upon our own atom of the universe it is given the generic name of love and its existence is that which the boldest need not defy the most profound need not attempt to explain with clarity the most brilliantly sophistical to argue away its forms of beauty triviality magnificence imbecility loveliness stupidity holiness purity and bestiality neither detract from nor add to its unalterable power as the earth revolves upon its axis and reveals night and day spring summer and winter so it reveals this ceaselessly working force men who were as gods have been uplifted or broken by it fools have trifled with it brutes have sullied it saints have worshipped poets sung and wits derided it as electricity is a force death dealing or illuminating and power bestowing so is this great impeller and it is fatuoushowsoever worldly wise or moderately sardonic one would choose to beto hint ironically that its proportions are less than the ages have proved them whether a world formed without a necessity for the presence and assistance of this psychological factor would have been a better or a worse one it isby good fortunenot here imperative that one should attempt to decide what isexists none of us created it each one will deal with the impeller as he himself either sanely or madly elects he will also bear the consequencesand so also may others of this force the head of the house of coombe and his old friend knew much and had often spoken to each other they had both been accustomed to recognizing its signs subtle or crude and watching their development they had seen it in the eyes of creatures young enough to be called boys and girls they had heard it in musical laughter and in silly giggles they had seen it express itself in tragedy and comedy and watched it end in union or in a nothingness which melted away like a wisp of fog but they knew it was a thing omnipresent and that no one passed through life untouched by it in some degree years before this evening two children playing in a garden had not know that the powerthe thingdrew them with its greatest strength because among myriads of atoms they two were created for oneness enraptured and unaware they played together their souls and bodies drawn nearer each other every hour so it was thatwithout being portentousone may say that when an unusually beautiful and unusually well dressed and perfectly fitted young man turned involuntarily in the particular london ball room in which mrs garethlawless daughter watched the dancers and looked unintentionally into the eyes of a girl standing for a moment near the wide entrance doors the inexplicable and unconquerable force reconnected its currents again donal muirs eyes only widened a little for a seconds time he had not known why he had suddenly looked around and he did not know why he was conscious of something which startled him a little you could not actually stare at a girl because your eyes chanced to get entangled in hers for a second as you danced past her it was true she was of a startling prettiness and there was something yes there was something which drew the eye and he did not know what it was it had actually given him a sort of electric shock he laughed at himself a little and then his open brow looked puzzled for a moment you saw miss lawless said sara studleigh who was at the moment dancing prettily with him she was guilty of something which might have been called a slight giggle but it was goodnatured i know you saw miss lawlessthe pretty one near the door there are so many pretty ones near everything you cant lift your eyes without seeing one donal answered what a lot of them the sense of having received a slight electric shock made you feel that you must look again and find out what had caused it he was thinking she is the one with the eyelashes i have eyelashesso have you looking down at hers with a very taking expression hers were in fact nice ones but ours are not two inches long and they dont make a big soft circle round our eyes when we look at anyone please look up and let me see said donal when i asked you to dance with me i thought what a way he had sara studleigh was thinking but perhaps it was the eyelashes was passing through donals mind very noticeable eyelashes were rather arresting i knew you saw her said sara studleigh because i have happened to be near two or three people this evening when they caught their first sight of her what happens to them asked donal muir they forget where they are she laughed and dont say anything for a few seconds i should not want to forget where i am it wouldnt be possible either answered donal but that was it he thought for a minute i forgot one should not dance with one girl and talk to her about another wisely he led her to other subjects the music was swinging through the air performing its everlasting miracle of swinging young souls and pulses with it the warmed flowers breathed more perceptible scent sweet chatter and laughter swaying colour and glowing eyes concentrated in making magic this beautiful young mans pulses only beat with the restas one with the pulse of the universe lady lothwell acting for the duchess was very kind to him finding him another partner as soon as a new dance beganthis time her own daughter lady kathryn even while he had been tangoing with sara studleigh he had seen the girl with the eyelashes whirling about with someone and when he began his dance with kathryn he caught a glimpse of her at the other end of the room and almost immediately kathryn spoke of her i dont know when you will get a dance with miss lawless she said she is obliged to work out mathematical problems on her programme i have a setter who fixes his eyes on you and waits without moving until you look at him and then he makes a dart and youre obliged to pat him he said perhaps if i go and stand near her and do that she will take notice of me take notice of him the enslaving thing thought kathryn shed jumpfor all her talk about lepersany girl would hes too nice theres something about him too robin did not jump she had no time to do it because one dance followed another so quickly and some of them were even divided in two or three pieces but the thrill of the singing sound of the violins behind the greenery the perfume and stately spaces and thousand candlelights had suddenly been lifted on to another plane though she had thought they could reach no higher one her whole being was a keen fine awareness every moment she was aware after all the yearsfrom the far away dayshe had come back no one had dreamed of the queer half abnormal secret she had always kept to herself as a childas a little girlas a bigger one when she would have died rather than divulge that in her loneliness there had been something she had rememberedsomething she had held on toa memory which she had actually made a companion of making pictures telling herself stories in the dark even inventing conversations which not for one moment had she thought would or could ever take place but they had been living things to her and her one near warm comfortcloser oh so weirdly closer than kind kind dowie and dearly beloved mademoiselle she had wondered if the two would have disapproved if they had knownif mademoiselle would have been shocked if she had realized that sometimes when they walked together there walked with them a growing laughing boy in a swinging kilt and plaid and that he had a voice and eyes that drew the heart out of your breast for joy at first he had only been a child like herself but as she had grown he had grown with herbut always taller grander marvellously masculine and beyond compare yet never once had she dared to believe or hope that he could take form before her eyesa living thing he had only been the shadow she had loved and which could not be taken away from her because he was her secret and no one could ever know the music went swinging and singing with notes which were almost a pain and he was in the very room with her donal donal he had not known and did not know he had laughed into her eyes without knowingbut he had come back a young man now like all the rest but more beautiful what a laugh what wonderful shoulders what wonderful dancing how long and strongly smooth and supple he was in the line fabric of his clothes though her mind did not form these things in words for her it was only that her eyes saw all the charm of him from head to foot and told her that he was only more than ever what he had been in the miraculous first days perhaps he will not find out at all she thought dancing all the while and trying to talk as well as think i was too little for him to remember i only remembered because i had nothing else oh if he should not find out she could not go and tell him even if a girl could do such a thing perhaps he could not recall a childish incident of so long agosuch a small small thing it had only been immense to her and so much water had flowed under his bridge bearing so many flotillas she had only stood and looked down at a thin trickling stream which carried no ships at all it was very difficult to keep her eyes from stealingeven dartingabout in search of him his high fair head with the clipped wave in its hair could be followed if one dared be alert he danced with an auburn haired girl he spun down the room with a brown one he paused for a moment to show the trick of a new step to a tall one with black coils he was at the end of the room he was tangoing towards her and she felt her heart beat and beat he passed close by and his eyes turned upon her and after he had passed a queer little inner trembling would not cease oh if he had looked a little longerif her partner would only carry her past him and how dreadful she was to let herself feel so excited when he could not be expected to remember such a little thingjust a baby playing with him in a garden ohher heart giving a leapif he would lookif he would look when did she first awaken to a realizationafter what seemed years and years of waiting and not being able to conquer the inwardly trembling feelingthat he was beginning to lookthat somehow he had become aware of her presence and that it drew his eyes though there was no special recognition in them down the full length of the room they met hers first and again as he passed with yet another partner then when he was resting between dances and being very gay indeedthough somehow he always seemed gay he had been gay when they played in the gardens yes his eyes cane and found her she thought he spoke of her to someone near him of course robin looked away and tried not to look again too soon but when in spite of intention and even determination something forced her glance and made it a creeping following glancethere were his eyes again she was frightened each time it happened but he was not she began to know with new beatings of the pulse that he no longer looked by chance but because he wanted to see herand wished her to see him as if he had begun to call to her with a gay donal challenge it was like that though his demeanour was faultlessly correct the incident of their meeting was faultlessly correct also when after one of those endless lapses of time lady lothwell appeared and presented him as if the brief ceremony were one of the most ordinary in existence the conventional grace of his bow said no more than georges had said to those looking on but when he put his arm round her and they began to sway together in the dance robin wondered in terror if he could not feel the beating of her heart under his hand if he could it would be horriblebut it would not stop to be so nearto try to believe itto try to make herself remember that she could mean nothing to him and that it was only she who was shakingfor nothing but she could not help it this was the disjointed kind of thing that flew past her mental vision she was not a shy girl but she could not speak curiously enough he also was quite silent for several moments they danced for a space without a word and they did not notice that people began to watch them because they were an attracting pair to watch and the truth was that neither of the two knew in the least what the other thought thatis a beautiful waltz he said at last he said it in a low meaning voice as if it were a sort of emotional confidence he had not actually meant to speak in such a tone but when he realized what its sound had been he did not care in the least what was the matter with him yes robin answered only yes he had not known when he glanced at her first he was saying mentally he could not of course swear to her now but what an extraordinary thing that she was like a swallowshe was like any swift flying thing on a mans arm one could go on to the end of time once round the great ball room twice and as the third round began he gave a little laugh and spoke again i am going to ask you a question may i yes is your name robin yes she could scarcely breathe it i thought it was in the voice in which he had spoken of the music i hoped it wasafter i first began to suspect i hoped it was it isit is did we he had not indeed meant that his arm should hold her a shade closer butin spite of himselfit did because he was after all so little more than a boy did we play together in a garden yesyes breathed robin we did surely she heard a sound as if he had caught a quick breath but after it there were a few more steps and another brief space of silence i knew he said next very low i knew that we played together in a garden you did not know when you first looked at me tonight innocently revealing that even his first glance had been no casual thing to her but his answer revealed something too you were near the doorjust coming into the room i didnt know why you startled me i kept looking for you afterwards in the crowd i didnt see you look said robin softly revealing still more in her utter inexperience no because you wouldnt look at meyou were too much engaged do you like this step i like them all do you always dance like this do you always make your partner feel as if he had danced with you all his life it isbecause we played together in the garden said robin and then was quite terrified at herself because after allafter all they were only two conventional young people meeting for the first time at a dance not knowing each other in the least it was really the first time the meeting of two children could not count but the beating and strange elated inward tremor would not stop as for him he felt abnormal also and he was usually a very normal creature it was abnormal to be so excited that he found himself as it were upon another plane because he had recognized and was dancing with a girl he had not seen since she was five or six it was not normal that he should be possessed by a desire to keep near to her overwhelmed by an impelling wish to talk to herto ask her questions about whatabout herselfthemselvesthe years betweenabout the garden it began to come back bit by bit after i had two fair looks you passed me several times though you didnt know oh had she not known i had been promised some dances by other people but i went to lady lothwell shes very kind back swept the years and it had all begun again the wonderful happinessjust as the anguish had swept back on the night her mother had come to talk to her as he had brought it into her dreary little world then he brought it now he had the power she was so happy that she seemed to be only waiting to hear what he would sayas if that were enough there are phases like thisrare onesand it was her fate that through such a phase she was passing it was indeed true that much more water had passed under his bridge than under hers but now memory reproduced for him with an acuteness like actual pain a childish torment he thought he had forgotten and it was as if it had been endured only yesterdayand as if the urge to speak and explain was as intense as it had been on the first day shes very little and she wont understand he had said to his mother shes very little reallyperhaps shell cry how monstrous it had seemed had she criedpoor little soul he looked down at her eyelashes her cheek had been of the same colour and texture then that came back to him too the impulse to tighten his arms was infernally powerfulalmost automatic she has no one but me to remember he heard his own child voice saying fiercely good lord it was as if it had been yesterday he actually gulped something down in his throat you havent rested much he said aloud theres a conservatory with marble seats and corners and a fountain going will you let me take you there when we stop dancing i want to apologize to you the eyelashes lifted themselves and made round her eyes the big soft shadow of which sara studleigh had spoken a strong and healthy valvular organ in his breast lifted itself curiously at the same time to apologize was he speaking to her almost as if she were still four or five it was to the helplessness of those years he was about to explainand yet he did not feel as though he were still eight i want to tell you why i never came back to the garden it was a broken promise wasnt it the music had not ceased but they stopped dancing will you come he said and she went with him like a childjust as she had followed in her babyhood it seemed only natural to do what he asked the conservatory was like an inner paradise now the tropically scented warmththe tiers on tiers of bloom above bloomthe softened swing of musicthe splash of the fountain on water and leaves their plane had lifted itself too they could hear the splashing water and sometimes feel it in the corner seat of marble he took her to a crystal drop fell on her hand when she sat down the blue of his eyes was vaguely troubled and he spoke as if he were not certain of himself i was wakened up in what seemed to me the middle of the night he said as if indeed the thing had happened only the day before my mother was obliged to go back suddenly to scotland i was only a little chap but it nearly finished me parents and guardians dont understand how gigantic such a thing can be i had promised youwe had promised each otherhadnt we yes said robin her eyes were fixed upon his faceopen and unmoving such eyes such eyes all the touchingness of the past was in their waiting on his words childrenlittle boys especiallyare taught that they must not cry out when they are hurt as i sat in the train through the journey that day i thought my heart would burst in my small breast i turned my back and stared out of the window for fear my mother would see my face id always loved her do you know i think that just then i hated her i had never hated anything before good lord what a thing for a little chap to go through my mother was an angel but she didnt know no said robin in a small strange voice and without moving her gaze she didnt know he had seated himself on a sort of low marble stool near her and he held a knee with clasped hands they were hands which held each other for the moment with a sort of emotional clinch his position made him look upward at her instead of down it was you i was wild about he said you see it was you i could have stood it for myself the trouble was that i felt i was such a big little chap i thought i was yearsages older than youand mountains bigger his faint laugh was touched with pity for the smallness of the big little chap you seemed so tiny and prettyand lonely i was as lonely as a newborn bird fallen out of its nest you had told me you had nothing you said no one had ever kissed you id been loved all my life you had a wondering way of fixing your eyes on me as if i could give you everythingperhaps it was a coxy little chaps conceit that made me love you for itbut perhaps it wasnt you were everything robin saidand the mere simpleness of the way in which she said it brought the garden so near that he smelt the warm hawthorn and heard the distant piano organ and it quickened his breath it was because i kept seeing your eyes and hearing your laugh that i thought my heart was bursting i knew youd go and wait for meand gradually your little face would begin to look different i knew youd believe id come shes littlethat was what i kept saying to myself again and again and shell cryawfullyand shell think i did it shell never know therehe hesitated a momentthere was a kind of mad shame in it as if id betrayed your littleness and your belief though i was too young to know what betraying was just as she had looked at him before as if he could give her everything she was looking at him now in what other way could she look while he gave her this wonderful soothing binding softly all the old wounds with unconscious natural touch because he had really been all her child being had been irradiated and warmed by there was no pose in his mannerno sentimental or flirtatious youths affecting of a picturesque attitude it was real and he told her this thing because he must for his own relief did you cry he said did my little chaps conceit make too much of it i suppose i ought to hope it did robin put her hand softly against her heart no she answered i was only a baby but i think it killed somethinghere he caught a big hard breath oh he said and for a few seconds simply sat and gazed at her but it came to life again he said afterwards i dont know i dont know what it was perhaps it could only live in a very little creature but it was killed i say broke from him it was like wringing a canarys neck when it was singing in the sun a sudden swelling of the music of a new dance swept in to them and he rose and stood up before her thank you for giving me my chance to tell you he said this was the apology you have been kind to listen i wanted to listen robin said i am glad i didnt live a long time and grow old and die without your telling me when i saw you tonight i almost said aloud hes come back im glad i came its queer how one can live a thing over again there have been all the years between for us both for me theres been all a lads lifetutors and eton and oxford and people and lots of travel and amusement but the minute i set eyes on you near the door something must have begun to drag me back ill own ive never liked to let myself dwell on that memory it wasnt a good thing because it had a trick of taking me back in a fiendish way to the little chap with his heart bursting in the railway carriageand the betrayal feeling its morbid to let yourself grouse over what cant be undone so you faded away but when i danced past you somehow i knew id come on something it made me restless i couldnt keep my eyes away decently then all at once i knew i couldnt tell you what the effect was there you were againi was as much obliged to tell you as i should have been if id found you at braemarnie when i got there that night conventions had nothing to do with it it would not have mattered even if youd obviously thought i was a fool you might have thought so you know no i mightnt answered robin there have been no eton and oxford and amusements for me this is my first party she rose as he had done and they stood for a second or so with their eyes resting on each otherseach with a young smile quivering into life which neither was conscious of it was she who first wakened and came back he saw a tiny pulse flutter in her throat and she lifted her hand with a delicate gesture this dance was lord halwyns and weve sat it out we must go back to the ball room isupposewe must he answered with slow reluctancebut he could scarcely drag his eyes away from herseven though he obeyed and they turned and went in the shining ball room the music rose and fell and swelled again into ecstasy as he took her white young lightness in his arm and they swayed and darted and swooped like things of the airwhile the old duchess and lord coombe looked on almost unseeing and talked in murmurs of sarajevo the end publishers note the inflexible limitations of magazine space necessitated the omissionin its serial formof so large a portion of the head of the house of coombe as to eliminate much of the charm of characterization and the creation of atmosphere and background which add so greatly to the power and picturesqueness of the authors work these values having been unavoidably lost in a greatly compressed version it is the publishers desire to produce the story in its entirety and as during its writing it developed into what might be regarded as two novelsso distinctly does it deal with two epochsit has been decided to present it to its public as two separate books the first the head of the house of coombe deals with social life in london during the evolutionary period between the late victorian years and the reign of edward vii and that of his successor previous to the great war it brings lord coombe and donal feather and her girl robin to the summer of it ends with the ending of a world which can never again be the same the second novel robin to be published later continues the story of the same characters facing existence however in a world transformed by tragedy and in which new aspects of character new social economic and spiritual possibilities are to be confronted rising to the surface of life as from the depths of unknown seas readers of the head of the house of coombe will follow the story of robin with intensified interest
