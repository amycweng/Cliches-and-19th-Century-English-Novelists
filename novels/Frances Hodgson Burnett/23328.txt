esmeralda by frances hodgson burnett copyright to begin i am a frenchman a teacher of languages and a poor mannecessarily a poor man as the great world would say or i should not be a teacher of languages and my wife a copyist of great pictures selling her copies at small prices in our own eyes it is true we are not so poormy clelie and i looking back upon our past we congratulate ourselves upon our prosperous condition there was a time when we were poorer than we are now and were not together and were moreover in london instead of in paris these were indeed calamities to be poor to teach to live apart not even knowing each otherand in england in england we spent years we instructed imbeciles of all grades we were chilled by east winds and tortured by influenza we vainly strove to conciliate the appalling english we were discouraged and desolate but this thank le bon dieu is past we are united we have our little apartmentupon the fifth floor it is true but still not hopelessly far from the champs elysees clelie paints her little pictures or copies those of some greater artist and finds sale for them she is not a great artist herself and is charmingly conscious of the fact at fifteen she says i regretted that i was not a genius at five and twenty i rejoice that i made the discovery so early and so gave myself time to become grateful for the small gifts bestowed upon me why should i eat out my heart with envy is it not possible that i might be a less clever woman than i am and a less lucky one on my part i have my pupilsfrench pupils who take lessons in english german or italian english or american pupils who generally learn french and upon the whole i do not suffer from lack of patrons it is my habit when clelie is at work upon a copy in one of the great galleries to accompany her to the scene of her labor in the morning and call for her at noon and in accordance with this habit i made my way to the louvre at midday upon one occasion three years ago i found my wife busy at her easel in the grande galerie and when i approached her and laid my hand upon her shoulder as was my wont she looked up with a smile and spoke to me in a cautious undertone i am glad she said that you are not ten minutes later look at those extraordinary people she still leaned back in her chair and looked up at me but made at the same time one of those indescribable movements of the head which a clever woman can render so significant this slight gesture directed me at once to the extraordinary people to whom she referred are they not truly wonderful she asked there were two of them evidently father and daughter and they sat side by side upon a seat placed in an archway and regarded hopelessly one of the finest works in the gallery the father was a person undersized and elderly his face was tanned and seamed as if with years of rough outdoor labor the effect produced upon him by his clothes was plainly one of actual suffering both physical and mental his stiff hands refused to meet the efforts of his gloves to fit them his body shrank from his garments if he had not been pathetic he would have been ridiculous but he was pathetic it was evident he was not so attired of his own free will that only a patient nature inured by long custom to discomfort sustained him that he was in the gallery under protest that he did not understand the paintings and that they perplexedoverwhelmed him the daughter it is almost impossible to describe and yet i must attempt to describe her she had a slender and pretty figure there were slight marks of the sun on her face also and as in her fathers case the richness of her dress was set at defiance by a strong element of incongruousness she had black hair and gray eyes and she sat with folded hands staring at the picture before her in dumb uninterestedness clelie had taken up her brush again and was touching up her work here and there they have been here two hours she said they are waiting for some one at first they tried to look about them as others did they wandered from seat to seat and sat down and looked as you see them doing now what do you think of them to what nation should you ascribe them they are not french i answered and they are not english if she were english said clelie the girl would be more conscious of herself and of what we might possibly be saying she is only conscious that she is out of place and miserable she does not care for us at all i have never seen americans like them before but i am convinced that they are americans she laid aside her working materials and proceeded to draw on her gloves we will go and look at that tentation de st antoine of teniers she said and we may hear them speak i confess i am devoured by an anxiety to hear them speak according a few moments later an amiable young couple stood before la tentation regarding it with absorbed and critical glances but the father and daughter did not seem to see us they looked disconsolately about them or at the picture before which they sat finally however we were rewarded by hearing them speak to each other the father addressed the young lady slowly and deliberately and with an accent which but for my long residence in england and familiarity with some forms of its patois i should find it impossible to transcribe esmeraldy he said your mas a long time acomin yes answered the girl with the same accent and in a voice wholly listless and melancholy shes a long time clelie favored me with one of her rapid side glances the study of character is her grand passion and her special weakness is a fancy for the singular and incongruous i have seen her stand in silence and regard with positive interest one of her former patronesses who was overwhelming her with contumelious violence seeming entirely unconscious of all else but that the woman was of a species novel to her and therefore worthy of delicate observation it is as i said she whispered they are americans but of an order entirely new almost the next instant she touched my arm here is the mother she exclaimed she is coming this way see a woman advanced rapidly toward our part of the gallerya small angry woman with an un graceful figure and a keen brown eye she began to speak aloud while still several feet distant from the waiting couple come along she said ive found a place at last though ive been all the morning at itand the woman who keeps the door speaks english they call em remarked the husband meekly rising conserges i wonder why the girl rose also still with her hopeless abstracted air and followed the mother who led the way to the door seeing her move forward my wife uttered an admiring exclamation she is more beautiful than i thought she said she holds herself marvelously she moves with the freedom of some fine wild creature and as the party disappeared from view her regret at losing them drew from her a sigh she discussed them with characteristic enthusiasm all the way home she even concocted a very probable little romance one would always imagine so many things concerning americans they were so extraordinary a people they acquired wealth by such peculiar means their country was so immense their resources were so remarkable these persons for instance were evidently persons of wealth and as plainly had risen from the people the mother was not quite so wholly untaught as the other two but she was more objectionable one can bear with the large simplicity of utter ignorance said my fair philosopher one frequently finds it gentle and unworldly but the other is odious because it is always aggressive and narrow she had taken a strong feminine dislike to madame la mere she makes her family miserable she said she drags them from place to place possibly there is a lovermore possibly than not the girls eyes wore a peculiar lookas if they searched for something far away she had scarcely concluded her charming little harangue when we reached our destination but as we passed through the entrance she paused to speak to the curlyheaded child of the concierge whose mother held him by the hand we shall have new arrivals tomorrow said the good woman who was always ready for friendly gossip the apartment upon the first floor and she nodded to me significantly and with goodnatured encouragement perhaps you may get pupils she added they are americans and speak only english and there is a young lady madame says americans exclaimed clelie with sudden interest americans answered the concierge it was madame who came mon dieu it was wonderful so rich and sosofilling up the blank by a shrug of deep meaning it cannot have been long since they werepeasants her voice dropping into a cautious whisper why not our friends of the louvre said clelie as we went on upstairs why not i replied it is very possible the next day there arrived at the house numberless trunks of large dimensions superintended by the small angry woman and a maid an hour later came a carriage from whose door emerged the young lady and her father both looked pale and fagged both were led upstairs in the midst of voluble comments and commands by the mother and both entering the apartment seemed swallowed up by it as we saw and heard nothing further of them clelie was indignant it is plain that the mother overwhelms them she said a girl of that age should speak and be interested in any novelty this one would be if she were not wretched and the poor little husband my dear i remarked you are a feminine bayard you engage yourself with such ardor in everybodys wrongs when i returned from my afternoons work a few days later i found clelie again excited she had been summoned to the first floor by madame i went into the room said clelie and found the mother and daughter together mademoiselle who stood by the fire had evidently been weeping madame was in an abrupt and angry mood she wasted no words i want you to give her lessons she said making an ungraceful gesture in the direction of her daughter what do you charge a lesson and on my telling her she engaged me at once its a great deal but i guess i can pay as well as other people she remarked a few of the lessons were given downstairs and then clelie preferred a request to madame if you will permit mademoiselle to come to my room you will confer a favor upon me she said fortunately her request was granted and so i used afterward to come home and find mademoiselle esmeralda in our little salon at work disconsolately and tremulously she found it difficult to hold her pencil in the correct manner and one morning she let it drop and burst into tears dont you see ill never do it she answered miserably dont you see i couldnt even if my heart was in it and it aint at all she held out her little hands piteously for clelie to look at they were well enough shaped and would have been pretty if they had not been robbed of their youthful suppleness by labor ive been used to work she said rough work all my life and my hands aint like yours but you must not be discouraged mademoiselle said clelie gently time time interposed the girl with a frightened look in her pretty gray eyes thats what i cant bear to think ofthe time thats to come this was the first of many outbursts of confidence afterward she related to clelie with the greatest naivete the whole history of the family affairs they had been the possessors of some barren mountain lands in north carolina and her description of their former life was wonderful indeed to the ears of the parisian she herself had been brought up with marvelous simplicity and hardihood barely learning to read and write and in absolute ignorance of society a year ago iron had been discovered upon their property and the result had been wealth and misery for father and daughter the mother who had some vague fancies of the attractions of the great outside world was ambitious and restless monsieur who was a mild and accommodating person could only give way before her stronger will she always had her way with us said mademoiselle esmeralda scratching nervously upon the paper before her with her pencil at this part of the relation we did not want to leave home neither me nor father and father said more than i ever heard him say before at one time mother says he let me an esmeraldy stay at home an you go an enjoy your tower youve had more schoolin an youll be more at home than we should youre useder to city ways havin lived in lizabethville but it only vexed her people in town had been talking to her about traveling and letting me learn things and shed set her mind on it she was very simple and unsophisticated to the memory of her former truly singular life she clung with unshaken fidelity she recurred to it constantly the novelty and luxury of her new existence seemed to have no attractions for her one thing even my clelie found incomprehensible while she fancied she understood the restshe did not appear to be moved to pleasure even by our beloved paris it is a true maladie du pays clelie remarked to me and that is not all nor was it all one day the whole truth was told amid a flood of tears ii was going to be married cried the poor child i was to have been married the week the ore was found i wasall ready and mothermother shut right down on us clelie glanced at me in amazed questioning it is a kind of argot which belongs only to americans i answered in an undertone the alliance was broken off ciel exclaimed my clelie between her small shut teeth the woman is a fiend she was wholly absorbed in her study of this unworldly and untaught nature she was full of sympathy for its trials and tenderness and for its pain even the girls peculiarities of speech were full of interest to her she made serious and intelligent efforts to understand them as if she studied a new language it is not common argot she said it has its subtleties one continually finds somewhere an original ideasometimes even a bon mot which startles one by its pointedness as you say however it belongs only to the americans and their remarkable country a french mind can only arrive at its climaxes through a grave and occasionally tedious research which would weary most persons but which however does not weary me the confidence of mademoiselle esmeralda was easily won she became attached to us both and particularly to clelie when her mother was absent or occupied she stole upstairs to our apartment and spent with us the moments of leisure chance afforded her she liked our rooms she told my wife because they were small and our society because we were clever which we discovered afterward meant amiable but she was always pale and out of spirits she would sit before our fire silent and abstracted you must not mind if i dont talk she would say i cant and it seems to help me to get to sit and think about thingsmother wont let me do it downstairs we became also familiar with the father one day i met him upon the staircase and to my amazement he stopped as if he wished to address me i raised my hat and bade him goodmorning on his part he drew forth a large handkerchief and began to rub the palms of his hands with awkward timidity howdy he said i confess that at the moment i was covered with confusion i who was a teacher of english and flattered myself that i wrote and spoke it fluently did not understand immediately however it flashed across my mind that the word was a species of salutation which i finally discovered to be the case i bowed again and thanked him hazarding the reply that my health was excellent and an inquiry as to the state of madames he rubbed his hands still more nervously and answered me in the slow and deliberate mariner i had observed at the louvre thank ye he said shes doin tolable well is motheras well as common and shes aenjoyin herself too i wish we was all but there he checked himself and glanced hastily about him then he began again esmeraldy he saidesmeraldy thinks a heap on you she takes a sight of comfort out of mis desi cant call your name but i mean your wife madame desmarres i replied is rejoiced indeed to have won the friendship of mademoiselle yes he proceeded she takes a sight of comfort in you and all an she needs comfort does esmeraldy there ensued a slight pause which somewhat embarrassed me for at every pause he regarded me with an air of meek and hesitant appeal shes a little downsperrited is esmeraldy he said an adding this suddenly in a subdued and fearful tone so am i having said this he seemed to feel that he had overstepped a barrier he seized the lapel of my coat and held me prisoner pouring forth his confessions with a faith in my interest by which i was at once amazed and touched you see its this way he saidits this way mister were home folks me an esmeraldy an were a long way from home an it sorter seems like we didnt get no useder to it than we was at first were not like mother mother she was raised in a townshe was raised in lizabethvillean she allers took to town ways but me an esmeraldy we was raised in the mountains right under the shadder of old bald an town goes hard with us seems like were allers a thinkin of north callina an mother she gits outed which is likely she says wed ought to fit ourselves fur our higher pear an i dessay wed oughtbut you see it goes sorter hard with us an esmeraldy she has her trouble an i cant help a sympathizin with her fur young folks will be young folks an i was young folks once myself onceonce i sot a heap o store by mother so you seehow it is it is very sad monsieur i answered with gravity singular as it may appear this was not so laughable to me as it might seem it was so apparent that he did not anticipate ridicule and my clelies interest in these people also rendered them sacred in my eyes yes he returned thats so an sometimes its wuss than youd thinkwhen mothers outed an thats why im glad as mis dimar an esmeraldy is such friends it struck me at this moment that he had some request to make of me he grasped the lapel of my coat somewhat more tightly as if requiring additional support and finally bent forward and addressed me with caution do you think as mis dimar would mind it ef now an then i was to step in fur esmeraldy an set a littlejust in a kinder neighborin way esmeraldy she says youre so sosherble and i haint been sosherble with no one furfur a right smart spell and it seems like i kinder hanker arter it youve no idea mister how lonesome a man can git when he hankers to be sosherble an haint no one to be sosherble with mother she says go out on the champs elizy and promenard and ive done it but some ways it dont reach the spot i dont seem to get sosherble with no one ive spoke tomay be through us speakin different languages an not comin to a understandin ive tried it loud an ive tried it low an encouragen but some ways we never seemed to get on an er mis dimar wouldnt take no exceptions at me adroppin in i feel as ef i should be sorter upliftedif shed only allow it once a week or even fewer monsieur i replied with warmth i beg you will consider our salon at your disposal not once a week but at all times and madame desmarres would certainly join me in the invitation if she were upon the spot he released the lapel of my coat and grasped my hand shaking it with fervor now thats clever that is he said an its friendly an im obligated to ye since he appeared to have nothing further to say we went downstairs together at the door we parted im agoin he remarked to the champs elizy to promenard where are you agoin to the boulevard haussmann monsieur to give a lesson i returned i will wish you goodmorning goodmornin he answered bongreflecting deeply for a momentbong jore im a tryin to learn it you see with a view to bein more sosherbler bong jore and thus took his departure after this we saw him frequently in fact it became his habit to follow mademoiselle esmeralda in all her visits to our apartment a few minutes after her arrival we usually heard a timid knock upon the outer door which proved to emanate from monsieur who always entered with a laborious bong jore and always slipped deprecatingly into the least comfortable chair near the fire hurriedly concealing his hat beneath it in him also my clelie became much interested on my own part i could not cease to admire the fine feeling and delicate tact she continually exhibited in her manner toward him in time he even appeared to lose something of his first embarrassment and discomfort though he was always inclined to a reverent silence in her presence he dont say much dont father said mademoiselle esmeralda with tears in her pretty eyes hes like me but you dont know what comfort hes taking when he sits and listens and stirs his chocolate round and round without drinking it he doesnt drink it because he aint used to it but he likes to have it when we do because he says it makes him feel sosherble hes trying to learn to drink it toohe practices every day a little at a time he was powerful afraid at first that youd take exceptions to him doing nothing but stir it round but i told him i knew you wouldnt for you wasnt that kind i find him said clelie to me inexpressibly mournfuleven though he excites one to smile upon all occasions is it not mournful that his very suffering should be absurd mon dieu he does not wear his clotheshe bears them about with himhe simply carries them it was about this time that mademoiselle esmeralda was rendered doubly unhappy since their residence in paris madame had been industriously occupied in making efforts to enter society she had struggled violently and indefatigably she was at once persistent and ambitious she had used every means that lay in her power and most of all she had used her money naturally she had found people upon the outskirts of good circles who would accept her with her money consequently she had obtained acquaintances of a class and was bold enough to employ them as steppingstones at all events she began to receive invitations and to discover opportunities to pay visits and to take her daughter with her accordingly mademoiselle esmeralda was placed upon exhibition she was dressed by experienced artistes she was forced from her seclusion and obliged to drive and call and promenade her condition was pitiable while all this was torture to her inexperience and timidity her fear of her mother rendered her wholly submissive each day brought with it some new trial she was admired for many reasonsby some for her wealth of which all had heard rumors by others for her freshness and beauty the silence and sensitiveness which arose from shyness and her ignorance of all social rules were called naivete and modesty and people who abhorred her mother not unfrequently were charmed with her and consequently madame found her also an instrument of some consequence in her determination to overcome all obstacles madame even condescended to apply to my wife whose influence over mademoiselle she was clever enough not to undervalue i want you to talk to mademoiselle she said she thinks a great deal of you and i want you to give her some good advice you know what society is and you know that she ought to be proud of her advantages and not make a fool of herself many a girl would be glad enough of what she has before her shes got money and shes got chances and i dont begrudge her anything she can spend all she likes on clothes and things and ill take her anywhere if shell behave herself they wear me outher and her father its her father thats ruined her and her living as shes done her father never knew anything and hes made a pet of her and got her into his way of thinking its ridiculous how little ambition they have and she might marry as well as any girl theres a marquis thats quite in love with her at this moment and shes as afraid of him as death and cries if i even mention him though hes a nice enough man if he is a bit elderly now i want you to reason with her this clelie told me afterward and upon going away she ended she turned round toward me setting her face into an indescribable expression of hardness and obstinacy i want her to understand she said that shes cut off forever from anything thats happened before theres the atlantic ocean and many a mile of land between her and north carolina and so she may as well give that up two or three days after this mademoiselle came to our apartment in great grief she had left madame in a violent illtemper they had received invitations to a ball at which they were to meet the marquis madame had been elated and the discovery of mademoiselles misery and trepidation had roused her indignation there had been a painful scene and mademoiselle had been overwhelmed as usual she knelt before the fire and wept despairingly id rather die than go she said i cant stand it i cant get used to it the light and the noise and the talk hurts me and i dont know what i am doing and people stare at me and i make mistakes and im not fit for itandandid rather be dead fifty thousand times than let that man come near me i hate him and im afraid of him and i wish i was dead at this juncture came the timid summons upon the door and the father entered with a disturbed and subdued air he did not conceal his hat but held it in his hands and turned it round and round in an agitated manner as he seated himself beside his daughter esmeraldy he said dont you take it so hard honey mother shes kinder outed and shes not at herself rightly dont you never mind mother she means well butbut shes got a sorter curious way of showin it shes got a high sperrit an wed ought to low fur it and not take it so much to heart mis dimar here knows how highsperrited people is sometimes i dessayan mother shes got a powerful high sperrit but the poor child only wept more hopelessly it was not only the cruelty of her mother which oppressed her it was the wound she bore in her heart clelies eyes filled with tears as she regarded her the father was also more broken in spirit than he wished it to appear his weatherbeaten face assumed an expression of deep melancholy which at last betrayed itself in an evidently inadvertent speech i wishi wish he faltered lord id give a heap to see wash now id give a heap to see him esmeraldy it was as if the words were the last straw the girl turned toward him and flung herself upon his breast with a passionate cry oh father she sobbed we shant never see him againnevernever nor the mountains nor the people that cared for us weve lost it all and we cant get it backand we havent a soul thats near to usand were all aloneyou and me father and washwash he thinks we dont care i must confess to a momentary spasm of alarm her grief was so wild and overwhelming one hand was flung about her fathers neck and the other pressed itself against her side as if her heart was breaking clelie bent down and lifted her up consoling her tenderly mademoiselle she said do not despair le bon dieu will surely have pity the father drew forth the large linen handkerchief and unfolding it slowly applied it to his eyes yes esmeraldy he said dont let us give outat least dont you give out it doesnt matter fur me esmeraldy because you see i must hold on to mother as i swore not to go back on but youre young an likely esmeraldy an dont you give out yet fur the lords sake but she did not cease weeping until she had wholly fatigued herself and by this time there arrived a message from madame who required her presence downstairs monsieur was somewhat alarmed and rose precipitately but mademoiselle was too full of despair to admit of fear its only the dressmaker she said you can stay where you are father and she wont guess weve been together and itll be better for us both and accordingly she obeyed the summons alone great were the preparations made by madame for the entertainment my wife to whom she displayed the costumes and jewels she had purchased was aroused to an admiration truly feminine she had the discretion to trust to the taste of the artistes and had restrained them in nothing consequently all that was to be desired in the appearance of mademoiselle esmeralda upon the eventful evening was happiness with her mothers permission she came to our room to display herself monsieur following her with an air of awe and admiration commingled her costume was rich and exquisite and her beauty beyond criticism but as she stood in the centre of our little salon to be looked at she presented an appearance to move ones heart the pretty young face which had by this time lost its slight traces of the sun had also lost some of its bloom the slight figure was not so round nor so erect as it had been and moved with less of spirit and girlishness it appeared that monsieur observed this also for he stood apart regarding her with evident depression and occasionally used his handkerchief with a violence that was evidently meant to conceal some secret emotion youre not so peart as you was esmeraldy he remarked tremulously not as peart by a light smart and what with that and what with your fixins washi mean the homefolkshastilytheyd hardly know ye he followed her downstairs mournfully when she took her departure and clelie and myself being left alone interested ourselves in various speculations concerning them as was our habit this monsieur wash remarked clelie is clearly the lover poor child how passionately she regrets himand thousands of miles lie between themthousands of miles it was not long after this that on my way downstairs to make a trifling purchase i met with something approaching an adventure it so chanced that as i descended the staircase of the second floor the door of the first floor apartment was thrown open and from it issued mademoiselle esmeralda and her mother on their way to their waiting carriage my interest in the appearance of mademoiselle in her white robes and sparkling jewels so absorbed me that i inadvertently brushed against a figure which stood in the shadow regarding them also turning at once to apologize i found myself confronting a young mantall powerful but with a sad and haggard face and attired in a strange and homely dress which had a foreign look monsieur i exclaimed a thousand pardons i was so unlucky as not to see you but he did not seem to hear he remained silent gazing fixedly at the ladies until they had disappeared and then on my addressing him again he awakened as it were with a start it doesnt matter he answered in a heavy bewildered voice and in english and turning back made his way slowly up the stairs but even the utterance of this brief sentence had betrayed to my practiced ear a peculiar accentan accent which strange to say bore a likeness to that of our friends downstairs and which caused me to stop a moment at the lodge of the concierge and ask her a question or so have we a new occupant upon the fifth floor i inquired a person who speaks english she answered me with a dubious expression you must mean the strange young man upon the sixth she said he is a new one and speaks english indeed he does not speak anything else or even understand a word mon dieu the trials one encounters with such personsendeavoring to comprehend poor creatures and failing alwaysand this one is worse than the rest and looks more wretchedas if he had not a friend in the world what is his name i asked how can one remember their namesit is worse than impossible this one is frightful but he has no letters thank heaven if there should arrive one with an impossible name upon it i should take it to him and run the risk naturally clelie to whom i related the incident was much interested but it was some time before either of us saw the hero of it again though both of us confessed to having been upon the watch for him the concierge could only tell us that he lived a secluded liferarely leaving his room in he daytime and seeming to be very poor he does not work and eats next to nothing she said late at night he occasionally carries up a loaf and once he treated himself to a cup of bouillon from the restaurant at the cornerbut it was only once poor young man he is at least very gentle and wellconducted so it was not to be wondered at that we did not see him clelie mentioned him to her young friend but mademoiselles interest in him was only faint and ephemeral she had not the spirit to rouse herself to any strong emotion i dare say hes an american she said there are plenty of americans in paris but none of them seem a bit nearer to me than if they were french they are all rich and fine and they all like the life here better than the life at home this is the first poor one i have heard of each day brought fresh unhappiness to her madame was inexorable she spent a fortune upon toilette for her and insisted upon dragging her from place to place and wearying her with gayeties from which her sad young heart shrank each afternoon their equipage was to be seen upon the champs elysees and each evening it stood before the door waiting to bear them to some place of festivity mademoiselles bete noir the marquis who was a debilitated roue in search of a fortune attached himself to them upon all occasions bah said clelie with contempt she amazes one by her imbecilitythis woman truly one would imagine that her vulgar sharpness would teach her that his object is to use her as a tool and that having gained mademoiselles fortune he will treat them with brutality and derision but she did not seem to seepossibly she fancied that having obtained him for a soninlaw she would be bold and clever enough to outwit and control him consequently he was encouraged and fawned upon and mademoiselle grew thin and pale and largeeyed and wore continually an expression of secret terror only in her visits to our fifth floor did she dare to give way to her grief and truly at such times both my clelie and i were greatly affected upon one occasion indeed she filled us both with alarm do you know what i shall do she said stopping suddenly in the midst of her weeping ill bear it as long as i can and then ill put an end to it therestheres always the seine left and ive laid awake and thought of it many a night father and me saw a man taken out of it one day and the people said he was a tyrolean and drowned himself because he was so poor and lonelyandand so far from home upon the very morning she made this speech i saw again our friend of the sixth floor in going downstairs i came upon him sitting upon one of the steps as if exhausted and when he turned his face upward its pallor and haggardness startled me his tall form was wasted his eyes were hollow the peculiarities i had before observed were doubly markedhe was even emaciated monsieur i said in english you appear indisposed you have been ill allow me to assist you to your room no thank you he answered its only weakness ii sorter give out dont trouble yourself i shall get over it directly something in his face which was a very young and welllooking one forced me to leave him in silence merely bowing as i did so i felt instinctively that to remain would be to give him additional pain as i passed the room of the concierge however the excellent woman beckoned to me to approach her did you see the young man she inquired rather anxiously he has shown himself this morning for the first time in three days there is something wrong it is my impression that he suffers wantthat he is starving himself to death her rosy countenance absolutely paled as she uttered these last words retreating a pace from me and touching my arm with her forefinger he has carried up even less bread than usual during the last few weeks she added and there has been no bouillon whatever a young man cannot live only on dry bread and too little of that he will perish and apart from the inhumanity of the thing it will be unpleasant for the other locataires i wasted no time in returning to clelie having indeed some hope that i might find the poor fellow still occupying his former position upon the staircase but in this i met with disappointment he was gone and i could only relate to my wife what i had heard and trust to her discretion as i had expected she was deeply moved it is terrible she said and it is also a delicate and difficult matter to manage but what can one do there is only one thingi who am a woman and have suffered privation myself may venture accordingly she took her departure for the floor above i heard her light summons upon the door of one of the rooms but heard no reply at last however the door was opened gently and with a hesitance that led me to imagine that it was clelie herself who had pushed it open and immediately afterward i was sure that she had uttered an alarmed exclamation i stepped out upon the landing and called to her in a subdued tone clelie i said did i hear you speak yes she returned from within the room come at once and bring with you some brandy in the shortest possible time i had joined her in the room which was bare cold and unfurnisheda mere garret in fact containing nothing but a miserable bedstead upon the floor near the window knelt clelie supporting with her knee and arm the figure of the young man she had come to visit quick with the brandy she exclaimed this may be a faint but it looks like death she had found the door partially open and receiving no answer to her knock had pushed it farther ajar and caught a glimpse of the fallen figure and hurried to its assistance to be as brief as possible we both remained at the young mans side during the whole of the night as the concierge had said he was perishing from inanition and the physician we called in assured us that only the most constant attention would save his life monsieur clelie explained to him upon the first occasion upon which he opened his eyes you are ill and alone and we wish to befriend you and he was too weak to require from her anything more definite physically he was a person to admire in health his muscular power must have been immense he possessed the frame of a young giant and yet there was in his face a look of innocence and inexperience amazing even when one recollected his youth it is the look said clelie regarding him attentivelythe look one sees in the faces of monsieur and his daughter downstairs the look of a person who has lived a simple life and who knows absolutely nothing of the world it is possible that this may have prepared the reader for the denoument which followed but singular as it may appear it did not prepare either clelie or myselfperhaps because we had seen the world and having learned to view it in a practical light were not prepared to encounter suddenly a romance almost unparalleled the next morning i was compelled to go out to give my lessons as usual and left clelie with our patient on my return my wife hearing my footsteps came out and met me upon the landing she was moved by the strongest emotion and much excited her cheeks were pale and her eyes shone do not go in yet she said i have something to tell you it is almost incredible butbut it isthe lover for a moment we remained silentstanding looking at each other to me it seemed incredible indeed he could not give her up clelie went on until he was sure she wished to discard him the mother had employed all her ingenuity to force him to believe that such was the case but he could not rest until he had seen his betrothed face to face so he followed herpoor inexperienced and miserableand when at last he saw her at a distance the luxury with which she was surrounded caused his heart to fail him and he gave way to despair i accompanied her into the room and heard the rest from his own lips he gathered together all his small savings and made his journey in the cheapest possible wayin the steerage of the vessel and in thirdclass carriagesso that he might have some trifle left to subsist upon ive a little farm he said and theres a house on it but i wouldnt sell that if she cared to go it was all i had to take her to an id worked hard to buy it id worked hard early and late always thinking that some day wed begin life there togetheresmeraldy and me since neither sea nor land nor cruelty could separate them said clelie to me during the day it is not i who will help to hold them apart so when mademoiselle came for her lesson that afternoon it was clelies task to break the news to herto tell her that neither sea nor land lay between herself and her lover and that he was faithful still she received the information as she might have received a blowstaggering backward and whitening and losing her breath but almost immediately afterward she uttered a sad cry of disbelief and anguish no no she said itit isnt true i wont believe iti mustnt theres half the world between us oh dont try to make me believe itwhen it cant be true come with me replied clelie nevernever in my life has it been my fate to see before or since a sight so touching as the meeting of these two young hearts when the door of the cold bare room opened and mademoiselle esmeralda entered the lover held out his weak arms with a soba sob of rapture and yet terrible to hear i thought youd gone back on me esmeraldy he cried i thought youd gone back on me clelie and i turned away and left them as the girl fell upon her knees at his side the effect produced upon the fatherwho had followed mademoiselle as usual and whom we found patiently seated upon the bottom step of the flight of stairs awaiting our arrivalwas almost indescribable he sank back upon his seat with a gasp clutching at his hat with both hands he also disbelieved wash he exclaimed weakly lord no lord no not wash wash hes in north callina lord no he is upstairs returned clelie and mademoiselle is with him during the recovery of monsieur wash though but little was said upon the subject it is my opinion that the minds of each of our number pointed only toward one course in the future in mademoiselles demeanor there appeared a certain air of new courage and determination though she was still pallid and anxious it was as if she had passed a climax and had gained strength monsieur the father was alternately nervous and dejected or in feverishly high spirits occasionally he sat for some time without speaking merely gazing into the fire with a hand upon each knee and it was one evening after a more than usually prolonged silence of this description that he finally took upon himself the burden which lay upon us unitedly esmeraldy he remarked tremulously and with manifest trepidationesmeraldy ive been thinkinits timewe broke it to mother the girl lost color but she lifted her head steadily yes father she answered its time yes he echoed rubbing his knees slowly its time an esmeraldy its a thing toto sorter set a man back yes father she answered again yes as before though his voice broke somewhat an i dessay you know how itll be esmeraldythat youll have to choose betwixt mother and wash she sat by her lover and for answer she dropped her face upon his hand with a sob anan youve chose wash esmeraldy yes father he hesitated a moment and then took his hat from its place of concealment and rose its natral he said an its right i wouldnt want it no other way an you mustnt mind esmeraldy its bein kinder rough on me as cant go back on mother havin swore to cherish her till death do us part youve allus been a good gal to me an weve thought a heap on each other an i reckon it can allers be the same way even though were seprated fur its natral you should have chose wash anan i wouldnt have it no other way esmeraldy now ill go an have it out with mother we were all sufficiently unprepared for the announcement to be startled by it mademoiselle esmeralda who was weeping bitterly half sprang to her feet tonight she said oh father yes he replied ive been thinking over it an i dont see no other way an it may as well be tonight as any other time after leaving us he was absent for about an hour when he returned there were traces in his appearance of the storm through which he had passed his hands trembled with agitation he even looked weakened as he sank into his chair we regarded him with commiseration its over he half whispered an it was even rougher than i thought it would be she was terrible outed was mother i reckon i never see her so outed before she jest raged and tore it was most more than i could stand esmeraldy and he dropped his head upon his hands for support seemed like it was the markis as laid heaviest upon her he proceeded she was terrible sot on the markis an every time she think of him shed just rear shed just rear i never stood up agen mother afore an i hope i shant never have it to do again in my time im kinder wore out little by little we learned much of what had passed though he evidently withheld the most for the sake of mademoiselle and it was some time before he broke the news to her that her mothers doors were closed against her i think youll find it pleasanter astoppin here he said if mis dimarll board ye untilthe time fur startin home her sperrit was so up that she said she didnt aim to see you no more an you know how she is esmeraldy when her sperrits up the girl went and clung around his neck kneeling at his side and shedding tears oh father she cried youve bore a great deal for me youve bore more than any one knows and all for me he looked rather grave as he shook his head at the fire thats so esmeraldy he replied but we ailers seemed nigh to each other somehow and when it come to the wust i was bound to kinder make a stand fur you as i couldnt have made fur myself i couldnt have done it fur myself lord no so mademoiselle remained with us and clelie assisted her to prepare her simple outfit and in the evening the tall young lover came into our apartment and sat looking on which aspect of affairs i will confess was entirely new to clelie and yet did not displease her their candor moves me she said he openly regards her with adoration at parting she accompanies him to the door and he embraces her tenderly and yet one is not repelled it is the love of the lost arcadiaserious and innocent finally we went with them one morning to the american chapel in the rue de bern and they were united in our presence and that of monsieur who was indescribably affected after the completion of the ceremony he presented monsieur wash with a package its papers as ive had drawd up fur esmeraldy he said itll start you well out in the world an after me and mothers gone theres no one but you and her to have rest the lordmay the lord bless ye we accompanied them to havre and did not leave them until the last moment monsieur was strangely excited and clung to the hands of his daughter and soninlaw talking fast and nervously and pouring out messages to be delivered to his distant friends tell em id like powerful well to see em all an id have come onlyonly things was kinder onconvenient sometime perhaps but here he was obliged to clear his throat as his voice had become extremely husky and having done this he added in an undertone you see esmeraldy i couldnt because of mother as ive swore not to go back on wash he wouldnt go back on you however high your sperrit was an i cant go back on mother the figures of the young couple standing at the side monsieur wash holding his wife to his breast with one strong arm were the last we saw as the ship moved slowly away it is obscurity to which they are returning i said half unconsciously it is love said clelie the father who had been standing apart came back to us replacing in his pocket his handkerchief they are young an likely you see said monsieur an life before them an its natral as she should have chose wash as was young too an sot on her lord its natral an i wouldnt have it no otherways
