aimed the blow illustration haworths first appearance haworths chapter i twenty years twenty years ago yes twenty years ago this very day and there were men among them who remembered it only two however and these were old men whose day was passed and who would soon be compelled to give up work naturally upon this occasion these two were the center figures in the group of talkers who were

nay he will na commented another of the old ones hes a pretty rough chap but hell dowill jem haworth there was a slight confused movement in the group here he cooms exclaimed an outsider the man who entered the doorwaya strongly built fellow whose handsome clothes sat rather ill on his somewhat uncouth bodymade his way through the crowd with small ceremony he met the glances of the workmen with a rough nod and went straight to the managerial desk but he did not sit down he stood up facing those who waited as if he meant to dispose of the business in hand as directly as possible well chaps he said here we are a slight murmur as of assent ran through the room aye mester they said here we are well said he you know why i suppose were taking a fresh start and ive something to say to you ive had my say here for some time but ive not had my way and now the times come when i can have it hang me but im going to have the biggest place in england and the best place too haworths shant be second to none ive set my mind on that i said id stand here some daywith a blow on the deskand here i am i said id make my way and ive done it from today on this heres haworths and to show you i mean to start fair and square if theres a chap here thats got a grievance let that chap step out and speak his mind to jem haworth himself nows his time and he sat down there was another stir and murmur this time rather of consultation then one of them stepped forward mester he said im to speak fur em haworth nodded what ive getten to say said the man is said easy them as thowt theyd getten grievances is willin to leave the settlin on em to jem haworth thats straight enough said haworth let em stick to it and theres not a chap among em shant have his chance go into greysons room lads and drink luck to haworths tipton and harrison you wait a bit tipton and harrison lingered with some degree of timidity by the time the room had emptied itself haworth seemed to have fallen into a reverie he leaned back in his chair his hands in his pockets and stared gloomily before him the room had been silent five minutes before he aroused himself with a start then he leaned forward and beckoned to the two who came and stood before him you two were in the place when i came he said youto tiptonwere the fellow as lifted me from the snow aye mester was the answer twenty year ago toneet the other fellow dead eh long sin ivvery chap as wur theer dead an gone but me an him with a jerk toward his comrade haworth put his hand in his vestpocket and drew forth a crisp piece of paper evidently placed there for a purpose here he said with some awkwardness divide that between you betwixt us two stammered the old man its a tenpunnote mester yes with something like shamefacedness i used to say to myself when i was a youngster that every chap who was in the works that night should have a fivepound note today get out old lads and get as drunk as you please ive kept my word but his laugh breaking off in the middlei wish thered been more of you to keep it up together then they were gone chuckling in senile delight over their good luck and he was left alone he glanced round the rooma big handsome one well filled with massive office furniture and yet wearing the usual empty barren look its taken twenty years he said but ive done it its doneand yet there isnt as much of it as i used to think there would be he rose from his chair and went to the window to look out rather impelled by restlessness than any motive the prospect at least could not have attracted him the place was closed in by tall and dingy houses whose slate roofs shone with the rain which drizzled down through the smoky air the ugly yard was wet and had a deserted look the only living object which caught his eye was the solitary figure of a man who stood waiting at the iron gates at the sight of this man he started backward with an exclamation the devil take the chap he said there he is again he took a turn across the room but he came back again and looked out once more as if he found some irresistible fascination in the sight of the frail shabbily clad figure yes he said its him sure enough i never saw another fellow with the same donefor look i wonder what he wants he went to the door and opening it spoke to a man who chanced to be passing floxham come in here he said floxham was a welloiled and burly fellow plainly fresh from the engineroom he entered without ceremony and followed his master to the window haworth pointed to the man at the gate theres a chap he said that ive been running up against here and there for the last two months the fellow seems to spend his time wandering up and down the streets im hanged if he dont make me think of a ghost he goes against the grain with me somehow do you know who he is and whats up with him floxham glanced toward the gateway and then nodded his head dryly aye he answered hes th inventin chap as has bin thirty year at work at some contrapshun an hasnt browt it to a yed yet he lives i our street an me an my missis hes been noticin him fur a good bit hell noan finish th thing hes at hes on his last legs now he took th contrapshun to merica thirty year ago when he first getten th idea into his yed an he browt it back a bit sin amost i the same fix he took it me an my missis think hes a bit soft i the yed haworth pushed by him to get nearer the window a slight moisture started out upon his forehead thirty year he exclaimed by the lord harry there might have been something in his excitement which had its effect upon the man who stood outside he seemed as it were to awaken slowly from a fit of lethargy he glanced up at the window and moved slowly forward hes made up his mind to come in said floxham what does he want said haworth with a sense of physical uneasiness confound the fellow trying to shake off the feeling with a laugh what does he want with metoday i can go out an turn him back said floxham no answered haworth you can go back to your work ill hear what he has to say ive naught else to do just now floxham left him and he went back to the big armchair behind the table he sat down and turned over some papers not rid of his uneasiness even when the door opened and his visitor came in he was a tall slender man who stooped and was narrowchested he was gray holloweyed and haggard he removed his shabby hat and stood before the table a second in silence mr haworth he said in a gentle absentminded voice they told me this was mr haworths room yes he answered im haworth i want a little hoarsely and falteringto get some work to do my name is murdoch ive spent the last thirty years in america but im a lancashire man i went to america on businesswhich has not been successfulyet ii have worked here beforewith a glance around himand i should like to work here again i did not think it would be necessary butthat doesnt matter perhaps it will only be temporary i must get work in the last sentence his voice faltered more than ever he seemed suddenly to awaken and bring himself back to his first idea as if he had not intended to wander from it ii must get work he repeated the effect he produced upon the man he appealed to was peculiar jem haworth almost resented his frail appearance he felt it an uncomfortable thing to confront just at this hour of his triumph he had experienced the same sensation in a less degree when he rose in the morning and looked out of his window upon murky sky and falling rain he would almost have given a thousand pounds for clear triumphant sunshine and yet in spite of this he was not quite as brusque as usual when he made his answer ive heard of you he said youve had ill luck stephen murdoch shifted his hat from hand to hand i dont know he replied slowly ive not called it that yet the end has been slow but i think its sure it will come some haworth made a rough gesture by george he exclaimed havent you given the thing up yet murdoch fell back a pace and stared at him in a stunned way given it up he repeated yet look here said haworth youd better do it if you havent take my advice and have done with it youre not a young chap and if a things a failure after thirty years work he stopped because he saw the man trembling nervously oh i didnt mean to take the pluck out of you he said bluntly a moment later you must have had plenty of it to begin with egad or youd never have stood it this long i dont know that it was pluckstill quivering ive lived on it so long that it would not give me up i think thats it haworth dashed off a couple of lines on a slip of paper and tossed it to him take that to greyson he said and youll get your work and if you have anything to complain of come to me murdoch took the paper and held it hesitatingly iperhaps i ought not to have asked for it today he said nervously im not a business man and i didnt think of it i came in because i saw you im going to london tomorrow and shall not be back for a week thats all right said haworth come then he was not sorry to see his visitor turn away after uttering a few simple words of thanks it would be a relief to see the door close after him but when it had closed to his discomfiture it opened again the thin poorly clad figure reappeared i heard in the town said the man his cheek flushing faintly of what has happened here today twenty years have brought you better luck than thirty have brought me yes answered haworth my lucks been good enough as luck goes it seems almost a follyfalling into the meditative tonefor me to wish you good luck in the future and then pulling himself together again as before it is a folly but i wish it nevertheless good luck to you the door closed and he was gone chapter ii thirty years a little later there stood at a window in one of the cheapest of the respectable streets a woman whom the neighbors had become used to seeing there she was a small person with a repressed and watchful look in her eyes and she was noticeable also to the lancashire mind for a certain slightly foreign air not easily described it was in consequence of inquiries made concerning this foreign air that the rumor had arisen that she was a merican and it was possibly a result of this rumor that she was regarded by the inhabitants of the street with a curiosity not unmingled with awe aye said one honest matron hoos a merican fur my mester heerd it fro th landlord eh i would like to ax her summat about th blacks an th indians but it was not easy to attain the degree of familiarity warranting the broaching of subjects so delicate and truly merican the stranger and her husband lived a simple and secluded life it was said the woman had never been known to go out it seemed her place to stand or sit at the window and watch for the man when he left the house on one of his mysterious errands in company with the wooden case he carried by its iron handle this morning she waited as usual though the case had not gone outrather to the disappointment of those interested whose conjectures concerning its contents were varied and ingenious when at last the tall stooping figure turned the corner she went to the door and stood in readiness to greet its crossing the threshold stephen murdoch looked down at her with a kindly absent smile thank you kitty he said you are always here my dear there was a narrow hard horsehair sofa in the small room into which they passed and he went to it and lay down upon it panting a little in an exhausted way a hectic red showing itself on his hollow cheeks everything is ready kitty he said at last yes all ready he lay and looked at the fire still breathing shortly i never was as certain of it before he said i have thought i was certain buti never felt as i do now and yeti dont know what made me do iti went into haworths this morning and asked forfor work his wife dropped the needle she was holding for work she said yesyes a little hastily i was there and saw haworth at a window and there have been delays so often that it struck me i might as wellnot exactly depend on it he broke off and buried his face in his hands what am i saying he cried it sounds as if i did not believe in it his wife drew her chair nearer to him she was used to the task of consoling him it had become a habit she spoke in an even unemotional voice when hilary comes she began it will be all over then he said one way or the other he will be here when i come back yes i may have good news for him he said i dont seefaltering afreshhow it can be otherwise only i am so used to discouragement thatthat i cant see the thing fairly it has beena long time kitty this man in london she said can tell you the actual truth about it he is the first mechanic and inventor in england he answered his eye sparkling feverishly he is a genius if he says it is a success it is one the woman rose and going to the fire bent down to stir it she lingered over it for a moment or so before she came back when the lad comes he was saying as if to himself we shall have news for him thirty years before he had reached america a gentle unpractical lancashire man with a frail physique and empty pockets he had belonged in his own land to the better class of mechanics he had a knack of invention which somehow had never as yet brought forth any decided results he had done one or two things which had gained him the reputation among his employers of being a clever fellow but they had always been things which had finally slipped into stronger or shrewder hands and left his own empty but at last there had come to him what seemed a new and wonderful thought he had labored with it in secret he had lain awake through long nights brooding over it in the darkness and then some one had said to him why dont you try america americas the place for a thinking inventing chap like you its fellows like you who are appreciated in a new country capitalists are not so slow in america why dont you carry your traps out there it was more a suggestion of boisterous goodfellowship than anything else but it awakened new fancies in stephen murdochs mind he had always cherished vaguely grand visions of the new world and they were easily excited i only wonder i never thought of it he said to himself he landed on the strange shore with high hopes in his breast and a little unperfected model in his shabby trunk this was thirty years ago and today he was in lancashire again in his native town with the same little model among his belongings during the thirty years interval he had lived an unsettled unsuccessful life he had labored faithfully at his task but he had not reached the end which had been his aim sometimes he had seemed very near it but it had always evaded him he had drifted here and there bearing his work with him earning a scant livelihood by doing anything chance threw in his way it had always been a scant livelihoodthough after the lapse of eight years in one of his intervals of hopefulness he had married on the first night they spent in their new home he had taken his wife into a little bare room set apart from the rest and had shown her his model i think a few weeks will finish it he said the earliest recollections of their one child centered themselves round the small room and its contents it was the one touch of romance and mystery in their narrow simple life the few spare hours the struggle for daily bread left the man were spent there sometimes he even stole hours from the night and yet the end was always one step further his frail body grew frailer his gentle temperament more excitable he was feverishly confident and utterly despairing by turns it was in one of his hours of elation that his mind turned again to his old home he was sure at last that a few days work would complete all and then only friends were needed england is the place after all he said they are more steady there even if they are not so sanguineand there are men in lancashire i can rely upon well try old england once again the little money hard labor and scant living had laid away for an hour of need they brought with them their son had remained to dispose of their few possessions between this son and the father there existed a strong affection and stephen murdoch had done his best by him i should like the lad he used to say to have a fairer chance than i had i want him to have what i have lacked as he lay upon the horsehair sofa he spoke of him to his wife there are not many like him he said hell make his way ive sometimes thought that maybe but he did not finish the sentence the words died away on his lips and he layperhaps thinking over them as he looked at the fire chapter iii not finished the next morning he went upon his journey and a few days later the son came he was a tall young fellow with a dark strongly cut face deepset black eyes and an unconventional air those who had been wont to watch his father watched him in his turn with quite as much interest he seemed to apply himself to the task of exploring the place at once he went out a great deal and in all sorts of weather he even presented himself at haworths and making friends with floxham got permission to go through the place and look at the machinery his simple directness of speech at once baffled and softened floxham my names murdoch he said im an american and im interested in mechanics if it isnt against your rules i should like to see your machinery floxham pushed his cap off his forehead and looked him over well im domd he remarked it had struck him at first that this might be cheek and then he recognized that it was not murdoch looked slightly bewildered if there is any objection he began well there is na said floxham coom on in and he cut the matter short by turning into the door did any o yo chaps see that felly as coom to look at th machinery he said afterward to his comrades hes fro merica an danged if he has na more headfillin than yod think fur he goes round wi his hands i his pockits lookin loike a foo an axin questions as ud stump an owd un hes th inventin chaps lad i dunnot go much wi inventions mysen but th young chaps noan sich a foo as he looks between mother and son but little had been said on the subject which reigned supreme in the mind of each it had never been their habit to speak freely on the matter on the night of hilarys arrival as they sat together the woman said he went away three days ago he will be back at the end of the week he hoped to have good news for you they said little beyond this but both sat silent for some time afterward and the conversation became desultory and lagged somewhat until they separated for the night the week ended with fresh gusts of wind and heavy rains stephen murdoch came home in a storm on the day fixed for his return his wife scarcely left her seat at the window for an hour she sat looking out at the driving rain with a pale and rigid face when the night fell and she rose to close the shutters hilary saw that her hands shook she made the small room as bright as possible and set the evening meal upon the table and then sat down and waited again by the fire cowering a little over it but not speaking his being detained is not a bad sign said hilary half an hour later they both started from their seats at once there was a loud summons at the door it was hilary who opened it his mother following closely a great gust of wind blew the rain in upon them and stephen murdoch wet and stormbeaten stepped in from the outer darkness carrying the wooden case in his hands he seemed scarcely to see them he made his way past them and into the lighted room with an uncertain step the light appeared to dazzle him he went to the sofa weakly and threw himself upon it he was trembling like a leaf he had aged ten years ii and then he looked up at them as they stood before him waiting there is naught to say he cried out and burst into wild hysterical weeping like that of a woman in obedience to a sign from his mother hilary left the room when after the lapse of half an hour he returned all was quiet his father lay upon the sofa with closed eyes his mother sat near him he did not rise nor touch food and only spoke once during the evening then he opened his eyes and turned them upon the case which still stood where he had placed it take it away he said in a whisper take it away the next morning hilary went to floxham i want work he said do you think i can get it here what soart does tha want asked the engineer not too encouragingly th gentlemanly soart as tha con do wi kidgloves an a eyeglass on no answered murdoch not that sort floxham eyed him keenly would tha tak owt as was offert thee he demanded i think i would aw reet then ill gie thee a chance coom tha wi me to th engineroom an see how long thalt stick to it it was very ordinary work he was given to do but he seemed to take quite kindly to it in fact the manner in which he applied himself to the rough tasks which fell to his lot gave rise to no slight dissatisfaction among his fellowworkmen and caused him to be regarded with small respect he was usually a little ahead of the stipulated time he had an equable temper and yet despite this and his civility he seemed often more than half oblivious of the existence of those around him a highly flavored joke did not awaken him to enthusiasm and perhaps chiefest among his failings was noted the fact that he had no predilection for sixpenny and at his midday meal which he frequently brought with him and ate in any convenient corner he sat drinking cold water and eating his simple fare over a book th chap is na more than haaf theer was the opinion generally expressed since the night of his return from his journey stephen murdoch had been out no more the neighbors watched for him in vain the wooden case stood unopened in his roomhe had never spoken of it through the long hours of the day he lay upon the sofa either dozing or in silent wakefulness and at length instead of upon the sofa he lay upon the bed not having strength to rise about three months after he had taken his place at haworths hilary came home one evening to find his mother waiting for him at the door she shed no tears there was in her face only a hopeless terror he has sent me out of the room she said he has been restless all day he said he must be alone hilary went upstairs opening the door he fell back a step the model was in its old place on the worktable and near it stood a tall gaunt white figure his father turned toward him he touched himself upon the breast i always told myself he said incoherently and hoarsely that there was a flaw in itthat something was lacking i have said that for thirty years and believed the day would come when i should remedy the wrong tonight i know the truth has come to me at last there was no remedy the flaw was in me touching his hollow chestin me as i lay there i thought once that perhaps it was not realthat i had dreamed it all and might awake i got up to seeto touch it it is there good god as if a sudden terror grasped him not finishedand i he fell into a chair and sank forward his hand falling upon the model helplessly and unmeaningly hilary raised him and laid his head upon his shoulder he heard his mother at the door and cried out loudly to her go back he said go back you must not come in chapter iv janey briarley a week later hilary murdoch returned from the broxton graveyard in a drizzling rain and made his way to the bare cleanly swept chamber upstairs since the night on which he had cried out to his mother that she must not enter the table at which the dead man had been wont to sit at work had been pushed aside some one had thrown a white cloth over it murdoch went to it and drew this cloth away he stood and looked down at the little skeleton of wood and steel it had been nothing but a curse from first to last and yet it fascinated him he found it hard to do the thing he had come to do it is not finished he said to the echoes of the empty room itnever will be he slowly replaced it in its case and buried it out of sight at the bottom of the trunk which from that day forward would stand unused and locked when he arose after doing this he unconsciously struck his hands together as he had seen gravediggers do when they brushed the damp soil away the first time haworth saw his new hand he regarded him with small favor in crossing the yard one day at noon he came upon him disposing of his midday meal and reading at the same time he stopped to look at him whos that he asked one of the men the fellow grinned in amiable appreciation of the rough tone of the query thats th merican he answered an a soft un he is whats that hes reading summat about engineerin loike as not thats his crank in the rush of his new plans and the hurry of the last few months haworth had had time to forget the man who had wished him good luck and whose pathetic figure had been a shadow upon the first glow of his triumph he did not connect him at all with the young fellow before him he turned away with a shrug of his burly shoulders he doesnt look like an englishman he said he hasnt got backbone enough afterward when the two accidentally came in contact haworth wasted few civil words at times his domineering brusqueness excited murdoch to wonder hes a queer fellow that haworth he said reflectingly to floxham sometimes i think hes out of humor with me with the twelveyearold daughter of one of the workmen who used to bring her fathers dinner the young fellow had struck up something of a friendship she was the eldest of twelve a mature young person whose businesslike air had attracted him she had assisted her mother in the rearing of her family from her third year and had apparently done with the follies of youth she was stunted with much nursing and her small face had a shrewd and careworn look murdochs first advances she received with some distrust but after a lapse of time they progressed fairly and without any weak sentiment were upon excellent terms one rainy day she came into the yard enveloped in a large shawl evidently her mothers and also evidently very much in her way her dinnercan her beerjug and her shawl were more than she could manage eh i am in a mess she said to hilary stopping at the doorway with a longdrawn breath i dunnot know which way to turnwhat wi th beer and what wi th dinner ive getten on mothers sunday shawl as she had afore she wur wed an th eends keep adraggin an adraggin an th mudll be th ruin on em th pin mother put in is na big enow an its getten loose there was perhaps not much sense of humor in the young man he did not seem to see the grotesqueness of the little figure with its mudbedraggled maternal wrappings he turned up the lapel of his coat and examined it quite seriously ive got a pin here that will hold it he said i picked it up because it was such a large one janey briarleys eyes brightened eh she ejaculated that theers a graidely big un some woman mun ha dropped it out o her shawl wheer did tha foind it in the street i thowt so some womans lost it dost tha think tha con pin it reet or mun i put th beer down an do it mysen he thought he could do it and bent down to reach her level it was at this moment that haworth approached the door with the intention of passing out things had gone wrong with him and he was in one of his worst moods he strode down the passage in a savage hurry and finding his way barred made no effort to keep his temper get out of the road he said and pushed murdoch aside slightly with his foot it was as if he had dropped a spark of fire into gunpowder murdoch sprang to his feet white with wrath and quivering dn you he shrieked dn you ill kill you and he rushed upon him as he sprang upon him haworth staggered between the shock and his amazement a sense of the true nature of the thing he had done broke in upon him when it was all over he fell back a pace and a grim surprise not without its hint of satisfaction was in his face the devil take you he said you have got some blood in you after all chapter v the beginning of a friendship the next morning when he appeared at the works murdoch found he had to make his way through a group of the hands which some sufficiently powerful motive had gathered togetherwhich group greeted his appearance with signs of interest theer he is he heard them say and then a gentleman of leisure who was an outsider leaning against the wall enjoying the solace of a short pipe exerted himself to look round and add his comment well he remarked he may ha done it an i wunnot stick out as he did na but if it wur na fur the circumstantshal evidence i would na ha believed it floxham met him at the entrance with a message haworths sent fur thee he said where is hecoolly enough under the circumstances the engineer chuckled in sly exultation hes in the office he didna say nowt about givin thee th bag but tha may as well mak up thy moind to it tha wert pretty cheeky tha knows considerin he wur th mester look here with some heat do you mean to say you think i was in the wrong am i to let the fellow insult me and not resent ittouch me with his foot as if i were a dog thart particular my lad dryly an tha does na know as much o th mester koind as most folk but the next instant he flung down the tool he held in his hand dom thee he cried i loike thy pluck stick to it ladmesters or no mesters as murdoch crossed the threshold of his room jem haworth turned in his seat and greeted him with a short nod not altogether combative then he leaned forward with his arms upon the table before him sit down he said id like to take a look at the chap who thought he could thrash jem haworth but murdoch did not obey him i suppose you have something to say to me he said as you sent for me he did not receive the answer he was prepared for jem haworth burst into a loud laugh by george youre a plucky chap he said if you are an american murdochs blood rose again say what you have to say he demanded i can guess what it is but let me tell you i should do the same thing again it was no fault of mine that i was in your path if id been such a fool as not to see that put in haworth with a smile grimmer than before do you think i couldnt have smashed every bone in your body then murdoch comprehended how matters were to stand between them getten th bag asked floxham when he went back to his work no tha hannot with animation well dang me at the close of the day as they were preparing to leave their work haworth presented himself in the engineroom looking perhaps a trifle awkward see here he said to murdoch ive heard something today as ive missed hearing before somehow the inventing chap was your father yes he stood in an uneasy attitude looking out of the window as if he half expected to see the frail tall figure again i saw him once poor chap he said and he stuck to me somehow id meant to stand by him if hed come here id have liked to do him a good turn he turned to murdoch suddenly and with a hint of embarrassment in his offhand air come up and have dinner with me he said its devilish dull spending a chaps nights in a big place like mine come up with me now the visit was scarcely to murdochs taste but it was easier to accept than to refuse he had seen the house often and had felt some slight curiosity as to its inside appearance there was only one other house in broxton which approached it in size and splendor and this stood empty at present its owner being abroad broxton itself was a sharp and dingy little town whose inhabitants were mostly foundry hands it had grown up around the works and increased with them it had a small railway station two or three public houses much patronized and wore somehow an air of being utterly unconnected with the outside world which much belied it motives of utility a desire to be on the spot and a general disregard for unbusinesslike attractions had led haworth to build his house on the outskirts of the town when i want a spree he had said i can go to manchester or london and im not particular about the rest on it i want to be nigh the place it was a big house and a handsome one it was one of the expressions of the mans success and his pride was involved in it he spent money on it lavishly and having completed it went to live a desolate life among its grandeurs the inhabitants of the surrounding villages which were simple and agricultural regarded broxton with frank distaste and haworths with horror haworths smoke polluted their atmosphere haworths hands made weekly raids upon their towns and rendered themselves obnoxious in their streets the owner of the works his mode of life his defiance of opinion and his coarse sins were supposed to be tabooed subjects the man was ignored and left to his visitors from the larger townsvisitors who occasionally presented themselves to be entertained at his house in a fashion of his own and who were a greater scandal than all the rest they hate me said haworth to his visitor as they sat down to dinner they hate me the devil take em im not moral enough for emnot moral enough with a shout of laughter there was something unreal to his companion in the splendor with which the great fellow was surrounded the table was covered with a kind of banquet servants moved about noiselessly as he talked and laughed the appointments of the room were rich and in good taste oh its none of my work he said seeing murdoch glance about him i wasnt fool enough to try to do it myself i gave it into the hands of them as knew how he was loudtongued and boastful but he showed goodnature enough and a rough wit and it was also plain that he knew his own strength and weaknesses thirty year your father was at work on that notion of his he said once during the evening murdoch made an uneasy gesture of assent and it never came to aught no he died yes he thrust his hands deep in his pockets and gave the young fellow a keen look why dont you take the thing up yourself he said there may be something in it after all and youre a longheaded chap murdoch started from his chair he took an excited turn across the room before he knew what he was doing i never will he said so help me god the things done with and shut out of the world when he went away haworth accompanied him to the door at the threshold he turned about how do you like the look of things he demanded i should be hard to please if i did not like the look of them was the answer well then come again youre welcome i have it all to myself im not favorite enow with the gentry to bring any on em here youre free to come when th fit takes you chapter vi miss ffrench it was considered after this a circumstance illustrative of haworths peculiarities that he had taken to himself a protege from among the hands that said protege was an eccentric young fellow who was sometimes spoken of as being scarcely as bright as he should be that he occasionally dined or supped with haworth that he spent numberless evenings with him and that he read his books which would not have been much used otherwise murdoch lived his regular unemotional life in happy ignorance of these rumors it was true that he gradually fell into the habit of going to haworths house and also of reading his books indeed if the truth were told these had been his attraction ive no use for em said haworth candidly on showing him his library get into em if youve a fancy for em his fancy for them was strong enough to bring him to the place again and again he found books he had wanted but never hoped to possess the library it may be admitted was not of jem haworths selection and indeed this gentlemans fancy for his new acquaintance was not a little increased by a shrewd admiration for an intellectual aptness which might be turned to practical account you tackle em as if you were used to em he used to say id give something solid myself if i could do the same theres whats against me many a timeknowing naught of books and having to fight my way rough and ready from the outset of this acquaintance murdochs position at the works had been an easier one it became understood that haworth would stand by him and that he must be treated with a certain degree of respect greater latitude was given him and better pay and though he remained in the engineroom other and more responsible work frequently fell into his hands he went on in the even tenor of his way uncommunicative and odd as ever he still presented himself ahead of time and labored with the unnecessary absorbed ardor of an enthusiast greatly to the distaste of those less zealous tha gets into it as if tha wur doin fur thysen said one of these happenfeeling the sarcasm a strong onehappen thart fond on it oh yesunconsciouslythats it i suppose im fond of it the scoffer bestowed upon him one thunderstruck glance opened his mouth shut it and retired in disgust theers a chap he said jerking his thumb over his shoulder on returning to his companions theers a chap as says hes fond o workfond on it with dramatic scorn blast his eyes fond on it with floxham he had always stood well though even floxhams regard was tempered with a slight private contempt for peculiarities not easily tolerated by the practical mind th chaps getten gumption enow i his way he said to haworth if owt breaks down or gets out o gear hes aw theer but theer is na a lad on th place as could na cheat him out o his eyeteeth his reputation for being a queer chap was greatly increased by the simplicity and seclusion of his life the house in which he lived with his mother had the atmosphere of a monastic cell as she had devoted herself to her husband the woman devoted herself to her son watching him with a hungry eye he was given to taking long stretches of walks and appearing in distant villages book in hand and with apparently no ulterior object in view his holidays were nearly all spent outofdoors in such rambles as these the country people began to know his tall figure and long stride and to regard him with the friendly toleration of strength for weakness they say i broxton it was said among them as his feyther deed daft and its no wonder th young chaps getten queer ways hes goodnatured enow though i a simple road his goodnature manifested itself in more than one way which called forth comment to his early friendship for janey he remained faithful the child interested him and the sentiment developed as it grew older it was quite natural that after a few months acquaintance he should drop in at the household of her parents on saturday afternoon as he was passing it was the weeks halfholiday and a fine day and he had nothing else to do these facts in connection with that of the briarleys cottage presenting itself were reasons enough for going in it occurred to him as he entered the narrow strip of garden before the door that the children of the neighborhood must have congregated to hold high carnival groups made dirtpies clusters played bobber and kibbs select parties settled differences of opinions with warmth of feeling and elevation of voice a youth of tender years in corduroys which shone with friction stood upon his head in one corner calmly but not haughtily presenting to the blue vault of heaven a pair of ponderous brassfinished clogs what dost want he demanded without altering his position th missus isnt in im going in to see janey explained murdoch he found the little kitchen shining with the saturday cleaning up the flagged floor as glaringly spotless as pipeclay and sandstone could make it the brass ovenhandles and tin pans in a condition to put an intruder out of countenance the fire replenished and janey sitting on a stool on the hearth enveloped in an apron of her mothers and reading laboriously aloud eh dear me she exclaimed its yoan i am na fit to be seen i wur settin down to rest a bit ive been doin th cleanin aw day an i wur real done fur never mind that said murdoch thats all right enough he cast about him for a safe position to takeone in which he could stretch his legs and avoid damaging the embarrassing purity of the floor finally he settled upon a small printcovered sofa and balanced himself carefully upon its extreme edge and the backs of his heels notwithstanding janeys civil protestations dunnot yo moind th floor she said yo neednt set yo down comfortable oh im all right answered murdoch with calm good cheer this is comfortable enough whats that you were reading janey settled down upon her stool with a sigh at once significant of relief and a readiness to indulge in friendly confidence its a book i getten fro th broxton chapel sunday skoo its th memmemoirs memoirs responded murdoch memoyers of mary ann gibbs unfortunately her visitor was not thoroughly posted on the subject of the broxton chapel literature he cast about him mentally but with small success i dont seem to have heard of it before was the conclusion he arrived at hannot yo well its a noice book an theers lots more like it in th skoo liberyaw about sunday skoo scholars as has consumption an th loike an reads th boible to foalk an dees they aw on em dee oh doubtfully but still with respect its not very cheerful is it janey shook her head with an expression of mature resignation eh no theyre none on em cheerfulbut theyre noice to read this here un nowshe had th asthma an summat wrong wi her legs an she knowed aw th boible through aside o th hymnbook an shed sing aw th toime when she could breathe fur th asthma an tell foak as if they did na go an do likewise theyd go to burnin hell wheer th fire is na quenched an th worms dyeth not it cant have been very pleasant for the friends was her companions comment but there was nothing jocose about his manner he was balancing himself seriously on the edge of the hard little sofa and regarding her with speculative interest wheres your mother he asked next hoos gone to th chapel was the answer theers a mothers meetin in th vestry an hoos gone theer an takken th babby wi her th rest o th childer is playin out at th front he glanced out of the door thosethose are not all yours he said thunderstruck aye they arethat eh drawing a long breath but is na there a lot on em theers eleven an ive nussed

that daughter o ffrenchs now eh id like to ha bin her i never heard of her before he answered who is she and why do you choose her cos shes so hansum shes that theer grand she looks loike she thowt

yes feeling his lack of enthusiasm something of a fault idare say i should from the depths of a drawer which she opened with a vigorous effort and some skill in retaining her balance she produced something pinned up in a fragment of old linen this she bore to her guest and unpinning it displayed the handkerchief tha can tak it in thy hond an smell it she said graciously its getten scent on it murdoch took it in his hand scarcely knowing what else to do he knew nothing of women and their finery he regarded the fragrant bit of lace and cambric seriously and read in one corner the name rachel ffrench written in delicate letters then he returned it to janey thank you he said it is very nice janey bore it back perhaps with some slight inward misgivings as to the warmth of its reception but also with a tempering recollection of the ways of menfoak when she came back to her stool she changed the subject weve bin havin trouble lately she said eh but ive seed a lot o trouble i my day what is the trouble now murdoch asked feyther its allus him hes getten in wi a bad lot an hes drinkin agen seems loike neyther mother nor me con keep him straight fur aw we told him haworthll turn him off

lack of patience and was in full flow when her mother entered returning from the chapel with a fagged face and a large baby on her hip here tak him jane ann she said but tak off thy apron furst or thalt tumble ower it an dirty his clean bishop wi th muck thas getten on it eh i am tired whos this here signifying murdoch its mester murdoch said janey dropping the apron and taking the child who made her look topheavy sit thee down mother yo neednt moind him hes a workin mon hissen when murdoch took his departure both accompanied him to the door coom in sometime when th mesters here said mrs briarley happen yo could keep him in a neet an that ud be summat half way up the lane he met haworth in his gig which he stopped wheer hast tha been he asked dropping into dialect as he was prone to do to briarleys cottage talking to the little girl haworth stared at him a moment and then burst into a laugh thart a queer chap he said i can no more than half make thee out if thy head was not so level i should think tha wert a bit soft i dont see why answered murdoch undisturbed the child interests me i am not a lancashire man remember and she is a new species get in said haworth making room for him on the seat murdoch got in and as they drove on it occurred to him to ask a question whos ffrench ffrench said haworth oh ffrench is one o th nobs here hes a chap with a fancy for being a gentlemanmanufacturer hes spent his brass on his notions until he has been obliged to draw in his horns a bit hes never lived much in broxton though hes got a pretty big place here the continents the style for him but hell turn up here again some day when hes hard up enow theres his place now and as he spoke they drove sharply by a house standing closed among the trees and having an air of desolateness in spite of the sunlight chapter vii the whod ha thowt it its th queerest thing i th world said mrs briarley to her neighbors in speaking of her visitorits th queerest thing i th world as he should be a workin mon i should ha thowt hed ha wanted to get behind th counter i a drapers shop or summat genteel hed be a welllookin young chap i a shiny cloth coat an wi a blue necktie on seems loike he does na think enow o hissen hell coom to our house an set down an listen to our janey talkin an tell her things out o books as simple as if he thowt it wur nowt but what ony chap could do theers wheer hes a bit soft he knows nowt o settin hissen up from mrs briarley murdoch heard numberless stories of haworth presenting him in a somewhat startling light eh but hes a rare un is haworth said the good woman he does na care fur mon nor devil the carryins on as he has up at th big house ud mak a decent bodys hair stond o eend afore he built th house he used to go to lunnon an manchester fur his sprees but he has em here now an theers drink an riotin an finery and foak as owt to be shamt o theirsens i wonder he is na feart to stay on th place alone after theyre gone but for one reason or another the house was quiet enough for the first six months of murdochs acquaintance with its master haworth gave himself up to the management of the works he perfected plans he had laid at a time when the power had not been in his own hands he kept his eye on his own interests sharply the most confirmed shirkers on the place found themselves obliged to fall to work however reluctantly his bold strokes of business enterprise began to give him wide reputation in the lapse of its first half year haworths gained for itself a name at the end of this time murdoch arrived at the works one morning to find a general tone of conviviality reigning a devilmaycare air showed itself among all the graceless there was a hint of demoralization in the very atmosphere wheres haworth he asked floxham who did not seem to share the general hilarity ive not seen him no was the engineers answer nor tha will na see him yet a bit a lot o foos coom fro lunnon last neet hes on one o his sprees an a nice doment theyll ha on it afore theyre done the next morning haworth dashed down to the works early in his gig and spent a short time in his room before he left he went to the engineroom and spoke to murdoch is there aught you want from the houseaught in the way o books i mean he said with a touch of rough bravado in his manner no murdoch answered all right he returned then keep away lad for a day or two during the day or two broxton existed in a state of ferment gradually an air of disreputable festivity began to manifest itself among all those whose virtue was assailable there were open sprees among these and their wives with the inevitable baby in their arms stood upon their doorsteps bewailing their fate and retailing gossip with no slight zest silks an satins bless yo they said an paint an feathers th brazent things i wonder they are na shamt to show their faces a noice mester haworth is to ha men under him having occasion to go out late one evening murdoch encountered janey clad in the big bonnet and shawl and hurrying along the street wheer am i goin she echoed sharply in reply to his query why im goin round to th publics to look fur feythertheers wheer im goin i hannot seed him sin dayleet this mornin an hes getten th rent an th buryinclub money wi him ill go with you said murdoch he went with her making the round of half the publichouses in the village finally ending at a jovial establishment bearing upon its whitened window the ambiguous title whod ha thowt it there was a sound of argument accompanied by a fiddle and an odor of beer supplemented by tobacco janey pushed open the door and made her way in followed by her companion an uncleanly and loudvoiced fellow stood unsteadily at a table flourishing a clay pipe and making a speech th workin mon he said theers too much talk o th workin mon is na it bad enow to be a workin mon wiout havin th gentry remindin yo on it fro year eend to year eend les ha less jawwork an more pawwork fro th gentry les ha fewer liberys an athyneums an more wagean holidaysanan beer les progressthas wha i sayan im a workin mon eeer eeer cried the chorus eeer in the midst of the pause following these acclamations a voice broke in suddenly with startling loudness eeer eeer it said it was mr briarley who had unexpectedly awakened from a beery nap and though much surprised to find out where he was felt called upon to express his approbation janey hitched her shawl into a manageable length and approached him thart here she said i knowed tha would be thalt worrit th loife out on us afore thart done coom on home wi me afore thast spent ivvery hapenny weve getten mr briarley roused himself so far as to smile at her blandly its zhaney he said its zhaney don intrup th meetin zhaney ill be home dreckly mus na intrup th workin mon hes th backbone n sinoo o th country les ha a sup more beer murdoch bent over and touched his shoulder you had better come home he said the man looked round at him blankly but the next moment an exaggerated expression of enlightenment showed itself on his face iss th merican he said iss murdoch and then with sudden bibulous delight gi us a speech bout merica in a moment there was a clamor all over the room the last words had been spoken loudly enough to be heard and the idea presented itself to the members of the assembly as a happy one aye they cried les ha a speech fro th merican les hear summat fro merica theers wheer ths laborin mon has his dues murdoch turned about and faced the company you all know enough of me to know whether i am a speechmaking man or not he said i have nothing to say about america and if i had i should not say it here you are not doing yourselves any good the least fellow among you has brains enough to tell him that there was at once a new clamor this time one of dissatisfaction the speechmaker with the long clay who was plainly the leader expressed himself with heat and scorn hes a noice chaphe is he cried hell ha nowt to do wi us hes th soart o workin mon to ha abowt to play th pianny an do paintin i velvet merica be danged hes more o th gentry koind today than haworth haworth does tak a decent spree now an then but this heer un ax him to tak a glass o beer an see what hell say disgust was written upon every countenance but no one proffered the hospitality mentioned mr briarley had fallen asleep again murmuring suggestively aye les hear summat fro merica les go to merica pur on thy bonnet lass purit on with her companions assistance janey got him out of the place and led him home haaf th rents gone she said when she turned out his pockets as he sat by the fire an wheers th buryin money to coom fro mr briarley shook his head mournfully th buryin money he said aye ideed a noice thing it is fur a poor chap to ha to cut off his beer to pay fur his coffin by th weekwastin good brass on summat he may nivver need as long as he lives i dunnot loike th thowt on it eyther its bad enow to ha to get into th thing at th eend wiout hain it lugged up to th door ivvery saturday an payin fur th ornymentin on it by inches chapter viii mr ffrench it was a week before affairs assumed their accustomed aspect not that the works had been neglected however each morning haworth had driven down early and spent an hour in his office and about the place reading letters issuing orders and keeping a keen lookout generally ill have no spreeing here among you chaps he announced spree as much as you like when th works done but you dont spree in my time look sharp after em kendal the day after his guests left him he appeared at his usual time and sent at once for murdoch on his arriving he greeted him leaning back in his chair his hands thrust into his pockets well lad he said its over almost unconsciously murdoch thrust his hands into his pockets also but the action had rather a reflective than a defiant expression its lasted a pretty long time hasnt it he remarked haworth answered him with a laugh egad you take it cool enough he said suddenly he got up and began to walk about his air a mixture of excitement and braggadocio after a turn or two he wheeled about why dont you say summat he demanded sardonically summat moral you dont mean to tell me youve not got pluck enow i dont see said murdoch deliberatelyi dont see that theres anything to say do you the man stared at him reddening then he turned about and flung himself into his chair again no he answered by george i dont they discussed the matter no further it seemed to dispose of itself their acquaintance went on in the old way but there were moments afterward when murdoch felt that the man regarded him with something that might have been restrained or secret feara something which held him back and made him silent and unready of speech once in the midst of a conversation taking a more confidential tone than usual to his companions astonishment he stopped and spoke bluntly if i say aught as goes against the grain with you he said speak up lad blast it striking his fist hard against his palm id like to show my clean side to you it was at this time that he spoke first of his mother when i run away from the poorhouse he said i left her there shes a softhearted bodya good one too as soon as i earned my first fifteen shillin a week i gave her a house of her ownand i lived hard to do it she lives like a lady now though shes as simple as ever she knows naught of the world and she knows naught of me beyond what she sees of me when i go down to the little countryplace in kent with a new silk gown and a lace cap for her she scarce ever wears em but shes as fond on em as if she got em from buckingham palace she thinks im a lad yet and say my prayers every night and the catechism on sundays shell never know aught else if i can help it thats why i keep her where she is when he said that he intended to make haworths second to no place in england he had not spoken idly his pride in the place was a passion he spent money lavishly but shrewdly he paid his men well but ruled them with an iron hand those of his fellowmanufacturers who were less bold and also less keensighted regarded him with no small disfavor hell have trouble yet that haworth fellow they said but haworths flourished and grew the original works were added to and new hands being called for flocked into broxton with their families it was jem haworth who built the rows of cottages to hold them and he built them well and substantially but as a sharp business investment and a matter of pride rather than from any weakness of regarding them from a moral standpoint ill have no poor jobs done on my place he announced ill leave that to the gentlemen manufacturers it was while in the midst of this work that he received a letter from gerard ffrench who was still abroad going into his room one day murdoch found him reading it and looking excited heres a chap as would be the chap for me he said if brass were ironthat chap ffrench what does he want murdoch asked naught much grimly hes got a notion of coming back here and hed like to go into partnership with me thats what hes drivin at hed like to be a partner with jem haworth what has he to offer cheek and plenty on it he says his names well known and hes got influence as well as practical knowledge id like to have a bit of a talk with him suddenly he struck his fist on the table before him ive got a name thats enow for me he said the days to come yet when i ask any chap for name or money or aught else partner be damned this heres haworths chapter ix not for one hour the meetings of the malcontents continued to be held at the whod ha thowt it and were loud voiced and frequent but notwithstanding their frequency and noisiness resulted principally in a disproportionate consumption of beer and tobacco and in some differences of opinion decided in a gentlemanly manner with the assistance of backers and a ring having been rescued from these surroundings by murdoch on several convivial occasions briarley began to anticipate his appearance with resignation if not cheerfulness and to make preparations accordingly i mun lay a sup in reet at th start he would say theers no knowin how soon hell turn up if he drops in to see th women gi me a glass afore these chaps mary they con wait a bit why does tha stand it tha foo some independent spirit would comment con th chap carry thee whoam if tha does na want to go but briarley never rebelled resistance was not his forte if it were possible to become comfortably drunk before he was sought out and led away he felt it a matter for mild selfgratulation but he bore defeat amiably th missis wants me he would say unsteadily but with beaming countenance on catching sight of murdoch or janey th missis has sent to ax me to go anan set wi her a bit i mun go chaps a man munna negleck his famly in response to mrs briarleys ratings and janeys querulous appeals it was his habit to shed tears copiously and with a touch of ostentation im a poor chap missus he would say im a poor chap yo munnot be hard on me i nivver wur good enow fur a woman loike yoursen i should na wonder if i had to join th teetotals after aw tha knows it allus rains o whitsaturday when they ha their walk an that theer looks as if th almoighty wur on th teetotal soide its noan loike hed go to so mich trouble if he were na at such crises as these th women foak as he called his wife and janey derived their greatest consolation from much going to chapel if it wur na fur th bit o comfort i get theer said the poor woman i should na know whether i wur standin on my head or my heelsbetwixt him an th work an th childer happen yed loike to go wi us said janey to murdoch one day yoll be sure to hear a good sermont murdoch went with them and sat in a corner of their free seata hard one with a straight and unrelenting back but he was not prevented by the seat from being interested and even absorbed by the doctrine he had an absentminded way of absorbing impressions and the unemotional tenor of his life had left him singularly impartial he did not finally decide that the sermon was good bad or indifferent but he pondered on it and its probable effects deeply and with no little curiosity it was a long sermon and one which hit straight from the shoulder it displayed a florid heaven and a burning hell it was literal and well garnished with telling and scriptural quotations once or twice during its delivery murdoch glanced at janey and mrs briarley the woman during intervals of eager pacifying of the big baby lifted her pale face and listened devoutly janey sat respectable and rigorous her eyes fixed upon the pulpit her huge shawl folded about her her bonnet slipping backward at intervals and requiring to be repeatedly rearranged by a smart hustling somewhere in the region of the crown the night was very quiet when they came out into the open air the smokeclouds of the day had been driven away by a light breeze and the sky was bright with stars mrs briarley and the ubiquitous baby joined a neighbor and hastened home but murdoch and janey lingered a little my father is buried here murdoch had said and janey had answered with sharp curiousness wheers th place id loike to see it has tha getten a big headstone up she was somewhat disappointed to find there was none and that nothing but the sod covered the long mound but she appeared to comprehend the state of affairs at once i spose thalt ha one after a bit she said when thart not so short as tha art now ivverybodys short i these toimes she seated herself upon the stone coping of the next grave her elbow on her knee a small weird figure in the uncertain light i allus did loike a big headstone she remarked reflectively theers summat noice about a big white un wi black letters on it i loike a white un th best an ha th letters cut deep an th name big an a bit o poitry at th eend stranger a moment linger near an hark to th one as moulders here thy bones loike mine shall rot i th ground until th last awful trumpets sound thy flesh loike mine fa to decay for mon is made to pass away summat loike that but yo see it ud be loike to cost so much what wi th stone an paint an cuttin i should na wonder if it would na coom to th matter o two poundan then theers th funeral she ended with a sigh and sank for a moment into a depressed reverie but in the course of a few moments she roused herself again tell me summat about thy feyther she demanded murdoch bent down and plucked a blade of grass with a rather uncertain grasp there isnt much to tell he answered he was unfortunate and had a hard lifeand died janey looked at his lowered face with a sharp unchildish twinkle in her eye would tha moind me axin thee summat she said no but she hesitated a little before she put the question is itwur it trueas he wur na aw theeras he wur a bita bit soft i th yed no that is not true im glad it is na she responded art tha loike him i dont know i hope tha art na if he did na ha luck theers a great deal i luck then with a quick change of subjecthow did tha loike th sermont i am not sure he answered that i know that either how did you like it yourself ay with an air of elderly approval it wur a good un mester hixon allus gies us a good un he owts wi what hes getten to say i loike a preacher as owts wi it a few moments later when they rose to go home her mind seemed suddenly to revert to a former train of thought wur theer money i that thing thy feyther wur tryin at she asked not for him it seemed ay but theer mought be fur thee tha mayst ha more in thee than he had an mought mak summat on it id nivver let owt go as had money i it thadst mak a better rich mon than haworth after leaving her murdoch did not go home he turned his back upon the village again and walked rapidly away from it out on the country road and across field paths and did not turn until he was miles from broxton of late he had been more than usually abstracted he had been restless and at times nervously unstrung he had slept ill and spent his days in a halfconscious mood more than once as they walked together floxham had spoken to him amazed whats up wi thee lad he had said art dazed or hast tha takken a turn an been on a spree one night when they were together haworth had picked up from the floor a rough but intricatelooking drawing and on handing it to him had been bewildered by his sudden change of expression is it aught of yours he had asked yes the young fellow had answered its mine but instead of replacing it in his pocket he had torn it slowly into strips and thrown it piece by piece into the fire watching it as it burned it was not janeys eminently practical observations which had stirred him tonight he had been drifting toward this feverish crisis of feeling for months and had contested its approach inch by inch there were hours when he was overpowered by the force of what he battled against and this was one of them it was nearly midnight when he returned and his mother met him at the door with an anxious look it was a look he had seen upon her face all his life but its effect upon himself had never lessened from the day he had first recognized it as a child i did not think you would wait for me he said it is later than i thought i am not tired she answered she had aged a little since her husbands death but otherwise she had not changed she looked up at her son just as she had looked at his fatherwatchfully but saying little are you going to bed i am going upstairs he replied but he did not say that he was going to bed he bade her goodnight shortly afterward and went to his room it was the one his father had used before his death and the trunk containing his belongings stood in one corner of it for a short time after entering the room he paced the floor restlessly and irregularly sometimes he walked quickly sometimes slowly once or twice he stopped short checking himself as he veered toward the corner in which stood the unused trunk im in a queer humor he said aloud im thinking of it as ifas if it were a temptation to sin why should i he made a sudden resolute movement forward he knelt down and turning the key in the lock flung the trunklid backward there was only one thing he wanted and he knew where to find it it lay buried at the bottom under the unused garments which gave forth a faint damp odor as he moved them when he rose from his knees he held the wooden case in his hand after he had carried it to the table and opened it and the model stood again before him he sat down and stared at it with a numb sense of fascination i thought i had seen the last of it he said and here it is even as he spoke he felt his blood warm within him and flush his cheek his hand trembled as he put it forth to touch and move the framework before him he felt as if it were a living creature his eye kindled and he bent forward theres something to be done with it yet he said its not a blunder ill swear he was hot with eagerness and excitement the thing had haunted him day and night for weeks he had struggled to shake off its influence but in vain he had told himself that the temptation to go back to it and ponder over it was the working of a morbid taint in his blood he had remembered the curse it had been and had tried to think of that only but it had come back to him again and again andhere it was he spent an hour over it and in the end his passionate eagerness had grown rather than diminished he put his hand up to his forehead and brushed away drops of moisture his throat was dry and his eyes strained theres something to be brought out of it yet he said as he had said before it can be done i swear the words had scarcely left his lips before he heard behind him a low but sharp crya miserable ejaculation half uttered he had not heard the door open nor the entering footsteps but he knew what the cry meant the moment he heard it he turned about and saw his mother standing on the threshold if he had been detected in the commission of a crime he could not have felt a sharper pang than he did he almost staggered against the wall and did not utter a word for a moment they looked at each other in a dead silence each wore in the eyes of the other a new aspect she pointed to the model it has come back she said i knew it would the young fellow turned and looked at it a little stupidly ididnt mean to hurt you with the sight of it he said i took it out becausebecause she stopped him with a movement of her head yes i know she said you took it out because it has haunted you and tempted you you could not withstand it it is in your blood he had known her through all his life as a patient creature whose very pains had bent themselves and held themselves in check lest they should seem for an hour to stand in the way of the end to be accomplished that she had even in the deepest secrecy rebelled against fate he had never dreamed she came to the table and struck the model aside with one angry blow shall i tell you the truth she cried panting i have never believed in it for an hournot for one hour he could only stammer out a few halting words this is all new to me he said i did not know no you did not know she answered how should you when i lived my whole life to hide it i have been stronger than you thought i bore with him as i should have borne with him if he had been maimed or blindor worse than that i did not hurt himhe had hurt enough i knew what the end would be he would have been a happy man and i a happy woman if it had not been for that and there it is again i tell you passionately there is a curse on it and you think he said that it has fallen upon me she burst into wild tears i have told myself it would she said i have tried to prepare myself for its coming some day but i did not think it would show itself so soon as this i dont know why he said slowly i dont knowwhat there is in me that i should think i might do what he left undone there seems a kind of vanity in it it is not vanity she said it is worse it is what has grown out of my misery and his i tell you it is in your blood a flush rose to his face and a stubborn look settled upon him perhaps it is he answered i have told myself that too she held her closed hand upon her heart as if to crush down its passionate heavings begin as he began she cried and the end will come to you as it came to him give it up nownow give it up he repeated after her give it up she answered or give up your whole life your youth your hopeall that belongs to it she held out her hands to him in a wild unconsciously theatrical gesture the whole scene had been theatrical through its very incongruousness and murdoch had seen this vaguely and been more shaken by it than anything else before she knew what he meant to do he approached the table and replaced the model in its box the touch of stubborn desperateness on him yet he carried the case back to the trunk and shut it in once more ill let it rest a while he said ill promise you that if it is ever to be finished by me the time will come when it will see the light again in spite of us both chapter x christian murdoch as he was turning into the gate of the works the next morning a little lad touched him upon the elbow mester he said sithee mesterstop a bit he was out of breath as if he had been running and he held in his hand a slip of paper i thowt i should na ketch thee he said thart so longlegged a woman sent thee that and he gave him the slip of paper murdoch opened and read the words written upon it if you are stephen murdochs son i must see you come with the child there was no signatureonly these words written irregularly and weakly he had never met with an adventure in his life and this was like an episode in a romance if you are stephen murdochs son i must see you he could scarcely realize that he was standing in the narrow uphill street jostled by the hands shouting and laughing as they streamed past him through the gates to their work and yet somehow he found himself taking it more coolly than seemed exactly natural this morning emotion and event appeared less startling than they would have done even the day before the strange scene of the past night had in a manner prepared him for anything which might happen who sent it he asked of the boy th woman as lodges i our house shes been theer three days an shes getten to th last mother says con tha coom shes promist me a shillin if i browt thee wait here a minute said murdoch he passed into the works and went to floxham ive had a message that calls me away he said if you can spare me for an hour ill mak out said the engineer the lad at the gate looked up with an encouraging grin when he saw his charge returning id loike to mak th shillin he said murdoch followed him in silence he was thinking of what was going to happen to himself scarcely as much as of the dead man in whose name he was called upon he was brought near to him again as if it were by a fate if you are stephen murdochs son had moved him strongly their destination was soon reached it was a house in a narrow but respectable street occupied chiefly by a decent class of workmen and their families a week before he had seen in the window of this same house a card bearing the legend lodgings to let and now it was gone a clean motherly woman opened the door for them thast earnt thy shillin has tha tha young nowt she said to the lad with friendly severity coom in mester i wur feart hed get off on some of his marocks an forget aw about th paper shes i a bad way poor lady an th lass is na o mich use coom upstairs she led the way to the second floor and her knock being answered by a voice inside she opened the door the room was comfortable and of good size a fire burned on the grate and before it sat a girl with her hands clasped upon her knee she was a girl of nineteen dark of face and slight of figure to thinness when she turned her head slowly to look at him murdoch was struck at once with the peculiar steadiness of her large black eyes she is asleep she said in a low cold voice there was a sound as of movement in the bed i am awake some one said if it is stephen murdochs son let him come here murdoch went to the bedside and stood looking down at the woman who returned his gaze she was a woman whose last hours upon earth were passing rapidly her beauty was now only something terrible to see her breath came fast and short her eyes met his with a look of anguish send the girl away she said to him low as her voice was the girl heard it she rose without turning to right or left and went out of the room until the door closed the woman still lay looking up into her visitors face but as soon as it was shut she spoke laboriously what is your name she asked he told her you are like your father she said and then closed her eyes and lay so for a moment it is a mad thing i am doing she said knitting her brows with weak fretfulness and still lying with closed eyes ii do not knowwhy i should have done itonly that it is the last thing it is not that i am fond of the girlor that she is fond of me she opened her eyes with a start is the door shut she said keep her out of the room she is not here he answered and the door is closed the sight of his face seemed to help her to recover herself what am i saying she said i have not told you who i am no he replied not yet my name was janet murdoch she said i was your fathers cousin once he was very fond of me she drew from under her pillow a few old letters look at them she said he wrote them but he only glanced at the superscription and laid them down again i did not know she panted that he was dead i hoped he would be here i knew that he must have lived a quiet life i always thought of him as living here in the old way he was away from here for thirty years said murdoch he only came back to die he she said i never thought of that itseems very strange i could not imagine his going from place to placeor living a busy lifeor suffering much he was so simple and so quiet i thought of him she went on because he was a good mana good manand there was no one else in the world as the end came i grew restlessi wanted toto try but there her eyes closed and she forgot herself again what was it you wanted to try to do he asked gently she roused herself as before with a start to try she saidto try to do something for the girl he did not understand what she meant until she had dragged herself up upon the pillow and leaned forward touching him with her hand she had gathered all her strength for the effort i am an outcast she saidan outcast the simple and bare words were so terrible that he could scarcely bear them but he controlled himself by a strong effort a faint color crept up on her cheek you dont understand she said yes he answered slowly i think i do she fell back upon her pillows i wont tell you the whole story she said it is an ugly one and she will be ready enough with it when her turn comes she has understood all her life she has never been a child she seemed to fasten her eyes upon me from the hour of her birth and i have felt them ever since keep her away with a shudder dont let her come in a sudden passion of excitement seized upon her i dont know why i should care she cried there is no reason why she should not live as i have livedbut she will notshe will not i have reached the end and she knows it she sits and looks on and says nothing but her eyes force me to speak they forced me to come hereto tryto make a last effort if stephen murdoch had lived she stopped a moment you are a poor man she said yes he answered i am a mechanic thenyou cannotdo it she spoke helplessly wildly there is nothing to be done there is no one else she will be all alone then he comprehended her meaning fully no he said i am not so poor as that i am not a poorer man than my father was and i can do what he would have done had he lived my mother will care for the girl if that is what you wish what i wish she echoed i wish for nothingbut i must do something for herbeforebeforebefore she broke off but began again you are like your father you make things seem simple you speak as if you were undertaking nothing it is not much to do he answered and we could not do less i will go to my mother and tell her that she is needed here she will come to you she turned her eyes on him in terror you think she whispered that i shall die soonsoon he did not answer her he could not she wrung her hands and dashed them open upon the bed panting oh she cried my god it is over i have come to the end of itthe end to have only one lifeand to have done with itand lie here to have livedand lovedand triumphed and to know it is over one may defy all the rest the whole world but not this it is done then she turned to him again desperately go to your mother she said tell her to come i want some one in the room with me i wont be left alone with her i cannot bear it on going out he found the girl sitting at the head of the stairs she rose and stood aside to let him pass looking at him unflinchingly are you coming back she demanded yes he answered i am coming back in half an hour he reascended the staircase bringing his mother with him when they entered the room in which the dying woman lay mrs murdoch went to the bed and bent over her my son has brought me to do what i can for you she said and to tell you that he will keep his promise the woman looked up for a moment it seemed that she had forgotten a change had come upon her even in the intervening halfhour his promise she said yes he will keep it at midnight she died mother and son were in the room the girl sat in a chair at the bedside her hands were clasped upon her knee she sat without motion at a few minutes before the stroke of twelve the woman awoke from the heavy sleep in which she had lain she awoke with a start and a cry and lay staring at the girl whose steady eyes were fixed upon her her lips moved and at last she spoke forgive me she cried forgive me murdoch and his mother rose but the girl did not stir for what she asked for panted the woman for but the sentence remained unfinished the girl did not utter a word she sat looking at the dying woman in silenceonly looking at her not once moving her eyes from the face which a moment later was merely a mask of stone which lay upon the pillow gazing back at her with a fixed stare chapter xi miss ffrench returns they took the girl home with them and three days later the ffrenchs returned they came entirely unheralded and it was janey who brought the news of their arrival to the works theyve coom she said in passing murdoch on her way to her father mester ffrench an her they rode through th town this mornin i a kerridge nobody knowed about it till they seed em the news was the principal topic of conversation through the day and the comments made were numerous and varied the most general opinions were that ffrench was in a tight place or had getten some crank i hond hes noan fond enow o th place to ha coom back fur nowt said floxham hes a bit harder up than common thats it in the course of the morning haworth came in murdoch was struck with his unsettled and restless air he came in awkwardly and looking as if he had something to say but though he loitered about some time he did not say it come up to the house tonight he broke out at last i want company it occurred to murdoch that he wished to say more but after lingering for a few minutes he went away as he crossed the threshold however he paused uneasily i say he said ffrench has come back so i heard murdoch answered when he presented himself at the house in the evening haworth was alone as usual wines were on the table and he seemed to have drunk deeply he was flushed and showed still the touch of uneasiness and excitement he had betrayed in the morning im glad youve come he said im out of sortsor something he ended with a short laugh and turned about to pour out a glass of wine in doing so his hand trembled so that a few drops fell upon it he shook them off angrily whats up with me he said he drained the glass at a draught and filled it again i saw ffrench today he said i saw them both both repeated murdoch wondering at him yes she is with him she and then remembering the episode of the handkerchief he added rather slowly you mean miss ffrench haworth nodded he was pushing his glass to and fro with shaking hands his voice was hoarse and uncertain i passed the carriage on the road he said and ffrench stopped it to speak to me hes not much altered i never saw her before shes a woman nowand a handsome woman by george the last words broke from him as if he could not control them he looked up at murdoch and as their eyes met he seemed to let himself loose i may as well make a clean breast of it he said imim hard hit im hard hit murdoch flinched he would rather not have heard the rest he had had emotion enough during the last few days and this was of a kind so novel that he was overwhelmed by it but haworth went on its a queer thing he said i cant quite make it out ii feel as if i must talkabout itand yet theres naught to say ive seen a woman thatsthats taken hold on me he passed his hands across his lips which were parched and stiff you know the kind of a fellow ive been he said ive known women enough and too many but theres never been one like this theres always been plenty like the rest i sat and stared at this one like a blockhead she set me trembling it came over me all at once i dont know what ffrench thought i said to myself heres the first woman that ever held me back shes one of your high kind thats hard to get nigh shes got a way to set a man mad shell be hard to get at by george murdoch felt his pulse start the mans emotion had communicated itself to him so far at least i dont know much of women he said ive not been thrown among them i no said haworth roughly theyre not in your line lad if they were happen i shouldnt be so ready to speak out then he began and told his story more minutely relating how as he drove to the works he had met the carriage and ffrench had caught sight of him and ordered the servant to stop how he had presented his daughter and spoken as if she had heard of him often before how she had smiled a little but had said nothing shes got a way which makes a man feel as if she was keeping something back and sets him to wondering what it is shes not likely to be forgot soon she gives a chap something to think over he talked fast and heatedly and sometimes seemed to lose himself now and then he stopped and sat brooding a moment in silence and then roused himself with a start and drank more wine and grew more flushed and excited after one of these fitful reveries he broke out afresh iwonder what folkll say to her of me they wont give me an over good name ill warrant what a fool ive been what a d fool ive been all my life let them say what they like theyll make me black enough but there is plenty would like to stand in jem haworths shoes ive never been beat yet ive stood up and held my ownand women like that and as to th name with rough banter its not chaps like you they fancy after all as to that said murdoch coldly ive told you i know nothing of women he felt restive without knowing why he was glad when he could free himself and get out into the fresh night air it seemed all the fresher after the atmosphere he had breathed indoors the night was bright and mild after cold unspringlike weather had come an ephemeral balminess the moon was at full and he stepped across the threshold into a light as clear as day he walked rapidly scarcely noting the road he passed over until he had reached the house which stood alone among its treesthe house haworth had pointed out a few months before it was lighted now and its lights attracted his attention its a brighterlooking place than it was then he said he never afterward could exactly recall how it was that at this moment he started turned and for a breaths space came to a full stop he had passed out of the shadow of the high boundary wall into the broad moonlight which flooded the gateway the iron gates were open and a white figure stood in the lightthe figure of a tall young woman who did not move he was so near that her dress almost touched him in another moment he was hurrying along the road again not having spoken and scarcely understanding the momentary shock he had received that he said to himselfthat was she when he reached home and opened the door of the little parlor christian murdoch was sitting alone by the dying fire in the grate she turned and looked at him something she said has happened to you what is it i dont know he answered that anything has happened to meanything of importance she turned to the fire again and sat gazing at it rubbing the back of one hand slowly with the palm of the other as it lay on her knee something has happened to me she said today i have seen some one i know some one you know he echoed here she nodded her head some one i know she repeated though i do not know her name i should like to know it her name he said then it is a woman yes a womana young woman i saw her abroadfourfive times she began to check off the number of times on her fingers in florence once she said in munich twice in parisyes in paris twice again when and how he asked as he spoke he thought of the unruffled serenity of the face he had just seen years ago the first time she answered without the least change of tone in a church in florence i went in because i was wet and cold and hungry and it was light and warm there i was a little thing and left to ramble in the streets i liked the streets better than my mothers room i was standing in the church looking at the people and trying to feel warm when a girl came in with a servant she was handsome and well dressed and looked almost like a woman when she saw me she laughed i was such a little thing and so draggled and forlorn that was why she laughed the next year i saw her again at munich her room was across the street and opposite mine and she sat at the window amusing herself by playing with her dog and staring at me she had forgotten me but i had not forgotten her and she laughed at me again in paris it was the same thing our windows were opposite each other again it was five years after but that time she knew me though she pretended she did not she drove past the house today and i saw her i should like to know her name i think i can tell you what it is he said she is a miss ffrench her father is a broxton man they have a place here have they she asked will they live here i believe so he answered she sat for a moment rubbing her hand slowly as before and then she spoke so much the worse she saidso much the worse for me she went up to her room when she left him it was a little room in the second story and she had become fond of it she often sat alone there she had been sitting at its window when rachel ffrench had driven by in the afternoon the window was still open she saw as she entered and a gust of wind passing through it had scattered several light articles about the floor she went to pick them up they were principally loose papers and as she bent to raise the first one she discovered that it was yellow with age and covered with a rough drawing of some mechanical appliance another and another presented the same plandrawn again and again elaborately and with great pains at times and then hastily as if some new thought had suggested itself on several were written dates and on others a few words she was endeavoring to decipher some of these faintly written words when a fresh gust of rising wind rushed past her as she stood and immediately there fell upon her ear a slight ghostly rustle near her was a small unused closet whose door had been thrown open and as she turned toward it there fluttered from one of the shelves a sheet of paper yellower than the rest she picked it up and read the words written upon the back of the drawing they had been written twentysix years before today the child was born it is a boy by the time he is a year old my work will be done the girls heart began to beat quickly the papers rustled again and a kind of fear took possession of her he wrote it she said aloud the man who is deadwho is dead and it was not finished at all she closed the window eager to shut out the wind then she closed the door and went back to the papers her fancies concerning stephen murdoch had taken very definite shape from the first she knew two things of him that he had been gentle and unworldly and that he had cherished throughout his life a hope which had eluded him until death had come between him and his patient and unflagging labor the sight of the yellow faded papers moved her to powerful feeling she had never had a friend she had stood alone from her earliest childhood and here was a creature who had been desolate toowho must have been desolate since he had been impelled to write the simple outcome of his thoughts again and again upon the paper he wrought on as if no human being had been near to hear it was this which touched her most of all there was scarcely a sheet upon which some few words were not written each new plan bore its date and some hopeful or weary thought he had been tired often but never faithless to his belief the end was never very far off a few days one more touch would bring itand then he had forgotten all the past i can afford to forget it he said once it only seems strange now that it should have lasted so long when so few steps remain to be taken these words had been written on his leaving america he was ready for his departure they were the last record when she had read them christian pushed the papers away and sat gazing into space with dilated eyes he died she said he is dead nothing can bring him back and it is forgotten chapter xii granny dixon the next time janey brought her fathers dinner to the yard she sought out murdoch in a dejected mood she found him reading over his lunch in the sunshine and she sat down opposite to him folding her arms on her lap were i trouble again at our house she said were allus i trouble if it is na one thing its another murdoch shut his book and leaned back upon his pile of lumber to listen he always listened what is it this time this toime querulously this is th worst o th lot granny dixons come back granny dixon janey shook her head tha knows nowt

dunnot speak so loud an if yo get close up to her ear an say things slow yod get used to it i toime ill come some day answered murdoch speculating with some doubt as to the possible result of the visit her mind relieved janey rose to take her departure suddenly however a new idea presented itself to her active mind has tha seen miss ffrench yet she asked yes he answered what does tha think on her he picked up his book and reopened it i only saw her for an instant he said i hadnt time to think anything on his way from his work a few days later he stopped at the briarley cottage it was swept and garnished there were no traces of the children about before he reached the house there had been borne to him the sound of a voice reading at its highest and shrillest pitch and he had recognized it as janeys as he entered that young person rose panting from her seat in her eagerness almost dropping the graphically illustrated paper she held in her hand eh she exclaimed i am glad to see thee i could na ha stood it mich longer she would ha me read the tobecontinyerd one an ive bin at it nigh an hour granny dixon turned on her sharply what art tha stoppin fur she demanded whats th matter wi

repeated get on wi thee janey drew near and spoke in her ear its mester murdoch she proclaimed him as i towd yo on the little bent figure turned slowly and murdoch felt himself transfixed by the gaze of a pair of large keen eyes they had been handsome eyes half a century before and the wrinkled and seamed face had had its comeliness too tha said he wur a workin mon she cried after a pause what did tha tell me that theer fur he is a workin mon said janey hes getten his workcloas on now does na tha see em cloas announced the voice again cloas ideed a mon is na made out o cloas ive seed workin men afore i my day an i know em then she extended her hand crooking the forefinger like a claw in a beckoning gesture coom tha here she commanded an set thysen down to talk to me she gave the order in the manner of a female potentate and murdoch obeyed her with a sense of overpowering fascination wheer art tha fro she demanded he made his reply from america as distinct as possible and was relieved to find that it reached her at once merica she repeated ive heerd o merica often enow thats wheer th blacks live an th indians i knowed a young chap as went theer an th indians scalped him he went theer because i would na ha him it wur when i wur a lass she paused a moment and then said the last words over again nodding her head with a touch of grim satisfaction he went theer because i would na ha him it wur when i wur a lass he was watching her so intently that he was quite startled a second time when she turned her eyes upon him and spoke again still nodding i wur a hansome lass she said i wur a hansome lassseventy year ago it was quite plain that she had been the thing which was least pleasant about her now was a certain dead and withered suggestion of a beauty of a not altogether sinless order the recollection of the fact seemed to enliven her so far that she was inspired to conducting the greater part of the conversation herself her voice grew louder and louder a dull red began to show itself on her cheeks and her eyes sparkled she had been a hansome lass seventy year ago an had had her dayas theer wur dead folk could tell shell go on i that rood aw neet if summat

there her voice changed and grew sharp and tremulous wheers that flower she cried whos getten it janey turned toward the door and uttered a shrill little cry of excitement its miss ffrench she said shesshes stondin at th door it would have been impossible to judge from her expression how long she had been there she stood upon the threshold with a faint smile on her lips and spoke to janey i want to see your mother she said illill go and tell her the child faltered will yo coom in she hesitated a second and then came in murdoch had arisen she did not seem to see him as she passed before him to reach the chair in which she sat down in fact she expressed scarcely a shadow of recognition of her surroundings but upon granny dixon had fallen a sudden feverish tremor who did she say yo wur she cried i did na hear her the visitor turned and confronted her i am rachel ffrench she answered in a clear high voice the dull red deepened upon the old womans cheeks and her eyes gained new fire yore a good un to mak a body hear she said an i know yo miss ffrench made no reply she smiled incredulously at the fire the old woman moved restlessly ay but i do she cried i know yo yore ffrench fro head

yore th very moral on him miss ffrench got up and turned toward the door to speak to mrs briarley who that moment arrived in great haste carrying the baby out of breath and stumbling in her tremor at receiving gentle folk company your visitor has been talking to me she remarked her little smile showing itself again she says my grandfather was a devil she answered all mrs briarleys terrified apologies with the same little smile she had been passing by and had remembered that the housekeeper needed assistance in some matter and it had occurred to her to come in that was all and having explained herself she went away as she had come eh fretted mrs briarley to think o that theer owd besom talkin i that rood to a lady thats allus th way wi her shed mak trouble anywheer she made

so mich as sayin goodday to a body shes as loike him as two peasan he wur a devil here to murdoch pick up that theer flower shes dropped murdoch turned to the place she pointed out the white flower lay upon the flagged floor he picked it up and handed it to her with a vague recognition of the powerfulness of its fragrance she took it and sat mumbling over it its th very same she muttered he used to wear em i his buttonhole when he coom an shes th very moral on him chapter xiii mr ffrench visits the works there were few men in broxton or the country surrounding it who were better known than gerard ffrench in the first place he belonged as it were to broxton and his family for several generations back had belonged to it his greatgrandfather had come to the place a rich man and had built a huge house outside the village and as the village had become a town the ffrenchs had held their heads high they had confined themselves to broxton until gerard ffrench took his place they had spent their lives there and their money those who lived to remember the youth and manhood of the present ffrenchs father had like granny dixon their stories to tell his son however was a man of a different mold there were no evil stories of him he was a wellbred and agreeable person and lived a refined life but he was a man with tastes which scarcely belonged to his degree i ought to have been born in the lower classes and have had my way to make he had been heard to say unfortunately however he had been born a gentleman of leisure and educated as one but this did not prevent him from indulging in his proclivities he had made more than one wild business venture which had electrified his neighbors once he had been on the verge of a great success and again he had overstepped the verge of a great loss he had lost money but he had never lost confidence in his business ability i have gained experience he said i shall know better next time his wife had died early and his daughter had spent her girlhood with a relative abroad she had developed into beauty so faultless that it had been said that its order belonged rather to the world of pedestals and catalogues than to ordinary young womanhood but the truth was that she was not an ordinary young woman at all i suppose she said at dinner on the evening of her visit to the briarley cottagei suppose these workpeople are very radical in their views why asked her father i went into a cottage this afternoon and found a young workman there in his working clothes and instead of leaving the room he remained in it as if that was the most natural thing to do it struck me that he must belong to the class of people we read of i dont know much of the political state of affairs now said mr ffrench some of these fellows are always bad enough and this haworth rose from the ranks he was a foundry lad himself i met mr haworth too said miss ffrench he stopped in the street to stand looking after the carriage he is a very big person he is a very successful fellow with something like a sigh a man who has made of himself what he has through sheer power of will and business capacity is a genius what has he made of himself inquired miss ffrench well replied her father the man is actually a millionaire he is at the head of his branch of the trade he leads the other manufacturers he is a kind of king in the place people may ignore him if they choose he does not care and there is no reason why he should mr ffrench became rather excited he flushed and spoke uneasily there are plenty of gentlemen he said we have gentlemen enough and to spare but we have few men who can make a path through the world for themselves as he has done for my part i admire the man he has the kind of force which moves me to admiration i dare say said miss ffrench slowly that you would have admired the young workman i saw it struck me at the time that you would by the bye her father asked with a new interest what kind of a young fellow was he perhaps it was the young fellow who is half american and he did not look like an englishman she interrupted he was too dark and tall and unconscious of himself in spite of his awkwardness he did not know that he was out of place i have no doubt it was this murdoch he is a peculiar fellow and i am as much interested in him as in haworth his father was a lancashire mana halfcrazy inventor who died leaving an unfinished model which was to have made his fortune i have heard a great deal of the son i wish i had seen him rachel ffrench made no reply she had heard this kind of thing before there had been a young man from cumberland who had been on the point of inventing a new propelling power but had somehow or other not done it there had been a machinist from manchester who had created an entirely new order of loomwhich had not worked and there had been half a dozen smaller lights whose inventions though less involved would still have made fortunesif they had been quite practical but mr ffrench had mounted his hobby which always stood saddled and bridled he talked of haworth and haworths success the works and their machinery he calculated the expenses and the returns of the business he even took out his tablets to get at the profits more accurately and got down the possible cost of various improvements which had suggested themselves he has done so much he said that it would be easy for him to do more he could accomplish anything if he were a better educated manor had an educated man as partner they say he remarked afterward that this murdoch is not an ignoramus by any means i hear that he has a positive passion for books and that he has made several quite remarkable improvements and additions to the machinery at the works it would be an odd thing biting the end of his pencil with a thoughtful air it would be a dramatic sort of thing if he should make a success of the idea the poor fellow his father left incomplete indeed miss ffrench was quite prepared for his afterstatement that he intended to pay a visit to the works and their owner the next morning though she could not altogether account for the slight hint of secret embarrassment which she fancied displayed itself when he made the announcement its true the man is rough and highhanded enough he said he has not been too civil in his behavior to me in times gone by but i should like to know more of him in spite of it he is worth cultivating he appeared at the works the following morning awakening thereby some interest among the shrewder spirits who knew him of old whats he up to now they said to each other hes getten some crank i his yed or he would na be here not being at any time specially shrewd in the study of human nature it must be confessed that mr ffrench was not prepared for the reception he met with in the owners room in his previous rare interviews with jem haworth he had been accorded but slight respect his advances had been met in a manner savoring of rough contempt his ephemeral hobbies disposed of with the amiable candor of the practical and not too polished mind he knew he had been jeered at openly at times and now the man who had regarded him lightly and as if he felt that he held the upper hand received him almost with a confused selfconscious air he even flushed when he got up and awkwardly shook hands perhaps said his visitor to himself events have taught him to feel the lack in himself after all i looked forward before my return to calling upon you he said aloud and i am glad to have the opportunity at last haworth reseated himself after giving him a chair and answered with a nod and a somewhat incoherent welcome ffrench settled himself with an agreeable consciousness of being less at a loss before the man than he had ever been in his life what i have seen abroad he said has added to the interest i have always felt in our own manufactures you know that is a thing i have always cared for most people have called it my hobby though i dont think that is quite the right name for it you have done a great deal since i went away i shall do more yet said haworth with effort before ive done with the thing youve done a good deal for broxton the place has grown wonderfully those cottages of yours are good work haworth warmed up his hand fell upon the table before him heavily its not broxton im aimin at he said broxtons naught to me ill have good work or none its this place here im at work on ive said id set haworths above em all and ill do it youve done it already answered ffrench ay but i tell you ill set it higher yet ive got the money and ive got the will theres none on em can back down jem haworth no said ffrench suddenly and unaccountably conscious of a weakness in himself and his position he did not quite understand the man his heat was a little confusing this he decided mentally is his hobby he sat and listened with real excitement as haworth launched out more freely and with a stronger touch of braggadocio he had set out in his own line and he meant to follow it in spite of all the gentlemen manufacturers in england he had asked help from none of them and they had given him none hed brought up the trade and hed made money there wasnt a bigger place in the country than haworths nor a place that did the work it did hed have naught cheap and hed have no fancy prices the chaps that worked for him knew their business and knew theyd lose naught by sticking to it they knew too theyd got a master who looked sharp after em and stood no cheek nor no slack dodges ive got the best lot in the trade under me he said ive got a young chap in the engineroom as knows more about machinery than half the topsawyers in england by george i wish i knew as much hes a quiet chap and hes young but if he knew how to look a bit sharper after himself hed make his fortune the trouble is hes too quiet and a bit too much of a gentleman without knowing it by george he is a gentleman if he is naught but jem haworths engineer he is proud of the fellow thought ffrench proud of him because he is a gentleman he knows whats worth knowing haworth went on and he keeps it to himself till the time comes to use it hes a chap that keeps his mouth shut he comes up to my house and reads my books ive not been brought up to books myself but theres none of em he cant tackle hes welcome to use aught ive got im not such a fool as to grudge him what all my brass wont buy me i think ive heard of him said ffrench you mean murdoch ay haworth answered i mean murdoch and theres not many chaps like him hes the only one of the sort i ever run up against i should like to see him said ffrench my daughter saw him yesterday in one of the workmens cottages and with a faint smile he struck her as having rather the air of a radical it was one of her feminine fancies there was a moments halt and then haworth made his reply as forcibly as ever radical be hanged he said hes got work o his own to attend to hes one of the kind as leaves th radicals alone hes a straightforward chap that cares more for his books than aught else i wont say a trifle grudgingly that hes not a bit too straight in some things there was a halt again here which ffrench rather wondered at then haworth spoke again bluntly and yet lagging a little ii saw her miss ffrench myself yesterday i was walking down the street when her carriage passed ffrench looked at him with an inward start it was his turn to flush now i think he said that she mentioned it to me he appeared a trifle preoccupied for some minutes afterward and when he roused himself laughed and spoke nervously the color did not die out of his face during the remainder of his visit even after he had made the tour of the works and looked at the machinery and given a good deal of information concerning the manner in which things were done on the continent it was still there and perhaps it deepened slightly as he spoke his parting words then he said iwe shall have the pleasure of seeing you at dinner tomorrow evening yes haworth answered ill be there chapter xiv nearly an accident it was rachel ffrench who received her fathers guest the following evening mr ffrench had been delayed in his return from town and was still in his dressingroom accordingly when haworth was announced the doors of the drawingroom being flung open revealed to him the figure of his hosts daughter alone the room was long and stately and after she had risen from her seat it took miss ffrench some little time to make her way from one end to the other haworth had unconsciously halted after crossing the threshold and it was not until she was halfway down the room that he bestirred himself to advance to meet her he did not know why he had paused at first and his sudden knowledge that he had done so roused him to a momentary savage anger dang it he said to himself why did i stand there like a fool the reason could not be explained briefly his own house was a far more splendid affair than ffrenchs and among his visitors from london and manchester there were costumes far more gorgeous than that of miss ffrench he was used to the flash of jewels and the gloss of brilliant colors miss ffrench wore no ornaments at all and her dark purple dress was simple and closeclinging a couple of paces from him she stopped and held out her hand my father will be glad to see you she said he was unfortunately detained this evening by business he will be down stairs in a few moments his sense of being at a disadvantage when after she had led him back to the fire they were seated was overwhelming a great heat rushed over him the hush of the room broken only by the light ticking of the clock was misery his eye traveled stealthily from the hem of her dark purple gown to the crowning waves of her fair hair but he had not a word to utter it made him feel almost brutal but the dayll come yet he protested inwardly feeling his weakness as he thought it when ill hold my own ive done it before and ill do it again miss ffrench regarded him with a clear and direct gaze she did not look away from him at all she was not in the least embarrassed and though she did not smile the calmness of her face was quite as perfect in expression my father told me of his visit to your place she said he interested me very much i should like to see the works if you admit visitors i know nothing of such things any time you choose to come he answered ill show you roundand be glad to do it its a pretty big place of the kind he was glad she had chosen this subject if she would only go on it would not be so bad he would be in his own groove and she did go on ive seen very little of broxton she proceeded i spent a few weeks here before going abroad again with my father and i cannot say i have been very fond of it i do not like england and on the continent one hears unpleasant things of english manufacturing towns i think smiling a little for the first time that one always associates them with strikes and squalid people there is not much danger of strikes here he replied i give my chaps fair play and let em know whos master but they have radical clubs she said and talk politics and get angry when they are not sober ive heard that much already they dont talk em in my place he answered dogmatically he was not quite sure whether it relieved him or not when ffrench entered at this moment and interrupted them he was more at his ease with ffrench and yet he felt himself at a disadvantage still he scarcely knew how the night passed a feverish unrest was upon him sometimes he hardly heard what his entertainer said and mr ffrench was in one of his most voluble and diffuse moods he displayed his knowledge of trade and mechanics with gentlemanly ostentation he talked of trades unions and the masters difficulties he introduced manufacturers politics and expatiated on continental weaknesses he weighed the question of demand and supply and touched on protective tariff blast him said haworth growing bitter mentally he thinks im up to naught else and hes right as her father talked miss ffrench joined in but seldom she listened and looked on in a manner of which haworth was conscious from first to last the thought made its way into his mind finally that she looked on as if these matters did not touch her at all and she was only faintly curious about them her eyes rested on him with a secret air of watchful interest he met them more than once as he looked up and she did not turn them away he sat through it all full of vengeful resentment and was at once wretched and happy in spite of it and himself when at her fathers request she played and sang he sat apart moody and yet full of clumsy rapture he knew nothing of the music but his passion found a tongue in it nevertheless if she had played badly he would have taken the lack of harmony for granted but as she played well he experienced a pleasure while he did not comprehend when it was all over and he found himself out alone in the road in the dark he was feverish still i dont seem to have made naught at th first sight he said then he added with dogged exultation but i dont look for smooth sailing i know enough for that ive seen her and been nigh her and thats worth setting downwith a chap like me at the end of the week a carriage drove up to the gateway of the works and mr ffrench and his daughter descended from it mr ffrench was in the best of humors he was in his element as he expatiated upon the size and appointments of the place he had been expatiating upon them during the whole of the drive on their being joined by haworth himself miss ffrench decided inwardly that here upon his own domain he was not so wholly objectionable as she had fancied at firsteven that he was deserving of a certain degree of approval despite the signs of elated excitement her quick eye detected at once that he was more at his ease his big frame did not look out of place he moved as if he was at home and upon the whole his rough air of authority and the promptness with which his commands were obeyed did not displease her he is master she said to herself she was fond of power and liked the evidence of it in others she did not object to the looks the men who were at work cast upon her as she went from one department to another her beauty had never yet failed to command masculine homage from all ranks the great black fellows at the furnaces exchanged comments as she passed they would have paused in their work to look at her if they had dared the object of their admiration bore it calmly it neither confounded nor touched her it did not move her at all mr ffrench commented examined and explained with delightful eloquence we are fortunate in timing our visit so well he said to his daughter they are filling an immense order for the most important railroad in the country on my honor i would rather be at the head of such a gigantic establishment than sit on the throne of england but where is this protege of yours he said to haworth at last i should like above all things to see him murdoch answered haworth oh were coming to him after a bit hes in among the engines when they reached the enginerooms haworth presented him with little ceremony and explained the purpose of their visit they wanted to see the engines and he was the man to make the most of them mr ffrenchs interest was awakened readily the mechanic from cumberland had been a pretentious ignoramus the young man from manchester had dropped his aspirates and worn loud plaids and flaming neckties but this was a less objectionable form of genius mr ffrench began to ask questions and make himself agreeable and in a short time was very well entertained indeed miss ffrench listened with but slight demonstrations of interest she did not understand the conversation which was being carried on between her father and murdoch and she made no pretense of doing so it is all very clear to them she said to haworth as they stood near each other its all clear enough to him said haworth signifying murdoch with a gesture upon which miss ffrench smiled a little she was not sensitive upon the subject of her fathers hobbies and the coarse frankness of the remark amused her but notwithstanding her lack of interest she drew nearer to the engine finally and stood looking at it feeling at once fascinated and unpleasantly overpowered by its heavy invariable motion it was as she stood in this way a little later that murdochs glance fell upon her the next instant with the simultaneous cry of terror which broke from the others he had thrown himself forward and dragged her back by main force and among the thunderous wheels and rods and shafts there was slowly twisted and torn and ground into shreds a fragment of the delicate fabric of her dress it was scarcely the work of a second her father staggered toward them white and trembling good god he cried good god what the words died upon his bloodless lips she freed herself from murdochs grasp and stood upright she did not look at him at all she looked at her father and lightly brushed with her hand her sleeve at the wrist despite her pallor it was difficult to realize that she only held herself erect by a terrible effort of selfcontrol whyshe saidwhy did he touch mein that manner haworth uttered a smothered oath murdoch turned about and strode out of the room he did not care to remain to hear the explanation as he went out into the open air a fellowworkman passing by stopped to stare at him whats up wi thee he asked has tha been punsin haworth oer again the incident referred to being always remembered as a savory and delectable piece of humor murdoch turned to him with a dazed look i he stammered wehave very nearly had an accident and went on his way without further explanation chapter xv it would be a good thing exciting events were not so common in broxton and its vicinity that this one could remain in the background it furnished a topic of conversation for the dinner and teatables of every family within ten miles of the place on murdochs next visit to the briarleys granny dixon insisted on having the matter explained for the fortieth time and was manifestly disgusted by the lack of dramatic incident connected with it tha seed her dress catch i th wheel an dragged her back she shouted was na theer nowt else did na she swound away nor nothin no he answered she did not know what had happened at first granny dixon gave him a shrewd glance of examination and then favored him with a confidential remark presented at the top of her voice i conna bide her she said what did mr ffrench say to thee asked janey does tha think hell gie thee owt fur it no answered murdoch he wont do that he owt to said janey fretfully an tha owt to tak it if he does tha does na think enow o money an th loike yoll nivver get on i th world if yo mak light o money an let it slip by yo floxham had told the story somewhat surlily to his friends and his friends had retailed it over their beer and the particulars had thus become common property what did she say floxham had remarked at the first relation she said nowt thats what she said she did na quoite mak th thing out at first an she stood theer brushin th black off her sleeve happen sardonically she did na loike th notion o a working chap catchin howd on her wiout apologizin haworth asked murdoch to spend an evening with him and sat moody and silent through the greater part of it at last he said you think youve been devilish badly treated he said but by the lord i wish i was in your place you wish repeated murdoch that you were in my place i dont know that its a particularly pleasant place to be in haworth leaned forward upon the table and stared across at him gloomily look here he said you know naught about her shes hard to get at but shell remember whats happened cool as she took it shell remember it i dont want her to remember it returned murdoch why should it matter its a thing of yesterday it was nothing but chance let it go confound it said haworth with a restive moroseness i tell you i wish id been in your placeat twice the risk the same day mr ffrench had made a visit to the works for the purpose of setting his mind at rest and expressing his gratitude in a graceful manner in fact he was rather glad of the opportunity to present himself upon the ground so soon again but on confronting the hero of the hour he found that somehow the affair dwindled and assumed an altogether incidental and unheroic aspect his rather highflown phrases modified themselves and took a different tone he is either very reserved or very shy he said afterward to his daughter it is not easy to reach him at the outset there seems a lack of enthusiasm about him so to speak will he come to the house asked miss ffrench oh yes i suppose he will come but it was very plain that he would rather have stayed away he had too much good taste to refuse pointblank to let you speak to him good taste repeated miss ffrench her father turned upon her with manifest irritation good taste he repeated petulantly cannot you see that the poor fellow is a gentleman i wish you would show less of this nonsensical caste prejudice rachel i suppose one necessarily dispenses with a good deal of it in a place like this she answered in making friends with mr haworth for instance mr ffrench drew nearer to her and rested his elbow upon the mantel with rather an embarrassed expression i wish you toto behave well to haworth he said faltering ia great deal maymay depend upon it she looked up at him at once lifting her eyes in a serene glance do you want to go into the iron trade she asked relentlessly he blushed scarlet but she did not move her eyes from his face on that account whatwhat haworth needs he stammered is aa man of education toto assist him a man who had studied the scientific features ofof things might suggest valuable ideas to him there is anan immense field open to a rich enterprising fellow such as he isa man who is fearless andand who has the means to carry out his ventures you mean a man who will try to do new things she remarked do you think he would the trouble has been floundering more hopelessly than ever that his lack of cultivation haswell has forced him to act in a single groove ifif he had aa partner whoknew the ropes so to speakhis business would be doubledtrebled she repeated aloud one of his words a partner she said he ran his hand through his hair and stared at her wishing that he could think of something decided to say does he know you would like to be his partner she asked next nno he faltered not exactly she sat a moment looking at the fire i do not believe he would do it she said at last he is too proud of having done everything singlehanded then she looked at her father again if he would she said and there were no rash ventures made it would be a good thing chapter xvi a poor chap as is allus i trouble it was nothing but a chance after all murdoch said to miss ffrench just as he had said to haworth it happened that i was the first to see the danger she stood opposite to him upon the hearth in her fathers house neither of them had sat down she rested her arm upon the low mantel and played with a flower she held in her hand she looked at the flower as she made the reply you think of it very lightly she said with rather cold deliberateness he did not regard her furtively as haworth had done raising her eyes suddenly after she had said this she met his which were fixed upon her no he answered not lightly at all it was a horrible thing i shall never forget it she shuddered nor i she said then she added rather in the tone of one reluctantly making a confession i have not slept easily through one night since that is very natural he returned but the feeling will wear away he would have left her then but she stopped him with a gesture wait a moment she said there is something else he paused as she bade him a slight color rose to her cheek when i spoke she said i did not understand at all what had happenednot at all i was stunned and angry i thought that if i was too near you you might have spoken instead of doing as you did then with studied coldness and meeting his gaze fully it would have been a vile thing to have saidif i had understood yes he answered it would have been a vile thing if you had understood but you did not and i realized that when i had time to think over it coolly then at first she put it to him it made you angry yes i had run some risk you know and had had the luck to save your life the interview ended here and it was some time before they met again but murdoch heard of her often so often indeed that she was kept pretty constantly before him he heard of her from haworth from the briarleys from numberless sources indeed it became her caprice to make a kind of study of the people around her and to find entertainment in it when she drove through the streets of the little town past the workmens cottages and the works themselves she was stared at and commented upon her beauty her dress her manners roused the beholders either to lavish or grudging acknowledgment dirty children sometimes followed her carriage and on its stopping at any point a small crowd gathered about it shes been here again shouted granny dixon one evening as murdoch took a seat near her chair who he asked her that lass o ffrenchsth one i conna bide she maks out shes taen a fancy to our janey i dunnot believe her at a louder pitch and with vigorous nods tha nasty tempert owd body cried mrs briarley sotto voce get out wi thee what art tha sayin demanded her guest dunnot tell me tha wur sayin nowt i saw thee ii wur sayin it wur a bad day fur th wash faltered the criminal an fur them as had rheumatiz howshows thine misses thart tellin a lee was the rejoinder tha wert sayin summat ill o me i caught thee at it then going back to the subject and turning to

an she wants to pass th toimeif theers nowt else at th back on it shes will ffrench ower again she conna mak a foo o me he made foo enow o thee i his day commented mrs briarley cautiously granny dixon favored her with a sharper glance than before thart sayin summat ill again she cried howd thy tongue eh whimpered the poor woman a body dare na say theer souls theer own when hoos abouthoos that sharp an illfarrant a few minutes after briarley came in janey piloted him and he entered with a smile at once apologetic and encouraging he wur theer said janey but he had na had nowt briarley sidled forward and seated himself upon the edge of a chair his smile broadened steadily but he was in a tremendous minority granny dixon transfixed him with her baleful eye and under its influence the smile was graduated from exhilarated friendliness to gravity from gravity to gentle melancholy from melancholy to deepest gloom but at this stage a happy thought struck him and he beamed again howhow art tha doin misses he quavered i hope thart makin thysen comfortable the reception this polite anxiety met with was not encouraging granny dixons eye assumed an expression still more baleful thast been at it again she shouted thast been at it again thall neer git none o my brass to spend at th alehouse mak sure o that mr briarley turned his attention to the fire again melancholy was upon the point of marking him for her own when the most delicate of tact came to his rescue it is na thy brass we want misses he proclaimed itsits thy compny and then clenched the matter by adding still more feebly ay to be sure its thy compny is na it sararann ay faltered mrs briarley to be sure its nowt o th soart answered granny dixon in the tone of the last trump an dunnot yo threep me down as it is mr briarleys countenance fell mrs briarley shed a few natural tears under cover of the baby discretion and delicacy forbade either to retort their venerable guest having badgered them into submission glared at the fire with the air of one who detected its feeble cunning and defied it it was mr briarley who first attempted to recover cheerfulness thast had quality to see thee sararann he ventured our jane towd me ay answered mrs briarley tearfully mr briarley fell into indiscreet reverie the chap as gets her he said ll get a hansome lass i would na moind modestly i would na moind bein i his shoes mysen mrs briarleys smothered wrongs broke forth thee she cried out tha brazant nowt i wonder thart na shamt o thy facetalkin i that rood about a lady an afore thy own wife i wonder tha art na shamt mr briarleys courage forsook him he sought refuge in submissive penitence almost lachrymose i did na mean nowt sararann he protested meekly it wur a slip o th tongue lass imim not th build as a young woman o that soart ud be loike to tak up wi yo wur good enow fur me onct replied mrs briarley sharply a noice un yo are settin yore wedded wife below other peopleas if she wur dirt ay sararann the criminal faltered i wur good enow fur yo butbutyo but at this point he dropped his head upon his hand shaking it in mournful contrition im a poor chap he said im nowt but a poor chap as is allus i trouble im not th man yo ought to ha had sararann nay retorted mrs briarley that thart not an its a pity tha did na foind that theer out thirteen year ago mr briarley shook his head with a still deeper depression ay sararann he answered seems loike it is he did not recover himself until murdoch took his departure and then he followed him deprecatingly to the door does tha think he asked as that theers true that what is true that theer th chaps has been talkin ower i dont know answered murdoch what they have been talking over theyre gettin it goin among em as haworths goin to tak ffrench in partner murdoch looked up the road for a few seconds before he replied he was thinking over the events of the past week i do not think it is true he said after this pause i dont think it can be haworth is not the man to do it but the idea was such a startling one presented in this form that it gave him a kind of shock and as he went on his way naturally thinking over the matter he derived some consolation from repeating aloud his last words no it is not likely haworth is not the man to do it chapter xvii a flower but at last it was evident that the acquaintance between haworth and ffrench had advanced with great rapidity ffrench appeared at the works on an average three or four times a week and it had become a common affair for haworth to spend an evening with him and his daughter he was more comfortable in his position of guest in these days custom had given him greater ease and selfpossession after two visits he had begun to give himself up to the feverish enjoyment of the hour his glances were no longer furtive and embarrassed at times he reached a desperate boldness theres something about her he said to murdoch that draws a fellow on and holds him off both at the same time sometimes i nigh lose my head when im with her he was moody and resentful at times but he went again and again and held his own after a manner on the occasion of the first dinner mr ffrench gave to his old friends no small excitement was created by haworths presence among the guests the first man who entering the room with his wife and daughters caught sight of his brawny frame and rather dogged face faltered and grew nervous and would have turned back if he had possessed the courage to be the first to protest everybody else lacked the same courage it appeared for nobody did protest openly though there were comments enough made in private and as much coldness of manner as good breeding would allow miss ffrench herself was neither depressed nor ill at ease it was reluctantly admitted that she had never appeared to a greater advantage nor in better spirits before the evening was half over it was evident to all that she was not resenting the presence of her fathers new found friend she listened to his attempts at conversation with an attentive and suave little smile if she was amusing herself at his expense she was at the same time amusing herself at the expense of those who looked on and was delicately defying their opinion jem haworth went home that night excited and exultant he lay awake through the night and went down to the works early i didnt get the worst of it after all he said to murdoch let em grin and sert if they willthem laughs that wins sheshe never was as handsome in her life as she was last night and she never treated me as well she never says much she only lets a fellow come nigh and talk but she treated me wellin her way im going to send for my mother he said afterward somewhat shamefacedly im goin to begin a straight life i want naught to stand agin me and if shes here theyll come to see her i want all the chances i can get he wrote the letter to his mother the same day the old lady will be glad enough to come he said when he had finished it the finery about her will trouble her a bit at first but shell get over it his days work over murdoch did not return home at once his restless habit of taking long rambles across the country had asserted itself with unusual strength of late he spent little time in the house tonight he was later than usual he came in fagged and mudsplashed christian was leaving the room as he entered it but she stopped with her hand upon the door we have had visitors she said who he asked mr ffrench and his daughter mr ffrench wanted to see you she did not come in but sat in the carriage outside she shut the door and came back to the hearth she despises us all she said she despises us all he had flung himself into a chair and lay back clasping his hands behind his head and looking gloomily before him sometimes i think she does he said but what of that she answered without looking at him to be sure she said what of that after a little she spoke again there is something i have thought of saying to you she said it is this i am happier here than i ever was before i am very glad he answered i never thought of being happy she went on or like other women in anything ii was different she said the words with perfect coldness i was different different he echoed absently and then checked himself dont say that he said dont think it it wont do why shouldnt you be as good and happy as any woman who ever lived she remained silent but her silence only stirred him afresh it is a bad beginning he said i know it is because i have tried it i have said to myself that i was different from other men too he ended with an impatient movement and a sound half like a groan here i am he cried telling myself it is better to battle against the strongest feeling of my life because i am differentbecause there is a kind of taint in my blood i dont begin as other men do by hoping i begin by despairing and yet i cant give up how it will end god knows i understand you better than you think she said something in her voice startled him what he exclaimed has my mother he stopped and gazed at her wondering some powerful emotion he could not comprehend expressed itself in her face she does not speak of it often she said she thinks of it always yes he answered i know that she is afraid she is haunted by her dread of itand his voice dropping so am i he felt it almost unnatural that he should speak so freely he had found it rather difficult to accustom himself to her presence in the house sometimes he had even been repelled by it and yet just at this moment he felt somehow as if they stood upon the same platform and were near each other it will break loose some day he cried and the day is not far off i shall run the risk and either win or lose i fight hard for every day of dull quiet i gain when i look back over the past i feel that perhaps i am holding a chained devil but when i look forward i forget and doubt seems folly in your place she said i would risk my life upon it the passion in her voice amazed him he comprehended even less clearly than before i know what it has cost she said no one better i am afraid to pass the door of the room where it lies in the dark it is like a dead thing always there sometimes i fancy it is not alone and that the door might open and show me some one with it what do you mean he said you speak as if you would not understand if i should tell you she answered a little bitterly we are not very good friendsperhaps we never shall bebut i will tell you this again that in your place i would never give it upnever i would be true to him if all the world were against me she went away and shortly afterward he left the room himself intending to go upstairs as he reached the bottom of the staircase a light from above fell upon his face and caused him to raise it the narrow passage itself was dark but on the topmost stair his mother stood holding a lamp whose light struck upon him she did not advance but waited as he came upward looking down at him not speaking then they passed each other going their separate ways the next day ffrench appeared in the engineroom itself he had come to see murdoch and having seen him went away in most excellent humor whats he after inquired floxham when he was gone he wants me at his house said murdoch he says he needs my opinion in some matter he went to the house the same evening and gave his opinion upon the matter in question and upon several others also in fact mr ffrench took possession of him as he had taken possession of the young man from manchester and the cumberland mechanic though in this case he had different metal to work upon he was amiable generous and talkative he exhibited his minerals his plans for improved factories and workmens dwellinghouses his little collection of models which had proved impracticable and his books on mechanics and manufactures he was as generous as haworth himself in the matter of his library it was at his visitors service whenever he chose as they talked rachel ffrench remained in the room during the evening she went to the piano and sitting down played and sung softly as if for no other ears than her own once on her fathers leaving the room she turned and spoke to murdoch you were right in saying i should outlive my terror of what happened to me she said it has almost entirely worn away i am glad he answered she held in her belt a flower like the one which had attracted granny dixons attention as she crossed the room shortly afterward it fell upon the floor she picked it up but instead of replacing it laid it carelessly upon the table at murdochs side after he had risen from his chair when on the point of leaving he stood near this table and almost unconsciously took the flower up and when he went out of the house he held it in his fingers the night was dark and his mood was preoccupied he scarcely thought of the path before him at all and on passing through the gate he came without any warning upon a figure standing before it he drew back and would have spoken had he been given the time hush said haworths voice its me lad what are you doing here asked murdoch are you going in no surlily im not murdoch said no more haworth turned with him and strode along by his side but he got over his illtemper sufficiently to speak after a few minutes its the old tale he said im making a fool of myself i cant keep away i was there last night and tonight the fit came upon me so strong that i was bound to go but when i got there id had time to think it over and i couldnt make up my mind to go in i knew id better give her a rest what did ffrench want of you murdoch explained did you seeher yes well restlessly have you naught to say about her no coldly what should i have to say of her its no business of mine to talk her over youd talk her over if you were in my place said haworth youd be glad enow to do it youd think of her night and day and grow hot and cold at the thought of her youyou dont know her as i doif you did they had reached the turn of the lane and the light of the lamp which stood there fell upon them haworth broke off his words and stopped under the blaze murdoch saw his face darken with bitter passion curse you he said where did you get it without comprehending him murdoch looked down at his own hand at which the man was pointing and saw in it the flower he had forgotten he held this he said and though he did not know why the blood leaped to his face ay said haworth you know well enow what i mean where did you get it do you think i dont know the look on it you may or you may not answered murdoch that is nothing to me i took it up without thinking of it if i had thought of it i should have left it where it was i have no right to itnor you either haworth drew near to him give it here he demanded hoarsely they stood and looked each other in the eye externally murdoch was the calmer of the two but he held in check a fiercer heat than he had felt for many a day no he answered not i think over what you are doing you will not like to remember it tomorrow it is not mine to give nor yours to take i have done with my share of itthere it is and he crushed it in his hand and flung it exhaling its fragrance upon the ground then turned and went his way he had not intended to glance backward but he was not as strong as he thought he did look backward before he had gone ten yards and doing so saw haworth bending down and gathering the bruised petals from the earth chapter xviii haworth co the next day when he descended from his gig at the gates instead of going to his office haworth went to the engineroom leave your work a bit and come into my place he said to murdoch i want you his tone was offhand but not illhumored there was a hint of embarrassment in it murdoch followed him without any words having led the way into his office haworth shut the door and faced him can tha guess what i want he demanded no murdoch answered well its easy told you said id be cooler today and i am a night gives a man time to face a thing straight id been making a fool of myself before you came up but i made a bigger fool of myself afterward theres the end on it i suppose said murdoch that it was natural enough you should look at the thing differently just then perhaps i made a fool of myself too you said haworth roughly you were cool enow later ffrench came in and spent an hour with him and after his departure haworth made the rounds of the place in one of the worst of his moods aye said floxham to his companion thats allus th road when he shows hissen the same day janey briarley presented herself to mr ffrenchs housekeeper with a message from her mother having delivered the message she was on her way from the housekeepers room when miss ffrench who sat in the drawingroom spoke through the open door to the servant if that is the child she said bring her here to me janey entered the great room awestricken and overpowered by its grandeur miss ffrench who sat near the fire addressed her turning her head over her shoulder come here she commanded janey advanced with something approaching tremor miss ffrench was aweinspiring anywhere but miss ffrench amid the marvels of her own drawingroom leaning back in her chair and regarding her confusion with a suggestion of friendly notice was terrible sit down she said and talk to me illustration sit down she said and talk to me but here the practical mind rebelled and asserted itself in spite of abasement of spirit i havent getten nowt to talk about said janey stoutly what mun i say anything you like responded miss ffrench i am not particular theres a chair janey seated herself in it it was a large one in which her small form was lost her parcel was a big one but miss ffrench did not tell her to put it down so she held it on her knee and was almost hidden behind it presenting somewhat the appearance of a huge newspaper package clasped by arms and surmounted by a small sharp face and an immense bonnet with a curious appendage of short legs and big shoes i dunnot see the girl was saying mentally and with some distaste for her position what she wants wi me but as she stared over the top of her parcel she gradually softened the child found miss ffrench well worth looking at eh she announced with admiring candor eh but tha art hansome am i said rachel ffrench thank you aye answered janey tha art i nivver seed no lady loike thee afore let alone a young woman ive said so mony a toime to mester murdoch have you aye im allus talkin to him about thee thats kind said rachel ffrench i dare say he enjoys it who is he him exclaimed janey dost na tha know him him as was at our house th day yo coom th first toime him as dragged thee out o th engine oh said miss ffrench the engineer aye in a tone of some discomfiture hes a engineer but he is na th common workin soart granny dixon says hes getten gentlefolks ways i should think remarked miss ffrench that mrs dixon knew aye shes used to gentlefolk theyve takken notice on her i her young days she knowed thy grandfeyther she gave me to understand as much responded miss ffrench smiling at the recollection this brought to her mind yo see mother an me thinks a deal o mester murdoch because he is na one o th drinkin soart proceeded janey hes th steady koind as is fond o books an th loike he does na mak much at his trade but he knows more than yod think for to look at him that is good news said miss ffrench cheerfully janey rested her chin upon her parcel warming to the subject i should na wonder if he getten to be a rich mon some o these days she went on hes getten th makins on it in him if he has th luck an looks sharp about him i often tell him he mun look sharp she became so communicative indeed that miss ffrench found herself well entertained she heard the details of haworths history the reports of his prosperity and growing wealth the comments his hands had made upon herself and much interesting news concerning the religious condition of broxton and th chapel it was growing dusk when the interview ended and when she went away janey carried an additional bundle does tha allus dress i this road she had asked her hostess and the question suggested to miss ffrench a whimsical idea she took the child upstairs and gave her maid orders to produce all the castoff finery she could find and then stood by and looked on as janey made her choice she stood theer laughin while i picked th things out said janey afterward i dunnot know what she wur laughin at yo nivver know whether shes makin game on you or not i dunnot see as theer wur owt to laugh at said mrs briarley indignantly nay said janey nor me neyther but she does na laugh when theers owt to laugh atthats th queer part o it she said as i could ha more things when i coom again i would na go if it wur na fur that even his hands found out at this time that haworth was ill at ease his worst side showed itself in his intercourse with them he was overbearing and difficult to please he found fault and lost his temper over trifles and showed a restless angry desire to assert himself ill show you whos master here my lads he would say ill ha no dodges its haworth thats th head o this concern whoever comes in or out this heres haworths clap that i your pipes and smoke it summats up said floxham summats up mark yo that murdoch looked on with no inconsiderable anxiety the intercourse between himself and haworth had been broken in upon it had received its first check months before and in these days neither was in the exact mood for a renewal of it haworth wore a forbidding air his rough goodfellowship was a thing of the past he made no more boisterous jokes no more loud boasts at times his silence was almost morose he was not over civil even to ffrench who came oftener than ever and whose manner was cheerful to buoyancy matters had remained in this condition for a couple of months when on his way home late one night murdochs attention was arrested by a light burning in the room used by the master of the works as his office he stopped in the road to look up at it he could scarcely at first believe the evidence of his senses the place had been closed and locked hours before when haworth had left it with ffrench with whom he was to dine it was nearly midnight and certainly an unlawful hour for such a light to show itself but there it burned steadily amid the darkness of the night it doesnt seem likely that those who had reason to conceal themselves would set a light blazing murdoch thought but if theres mischief at work theres no time to waste there was only one thing to do and he did it making the best of his way to the spot the gate was thrown open and the door of entrance yielded to his hand inside the darkness was profound but when he found the passage leading to haworths room he saw that the door was ajar and that the light still burned on reaching this door he stopped short there was no need to go in it was haworth himself who was in the roomhaworth who lay with arms folded on the table and his head resting upon them murdoch turned away and as he did so the man heard him for the first time he lifted his head and looked round whos there he demanded there was no help for it murdoch pushed the door open and stood before him murdoch he said i saw the light and it brought me up haworth gave him a grudging look come in he said do you want me murdoch asked aye he answered dully i think i do murdoch stood and looked at him he did not sit down a mysterious sense of embarrassment held him in check what is wrong he asked in a lowered voice he hardly knew it for his own wrong echoed haworth naught ivebeen taking leave of the place thats all you have been doing what said murdoch taking leave of the place ive given it up his visitor uttered a passionate ejaculation you are mad he said aye bitterly mad enow the next instant a strange sound burst from hima terrible sound forced back at its birth his struggle to suppress it shook him from head to foot his hands clinched themselves as if each were a vise murdoch turned aside when it was over and the man raised his face he was trembling still and white with a kind of raging shame blast you he cried if theres ever aught in your face that minds me o this illill kill you this murdoch did not answer at all there was enough to say you are going to share it with ffrench he said aye with that fool hes been at me from the start naught would do him but he must have his try at it let him he shall play second fiddle by the lord harry he began plucking at some torn scraps of paper and did not let them rest while he spoke ive been over th place from top to bottom he said i held out until tonight tonight i give in and as soon as i left em i came here ten minutes after it was done id have undone it if i couldid have undone it but its done and theres an end on it he threw the scraps of paper aside and clenched his hand speaking through his teeth shes never given me a word to hang on he said and ive done it for her ive give up what i worked for and boasted on just to be brought nigher to her she knows ive done itshe knows it though shes never owned it by a lookand ill make that enough if you make your way with her said murdoch you have earned all you won aye was the grim answer ive earned it and soon after the light in the window went out and they parted outside and went their separate ways in the dark chapter xix an unexpected guest before the weeks end all broxton had heard the news in the works before and after working hours groups gathered together to talk it over haworth was going to tak ffrench in partner it was hard to believe it and the general opinion expressed was neither favorable nor complimentary haworth and ffrench said floxham in sarcastic mood haworth and coan a noice chap co is to ha i a place wen ha patent silvermounted backaction puddlinrakes afore long lads if co gets his way upon the occasion of the installation of the new partner however there was a natural tendency to conviviality not that the ceremony in question was attended with any special manifestation on the part of the individuals most concerned ffrenchs appearance at the works was its chief feature but the days labor being at an end several gentlemen engaged in the various departments scorning to neglect an opportunity retired to the whod a thowt it and promptly rendered themselves insensible through the medium of beer assisted by patriotic and somewhat involved speeches mr briarley returning to the bosom of his family at a late hour sat down by his fireside and wept copiously im a poor chap sararann he remarked i shall neer get took in partner by nobody im not i luck loike somean i nivver wur ceptin when i getten thee if thad keep thy nose out o th beermug thad do well enow said mrs briarley but this did not dispel mr briarleys despondency he only wept afresh nay sararann he said it is

an a good deal o beer an a man as has been misforchnit is loike to be slow after which he fell into a deep and untroubled slumber and it being found impossible to rouse him he spent the remainder of the night in granny dixons chair by the fire occasionally startling the echoes of the silent room by a loud and encouraging eereer during the following two weeks haworth did not go to the ffrenchs he spent his nights at his own house in dull and sullen mood at the works he kept his word as regarded ffrench that gentlemans lines had scarcely fallen in pleasant places his partner was gruff and authoritative and not given to enthusiasm there were times when only his goodbreeding preserved the outward smoothness of affairs but he said to his daughter one does not expect good manners of a man like that they are not his forte at the end of the two weeks there came one afternoon a message to haworth in his room murdoch was with him when it arrived he read it and crushing it in his hand threw it into the fire theyre a nice lot he said with a short laugh coming down on a fellow like that and then an oath broke from him ive give up two or three things he said and theyre among em its th last time and he took down his overcoat and began to put it on tell em he said to murdoch as he went outtell em im gone home and shant be back till morning keep the rest to yourself he went out shutting the door with a bang murdoch stood at the window and watched him drive away in his gig he was scarcely out of sight before a carriage appeared moving at a very moderate pace it was a bright though cold day and the top of the carriage was thrown back giving the occupant the benefit of the sunshine the occupant in question was rachel ffrench who looked up and bestowed upon the figure at the window a slight gesture of recognition murdoch turned away with an impatient movement after she had passed pooh he said angrily hes a fool by midnight of the same day haworth had had time to half forget his scruples he had said to his visitors what he had said to murdoch with his usual frankness its the last time weve done with each other after this you know its the last time make the most on it there was a kind of desperate exultation in his humor if he had dared he would have liked to fling aside every barrier of restraint and show himself at his worst defying the world but fear held him in check as nothing else would have donean abject fear of consequences by midnight the festivities were at their height he himself was boisterous with wine and excitement he had stood up at the head of his table and made a blatant speech and roared a loud song and had been laughed at and applauded make the most on it he kept saying itll be over by cockcrow its a bit like a chaps funeral he had just seated himself after this and was pouring out a great glass of wine when a servant entered the room and spoke to him in a low tone a lady sir as come in a cab and and then the door opened again and every one turned to look at the woman who stood upon the threshold she was a small woman dressed in plain country fashion she had white hair and a fresh bloom on her cheeks and her eyes were bright with timorous excitement and joy jem she faltered its me my dear haworth stared at her as if stunned at first his brain was not clear enough to take in the meaning of her presence but as she approached him and laid her basket down and took his hand the truth revealed itself to him its me my dear she repeated accordin to promise i didnt know you had compny she turned to those who sat about the table and made a little rustic courtesy a dead calm seemed to take possession of one and all they did not glance at each other but looked at her as she stood by haworth holding his hand waiting for him to kiss her hes so took by surprise she said he doesnt know what to say he wasnt expecting me so soon laughing proudly thats it im his mother ladies and gentlemen haworth made a sign to the servant who waited bring a plate here he said shell sit down with us the order was obeyed and she sat down at his right hand fluttered and beaming youre very good not to mind me she said i didnt think of there bein compnyand gentry too she turned to a brightly dressed girl at her side and spoke to her hes my only son miss and me a widder an hes allers been just what you see him now he was good from the time he was a infant hes been a pride an a comfort to me since the day he were born the girl stared at her with a look which was almost a look of fear she answered her in a hushed voice yes maam she said yes miss happily theres not many mothers as can say what i can hes never been ashamed of me hasnt jem if id been a lady born he couldnt have showed me more respect than he has nor been more kinder the girl did not answer this time she looked down at her plate and her hand trembled as she pretended to occupy herself with the fruit upon it then she stole a glance at the resta glance at once guilty and defiant of the smile she expected to see but the smile was not there the only smile to be seen was upon the face of the little country woman who regarded them all with innocent reverence and was in such bright good spirits that she did not even notice their silence ive had a long journey she said an ive been pretty flustered through not bein used to travel i dont know how id have bore up at firstbein flustered soif it hadnt have been for everybody bein so good to me id mention my son when i had to ask anything an theyd smile as goodnatured as could be an tell me in a minute the multiplicity of new dishes and rare wine bewildered her but she sat through the repast simple and unabashed theres some as wouldnt like me bein so ignorant she said but jem doesnt mind the subject of her sons virtues was an inexhaustible one the silence about her only gave her courage and eloquence his childish strength and precocity his bravery his good temper his generous ways were her themes he come to me in time of trouble she said an he made it lighteran hes been makin it lighter ever since whod have thought that a simple body like me would ever have a grand home like thisand it earned and bought by my own son i beg your pardon ladies and gentlemen looking round with happy tears i didnt go to do it an theres no reason for it except me bein took a little by surprise through not bein exactly prepared for such a grand place an gentlefolks compny as is so good an understands a mothers feelins when the repast was at an end she got up and made her little courtesy to them all again if the gentlefolk would excuse her she would bid them goodnight she was tired and not used to late hours to the girl who had sat at her side she gave an admiring smile of farewell youre very pretty my dear she said if i may take the liberty bein a old woman goodnight god bless you when she was gone the girl lay forward her face hidden upon her arms on the table for a few seconds no one spoke then haworth looked up from his plate on which he had kept his eyes fixed and broke the stillness if thered been a fellow among you that had dared to show his teeth he said id have wrung his cursed neck chapter xx miss ffrench makes a call the following sunday morning the congregation of broxton chapel was thrown into a state of repressed excitement haworths carriage with a couple of servants brought his mother to enjoy brother hixons eloquence to the presence of the carriage and servants haworth had held firm upon the whole he would have preferred that she should have presented herself at the door of broxton old church which was under the patronage of the county families and honored by their presence but the little woman had exhibited such uneasiness at the unfolding of his plan of securing the largest and handsomest pew for her that he had yielded the point ive always been a chapelgoin woman jem she had said an i wouldnt like to change an i should feel freer where theres not so many gentlefolk the carriage and the attending servants she had submitted to with simple obedience there were no rented pews in broxton chapel and she took her seat among the rest innocently unconscious of the sensation her appearance created every matron of the place had had time to learn who she was and to be filled with curiosity concerning her janey briarley by whose side she chanced to sit knew more than all the rest and took her under her protection at once thast getten th wrong hymnbook she whispered audibly having glanced at the volume the servant handed to her we dunnot use wesley aw th toime we use mester hixons songs o grace tha can look on wi me her delicate attentions and experience quite won dame haworths motherly heart i never see a sharper little thing she said admiringly afterward nor a oldfashioneder there wasnt a tex as she didnt find immediate nor yet a hymn bless us said mrs briarley laboriously lugging the baby homeward an to think o her bein th mistress o that big house wi aw them chaps i livery at her beck an call why shes nowt but a common body jane ann she thanked thee as simple as ony other woman mought ha done shes noan quality shed getten a silk gown on but it wur a black un an not so mich as a feather i her bonnet id ha had a feather if id ha been hera feather sets a body off but thats allus th road wi folk as has brassthey nivver know how to spend it nay said janey she is na quality but shes getten a noice way wi her haworth is na quality hissen she wur a noicespoken owd body commented mrs briarley seemt loike she took a fancy to thee janey turned the matter over mentally with serious thrift i should na moind it if she did she replied shell ha plenty to gi away it was not long before they knew her well she was a cheerful and neighborly little soul and through the years of her prosperity had been given to busy and kindly charities in her steadfast and loving determination to please her son she gave up her rustic habit of waiting upon herself and wore her best gown every day in spite of pangs of conscience she rode instead of walked and made courageous efforts to become accustomed to the size and magnificence of the big rooms but notwithstanding her faithfulness she was a little restless not bein used to it she said i get a little lonesome or sosometimes though not often my dear she had plenty of time to feel at a loss her leisure was not occupied by visitors broxton discussed her and smiled at her rather goodnaturedly than otherwise it was not possible to suspect her of any ill but it was scarcely to be anticipated that people would go to see her one person came however facing public opinion with her usual calmnessrachel ffrench who presented herself one day and made her a rather long call on hearing the name announced the little woman rose tremulously she was tremulous because she was afraid that she could not play her part as mistress of her sons household to his honor when miss ffrench advanced holding out her gloved hand she gave her a startled upward glance and dropped a little courtesy for a moment she forgot to ask her to be seated when she recollected herself and they sat down opposite to each other she could at first only look at her visitor in silence but miss ffrench was wholly at ease she enjoyed the rapturous wonder she had excited with all her heart she was very glad she had come it must be very pleasant for mr haworth to have you here she said the woman started a flush of joy rose upon her withered face her comprehension of her sons prosperity had been a limited one somehow she had never thought of this here was a beautiful highbred woman to whom he must be in a manner near since she spoke of him in this wayas if he had been a gentleman born jem she faltered innocently yes maam i hope so heshes told me so then she added in some hurry not that i can be much compny to himit isnt that if he hadnt been what he is and had the friends he has i couldnt be much compny for him an as it is its not likely he can need a old woman as much as his goodness makes him say he does rachel ffrench regarded her with interest he is very good she remarked and has a great many friends i dare say my father admires him greatly thank you maam brightly though theres no one could help it his goodness to me is more than i can tell an its no wonder that others sees it in him an is fond of him accordin no its no wonder in a tone of gentle encouragement the flush upon the withered cheek deepened and the old eyes lit up hes thirtytwo year old miss said the loving creature an the times to come yet when hes done a wrong or said a harsh word he was honest an good as a child an hes honest an good as a man his old mother can say it from the bottom of her full heart its a very pleasant thing to be able to say remarked her visitor its the grateful pride of my life that i can say it with fresh tenderness an to think that prosperity goes with it too ive said to myself that i wasnt worthy of it because i couldnt never be grateful enough he might have been prosperous and not what he is many a better woman than me has had that grief to bear an ive been spared it when miss ffrench returned to her carriage she wore a reflective look when she had seated herself comfortably she spoke aloud no there are ten chances to one that she will never see the other side at all there is not a man or woman in broxton who would dare to tell her i would not do it myself when haworth returned at night he heard the particulars of the visit as he had known he should when ffrench told him that it was his daughters intention to call that day the beautifulest young lady my old eyes ever saw my dear his mother said again and again an to think of her comin to see me as if id been a lady like herself haworth spoke but little he seldom said much in these days he sat at the table drinking his afterdinner wine and putting a question now and then what did she say he asked she stopped to think praps it was me that said most she answered though i didnt think so then she asked a question or so an seemed to like to listen i was tellin her what a son youd been to me an how happy i was an how thankful i was shes not one that says much he said without looking up from the glass on which his eyes had been fixed thats her way she replied with a question put timidly youve knowed her a good bit i dare say my dear no uneasily a sixmonth or so thats all but its been long enough for her to find out that what i said to her was true i didnt tell her what was new to her my dear i see that by her smile an the kind way she listened shes got a beautiful smile jem an a beautiful sweet face when they parted for the night he drew from his pocket a banknote and handed it to her ive been thinking he said awkwardly that it would be in your line to give summat now and then to some o the poor lot thats so thick here theres plenty on em an praps it wouldnt be a bad thing theres not many thats fond of givin lets set the gentry a fashion jem she said my dear there isnt nothin that would make me no happiernothin in the world it wont do overmuch good may be he returned more than half on em dont deserve it but give it to em if youve a fancy for it i dont grudge it there were tears of joy in her eyes she took his hand and held it fondling it i might have knowed it she said an i dont deserve it for holdin back an feelin a bit timid as i have done ive thought of it again and again when ive been a trifle lonesome with you away theres many a poor woman as is hardworked that i might help and children too may be me bein so fond of em she drew nearer still and laid her hand on his arm i always was fond of em she said alwaysan ive thought that sometimes my dear there might be little things here as i might help to care for an as would be fond of me if there was children she went on i should get used to it quick theyd take away thethe bigness an make me forget it but he did not answer nor look at her though she felt his arm tremble i think theyd be fond of me she said them anan her too whomsoever she might be shed be a lady jem but she wouldnt mind my ways i dare say an id do my best with all my heart id welcome her an give up my place here to her joyful its a place fitter for a lady such as she would begod bless herthan for me and she patted his sleeve and bent her face that she might kiss his hand chapter xxi in which mrs briarleys position is delicate so the poor and hardworked of the town came to know her well and it must also be confessed that others less deserving learned to know her also and proceeded with much thrift and dexterity to make hay while the sun shone haworth held to his bargain even going to the length of lavishness haworth gives it to her was said with marked incredulity at the outset nay lad tha canna mak me believe that mrs haworths earliest visit was made to the briarley cottage she came attired in her simplest gown the week after her appearance at the chapel and her entrance into the household created such an excitement as somewhat disturbed her the children were scattered with wild hustling and scurry while janey dragged off her apron in the temporary seclusion offered by the door mrs briarley wiping the soapsuds from her arms hurried forward with apologetic nervousness she dropped a courtesy scarcely knowing what words of welcome would be appropriate for the occasion and secretly speculating on possible results but her visitors demeanor was not overpowering she dropped a courtesy herselfa kindly and rustic obeisance she even looked somewhat timid im mr haworths mother maam she faltered anan thank you kindly taking the seat offered dont put yourself out maam for me there wasnt no need to send the children awaynot at all me bein partial to em an also used the next instant she gave a timid start gi me my best cap cried a stentorian voice gi me my best cap wheer is it gi me my best cap granny dixons high basketbacked chair had been placed in the shadow of the chimneycorner for the better enjoyment of her midday nap and suddenly aroused by some unknown cause she had promptly become conscious of the presence of a visitor and the dire need of some addition to her toilet she sat up her smallboned figure trembling with wrath her large eyes shining gi me my best cap she demanded gi it me mrs briarley disappeared into the adjacent room and came out with the article required in her hand it was a smart cap with a lace border and blue bows on it put it on shouted mrs dixon an put it on straight mrs briarley obeyed nervously shes my mesters grandmother she exclaimed plaintively yo munnot moind her missus granny dixon fixed her eyes upon the stranger she getten it she proclaimed i

protested mrs briarley whats a body to do wi her dont mind her maam said mrs haworth it dont do no harm a old persons often singlar it dont trouble me then janey issuing from her retirement in comparatively full dress was presented with due ceremony it wur her as fun thy place i th hymnbook said mrs briarley shes a good bit o help to me is jane ann it seemed an easy thing afterward to pour forth her troubles and she found herself so far encouraged by her visitors naive friendliness that she was even more eloquent than usual theers trouble ivvery wheer she said an i dare say tha has thy share missus fur aw thy brass politeness forbade a more definite reference to the goinson which had called forth so much virtuous indignation on the part of the broxton matrons she felt it but hospitable to wait until her guest told her own story of tribulation but mrs haworth sat smiling placidly ive seen it in my day she said an it were heavy enough too my dear an seemed heavier than it were praps through me bein a young thing an helpless but i should be a ungrateful woman if i didnt try to forget now as it had ever been a woman as has such a son as i haveone thats prospered an lived a pure good life an never done a willful wrong an has won friends an respect everywherehas enough happiness to help her forget troubles thats past an gone mrs briarley stopped halfway to the ground in the act of picking up granny dixons discarded headgear her eyes were wide open her jaw fell a little but her visitor went on without noticing her though for the matter of that she said i dare say theres not one on you as doesnt know his ways an couldnt tell me of some of his goodness as i should never find out from him wheer art tha puttin my cap shouted granny dixon what art tha doin wi my cap does tha think because ive got a bit o brass i can hot th bakeoven wi headdresses mrs briarley had picked up the cap and was only rescued by this timely warning from the fatal imprudence of putting it in the fire and stirring it violently with the poker art tha dazeder than common shrieked the old woman has tha gone daft what art tha starin at i am na starin at nowt said mrs briarley with a start ii wur hearkenin to the lady here an i did na think o what i wur doin she did not fully recover herself during the whole of her visitors stay and in fact several times lapsed into the same meditative condition when haworths charitable intentions were made known to her she stopped jolting the baby and sat in wild confusion did tha say as he wur goin to gi thee money she exclaimedmoney to gi away he said hed give it without a grudge said his mother proudly without a grudge if it pleased me thats his way my dear it were his way from the time he were a boy an worked so hard to give me a comfortable home he give it he said without a grudge jane ann said mrs briarley standing at the door to watch her out of sightjane ann what dost tha think o that theer she said it helplessly clutching at the child on her hip with a despairing grasp did tha hear her she demanded she wur talkin o haworth an she wur pridin hersen on th son hed been to her anan th way hed lived th cold sweat broke out aw over me no wonder i wur for puttin th cap i th fire lord ha mercy on us but janey regarded the matter from a more practical standpoint he has na treated her ill she said happen he is na so bad after aw did tha hear what she said about th money chapter xxii again theers a chap it was said of murdoch with some disdain among the malcontentstheers a chap as coom here to work for his fifteen bob a week an now hes hand i glove wi th mesters ans getten a shop o his own the shop in question had however been only a very simple result of circumstances in times of emergency it had been discovered that th merican chap was an individual of resources floxham had discovered this early and afterward the heads of other departments if a machine or tool was out of order tak it to th merican chap an hell fettle it said one or another and the time had never been when the necessary fettling had not been accomplished in his few leisure moments murdoch would go from room to room asking questions or looking on in silence at the work being carried on often his apparently haphazard and desultory examinations finally resulted in some suggestion which simplified things astonishingly he had a fancy for simplifying and improving the appliances he saw in use and this too without any waste of words but gradually rough models of these trifles and hastily made drawings collected in the corner of the common workroom which had fallen to murdoch and haworths attention was drawn toward them what wi moddles o this an moddles o that floxham remarked well ha to mak a flittin afore long theerll be no room fur us nor th engines neyther haworth turned to the things and looked them over one by one touching some of them dubiously some carelessly some without much comprehension look here he said to murdoch theres a room nigh mine thats not in use i dont like to be at close quarters with every chap but you can bring your traps up there itll be a place to stow em an do your bits o jobs when youre in the humor the same day the change was made and before leaving the works haworth came in to look around throwing himself into a chair he glanced about him with a touch of curiosity theyre all your own notions these he said murdoch assented they are of not much consequence he answered they are only odds and ends that fell into my hands somehow when they needed attention i like that kind of work you know aye responded haworth i dare say but most chaps would have had more to say about doin em than you have not long after ffrenchs advent a change was made if youll give up your old job and take to looking sharp after the machinery and keeping the chaps that run it up to their work said haworth you can do it itll be a better shop than the other and give you more time and itll be a saving to the place in the end so the small room containing his nondescript collection became his headquarters and murdochs position was a more responsible one he found plenty of work but he had more time as haworth had prophesied and he had also more liberty yore getten on said janey briarley yore getten more wage an less work an yore one o th mesters i a way yo go wi th gentlefolk a good bit too feyther says ffrench maks hissen as thick wi yo as if yo wur a gentleman yorsen yo had yore supper up theer last neet did she set i th room an talk wi yo yes he answered it was not necessary to explain who she was well said janey she would na do that if she did na think more o yo nor if yo were a common chap shes pretty grand i her ways what did yo talk about it would be hard to tell now he replied we talked of several things aye but what i wanted to know wur whether she talked to thee loike shed talk to a gentlemonwhether she made free wi thee or not i have never seen her talk to a gentleman he said how does she talk to haworth i have never seen her talk to him either we have never been there at the same time this was true it had somehow chanced that they had never met at the house perhaps rachel ffrench knew why she had found broxton dull enough to give her an interest in any novelty of emotion or experience she disliked the ugly town with its population of hardworked and unpicturesque people she hated the quiet well regulated wellbred county families with candor and vivacity she had no hesitation in announcing her distaste and weariness i detest them all she once said calmly to murdoch i detest them she made the best of the opportunities for enlivenment which lay within her grasp she was not averse to haworths presenting himself again and again sitting in restless misery in the room with her watching her every movement drinking in her voice struggling to hold himself in check and failing and growing sullen and silent and going away carrying his wretchedness with him she never encouraged him to advance by any word or look but he always returned again to go through the same selftorture and humiliation and she always knew he would she even derived some unexciting entertainment from her fathers plans for the future he had already new methods and processes to discuss he had a fancy for establishing a bank in the town and argued the advisability of the scheme with much fervor and brilliancy without a bank in which the hands could deposit their earnings and which should make the town a sort of center and add importance to its business ventures broxton was nothing the place was growing and the people of the surrounding villages were drawn toward it when they had business to transact they were beginning to buy and sell in its market and to look to its increasing population for support the farmers would deposit their funds the shopkeepers theirs the hands would follow their example and in all likelihood it would prove in the end a gigantic success haworth met his enthusiasms with stolid indifference sometimes he did not listen at all sometimes he laughed a short heavy laugh sometimes he flung him off with a rough speech but in spite of this there were changes gradually made in the workstrifling changes of which haworth was either not conscious or which he disdained to notice he lost something of his old masterful thoroughness he was less regular in his business habits he was prone to be tyrannical by fits and starts go to ffrench he said roughly to one of the hands on one occasion and though before he had reached the door he was called back the man did not forget the incident miss ffrench looked on at all of this with a great deal of interest he does not care for the place as he did she said to murdoch he does not like to share his power with another man it is a nightmare to him by this time she had seen murdoch the oftener of the two mr ffrenchs fancy for him was more enthusiastic than his fancy for the young man from manchester or the cumberland mechanic he also found him useful and was not chary of utilizing him in time the servants of the house ceased to regard him as an outsider and were surprised when he was absent for a few days we have a fellow at our place whom you will hear of some of these days ffrench said to his friends he spends his evenings with me often ffrench has taken a great fancy to thee lad haworth said drily he says youre goin to astonish us some o these days does he murdoch answered aye hes got a notion that youre holding on to summat on the quiet and that itll come out when were not expecting it they were in the little workroom together and murdoch leaning back in his chair with his hands clasped behind his head looked before him without replying except by a slight knitting of his brows haworth laughed harshly confound him for a fool he said im sick of the chap with his talk hell stir me up some o these days then he looked up at his companion he has you up there every night or so he said what does he want of you never the same thing twice said murdoch do youalways see her yes the man moved in his seat a sullen red rising to his forehead whathas she to say he asked murdoch turned about to confront him he spoke in a low voice and slowly do you want to know he said whether she treats me as she would treat another man is that it aye was the grim answer summat o that sort lad murdoch left his chair he uttered half a dozen words hoarsely come up to the house some night and judge for yourself he said he went out of the room without looking back it was saturday noon and he had the halfday of leisure before him but he did not turn homeward he made his way to the high road and struck out upon it he had no definite end in view at first except the working off of his passionate excitement but when after twenty minutes walk he came within sight of broxton chapel and its graveyard his steps slackened and when he reached the gate he stopped a moment and pushed it open and turned in it was a quiet little place with an almost rustic air of which even the small ugly chapel could not rob it the grass grew long upon the mounds of earth and swayed softly in the warm wind only common folk lay there and there were no monuments and even few slabs murdoch glanced across the sunlit space to the grasscovered mound of which he had thought when he stopped at the gateway he had not thought of meeting any one and at the first moment the sight of a figure standing at the graveside in the sunshine was something of a shock to him he went forward more slowly even with some reluctance though he had recognized at once that the figure was that of christian murdoch she stood quite still looking down not hearing him until he was close upon her she seemed startled when she saw him why did you come here she asked i dont know he answered i needed quiet i suppose and the place has a quiet look why did you come it is not the first time i have been she said i come here often you he said why she pointed to the mound at her feet because he is here she said and i have learned to care for him she knelt down and laid her hand upon the grass and he remembered her emotion in the strange scene which had occurred before i know him very well she said i know him you told me that i would not understand he said it is true that i dont yet suddenly there were tears in her eyes and in her voice he does not seem a dead man to me she said he never will i do not think he answered heavily that his life seems at an end to any of us not to me she repeated i have thought of him until i have seemed to grow near to him and to know what his burden was and how patiently he bore it i have never been patient i have rebelled always and so it has gone to my heart all the more murdoch looked down upon the covering sod with a pang he did bear it patiently he said at the bitterest and worst i know that she replied i have been sure of it i found some papers in my room when i first came she went on some of them were plans he had drawn thirty years ago he had been very patient and constant with them he had drawn the same thing again and again often he had written a few words upon them and they helped me to understand after i had looked them over i could not forget they haunted me and came back to me i began to care for him and put things together until all was real then she added slowly and in a lowered voice i have even thought that if he had lived he would have been fond of me i dont know why but i have thought that perhaps he would for the first time in his knowledge of her murdoch saw in her the youth he had always missed her dark and bitter young face was softened for the moment she seemed almost a childeven though a child whose life had been clouded by the shadow of sin and wrong i thinkhe would he said slowly and i have got into the habit of coming here when i was lonely orat my worst you are lonely often i dare say he returned wearily i wish it could be helped it is nothing new she replied with something of her old manner and there is no help for it but her touch upon the grass was a caress she smoothed it softly and moved with singular gentleness a few dead leaves which had dropped upon it when i come here i ambetter she said andless hard things do not seem to matter so muchor to look so shameful a pause followed which she herself broke in upon i have thought a great deal ofwhat he left unfinished she said i have wished that i might see it it would be almost as if i had seen him i can show it to you murdoch answered it is a little thing to have caused so great pain they said but little else until they rose to go as he sat watching the long grass wave under the warm wind murdoch felt that his excitement had calmed down he was in a cooler mood when they got up at last but before they turned away the girl lingered for a moment as if she wished to speak sometimes she falteredsometimes i have thought you had half forgotten nay he answered never that god knows i could not bear to believe it she said passionately it would make me hate you when they reached home he took her upstairs to his room he had locked the door when he left it in the morning he unlocked it and they went in a cloth covered something standing upon the table he drew it aside with an unsteady hand look at it he said it has been there since last night you see it haunts me too what she said you brought it out yourselfagain yes he answered again she drew nearer and sat down in the chair before the table he used to sit here she said yes if it had been finished she said as if speaking to herself death would have seemed a little thing to him even if it should be finished now i think he would forget the rest chapter xxiii ten shillings worth the same evening mr briarley having partaken of an early tea and some vigorous advice from his wife had suddenly during a lull in the storm vanished from the domestic circle possibly called therefrom by the recollection of a previous engagement mrs briarley had gone out to do her sunday shoppin the younger children had been put to bed the older ones were disporting themselves in the streets and byways and consequently janey was left alone uncheered save by the presence of granny dixon who had fallen asleep in her chair with her cap unbecomingly disarranged janey sat down upon her stool at a discreet distance from the hearth she had taken down from its place her last book of memoirsa volume of a more than usually orthodox and peppery flavor she held it within range of the light of the fire and began to read in a subdued tone with much unction but she had only mastered the interesting circumstance that james joseph william was born november th when her attention was called to the fact that wheels had stopped before the gate and she paused to listen bless us she said some uns comin in the person in question was haworth who so far dispensed with ceremony as to walk up to the firelight without even knocking at the door which stood open wheres your father he demanded hes takken hissen off to th beerhouse said janey as he allus does o saturday neetan ivvery other neet too as he gets th chance a chair stood near and haworth took it ill sit down and wait for him he replied thalt ha to wait a good bit then said miss briarley hell noan be whoam till midneet she stood in no awe of her visitor she had heard him discussed too freely and too often of late years she had not unfrequently assisted in the discussions herself she was familiar with his sins and shortcomings and regarded him with due severity hell noan be whoam till midneet she repeated as she seated herself on her stool but haworth did not move he was in a mysterious humor it was plain in a minute more his young companion began to stare at him with open eyes she saw something in his face which bewildered her hes getten more thans good fur him she was about to decide shrewdly when he leaned forward and touched her with the handle of the whip he held youre a sharp little lass i warrant he said janey regarded him with some impatience he was flushed and somewhat disheveled and spoke awkwardly youre a sharp little lass ill warrant he said again i ha to be she responded tartly thad be sharp thysen if tha had as mich to look after as i ha i dare say he answered i dare say then added even more awkwardly still ive heard murdoch say you weremurdoch the disfavor with which she had examined him began to be mingled with distrust she hitched her stool a few inches backward mester murdoch she echoed aye i know him well enow he comes here every day or so aye him an mes good friends hes got a good many friends he said aye she answered hes a noice chap most o folk tak to him theers mr ffrench now and her he goes there pretty often aye oftener than he goes any wheer else they mak as mich o him as if he wur a gentleman did he tell you that nay she answered he does na talk mich about it ive fun it out fro them as knows then a new idea presented itself to her what does tha want to know fur she demanded with unceremonious candor he did not tell her why he gave no notice to her question save by turning away from the fire suddenly and asking her another what does he say about her he spoke in such a manner that she pushed her stool still farther back and sat staring at him blankly and with some indignation he does na say nowt about her she exclaimed whats up wi thee the next moment she uttered an ejaculation and the book of memoirs fell upon the floor a flame shot up from the fire and showed her his face he drew forth his purse and opening it took out a coin the light fell upon that too and showed her what it was do you see that he asked aye she answered its a halfsovrin ill give it to you he said if youll tell me what he says and what he does youre sharp enow to have seen summat and ill give it you if youll tell me he did not care what impression he made on her or how he entangled himself he only thought of one thing tell me what he says and what he does he repeated and ill give it to you janey rose from her stool in such a hurry that it lost its balance and fell over ii dunnot want it she cried i dunnot want it i can na mak thee out youre not as sharp as i took you for if you dont want it he answered youll not earn another as easy my lass only stern common sense rescued her from the weakness of backing out of the room into the next apartment i dunnot know what thart drivin at she said i tell theei dunnot know nowt does he never say he put it to her that hes been thereand that hes seen herand that shes sat and talkedand that hes looked at herand listenedand thought over it afterward this was the last straw bewilderment turned to contempt that would na be worth ten shillin she said tha knows hes been theer an tha knows hes seen her an tha knows he could na see her wiout lookin at her i dunnot see as theers owt i lookin at her or i listenin neyther wheers th use o givin ten shillin to hear summat yo know yorsen theres nowt i that has he ever said it he persisted no she answered he has na he nivver wur much give ter talk an he says less than ivver i these days has he never said that she treated him well andwas easier to please than hed thought has he never said nowt like that nay that he has na with vigor nowt o th soart he got up as unceremoniously and abruptly as he had sat down i was an accursed fool for coming she heard him mutter he threw the halfsovereign toward her and it fell on the floor art tha goin to gi it me she asked yes he answered and he strode through the doorway into the darkness leaving her staring at it she went to the fire and bending down examined it closely and rubbed it with a corner of her apron then she tried its ring upon the flagged floor aye she said its a good un sure enow its a good un she had quite lost her breath she sat down upon her stool again forgetting the memoirs altogether i nivver heard so mich doment made over nowt i aw my days she said i conna see now what he wur up to axin questions as if he wur i drink he mun ha been i drink or hed nivver ha gien it to me and on the mothers return she explained the affair to her upon this sound and commonsense basis mester haworths been here she said an he wur i drink an give me ten shillin i could na mak out what he wur drivin at he wur askin questions as put me out o patience eh what foos men is when theyve getten too much when he left the house haworth sprang into his gig with an oath since the morning he had had time to think over things slowly he had worked himself up into a desperate headlong mood his blood burned in his veins his pulses throbbed he went home to his dinner but ate nothing he drank heavily and sat at the table wearing such a look that his mother was stricken with wonder im out o humor old lady he said to her stick to your dinner and dont mind me a chap with a place like mine on his mind cant always be up to the mark if you aint ill jem she said it dont matter your not talkin you mustnt think o me my dear im used to havin lived alone so long after dinner he went out again but before he left the room he went to her and kissed her theres nowt wrong wi me he said youve no need to trouble yourself about that im right enow never fear theres nothin else could trouble me she said nothin so long as youre well an happy theres nowt to go agen me bein happy he said a little grimly not yet as i know on i dont let things go agen me easy about half an hour later he stood in the road before his partners house the night was warm and the windows of the drawingroom were thrown open he stood and looked up at them for a minute and then spoke aloud aye he said hes there by george he could see inside plainly and the things he saw best were rachel ffrench and murdoch ffrench himself sat in a large chair reading miss ffrench stood upon the hearth she rested an arm upon the low mantel and talked to murdoch who stood opposite to her the man who watched uttered an oath at the sight of her him he said himdamn him and grew hot and cold by turns he kept his stand for full ten minutes and then crossed the road the servant who answered his summons at the door regarded him with amazement i know theyre in he said making his way past him i saw em through the window those in the drawingroom heard his heavy feet as he mounted the staircase it is possible that each recognized the sound ffrench rose hurriedly and it must be owned with some slight trepidation rachel merely turned her face toward the door she did not change her position otherwise at all murdoch did not move my dear fellow said ffrench with misplaced enthusiasm i am glad to see you but haworth passed him over with a nod his eyes were fixed on murdoch he gave him a nod also and spoke to him what youre here are you he said thats a good thing we think so said mr ffrench with fresh fervor my dear fellow sit down he took the chair offered him but still looked at murdoch and spoke to him ive been to briarleys he said ive had a talk with that little lass of his she gave me the notion youd be here shes a sharp little un by george theyre all sharp said mr ffrench the precocity one finds in these manufacturing towns is something astonishingastonishing he launched at once into a dissertation upon the causes of precocity in a manufacturing town and became so absorbed in his theme that it mattered very little that haworth paid no attention to him he was leaning back in his chair with his hands in his pockets not moving his eyes from murdoch mr ffrench was in the middle of his dissertation when half an hour afterward haworth got up without ceremony murdoch was going ill go with you he said to him they went out of the room and down the staircase together without speaking they did not even look at each other when they were fairly out of the room mr ffrench glanced somewhat uneasily at his daughter really he said he is not always a pleasant fellow to deal with one is never sure of reaching him and then as he received no answer he returned in some embarrassment to his book chapter xxiv at an end when they stood in the road haworth laid his hand upon his companions shoulder heavily come up to the works lad he said and lets have a bit of a talk his voice and his touch had something in common murdoch understood them both there was no need for clearer speech why there he asked its quiet there ive a fancy for it i have no fancy against it as well there as anywhere else aye said haworth not only as well but better he led the way into his own room and struck a light he flung his keys upon the table they struck it with a heavy clang then he spoke his first words since they had turned from the gateway aye he said not only as well but better im at home here if im out everywhere else the place knows me and i know it im best man here by if im out everywhere else he sat down at the table and rested his chin upon his hand his hand shook and his forehead was clammy murdoch threw himself into the chair opposite to him go on he said say what you have to say haworth bent forward a little youve got on better than id have thought lad he saidbetter than id have thought what hoarsely does she treat me as she treats other men nay said haworth not as she treats meby the lord harry the deadly bitterness which possessed him was terrible he was livid with it ive thought of a good many he said ive looked on at em as they stood round herchaps of her own sort with money and the rest of it but i never thought of younot once no said murdoch i dare say not nonot once the man repeated get up and lets take a look at you he said happen ive not had the right notion on you dont say anything youll repent said murdoch its bad enough as it is but his words were like chaff before the wind you cried the man you were the chap that knew naught of womens ways youd scarce look one on em in the face youre not the build i thought they took to you told me that once before said murdoch with a bitter laugh ive not forgotten it haworths clenched fist fell upon the table with a force which made the keys ring blast you he said youre nigher to her now than menow then murdoch answered you may give up give up was the reply nay not that my lad ive not come to that yet then his rage broke forth again you to be going there on the quiet he cried you to be making way with her and finding her easy to please and priding yourself on it i please her said murdoch i pride myself he got up and began to pace the floor youre mad he said mad haworth checked himself to stare at him what did you go for he asked if it wasnt for that murdoch stopped in his walk he turned himself about i dont know he said i dont know do you think he said in a hushed voice after the pause which followeddo you think i expect anything do you think i look forward or backward can you understand that it is enough as it standsenough haworth still stared at him dully nay he returned that i cannot i to stand before her as a man with a best side which might win her favor what is there in me that she should give me a thought when i am not near her what have i done what has my life been worth it may be nothing in the end good god nothing he said it almost as if stunned for the moment he was overwhelmed and had forgotten youre nigher to her than i am said haworth you think because youre one o the gentleman sort gentleman said murdoch speculatively i a gentleman aye damn you said haworth bitterly and you know it the very words seemed to rouse him he shook his clenched hand thats it he cried theres where it is youve got it in you and you know itand she knows it too i have never asked myself whether i was or not said murdoch i have not cared what did it matter what you said just now was true after all i know nothing of women i know little enough of men i have been a dull fellow i think and slow to learn i can only take what comes he came back to the table and threw himself into his chair does either of us know what we came here for he asked we came to talk it over was haworths answer and weve done it then if we have done it let us go our ways nay not yet ive summat more to say say it murdoch replied and let us have it over its this he returned youre a different chap from what i took you fora different chap i never thought of younot once youve said that before aye grimly ive said it before like enough i shall say it again it sticks to me weve been good friends after a manner and that makes it stick to me i dont say youre to blame i havent quite made the thing out yet were of a different build andtheres been times before when i havent quite been up to you but weve been friends after a manner and now th times come when were done with that done with it repeated murdoch mechanically aye meeting his glance fully done with it well begin fair and square lad its done with do you think with deadly coolness id stop at aught if th time come he rose a little from his seat bending forward naughts never come in my way yet thats stopped me he said things has gone agen me and ive got th best on em in one way or another ive not minded how ive gone on till ive reached this naughts stopped menaught never shall he fell back in his chair and wiped the cold sweat from his forehead with his handkerchief i wish he said it had been another chap i never thought of younot once chapter xxv i shall not turn back murdoch went out into the night alone when he found himself outside the iron gate he stood still for a moment i will not go home yet he said not yet he knew this time where he was going when he turned his steps upon the road again he had only left the place a few hours before the moonlight gave it almost a desolate look he thought as he passed through the entrance the wind still swayed the grass upon the mounds fitfully and the headstones cast darker shadows upon them there was no shadow upon the one under which stephen murdoch rested it lay in the broad moonlight murdoch noticed this as he stopped beside it he sat down upon the grass just as he had done in the afternoon better not go home just yet he said again there is time enough suddenly an almost unnatural calmness had fallen upon him his passions and uncertainties of the past few months seemed small things he had reached a climax and for a moment there seemed time enough he thought of the past almost coldlygoing over the ground mentally step by step it was as if he thought of the doings of another manone who was younger and simpler and whose life was now over there are a good many things that are done with he said mechanically recalling haworths words he thought of the model standing in its old place in the empty room it was a living thing awaiting his coming the end might be anythingcalamity failure deathbut tonight he had taken his first step toward that end tonight i shall begin as he began he thought tonight he threw himself full length upon the grass clasping his hands beneath his head his face turned upward to the vast clearness and depth above him he had known it would come some day but he never thought of its coming in this way the man who slept under the earth at his side had begun with hope he began as one who neither hoped nor feared yielding only to a force stronger than himself he lay in this manner looking up for nearly an hour then he arose and stood with bared head in the white light and stillness i shall not turn back he said aloud at last as if to some presence near him i shall not turn back at least do not fear it and he turned away it was his mother who opened the door for him when he reached home come in he said to her with a gesture toward the inner room i have something to say to you she followed him in silence her expression was cold and fixed it struck him that she too had lived past hope and dread she did not sit down when she had closed the door but stood upright facing him he spoke hoarsely i am going upstairs he said i told you once that some day it would see the light again in spite of us both you can guess what work i shall do tonight yes she answered i can guess i gave up long ago she looked at him steadily her eyes dilated a little as if with slowgrowing fear of him i knew it would end so she went on i fought against my belief that it would but it grew stronger every dayevery hour there was no other way no he replied there was no other way i have seen it in your face she said i have heard it in your voice it has never been absent from your thoughts a momentnor mine he did not speak at first when he died her voice faltered and broke and then rose in a cry almost shrill he did not die she cried he is not dead he lives nowhere there is no death for himnot even death until it is done she panted for breath her thin chest rose and felland yet suddenly she checked herself and stood before him with her first strained calm go she said i cannot hold you if there is an end to be reached reach it for gods sake and let him rest wish me godspeed he said ihave more to bear than you think of for answer she repeated steadily words which she had uttered before i do not believe in it i have never believed for one hour chapter xxvi a revolution in a months time the broxton bank was an established fact it had sprung into existence in a manner which astonished even its originator haworth had come to him in cold blood and talked the matter over he had listened to the expounding of his views and without being apparently much moved by his eloquence had still shown a disposition to weigh the plan and having given a few days to deliberation he had returned a favorable decision the thing sounds well he said and it may be a sharp stroke that way when the rest on em hear on it itll set em thinkin blast em i like to astonish em an give em summat to chew mr ffrench could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses he had been secretly conscious of playing a minor part in all business transactions his pet theories had been thrust aside as worthy of small notice his continental experience had been openly set at naught when he had gone to the trouble of explaining his ideas to the heads of the various departments he had been conscious of illuminating smiles on the grimy countenances around him his rather frail physique his good breeding his wellmodulated voice had each been the subject of derisive comment gi him a puddlin rake an let him puddle a bit he had heard a brawny fellow say after one of his most practical dissertations after his final interview with haworth he went home jubilant at dinner he could speak of nothing else miss ffrench heard the details from beginning to end and enjoyed them in a manner peculiarly her own at the whod ha thowt it no little excitement prevailed when the movement was discussed a bank said foxy gibbs an wheer did he get th money to set up a bank wi why he getten it out o th workin mon an th sweat o th workin mons brow if theer wur na no banks theerd be more money to put in em i dunnot believe i banks mysen let the brass cerkylatelet it cerkylate aye said mr briarley who had reached his second quart let it cerkylate an hell ha more comfort will th workin mon theers too many on em with natural emotion theyre th ruin o th country theers summat wrong wi em if theyd gi a chap summat to put i em theerd be some chance for him but thats allus th way he has na no chance hasnt th workin monhe has na no shut up said foxy gibbs eh inquired the orator weakly and uncertainly shut up till thas getten less beer i thee shut repeated mr briarley winking his eyes slowlyup he seized his beer mug and gazed into its depths in some confusion a deep sigh escaped him thats allus th road he faltered its th road wi sararann an its th road wi aw on em he has no chance has na a mon as is misforchnit and he happily disposed of the beer before janey opened the door and appeared to marshal him homeward but the broxton bank was an established fact and created no small sensation he is a bold fellow this haworth it was said among his rivals but he will overstep himself one of these days hes set up a bank has he shouted granny dixon on murdochs first visit after she had heard the story yes murdoch answered she sat glowering at the fire a few moments almost bent double and then having deluded her audience into believing she had subsided suddenly started and came to life again with increased vigor ive getten my brass i th manchester savins she cried an ill keep it theer it seemed unnecessary to reply and nobody made any remark upon this statement of facts but the venerable matron had not concluded ill keep it theer she repeatedkeep it theer i conna bide him no more than i can bide her and then she returned to her fire fixing her great eyes upon it and mumbling with no small elation th thingll break now for sure commented her muchtried hostess sardonically it conna stand up agen that i reason haworth ud better sell th works at th start afore its too late there had been some vague wonder in murdochs mind as to what the result of haworths outburst against himself would be the first time he found himself confronting him as he went to his workroom he spoke to him you said once he remarked that you had kept this room empty because you did not care to be at close quarters with every man now get thee in my lad he interrupted dryly it suits me well enow to ha you nigh me never fear that the only outward change made was in his manner he went about his labor with a deadly persistence he came early and went home late the simplest hand saw that some powerful force was at work he was silent and harder in his rule of those under him he made closer bargains and more daring plans men who had been his rivals began to have a kind of fear of him all he took in hand throve he is a wonderful fellow said ffrench to his friends wonderfulwonderful even the friends in question who were some of them county magnates of great dignity began to find their opinion of the man shaken in these days there was actually nothing to complain of the simple little country woman reigned in his household she attended the broxton chapel and dispensed her innocent charities on all sides finally a dowager of high degree the patroness of a charitable society made the bold move of calling upon her for a subscription it werent as hard to talk to her jem as id have thought said mrs haworth afterward she began to tell me about the poor women as suffers so an somehow i forgot about her bein so grand i couldnt think of nothin but the poor creturs an their pain an when i come to sign my name my and trembled so an my eyes was that full i couldnt hardly tell what id put down to think of them poor things how much did you give her asked haworth i give her ten pound my dear an he pulled out a banknote and handed it to her go to her tomorrow and give her that he said happen itll be summat new fur her to get fifty at a stroke so it began to be understood that the master of haworths was a bugbear with redeeming points after all the broxton bank had its weight too and the new cottages which it was necessary to build it is to haworth after all that you owe the fact that the place is growing said ffrench there came an evening when on entering the drawingroom of a county potentate with whom she and her father were to dine rachel ffrench found herself looking directly at haworth who stood in the center of a group of guests they were talking to him with an air of great interest and listening to his offhand replies with actual respect suddenly the tide had turned before the evening had passed the man was a lion and all the more a lion because he had been so long tabooed he went in to dinner with the lady patroness and she afterward announced her intention of calling upon his mother in state there is a rough candor about the man my dear she said which one must respect and it appears that he has really reformed there was no difficulty after this mrs haworth had visitors every day who came and examined her and wondered and somehow were never displeased by her tender credulity she admired them all and believed in them and was always ready with tears and relief for their pensioners and charities dont thank me maam she would say dont never thank me for its not me that deserves it but him thats so ready and generous to every one that suffers there never was such a kind heart before it seems to me maam nor such a lovin one haworths wealth his success his openhandedness his past sins were the chief topics of conversation to speak of broxton was to speak of the man who had made it what it was by his daring and his power and who was an absolute ruler over it and its inhabitants ffrench was a triumphant man he was a potentate also he could ride his hobby to the sound of applause when he expatiated upon processes he could gain an audience which was attentive and appreciative he had not failed this time at least and was put down as a shrewd fellow after all in the festivities which seemed somehow the result of this sudden revulsion of feeling rachel ffrench was naturally a marked figure among the women with whom she was not exactly a favorite it was still conceded that she was not a young woman whom it was easy to ignore her beautyof which it was impossible to say that she was consciouswas of a type not to be rivaled when she entered a room glancing neither to right nor left those who had seen her before unavoidably looked again and those who had not were silent as she passed there was a delicate suggestion of indifference in her manner which might be real or might not her demeanor toward haworth never altered even to the extent of the finest shadow of change when they were in a room together his eye followed her with stealthy vigilance and her knowledge of the fact was not a disturbing one the intensity of her consciousness was her great strength she was never unprepared when he approached her she met him with her little untranslatable smile he might be bold or awkward or desperate but he never found her outwardly conscious or disturbed or a shade colder or warmer it was only natural that it should not be long before others saw what she seeing showed no knowledge of it was easily seen that he made no effort at concealment his passion revealed itself in every look and gesture he could not have controlled it if he would and would not if he could let em see he said to himself its naught to them its betwixt her and me he even bore himself with a sullen air of defiance at times knowing that he had gained one thing at least he was nearer to her in one way than any other man he might come and go as he chose he saw her day after day he knew her ingoings and outcomings the success which had restored her fathers fortunes was his success i can make her like a queen among em he saidlike a queen by georgeand ill do it every triumph which fell to him he regarded only as it would have weight in her eyes when society opened its doors to him he said to himself now shell see that i can stand up with the best of em gentlemen or no gentlemen when he suddenly found himself a prominent figurea man deferred to and talked of he waited with secret feverishness to see what the effect upon her would be its what women like he said its what she likes more than most on em itll be bound to tell in the end he labored as he had never labored before his ambitions were boundless he strove and planned and ventured lying awake through long hours of the night pondering and building his daring growing with his success there occurred one thing however which he had not bargained for in his laudable enthusiasm mr ffrench could not resist the temptation to sound the praises of his protege his belief in him had increased instead of diminished with time as he had been forced regretfully to acknowledge had been the case during the eras of the young man from manchester and his fellows he had reason to suspect that a climax had been reached and that his hopes might be realized it is not every man who keeps on hand a genius naturally his friends heard of murdoch often those who came to the works were taken to his workroom as to a point of interest he became in time a feature and was spoken of with a mixture of curiosity and bewilderment to each visitor ffrench told in strict confidence the story of his father with due effect and its my impression he always added that we shall hear more of this invention one of these days he is a singular fellowreserved and not easy to readjust the man to carry a purpose in his mind and say nothing of it and in the end startle the world by accomplishing what he has held in view finally upon one occasion when his daughter was making her list of invitations for a dinner party they were to give he turned to her suddenly with some hesitation in his manner ohby the way he said theres murdoch weve never had murdoch she wrote the name without comment who next she asked after having done it you see he went on waveringly there is really nothing which could be an obstacle in the way of our inviting himreally nothing he ishe is all that we could wish the reply he received staggered him it is nonsense she said looking up calmly to talk of obstacles i should have invited him long ago you he exclaimed would youreally yes she answered why not whynot he repeated feebly i dont know why not i thought that perhaps and then he broke off i wish i had known as much before he added when he received the invitation murdoch declined it i should only be out of place he said candidly to miss ffrench i should know nobody and nobody would know me why should i come there is a very good reason why you should come answered the young woman with perfect composure i am the reason there was no further discussion of the point he was present and haworth sat opposite to him at the table its the first time for him said haworth to miss ffrench afterward it is the first time he has dined here with other people she answered have you a reason for asking he held his coffeecup in his hand and glanced over it across the room he is not like the rest on em he said but he stands it pretty well by george chapter xxvii the beginning for some time there had hung over the conduct of mr briarley an air of deep mystery the boon of his society had been granted to his family even less frequently than ever his habit of sudden and apparently unaccountable disappearance from the home circle after or even in the midst of an argument had become more than usually pronounced he went out every night and invariably returned under the influence of malt liquor wheer he gets th brass bangs me said mrs briarley he does na tak it out o his wage thats certain fur he has na been a hapenny short fur three week an he does na get it o tick that i know bannett at th public is na a foo wheer does he get th brass fro but this was not easily explained on being catechised mr briarley either shed tears of penitence or shook his head with deep solemnity of meaning at times when he began to shake itif the hour was late and his condition specially foggyhe was with difficulty induced to stop shaking it but frequently continued to do so with protracted fervor and significance gradually decreasing until he fell asleep when he was sober he was timorous and abstracted he started at the sound of the opening door and apparently existed in a state of secret expectation and alarm i conna tell thee sararann he would say at least with some tremor i wunnot tell thee just yet thoult know i toime he did not patronize the whod ha thowt it as much as formerly in these days janey discovered he evidently got the beer elsewhere and at somebodys expense his explanation of this was a brilliant and happy one but it was only offered once in consequence of the mode of its reception by his hearers he presented it suddenly one night after some moments of silence and mental research theers a gentlemon as is a friend o moine he said as has had uncommon luck his heirs has deed an left him a forchin an hes come into it an hes very mich tuk wi me i dunnot know as i ivver seed ony one as mich tuk wi me sararannan his heirs deein an leavin him a forchinthat theers how it is sararannthat theers how it is tha brazant leer cried mrs briarley aghast tha brazant leer get out wi thee in an outburst of indignation thee an thy forchins an heirs deeinas if it wur na bad enow at th start a noice chap tha art to set thysen up to know gentlefolks wi heirs to dee an leave em brass eh bless us what art tha comin to the result was not satisfactory as mr briarley felt keenly tha hast getten no confydence i me sararann he said in weak protest tha has na no faithnor yet following the train of thought with manifest uncertaintynor yet no works the situation was so painful however that he made no further effort of the imagination to elucidate the matter and it remained temporarily obscured in mystery only temporarily however a few weeks afterward ffrench came down to the works in great excitement he went to haworths room and finding him there shut the door and almost dropped into a chair whats up demanded haworth with some impatience whats up man you havent heard the report ffrench answered tremulously it hasnt reached you yet ive heard nowt to upset me out with it whats up he was plainly startled and lost a shade of color but he held himself boldly ffrench explained himself with trepidation the hands in marfort and molton and howton are on the strike and those in dillup and burton are plainly about to follow suit ive just got a manchester paper which says the lookout is bad all over the country meetings have been going on in secret for some time he stopped and sat staring at his partner haworth was deathly pale he seemed for a moment to lack breath and then suddenly the dark color rushed to his face again by he began and stopped with the oath upon his lips dont swear for pitys sake broke forth ffrench finding courage for protest in his very desperation its not the time for it lets look the thing in the face look it in the face haworth repeated aye lets he said the words with a fierce sneer aye look it in the face man he said again thats th thing to do he bent forward extending his hand across the table lets see th paper he demanded ffrench gave it to him and he read the paragraphs referred to in silence when he had finished them he folded the paper again mechanically they might have done it last year and welcome blast em he said ffrench began to tremble youve ventured a good deal of late haworth he said weakly youve done some pretty daring things you knowand haworth turned on him if i lose all ive made he said hoarsely shall i lose aught of yours lad ffrench did not reply he sat playing with his watchchain nervously he had cause for anxiousness on his own score and his soul quaked within him what is to be done he ventured at last theres only one thing to be done haworth answered pushing his chair back stop it hereat th start stop it ffrench echoed in amazement aye stop it he got up and took his hat down and put it on im going round th place and about th yards and into th town he said theres naught for you to do but keep quiet th quieter you keep th better for us go on as if youd heard naught stay here a bit and then walk over to th bank look alive man he went out and left ffrench alone in the passage he came upon a couple of men who were talking together in low voices they started at sight of him and walked away slowly he went first to the engineroom there he found floxham and murdoch talking also the old engineer wore an irritable air and was plainly in a testy mood murdoch looked fagged and pale of late he was often so as haworth entered he turned toward him uttering an exclamation he is here now he said that is well enough floxham gave him a glance from under his bent bushy brows aye he answered we may as well out wi it he touched his cap clumsily tell him he said to murdoch an ha it over murdoch spoke in a cool low voice i have found out he said that there is trouble on foot i began to suspect it a week ago some rough fellows from manchester and molton have been holding secret meetings at a low place here some of the hands have been attending them last night a worse and larger gang came and remained in the town they are here now they mean mischief at least and there are reports afloat that strikes are breaking out on all sides haworth turned abruptly to floxham where do you stand he asked roughly the old fellow laid his grimy hand upon his engine i stand here my lad he answered thats wheeran ill stick to it unions or no unions illustration i stand here my lad he answered thats the worst side of the trouble said murdoch those who would hold themselves aloof from the rest will be afraid of the trades unions if worst comes to worst their very lives will be in danger they know that and so do we aye lad said floxham an thart reet theer haworth ground his teeth and swore under his breath then he spoke to murdoch how is it going on here he asked badly enough in a quiet way you had better go and see for yourself he went out walking from room to room through the yards and wherever men were at work here and there a place was vacant where the work went on it went on dully he saw dogged faces and subdued ones those who looked up as he passed wore an almost deprecatory air those who did not look up at all bent over their tasks with an expression which was at least negatively defiant his keen eye discovered favorable symptoms however those who were in evil mood were his worst workmenmen who had their off days of drunken stupor and idleness and the heads of departments were plainly making an effort to stir briskly and ignore the presence of any cloud upon their labor by the time he had made the rounds he had grasped the situation fully the strait was desperate but not as bad as it might have been i may hold em he said to himself between his teeth and by the lord harry ill try hard for it he went over to the bank and found ffrench in his private room pale and out of all courage there will be a run on us by this time tomorrow he said i see signs of it already will there said haworth well see about that wait a bit my lad he went into the town and spent an hour or so taking a sharp lookout nothing escaped him there were more idlers than usual about the ale houses and more than once he passed two or three women talking together with anxious faces and in undertones as he was passing one such group one of the women saw him and started theer he is she said and her companion turned with her and they both stopped talking to look after him before returning he went up to his partners house he asked for miss ffrench and was shown into the room where she sat writing letters she neither looked pleased nor displeased when she saw him but rose to greet him at once she gave him a rather long look what is the matter she asked suddenly he felt less bold the heat of his excitement failed to sustain him he was all unstrung ive come to tell you not to go out he said theres trouble afootin the trade theres no knowing how itll turn out theres a lot of chaps in th town who are not in th mood to see aught thatll fret em theyre ready for mischief and have got drink in em stay you here until we see which way th things going do you mean she demanded that there are signs of a strike theres more than signs of it he answered sullenly before night the whole place will be astir she moved across the room and pulled the bell a servant answered the summons instantly i want the carriage she said then she turned to haworth with a smile of actual triumph nothing would keep me at home she said i shall drive through the town and back again do you think i will let them fancy that i am afraid of them youre not afraid he said almost in a whisper i afraid she answered i wait here she added she left the room and in less than ten minutes returned he had never before seen in her the fire he saw then there was a spark of light in her eyes a color on her cheek she had chosen her dress with distinct care for its luxurious richness his exclamation as she entered buttoning her long delicate glove was a repressed oath he exulted in her his fear for her was gone and only this exultation remained youve made up your mind to that he said he wanted to make her say more i am going to see your mother she answered that will take me outside of the town then i shall drive back againslowly they shall understand me at least she let him lead her out to the carriage which by this time was waiting after she was seated in it she bent forward and spoke to him tell my father where i am going and why she said chapter xxviii a speech when he returned to the works the noonbell was ringing and the hands were crowding through the gates on their way to their midday meal among those going out he met floxham who spoke to him as he passed theers some o them chaps he said as wunnot show their faces again aye said haworth i see that ffrench had left the bank and was pacing up and down his room panicstricken what have you heard he exclaimed turning as haworth entered is itis it as bad as you expected aye said haworth worse and better too better he faltered haworth flung himself into a chair he wore a look of dogged triumph leave em to me he answered im in th mood fur em now but it was not until some time afterward that he delivered the message rachel ffrench had intrusted to him on hearing it her father appeared to rally a little it seems a rather dangerous thing to do he said butit is like her and perhaps after all there is something inin showing no fear and for a few moments after having thought the incident over he became comparatively sanguine and cheerful as floxham had predicted when the workbell called the hands together again there were still other places vacant mr briarley it may be observed had been absent all day and by this time was listening with affectionate interest and spasmodic attacks of inopportune enthusiasm to various inflammatory speeches which were being made at a beer house toward evening the work lagged so that the overlookers could no longer keep up the semblance of ignorance a kind of gloom settled upon them also and they went about with depressed faces itll be all up tomorrow said one if theres nothing done but something was done suddenlyjust before time for the last bell to ringhaworth appeared at the door of the principal room lads he shouted them on you as wants a speech from jem haworth gather in th yard in five minutes from now there was no more work done the bell began to ring implements were thrown down and a shout went up from the crowd then there was a rush into the yard and in less than the five minutes the outpouring of the place thronged about its chief doorway where jem haworth stood on the topmost step looking down facing them all boldlywith the air of a man who felt his victory more than half won lets hear what thast getten to say cried some one well hidden by the crowd out wi it its not much haworth shouted back its this to start with im here to find out where you chaps stand but there was no answer to this he knew there would be none and went on ive been through th place this morning he said and through th town and i know how th wind blows as well as any on you th lads at marfort and molton and dillup are on th strike theres a bad lookout in many a place besides them theres a lot of fools laying in beer and making speeches down in broxton there were some here this morning as didnt show this afternoon how many on yous going to follow them then there was a murmur which was not easy to understand it was a mixture of sounds defiant and conciliatory haworth moved forward he knew them better than they knew him im not one o the model soart he called out ive not set up soup kitchens nor given you flannel petticoats ive looked sharp after you and i should have been a fool if i hadnt ive let you alone out of work hours and ive not grudged you your sprees when they didnt stand in my way ive done the square thing by you and ive done it by myself th places ive built let no water in and i let em to you as easy as i could and make no loss i didnt build em for benevolent purposes but ive not heard one of you chaps complain of em yet ive given you your dues and stood by youand ill do it again by there was a silencea significant breathless one have i done it he said or havent i suddenly the silence was broken aye there was a shout aye lad yo ha then he shouted them as jem haworth has stood by let em stand by jem haworth and he struck his big fist upon his open palm with a fierce blow and stood before them breathing hard he had the best metal on his side somehow and the best metal carried the day the boldness of his move the fact that he had not waited but had taken the lead were things all for him even those who wavered toward the enemy were stirred to something like admiration but what about th union said a timorous voice in the rear theerll be trouble with th unions as sure as we stand out mester haworth made a movement none of them understood he put his hand behind him and drew from his hippocket an object which caused every man of them to give a little start and gasp they were used to simple and always convenient modes of defense the little object he produced would not have startled an american but it startled a lancashire audience it was of shining steel and rosewood and its bright barrels glittered significantly he held it out and patted it lightly thats for the union lads he said and more like it a few of the black sheep moved restlessly and with manifest tremor this was a new aspect of affairs one of them suddenly cried out with much feebleness ththree cheers for haworth let the chaps as are on the other side go to their lot now said haworth but no one moved theres some here thatll go when th time comes he announced let em tell what theyve heard now lads the rest on you up with your hands the whole place was in a tumult they held up their hands and clenched and shook them and shouted and here and there swore with fluency and enthusiasm there were not six among them who were not fired with the general friendly excitement tomorrow morning therell be papers posted up writ in jem haworths hand and signed with his name cried haworth read em as you come along lads and when you reach here ill be ready for you is it about th pistols faltered the timorous voice aye haworth answered about th pistols now go home he turned to mount the step flushed and breathing fast and with highbeating pulses when suddenly he stopped before the iron gate a carriage had stopped a servant in livery got down and opened the door and rachel ffrench stepped out the hands checked their shouting to look at her she came up the yard slowly and with the setting sun shining upon her it was natural that they should gaze at her as she approached though she did not look at any of themonly at haworth who waited they made a pathway for her and she passed through it and went up the step her rich dress touched more than one man as she swept by i thought they heard her say that i would call for my father then for the first time she looked at the men she turned at the top of the step and looked downthe sun on her dress and face there was not a man among them who did not feel the look at first a murmur arose and then an incoherent cry and then a shout and they threw up their caps and shouted until they were hoarse in the midst of it she turned aside and went in with a smile on her lips in haworths room they found her father standing behind the door with a startled air what are they shouting for he asked what is the matter now i think i am the matter miss ffrench answered though i scarcely know why ah giving him a quiet glance you are afraid chapter xxix sararann the next morning there was an uproar in the town the strikers from molton and marfort no longer remained in the shade they presented themselves openly to the community in their true characters at first they lounged about in groups at the corners and before the alehouses smoking talking gesticulating or wearing sullen faces but this negative state of affairs did not last long by eight oclock the discovery was made that something had happened in the night in a score of prominent placeson walls and poststhere appeared papers upon which was written in a large bold hand the following announcement haworths lads will stand by him the chaps that have aught to say against this let them remember that to every man theres six barrels well loaded and to jem haworth twelve those that want their brass out of broxton bank let them come and get it writ and signed by jem haworth the first man who saw it swore aloud and ran to call others soon a select party stood before the place on which the card was posted confronting it in different moods some were scientifically profane some raged loudly some were silent one or two grinned he staid up aw neet to do that theer remarked one of these hes getten a gizzard o his own has haworth hes done it wi his own hands one gentleman neither grinned nor swore his countenance fell with singular rapidity this was mr briarley who had come up in the rear he held in one hand a pewter pot which was half empty he had caught it up in the heat of the moment from the table at which he had been sitting when the news came whats in th barrils he inquired the man he spoke to turned to him roughly powder he answered an lead tha domned foo mr briarley looked at his mug regretfully i thowt he said as happen it mought ha bin beer having reflected a moment he was on the point of raising the mug to his lips when a thought struck him he stopped short whats he goin to do wi em he quavered ax him was the grim answer ax him lad he dunnot say he is na in manifest trepidation he is nagoin toto fire em off hell fire em off if he comes across thee was the reply mak sure o that an i should na blame him neyther mr briarley reflected again for a few secondsreflected deeply then he moved aside a little i hannot seen sararann sin yesterday he said softly nor yet janey nor yetth owd missus ii mun go and see em haworth kept his word the next day there was not a man who went to and from the works who could not have defended himself if he had been attacked but no one was attacked his course was one so unheard of so unexpected that it produced a shock there was a lull in the movement at least the number of his enemies increased and were more violent but they were forced to content themselves with violence of speech somehow it scarcely seemed safe to use ordinary measures against jem haworth he slept in his room at the works and shared watches with the force he had on guard he drove through the town boldly and carried a grim alert face he was here and there and everywhere in the works going from room to room at the bank ready for emergencies when this heres over he said ill give you chaps a spree you wont get over in a bit by george those who presented themselves at the bank the morning the placards were to be seen got their money by noon the number arriving diminished perceptibly in a day or two a few came back and would have handed over their savings again willingly but the bank refused to take them carry it to manchester were haworths words theyll take it therei wont those of his hands who had deserted him came out of their respective sprees in a weeks time with chopfallen countenances they had not gained anything and were somehow not in great favor among the outside strikers in their most pronounced moods they had been neither useful nor ornamental to their party they were not eloquent nor even violent they were simply idle vagabonds who were no great loss to haworth and no great gain to his enemies in their own families they were in deep and dire disgrace and loud were the ratings they received from their feminine relatives the lot of mr briarley was melancholy indeed among the malcontents his portion was derision and contumely at home he was received with bewailings and scathing severity an that theer was what tha wur up to was it cried mrs briarley the day he found himself compelled by circumstances to reveal the true state of affairs thast jined th strikers has tha aye sararann ive jined emanan were gon to set things straight bless yothats what were goin to do wewere goin to bring the mesters down a bit anan get our dues thats what were goin to do sararann it was dinnertime and in the yard and about the street at the front the young members of the family disported themselves with vigor without janey and the baby who were in the house there were ten of them mrs briarley went to the door and called them housed to frantic demonstrations of joy by the immediate prospect of dinner they appeared in a body tumbling over one another shrieking filling the room to overflowing generally they were disposed of in relays for convenience sake it was some time since mr briarley had beheld the whole array he sat upright and stared at them mrs briarley sat down confronting him what art tha goin to do wi them while tha bring th mesters down she inquired mr briarley regarded the assembly with naive bewilderment a natural depression of spirit set in theertheer seems a good many on em sararann he said with an air of meek protestation they seem to hato ha cumylated theers twelve on em answered mrs briarley dryly an theyve aw getten mouths as tha sees an their feythers goin to bring th mesters down a bit twelve pairs of eyes stolidly regarded their immediate progenitor as if desirous of discovering his intentions mr briarley was embarrassed sararann he faltered send em out to play em send em out into th open air its good fur em th open air is an they set a mon back mrs briarley burst into lamentations covering her face with her apron and rocking to and fro aye cried she send em out in th airhappen theyll fatten on it its aw theyll get poor childer let em mak th most on it in these days haworth was more of a lion than ever he might have dined in state with a social potentate each day if he had been so minded the bolder spirits visited him at the works and would have had him talk the matter over but he was in the humor for neither festivities nor talk he knew what foundation his safety rested upon and spent many a sleepless and feverish night he was bitter enough at heart against those he had temporarily baffled wait till thart out o th woods he said to ffrench when he was betrayed into expressing his sense of relief oddly enough the feeling against ffrench was disproportionately violent he was regarded as an alien and a usurper of the rights of others there existed a large disgust for his gentle birth and breeding and a sardonic contempt for his incapacity and lack of experience he had no prestige of success and daring he had not shown himself in the hour of danger he took all and gave nothing i should not be surprised said miss ffrench to murdoch if we have trouble yet chapter xxx mrs haworth and granny dixon about this time a change appeared in little mrs haworth sometimes when they sat together haworth found himself looking up suddenly and feeling that her eyes were fixed upon him and at such times she invariably met his glance with a timid startled expression and released herself from it as soon as she had the power she had never been so tender and lavish with her innocent caresses but there was continuously a tremulous watchfulness in her manner which was almost suggestive of fear it was not fear of him however she clung to him with all the strength of her love at night when he returned home however late he was sure of finding her waiting patiently for him and in the morning when he left the house he was never so early that she was not at his service the man began to quail before her and grow restless in secret and be haunted when he awakened in the night by his remembrance of her she is on the lookout for something he said to himself fearfully what have they been saying to her on her part when she sat alone she used to try and think the matter out and set it straight and account for it its the strikes she said as has set them agen him and made em hard an forgetful of all hes done theyd never have spoke so if theyd been theirselves she could scarcely have told what she had heard or how the first blow had struck home she only knew that here and there she had heard at first a rough jeer and then a terrible outspoken story which in spite of her disbelief filled her with dread the man who first flung the illfavored story at her stopped halfway through it the words dying on his lips at the sight of her face it happened in one of her pensioners cottages and she rose from her chair trembling i didnt think she said with unconscious pathos as the world could be so ignorant and wicked but as the illfeeling became more violent she met with the same story again and again and often with new and worse versions in forms she could not combat she began to be haunted by vague memories of things she had not comprehended a sense of pain followed her she was afraid at times to go to the cottages lest she should be confronted with something which would overwhelm her then she began to search her sons face with a sense of finding some strangeness in it she watched him wistfully when he had so far forgotten her presence as to be almost unaware of it one night having thrown himself upon a sofa and fallen into a weary sleep he suddenly started up from it to find her standing close by him looking down her face pale her locked fingers moving nervously what is it he exclaimed what ails you he was startled by her falling upon her knees at his side crying and laying her shaking hand upon his shoulder you was having a bad dream my dear she saida bad dream ii scarcely knowed your face jemit was so altered he sank back upon his cushions and stared at her he knew he had been having no bad dream his dreams were not half so evil and bitter when he slept as they were in these days when he wakened you always had such a good face jem she said and such a kind one when you was a boy he stopped her almost sullenly im not a boy now he said thats put away and done with no she answered thats true my dear but youve lived an innocent life anan never done no wrongno more than you did when you was one and your face was so altered her voice died away into a silence which somehow neither of them could break it was granny dixon who revealed the truth in its barest form perhaps no man nor woman in broxton knew more of it than this respectable ancient matron haworth and his iniquities had been the spice of her later life the fact that his name was being mentioned in a conversation never escaped her she discovered it as if by magic and invariably commanded that the incident under discussion be repeated at the top of the reciters voice for her benefit occasionally somewhat to the confusion of the honest matron in question how it had happened that she had not betrayed all to mrs haworth at once was a mystery to remain unsolved during the little womans visits to the cottage mrs briarley existed in a chronic condition of fear and trembling shell be out wi it some o these days mark me she would quaver to janey an th lord knows i would na be theer fur nowt when she does but she did not do it at first mrs briarley had a secret conviction that the fact that she did not do so was due entirely to iniquity she had seen her sit peering from under her brows at their guest as the simple creature poured forth her loving praise of her son and at such times it was always mrs briarleys province to repeat the conversation for her benefit aye mrs dixon would comment with an evil smile thats him thats haworth hes a noice chapis haworth i know him mrs haworth learned in time to fear her and to speak timidly in her presence rarely referring to the subject of her boys benefactions only as it wouldnt be natral she said once to mrs briarley i should think she was set agen him eh bless us was mrs briarleys answer yo need na moind her shes set agen ivverybody shes th nowtest owd piece i christendom a few days after haworth had awakened to find his mother standing near him mrs haworth paid a visit to the briarleys she took with her a basket which the poor of broxton had long since learned to know in this case it contained stockings for the little briarleys and a dress or so for the baby when she had bestowed her gifts and seated herself she turned to granny dixon with some tremor of manner i hope youre well maam she said granny dixon made no reply she sat bent over in her chair regarding her for a few seconds with unblinking gaze then she slowly pointed with her thin crooked finger to the little presents he sent em did he she trumpeted forth haworth mrs haworth quailed before her yes maam she answered leastways granny dixon stopped her he did nowt o th soart she cried thart leein the little woman made an effort to rise turned pale and sat down again maam she began granny dixons eyes sparkled thart leein she repeated hes th worst chap i england and aw broxton knows it her victim uttered a low cry of pain mrs briarley had left the room and there was no one to help her all the hints and jeers she had heard rushed back to her but she struggled to stand up against them it aint true she said it ainttrue granny dixon was just beginning to enjoy herself a difference of opinion with mrs briarley which had occurred a short time before had prepared her for the occasion she knew that nothing would so much demoralize her relative and hostess as this iniquitous outbreak theyve been warnin me to keep quiet an not tell thee she answered but i towd em id tell thee when i wur i th humor an im i th humor now will ffrench wur a devil but hes a bigger one yet he kep thee away because he did na want thee to know he set aw th place by th ears a decent woman would na cross his doorstep nor a decent mon fur aw his brassafore tha coom th lot as he used to ha down fro lunnon an manchester wur a shame to th town ive seed emwomen in paint an feathers an men as decent lasses hide fro a good un wur he aye he wur a good un for sure she sat and chuckled a moment thinking of sararanns coming terror and confusion she had no objection to haworths moral lapses herself but she meant to make the most of them while she was at it she saw nothing of the anguish in the face from which all the fresh almost girlish color had faded an yo did na know as they wur na gentlefolk she proclaimed again tha thowt they wur ladies an gentlemen when tha coom in on em th fust night tha set foot i th house a noice batch o ladies they wur an he passed em off on thee he wur sharp enow fur that trust him ladies bless us i heard tell on itan so did aw broxton the wounded creature gathered all her strength to rise from her chair she stood pressing her hands against her heart swaying and deadly pale he has been a good son to me she said a good sonan i cant believe it you wouldnt yourself ifyou was his mother an knew him asas i do she made her way to the door just as mrs briarley came in one glance told that excellent matron that the longdreaded calamity had arrived whats she been up to she demanded lord ha mercy whats she been up to now shes been tellin me faltered the departing guest that my sons a bad man an a shame to me let me go maamfor ive never heard talk like this beforean its made me a bit weak anqueer and she slipped past and was gone mrs briarleys patience deserted her a full sense of what granny dixons worst might be burst in upon her a remembrance of her own manifold wrongs and humiliations added itself to this sense for the moment discretion ceased to appear the better part of valor what has tha been sayin she cried what has tha been sayin out wi it ive been telling her what tha wur afeared to tell her chuckled mrs dixon with exultation i towd thee i would an ive done it mrs briarley made no more ado she set the baby down upon an adjacent chair with a resonant sound and then fell upon the miserable old woman and seizing her by the shoulders shook her until her cap flew off and danced upon her back and her mouth opened and shut as if worked by a spring tha brazent hardhearted besom tha she cried as she shook tha illfarrant nowt tha as nivver did no good i thy days an canna bear as no one else should i dunnot care if i nivver see thy brass as long as i live if tha wur noine istead o ninetyfive id give thee a hidin tha brazent hardhearted owd piece her strength failed her and she loosened her hold and sat down and wept aloud behind the baby and mrs dixon fell back in her chair an unpleasant heap without breath to speak a word or strength to do anything but clutch wildly at her cap and so remained shrunken and staring chapter xxxi haworths defender mrs haworth made her way along the streets with weak and lagging steps she had been a brisk walker in the days of her country life and even now was fonder of going here and there on foot than of riding in state as her son would have preferred but now the way before her seemed long she knew where she was going theres one of em as knows an will tell me she said to herself she cant have no cruel feeling against him bein a lady an knowin him so well an if its truenot as i believe it jem my dear for i dontshell break it to me gentle not as i believe jem my dear for i dont she said to herself again and again her mind went back to the first hour of his life when he lay a stronglimbed child on her weak arm the one comfort given to her out of her wretched marriage she thought of him again as a lad growing and thriving in spite of hunger and cold growing and thriving in spite of cruelty and wrong which broke her health and threw her helpless upon charity he had been sharper and bolder than other boys and always steadfast to his determination he was always good to me she said child an man hes never forgot me or been unmindful if thered have been wrong in his life whod have been liker to see it than me it was to rachel ffrench she was going and when at last she reached the end of her journey and was walking up the pathway to the house rachel ffrench who stood at the window saw her and was moved to wonder by her pallor and feebleness the spring sunshine was so bright outside that the room seemed quite dark when she came into it and even after she had seated herself the only light in it seemed to emanate from the figure of miss ffrench herself who stood opposite her in a dress of some thin white stuff and with strongly fragrant yellow hyacinths at her neck and in her hand you are tired she said you should not have walked the woman looked up at her timidly it isnt that she answered its somethin else she suddenly stretched forth her hands into the light ive come here to hear about my boy she said i want to hear from one as knows the truth anwill tell me miss ffrench was not of a sympathetic nature few young women possessed more nerve and selfpoise at trying times and she had not at any previous period been specially touched by mrs haworth but just now she was singularly distressed what do you want to know she asked that i can tell you she was not prepared for what happened next and lost a little placidity through it the simple loving creature fell at her feet and caught hold of her dress sobbing hes thirtythree years old she cried an ive never seen the day when hes give me a hurt hes been the pride of my life an the hope of it ive looked up to him and prayed for him an believed in himan they say hes black with shameful sinan i dont know him nor never did for hes deceived me from first to last the yellow hyacinths fell from miss ffrenchs hand on the carpet and she looked down at them instead of at the upturned face who said it she asked but she was not answered if its truenot that i believe it for i dontif its true what is there left for me as loved and honored himwheres my son as paid me for all i bore hes never beenhes never been at all ive never been his mother nor hes never been my son if its truenot as i believe it for i dontwhere is he miss ffrench bent down and picked up her hyacinths she wondered as she bent down what her reply would be will you believe me she asked as she rose up again yes maam she was answered i know i may do itthank god yes you may said miss ffrench without flinching in the least i can have no feeling for or against him i can have no end to serve one way or the other it is not true it is a lie he is all you have believed she helped her to rise and made her sit down again in an easychair and then herself withdrew a little and stood leaning against the window looking at her he has done more good in broxton than any other man who lives she said he has made it what it is the people who hate him and speak ill of him are those he has benefited most it is the way of their class i have heard before and now i believe it to be true they have said worse things of men who deserve them as little as he does he has enemies whom he has conquered and they will never forgive him she discovered a good many things to say having once begun and she actually found a kind of epicurean enjoyment in saying them in a manner the most telling she always liked to do a thing very well but notwithstanding this the time seemed rather long before she was left alone to think the matter over before she had said many words her visitor was another woman lifes color came back to her and she sat crying softly tears of sheer joy and relief i knowed it couldnt be true she said i knowed it an oh thank you maam with all a mothers heart to think she said smiling and sobbing as i should have been so wicked as to let it weigh on me when i knowed so well as it couldnt never be i should be almost shamed to look him in the face if i didnt know how good he was an how ready hed be to forgive me when at last she was gone miss ffrench threw herself into the chair she had left rather languidly she was positively tired as she did so she heard a sound she rose hastily and turned toward the foldingdoors leading into the adjoining room they had been partially closed and as she turned they were pushed aside and some one came through them it was jem haworth he was haggard and disheveled and as he approached her he walked unsteadily i was in there through it all he said and i heard every word she was herself again at once she knew she had not been herself ten minutes before well she said he came up and stood near herand almost abject tremor upon him will you listen to what i have got to say he said she made a cold gesture of assent if shed gone to some and heard what they had to tell he said it would have killed her its well she came here she saw the dark color rush to his face and knew what was coming its all true by he burst out every word of it when i was in there he went on with a gesture toward the other room i swore id tell you make the best and the worst of it its all truethat and more he sat down in a chair and rested his forehead on his hands things has begun to go agen me he said they never did before ive been used to tell myself there was a kind of luck in keeping it hid from her th day it comes on her full force im done for i said in there you should know at least its all true i knew it was true remarked miss ffrench all the time you knew he cried out you i have known it from the first she answered did you think it was a secret he turned hot and cold as he looked at her then by george youd a reason for saying what you did what was it she remained silent looking out of the open window across the flowerbright garden she watched a couple of yellow butterflies eddying above a purple hyacinth for several seconds before she spoke and then did so slowly and absently i dont know the reason she said it was a strange thing for me to do it wasnt to save me aught he returned thats plain enough no she answered it was not to save you i am not given to pitying people but i think that for the time i wanted to save her it was a strange thing she said softly for me to do chapter xxxii christian murdoch christian had never spoken to murdoch openly of his secret labor he was always aware that she knew and understood he had seen her knowledge in her face almost from the first but they had exchanged no words on the subject he had never wavered from his resolve since he had made it whatever his tasks had been in the day or however late his return was at night he did not rest until he had given a certain number of hours to this work often christian and his mother wakening long after midnight heard him moving about in his closed room he grew gaunt and holloweyed but he did not speak of what he was doing and they never knew whether he was hopeful or despairing without seeing very much of the two women he still found himself led to think of them constantly he was vaguely conscious that since their interview in the graveyard he had never felt free from christian murdoch more than once her mothers words came back to him with startling force she sits and looks on and says nothing she asks nothing but her eyes force me to speak he knew that she was constantly watching him often he looked up and met her glance and somehow it was always a kind of shock to him he knew that she was wondering and asking herself questions she could not ask him if i gave it up or flagged he told himself she would know without my saying a word there had grown in her a beauty of a dark foreign type the delicate olive of her skin and the dense blackness of her eyes and hair caused her to be considered a novelty worth commenting upon by the men of broxton society which was of a highly critical nature she went out a great deal as the spring advanced and began to know the place and people better she developed a pathetic eagerness to make friends and understand those around her one day she went alone to broxton chapel and after sitting through one of mr hixons most sulphurous sermons came home in a brooding mood why did you go murdoch was roused to ask i thought she answered it might make me better i thought i would try not long afterward when he had gone out of the house and she was left sitting with mrs murdoch she suddenly looked up from the carpet on which her eyes had been fixed and asked her a question is it true that i am beginning to be very handsome she demanded yes mrs murdoch answered it is true a dark cloud settled upon her face and her eyes fell again i heard some men in the street speak aloud to each other about it she said do they speak so of all women who are handsome i dont know her companion replied surveying her critically and with some anxiety they used to speak so ofher she said slowly she was a beautiful woman they were always telling her of it again and again and i used to go and look at myself in the glass and be glad that i was thin and dark and ugly and that they laughed at me i wanted to be hideous once when i was a child a man said never mind she will be a beauty some daylike her mother and i flew at him and struck him and then i ran away to my room and fell down upon my knees and said the first prayer i ever said in my life i said o godif there is a godstrike me dead o godif there is a godstrike me dead the woman who listened shuddered am i likeanybody she said next i do not know was the answer i could not tell myself if i were she said i have watched for it for so long that i should not see it if it had come i look every day perhaps i am and do not know perhaps that is why they look at me in the street and speak of me loud as i go by her voice fell into a whisper she threw herself upon her knees and laid her head upon the womans lap cover me with your arms she said cover me so that you may not see my face she was constantly moved to these strange outbursts of feeling in these days a few nights later as he sat at work after midnight murdoch fancied that he heard a sound outside his door he went to it and opened it and found himself confronting the girl as she sat crouched upon the lowest step of the stairway what are you doing here he asked i could not go to sleep she answered i could not stop thinking of what you were doing it seemed as if i should have a little share in it if i were here are youalmost timidlyare you tired yes he answered i am tired are youany nearer sometimes i think sobut so did he she rose slowly i will go away she said it would only disturb you to know i was here she moved a step upward and then paused uncertainly you told me once she said that there was no reason why i should not be as good and happy as any other woman are you sure of what you said for gods sake do not doubt in that way he said she stood looking down at him one hand resting upon the balustrade her dark eyes wild with some strange emotion i lie awake at night a great deal she said and i am always thinking of what has gone by sometimeslatelyi have wished thati had forgiven her i have wished so too he answered i know that she returned but i did not and it is too late everything is over for her and it is too late for a long time i was glad but nowi suppose i am repenting she did not repent she suffered but she did not repent i think i am repenting when he returned to his room he found he could not settle down to work again he walked up and down restlessly for some time and at last threw himself upon the bed and lay wide awake thinking in the darkness it always cost him a struggle to shut out the world and life and concentrate himself upon his labor in those days a year before it would have been different now there was always a battle to be fought there were dreams to be held at bay and memories which his youth and passion made overwhelming forces but tonight somehow it was christian murdoch who disturbed him there had been a terrible wistfulness in her voicea wistfulness mingled with longrepressed fear which had touched him more than all and so when sleep came to him it happened that her figure stood out alone from all others before him and was his last thought among those whom christian murdoch learned to know was janey briarley she saw her first in the streets and again in mrs murdochs kitchen where she occasionally presented herself attired in the huge apron to assist in a professional capacity upon cleanin days the baby having learned to walk and mr briarley being still an inactive member of the household it fell upon janey and her mother to endeavor to add by such efforts as lay in their power to their means for providing for the eleven with the assistance of the apron janey was enabled to make herself generally useful upon all active occasions hoos a little thing but hoos a sharp un mrs briarley was wont to say hoo can work like a woman i dunnot know what id ha done wiout her yo try her missus an see she spent each saturday afternoon in mrs murdochs kitchen and it was not long before christian drifted into an acquaintance with her the first time she saw her on her knees before the fireplace surrounded by blacklead brushes bathbrick and pipeclay and vigorously polishing the fender she stopped short to look at her how old are you she asked after a little while im twelve goin on thirteen was the reply without any cessation of the rubbing the girl leaned against the side of the mantel and surveyed her critically you dont look that old she said aye but i do returned the child i tha looks at my face im stunted wi nussin thats what maks me so little she gave her face a sharp turn upward that it might be seen ive had enow to mak me look owd i con tell thee she remarked the interest she saw in her countenance inspired her she became comparatively garrulous upon the subject of the family anxieties feyther figured in his usual unenviable role and granny dixon was presented in strong colors but finally she pulled herself up and changed the subject with startling suddenness ive seed thee mony a toime afore she said an ive heerd folk talk about thee i nivver heerd him say owt about thee though whom do you mean asked christian with a little frown mester murdoch we used to see a good deal on him at th start but we dunnot see him so often i these days hes getten other places to go to th quality mak a good deal on him she paused and sat up polishing brush in hand i dunnot wonder as they say yore hansome she volunteered who says so coldly th men in th works an th foak as sees yo i th street some on em says youre hansomer than heran thats sayin a good bit yo know her is miss ffrench aye yo dunnot dress as foine an yore darkskinned but theers summat noice about yo i dunnot wonder as they say yore hansome never mind talking about that tell me about something else the termination of the interview left them on sufficiently good terms janey went home with a story to tell shes crossed th seas she said an lived i furrin parts shes getten queer ways an she stares at a bodybut i loike her fur aw that been i furrin parts exclaimed mrs briarley bless us no wonder th poor things a bit heathenish hast tha ivver seed her at chapel jane ann the fact that she had not been seen at chapel awakened grave misgivings as to the possible presence of popery and the scarlet woman which objectionable female figured largely and in most unpleasant guise in the discourses of brother hixon theers no knowin what th poor lass has been browt up to said the good matron livin reet under th popes nose an nivver darin to say her souls her own i nivver had no notion o them furrin parts mysen gie me lancashire but the next week the girl made her visit to the chapel and sat throughout the sermon with her steadfast black eyes fixed upon the reverend mr hixon once during a moment of inflammatory eloquence that gentleman suddenly becoming conscious of her gaze stopped with a start and with difficulty regained his equilibrium though christian did not flinch at all or seem to observe his alarm and confusion she cultivated janey with an odd persistence after this she asked her questions concerning her life and experiences and always seemed to find her interesting often janey was conscious of the fact that she stood and looked at her for some time with an air of curiosity do you she asked her suddenly one day do you believe all that man says to you janey started into a sitting posture as was her custom when roused in the midst of her labors eh bless us yes she exclaimed dunnot yo no recollections of the scarlet woman flashed across her young hearers mind art tha a papist she gasped nonot yet art tha janey asked breathlesslyart tha goin to be i dont know an thatha does na believe what mester hixon says nonot yet what does tha believe she stared up at the dark young face aghast it was quite unmoved the girls eyes were fixed on space nothing wheerwheer does tha expect to go when tha dees i dont know she said coldly very often i dont care janey dropped her brush and forgot to pick it up why bless thee she exclaimed with some sharpness and also with the manner of one presenting the only practical solution of a difficulty thalt go to hell i tha does na repent the girl turned her eyes upon her does it all depend on that she demanded aye to be sure she replied testily does na tha know that then said christian slowly i shall not go to hell for i am repenting and she turned about and walked away chapter xxxiii a seed sown there had been as it seemed a lull in the storm the idlers did not come over from molton and dillup as often as at first the strikes had extended until they were in full blast throughout the country but haworths so far had held its own haworth himself was regarded as a kind of demigod he might have done almost anything he pleased it was a source of some surprise to his admirers that he chose to do so little and showed no elation one or two observing outsiders saw that his struggle had left its mark upon him there were deep lines in his face he had lost flesh and something of his air of bravado at times he was almost haggard as things became quieter he began to take sudden mysterious journeys to london and manchester and various other towns ffrench did not know why he went in fact ffrench knew very little of him but that his humors were frequently trying and always more morose after such absences he himself had alternately blown hot and cold of late the fruit of his efforts had rather the flavor of ashes he was of even less importance than before in the works and he continually heard unpleasant comments and reports outside as surely as his spirits rose to a jubilant height some untoward circumstance occurred to dash them i should have thought he said fretfully to his daughter that as a broxton man andand a gentleman the people would have been with me but they are not no said miss ffrench they are not she knew far more than he did himself she was in the habit of not allowing any sign to escape her when she took her frequent drives she kept her eyes open to all that happened if they dared there are a good many of them who would be insolent to me why should they not dare asked her father with increased irritation because they know i am not afraid of thembecause i set them at defiance and for another reason the other reason which she did not state had nothing to do with their daring it was the strong one that in the splendor of her beauty she had her greatest power ordinary womanhood would scarcely in itself have appealed to the chivalric sentiment of broxton molton and dillup but rachel ffrench driving slowly through the streets and past the beerhouse doors and turning her perfect unmoved face for criticism to the crowd collected thereat created a natural diversion those who had previously been in a sarcastic mood lapsed into silence the most inveterate bacco consumers took their pipes out of their mouths feeling it necessary to suspend all action that they might look after her with a clearer appreciation they were neither touched nor softened but they were certainly roused to an active admiration which after a manner held them in check theer is na another loike her i england was once remarked rather sullenly by one not i england let aloan lancashirean be domd to herthis last added with a shade of delicate significance but there was one man who saw her with eyes different from the rest if he had not so seen her existence would have been another matter he seemed to live a simple monotonous life he held his place in the works and did well what he had to do he was not very thoroughly understood by his fellows but there existed a vague feeling of respect for him among them they had become used to his silence and absentmindedness and the tasks which seemed to them eccentricities his responsibilities had increased but he shouldered them without making any fuss and worked among the rest just as he had been wont to do when he had been floxhams right hand in the engineroom in more select circles he was regarded somewhat to his distaste with no inconsiderable interest he was talked of privately as a young man with a future before him though the idea of what that future was to be being gathered from ffrench was somewhat indefinite his own reserve upon the subject was rather resented but still was forgiven on the score of eccentricity for the rest he lived as it were in a dream the days came and went but at the close of each there were at least a few hours of happiness and yet it was not happiness of a very tangible form sometimes when he left the house and stepped into the cool darkness of the night outside he found himself stopped for a moment with a sense of bewilderment haworth who sat talking to his partner and following rachel ffrenchs figure with devouring eyes had gained as much as he himself she had not spoken often perhaps and had turned from one to the other with the same glance and tone but one man left her with anger and misery in his breast and the other wondered at his own rapture i have done nothing and gained nothing he would often say to himself as he sat at the worktable afterward buti am madly happy and then he would lie forward with his head upon his folded arms going over the incidents of the night again and againliving the seconds over one by one haworth watched him closely in these days as he passed him on his way to his workroom he would look up and follow him with a glance until he turned in at its door he found ways of hearing of his life outside and of his doings in the works one morning as he was driving down the road toward the town he saw in the distance the graceful figure of mr briarley who was slouching along in the somewhat muddled condition consequent upon the excitement of an agreeably convivial evening at the whod ha thowt it he gave him a critical glance and the next moment whipped up his horse uttering an exclamation theres th chap he said by th lord harry in a few seconds more he pulled up alongside of him stop a bit lad he said mr briarley hesitated and then obeyed with some suddenness a delicately suggestive recollection of th barrels induced him to do so he ducked his head with a feeble smile whose effect was somewhat obscured by a temporary cloud of natural embarrassment he had not been brought into immediate contact with haworth since the strikes began th same he faltered with illusive cheerfulnessth same to yo anan mony on em then he paused and stood holding his hat in his hand endeavoring painfully to preserve the smile in all its pristine beauty of expression haworth leaned forward in his gig youre a nice chap he said youre a nice chap a general vague condition of mind betrayed mr briarley into the momentary weakness of receiving this compliment literally he brightened perceptibly and his countenance became suffused with the roseate blush of manly modesty my best days is ower he replied ive been misforchnit mesterbut theer wur a toime as th opposite sect ha said th samethough that theers a thing reflecting deeply and shaking his head as i nivver remoind sararann on the next moment he fell back in some trepidation haworth looked down at him coolly youre a pretty chap he said goin on th strike an leaving your wife and children to starve at home while you lay in your beer and make an ass of yourself eh exclaimed mr briarley and make an ass of yourself repeated haworth unmovedly youd better be drawin your wages my lad mr briarleys expression changed from bewilderment he passed into comparative gloom it is na drawin em ive getten owt agen he remarked it is na drawin em its earnin eman hain em took away anan spent i luxuriesberryinclubs an th loike brass as ud buy th nessycerries if wed left you alone said haworth where would your wife and children be now you scoundrel whos fed em and clothed em while youve been on th spree jem haworth blast youjem haworth he put his hand in his pocket and drawing forth a few jingling silver coins tossed them to him take these he said an go an spend em on th nessycerries as you call em youll do it i know well enow youll be in a worse box than you are now before long well have done with you chaps when murdochs finished the job hes got on hand whats that faltered briarley i ha na heerd on it haworth laughed and picked up his whip and reins ask him he answered he can tell you better than i can hes at work on a thing thatll set the masters a good bit freer than they are now thats all i know there wont be any need o so many o you lads youll have to make your brass out of a new trade he bent a little to settle a strap go and tell the rest on em he said youll do it when youre drunk enow i dare say briarley fumbled with his coins his air became speculative what are you thinkin on demanded haworth its a bad lookout isnt it mr briarley drew a step nearer the gigs side he appeared somewhat pale and spoke in a whisper muddled as he was he had an idea or so left itll be a bad lookout for him he said bless yo theyd tear him to pieces theyre in th humor for it theyve been carryin a grudge so long theyre ready fur owt theyve nivver thowt mich o him though but start em on that an they wouldnt leave a shred o it togethernor a shred o him eyther if they got the chance haworth laughed again wouldnt they he said let em try hed have plenty to stand by him th masters are on his side my lad he touched his horse and it began to move suddenly he checked it and looked back speaking again keep it to yourself then he said if theres danger and keep my name out of it by george if you want to be safe just as he drove up to the gates of the yard murdoch passed him and entered them until thensince he had left briarleyhe had not spoken he had driven rapidly on his way with a grim steady face as murdoch went by he got down from his gig and went to the horses head he stood close to it knotting the reins nor of him either he said nor of him either by chapter xxxiv a climax the same night mr briarley came home in a condition more muddled and disheveled than usual he looked as if he had been hustled about and somewhat unceremoniously treated he had lost his hat and was tremulous and excited he came in without the trifling ceremony of opening the door in fact he fell up against it and ran in and making an erratic dive at a chair sat down granny dixon who had been dozing in her usual seat was roused by the concussion and wakened and sat up glaring excitedly hes been at it again she shouted at it again hell nivver ha none o my brass to mak way wi hes been at mrs briarley turned upon her keep thy mouth shut she said the command was effective in one sense though not in another mrs dixon stopped in the midst of the word at with her mouth wide open and so sat for some seconds with the aspect of an ancient beldam ordinarily going by machinery and suddenly having had her works stopped she would probably have presented this appearance for the remainder of the evening if mrs briarley had not addressed her again shut thy mouth she said the works were set temporarily in motion and her countenance slowly resumed its natural lines she appeared to settle down all over and sink and become smaller though as she crouched nearer the fire she had rather an evil look which seemed to take its red glow into her confidence and secretly rage at it whats tha been doin mrs briarley demanded of her better half out wi it mr briarley had already fallen into his favorite position he had placed an elbow upon each knee and carefully supported his disheveled head upon his hands he had also already begun to shed tears which dropped and made disproportionately large circles upon the pipeclayed floor im a misforchnit chap he said im a misforchnit chap sararann as nivver had no luck whats tha been doin repeated mrs briarley with even greater sharpness than before out wi it nay said mr briarley that theers what ive getten mysen i trouble wi i wunnot do it again theers summat i beer he proceeded mournfully as goes agen a man he towd me not to say nowt an i did na mean to but with fresh pathos theers summat i beer as windsas winds a chap up im not mich o th speakin loine sararann but afore i knowed it i wur

theer wur too much agoin on what wur it aw about asked mrs briarley but mr briarleys voice had been gradually becoming lower and lower and his words more incoherent he was sinking into slumber when she repeated her question he awakened with a violent start im a misforchnit chap he murmured an i dunnot know scaped me sararannowin to misforchins eh remarked mrs briarley regarding him with connubial irony but tha art a graidely foo id gie summat to see a graidelier un but he was so far gone by this time that there was no prospect of a clear solution of the cause of his excitement and so she turned to granny dixon its toime fur thee to be i bed she shouted granny dixon gave a sharp stealthy move round and a sharp stealthy glance up at her idunnot want to go she quavered shrilly aye but tha does was the answer an thart goin too get up missus and singularly enough mrs dixon fumbled until she found her stick and gathering herself up and leaning upon it made her rambling way out of the room carrying her evil look with her bless us mrs briarley had said in confidence to a neighbor a few days before i wur nivver more feart i my life than when id done it an th owd besom set theer wi her cap o one side an her breath gone i did na know but id put an eend to her i nivver should ha touched her i th world if i had na been that theer upset as i did na know what i wur doin i thowt

mysterious journeys to leeds or manchester or perhaps london said ffrench i dont know where the day after was saturday and in the afternoon janey briarley presented herself to mrs murdoch at an early hour and evidently with something on her mind i mun get through wi th cleanin an go whoam soon she said th stroikers is over fro molton an dillup again theers summat up among em we dunnot know nowt about it she answered when further questioned we ony know theyre here an i a ill way about summat theyve fun out feyther hes aw upset but he dare na say nowt fur fear o th union mother thinks theyve getten summat agen ffrench does mr ffrench know that mrs murdoch asked hell know it soon enow if he does na dryly theyll noan stand back at tellin him if theyre i th humorbut hes loiker to know than not hes too feart on em not to be on th watch it was plain enough before many hours had passed that some disturbance was on foot the strikers gathered about the streets in groups or lounged here and there sullenly they were a worselooking lot than they had been at the outset idleness and illfeeling and dissipation had left their marks clothes were shabbier faces more brutal and habits plainly more vicious at one oclock mr ffrench disappeared from his room at the bank no one knew exactly how or when all the morning he had spent in vacillating between his desk and a window looking into the street there was a rumor among the clerks that he had been seen vanishing through a side door leading into a deserted little back street an hour later he appeared in the parlor in which his daughter sat he was hot and flurried and out of breath those scoundrels are in the town again he said and there is no knowing what they are up to it was an insane thing for haworth to go away at such a time by night there will be an uproar if there is an uproar said miss ffrench they will come here they know they can do nothing at the works he is always ready for them thereand they are angrier with you than they are with him there is no reason why they should be ffrench protested i took no measures against them heaven knows i think returned rachel that is the reason you have been afraid of them he colored to the roots of his hair you are saying a deuced unpleasant thing my dear he broke forth it is true she answered what would be the use in not saying it he had no reply to make the trouble was that he never had a reply to make to these deadly simple statements of hers he began to walk up and down the room the people we invited to dine with us she said will not come they will hear what is going on and will be afraid it is very stupid i wonder he faltered if murdoch will fail us he never did before no she answered he will not stay away the afternoon dragged its unpleasant length along as it passed ffrench found in every hour fresh cause for nervousness and excitement the servant who had been out brought disagreeable enough tidings the small police force of the town had its hands full in attending to its business of keeping order if we had had time to send to manchester for some assistance said mr ffrench that would have been reason enough for being attacked said rachel it would have shown them that we felt we needed protection we may need it before all is quiet again retorted her father we may she answered or we may not by night several arrests had been made and there was a good deal of disorder in the town a goodly quantity of beer had been drunk and there had been a friendly fight or so among the strikers themselves rachel left her father in the drawingroom and went upstairs to prepare for dinner when she returned an hour afterward he turned to her with an impatient start why did you dress yourself in that manner he exclaimed you said yourself our guests would not come it occurred to me she answered that we might have visitors after all but it was as she had prophesiedthe guests they had expected did not come they were discreet and wellregulated elderly people who had lived long in the manufacturing districts and had passed through little unpleasantnesses before they knew that under existing circumstances it would be wiser to remain at home than to run the risk of exposing themselves to spasmodic criticism and its results but they had visitors the dinner hour passed and they were still alone even murdoch had not come a dead silence reigned in the room ffrench was trying to read and not succeeding very well miss ffrench stood by the window looking out it was a clear night and the moon was at full it was easy to see far up the road upon whose whiteness the trees cast black shadows she was looking up this road toward the town she had been watching it steadily for some time once her father had turned to her restlessly saying why do you stand there youyou might be expecting something to happen she did not make any reply and still retained her position but about half an hour afterward she turned suddenly and spoke in a low clear tone if you are afraid you had better go away she said they are coming it was evident that she at least felt no alarm though there was a thrill of excitement in her voice mr ffrench sprang up from his seat they are coming he echoed good god what do you mean it was not necessary that she should enter into an explanation a clamor of voices in the road told its own story there were shouts and riotous cries which in a moment more were no longer outside the gates but within them an uproarious crowd of men and boys poured into the garden trampling the lawn and flowerbeds beneath their feet as they rushed and stumbled over them wheer is he they shouted bring the chap out an lets tak a look at him bring him out ffrench moved toward the door of the room and then checked by some recollection turned back again good heaven he said they are at their worst and here we are utterly alone why did haworth go away why his daughter interrupted him there is no use in your staying she said it will do no good you may go if you like there is the back way none of them are near it ii cant leave you here he stammered haworth was mad why in heavens name there is no use asking why again she replied i cannot tell you i think you had better go her icy coldness would have been a pretty hard thing to bear if he had been less terrorstricken but he saw that the hand with which she held the windowcurtain was shaking he did not know however that it was not shaking with fear but with the power of the excitement which stirred her it is scarcely possible that he would have left her notwithstanding his panic though for a second it nearly seemed that he had so far lost selfcontrol as to be wavering but as he stood pale and breathless there arose a fresh yell wheer is he bring him out murdoch th merican chap were coom to see him whats that he asked who is it they want murdoch murdoch was shouted again lets ha a word wi murdoch we lads ha summat to say to him it is not i they want he said it is murdoch it is not i at all she dashed the windowcurtain aside and turned on him he was stunned by the mere sight of her face every drop of blood seemed driven from it you are a coward she cried panting a coward it is a relief to you he stood staring at her aa relief he stammered idont understand you what is the matter she had recovered herself almost before he had begun to speak it was over in a second he had not had time to realize the situation before she was moving toward the window they shall see me she said let us see what they will have to say to me he would have stopped her but she did not pay the slightest attention to his exclamation the window was a french one opening upon a terrace she flung it backward and stepped out and stood before the rioters for a second there was not a sound they had been expecting to see a manperhaps ffrench perhaps murdoch perhaps even a representative of the small police force looking as if he felt himself one too many in the gathering or not quite enoughand here was simply a tall young woman in a dazzling dress of some rich white stuff and with something sparkling upon her hands and arms and in her highdressed blonde hair the moonlight struck full upon her and she stood in it serene and bore unmoved the stupid stare of all their eyes it was she who spoke first and then they knew her and the spell which held them dumb was broken what do you want she demanded i should like to hear then they began to shout again we want murdoch they said we ha summat to say to him he is not here she said he has not been here thats a lee remarked a gentleman on the outskirts of the crowd a domd un she made no answer and singularly enough nobody laughed why do you want him she said next we want to hear about that contrapshun o his as is goin to mak th mesters indypendent he knows what we want him fur weve just been to his house and brokken th winders hes getten wind on us comin an he made off wi th machine hell be here afore long if he is na here now an were bound to see him hell be up to see thee put in the gentleman on the outskirts an i dunnot blame him im glad i coom mysen thas worth th tripan im a dillup chap moind yo she stood quite still as before and let them look at her to see what effect the words had produced it seemed as if they had produced none if you have come to see him she said after a few seconds you may go away again he is not here i know where he is and you cannot reach him if there has not been some blunder he is far enough away she told the lie without flinching in the least and with a clever coolness which led her to think in a flash beforehand even of the clause which would save her dignity if he should chance to come in the midst of her words if you want to break windows she went on break them here they can be replaced afterward and there is no one here to interfere with you if you would like to vent your anger upon a woman vent it upon me i am not afraid of you look at me she took half a step forward and presented herself to themmotionless not a fellow among them but felt that she would not have stirred if they had rushed upon her bodily the effect of her supreme beauty and the cold defiance which had in it a touch of delicate insolence was indescribable this was not in accordance with their ideas of women of her class they were used to seeing them discreetly keeping themselves in the shade in time of disorder here was oneone of the nobs as they saidwho flung their threats to the wind and scorned them what they would have done when they recovered themselves is uncertain the scale might have turned either way but just in the intervening moment which would have decided it there arose a tumult in their midst a man pushed his way with mad haste through the crowd and sprang upon the terrace at her side amid yells and hoots from those who had guessed who he was an instant later they all knew him though his dress was disordered his head was bare and his whole face and figure seemed altered by his excitement dom him they yelled theer he is by i towd thee hed coom shouted the cynic he did na get th tellygraph tha sees he turned on them panting and white with rage you devils he cried you are here too havent you done enough isnt bullying and frightening two women enough for you that you must come here thats reet commented the cynic stond up fur th young woman murdoch id do it mysen i i wur o that soide allus stond up fur th sect murdoch spoke to rachel ffrench you must go in he said there is no knowing what they will do i shall stay here she answered she made an impatient gesture she was shuddering from head to foot dont look at or speak to me she said youyou make me a coward they will stand at nothing he protested i will not turn my back upon them she said let them do their worst he turned to the crowd again her life itself was in danger and he knew he could not move her he was shuddering himself who is your leader he said to the men i suppose you have one the man known as foxy gibbs responded to their cries of his name by pushing his way to the front he was a big resolute hulking scamp who had never been known to do an honest days work and was yet always in funds and at liberty to make incendiary speeches where beer and tobacco were plentiful what do you want of me demanded murdoch speak out the fellow was ready enough with his words and forcible too weve heard tell o summat goin on were not goin to stond he said weve heerd tell o a chap ats contrivin summat to do away wi them as does th work now an maks theer bread by it weve heerd as th mesters is proidin theersens on it an laughin in their sleeves weve heerd tell as theers a chap makkin whatll eend i mischiefan yore th chap who told you nivver moind who a foo let it out an we wur na in th humor to let it pass were goin to sift th thing to th bottom yore th chap as was namt what ha yo getten to say just one thing he answered its a lie from first to lastan accursed lie lee or not were goin to smash th thing whatever it is were noan particular about th lee well mak th thing safe first an then settle about th lee murdoch thrust his hands in his pockets and eyed them with his first approach to his usual sangfroid its where you wont find it he said ive made sure of that it was a mad speech to have made but he had lost selfcontrol and balance he was too terribly conscious of rachel ffrenchs perilous nearness to be in the mood to weigh his words he saw his mistake in a second there was a shout and a surging movement of the mob toward him and rachel ffrench with an indescribable swiftness had thrown herself before him and was struck by a stone which came whizzing through the air she staggered under the stroke but stood upright in a breadths time my god murdoch cried out they have struck you they have struck you he was half mad with his anguish and horror the sight of the little stream of blood which trickled from her temple turned him sick with rage you devils he raved do you see what you have done but the play was over before he had finished his outcry there was a shout of th coppers th coppers and a rush and skurry and tumble of undignified retreat the police force with a band of antistrikers behind them had appeared upon the scene in the full glory of the uniform of the corporation and such was the result of habit and the majesty of the law that those who were not taken into custody incontinently took to their heels and scattered in every direction uttering curses loud and deep since they were not yet prepared to resist an attack more formally in half an hour the trampled grass and flowerbeds and broken shrubs were the only signs of the tumult mr ffrench was walking up and down the dreary room in as nervous a condition as ever good heavens rachel he said you must have been madmad she had persistently refused to lie down and sat in an easychair looking rather colorless and languid when they were left alone murdoch came and stood near her he was paler than she and haggard and worn before she knew what he was about to do he fell upon his knees and covered her hands with kisses if any harm had come to you he criedif any harm had come to you she tried to drag her hands away with an angry face but he clung to them and then quite suddenly all her resistance ceased and her eyes fixed themselves upon him as if with a kind of dread chapter xxxv i am not ready for it yet in expectation of something very serious happening the constabulary reenforced itself the day following and assumed a more imposing aspect and was prepared to be very severe indeed upon all shortcomings or symptoms of approaching disorder but somewhat to its private disappointment an unlookedfor quiet prevailedan almost suspicious quiet indeed there were rumors that a secret meeting had been held by the strikers the night before and the result of it was that in the morning there appeared to have been a sudden dispersing and only those remained behind who were unavoidably detained by the rather unfortunate circumstance of having before them the prospect of spending a few weeks in the comparative retirement of the county jail these gentlemen peremptorily refused to give any definite explanation of their eccentricities of conduct of the night before and were altogether very unsatisfactory indeed one of them even going so far under the influence of temporary excitement as to be guilty of the indiscretion of announcing his intention of doin fur one or two enemies of his cause when his term expired on account of which amiable statement three months were added to said term upon the spot it was janey briarley who gave murdoch his warning upon the night of the riot just before he left the works she had come into the yard saying she had a message for haworth and on being told that he was away had asked for murdoch hell do if i canna see th mester she remarked but when she reached murdochs room she stepped across the threshold and shut the door cautiously con anybody hear she demanded with an uneasy glance round no he answered then cut thy stick as fast as tha con an get thee whoam an hoid away that thing thart makkin th stroikers is after it nivver moind how i fun out cut an run i axt fur haworth to throw em off th scent i knowed he wurna here haste thee her manifest alarm convinced him that there was foundation enough for her errand and that she had run some risk in venturing it thank you he said you may have saved me a great deal let us go out quietly as if nothing was in hand come along and so they went he talking aloud as they passed through the gates and as it was already dusk he was out on the broxton road in less than half an hour and when he returned the mob had been to his mothers house and broken a few windows in their rage at his having escaped them and had gone off shouting that they would go to ffrenchs hell be fun theer some one saidpossibly the cynic th young woman is a sweetheart o his an yoll be loike to hear o th cat wheer th cream stonds his mother met him on the threshold with the news of the outbreak and the direction it had taken a few brief sentences told him all and at the end of them he left the house at once i am going there to show myself to them he said they will not return here you are safe enough now the worst is over here but there is no knowing what they may do there when they find themselves baffled it was after midnight when he came back and then it was christian who opened the door for him he came into the little dark passage with a slow unsteady step for a second he did not seem to see her at all his face was white his eyes were shining and his brow was slightly knit in lines which might have meant intense pain are you hurt she asked it was as if her voice wakened him from a trance he looked at her for the first time hurt he echoed nonot hurt he went into the sittingroom and she followed him the narrow horsehair sofa upon which his father had lain so often stood in its old place he threw himself full length upon it and lay looking straight before him are youare you sure you are not hurt she faltered he echoed her words again am i sure i am not hurt he repeated dreamily yes i am sure of it and then he turned slightly toward her and she saw that the look his face wore was not one of pain but of strange rapture i am not hurt he said quite slowly i am madly happy then she understood she was as ignorant of many things as she was bitterly wise in others but she had not been blind and she understood quite clearly she sat down upon a low seat from which she could see him her hands clasped on her knee i knew she said at last that it would come some dayi knew that it would did you he answered in the same dreamy way i did not i did not even hope for it i do not comprehend it even now i do she returned quite well he scarcely seemed to hear her i hoped for nothing he said and nowi am madly happy there was nothing more for her to say she had a fancy that perhaps in the morning he would have forgotten that he had spoken it seemed as if even yet he was hardly conscious of her presence but before she went away she asked him a question where did you put the model he gave a feverish start where and falling back into his previous manneri took it to the chapel yard i knew they would not go there there was space enough behind thethe headstone and the old wall for it to stand and the grass grew long and thick i left it there it was a safe place she answered when shall you bring it back he sighed impatiently not yet he said not just yet let it stay there a while i am notready for it let it stay chapter xxxvi settling an account it was not until the week following that haworth returned and then he came without having given any previous warning of his intention ffrench sitting in his office in a rather dejected mood one morning was startled by his entering with even less than his usual small ceremony my dear haworth he exclaimed is it possible his first intention had been to hold out his hand but he did not do so in fact he sat down again a little suddenly and uneasily haworth sat down too confronting him squarely what have you been up to he demanded what is this row about about echoed ffrench its the most extraordinary combination of nonsense and misunderstanding i ever heard of in my life how it arose there is no knowing the fellows are mad aye angrily mad enow but you cant stop em now theyve got agate its a devilish lookout for us ive heard it all over the country and the more you say agen it the worse it is theyre set on it all through lancashire that theres a plot agen em and theyre fur fettlin it their own fashion youyou dont think it will be worse for us his partner suggested weakly its struck me thatin the endit mightnt be a bad thingthat it would change the direction of their mood wait until the end comes its not here yet tell me how it happened upon the whole mr ffrench made a good story of it he depicted the anxieties and dangers of the occasion very graphically he had lost a good deal of his enthusiasm on the subject of the uncultivated virtues and sturdy determination of the manufacturing laboring classes and he was always fluent as has been before mentioned he was very fluent now and especially so in describing the incident of his daughters presenting herself to the mob and the result of her daring she might have lost her life he said at one point it was an insane thing to have donean insane thing she surprised them at first but she could not hold them in check after murdoch came she will bear the mark of the stone for many a day they threw a stone blast em did they said haworth setting his teeth yesbut not at her perhaps they would hardly have dared that after all it was thrown at murdoch and he stepped out of the way oh no he did not see the man raise his arm but she did and was too much alarmed to reflect i supposeandin fact threw herself before him he moved back disturbedly the next instant haworth burst forth with a string of oaths the veins stood out like cords on his forehead he ground his teeth when the outbreak was over he asked an embarrassing question where were you iwith some uncertainty of tone ihad not gone out ii did not wish to infuriate them it seemed to me thatthatthat a great deal depended upon their not being infuriated aye said haworth a good deal he asked a good many questions ffrench did not quite understand he seemed in a questioning humor and went over the ground step by step he asked what the mob had said and done and even how they had looked its a bad lookout for murdoch he said theyll have a spite again him theyre lyin quiet a bit now because its safest but theyll carry their spite at ffrenchs invitation he went up to the house with him to dinner as they passed into the grounds murdoch passed out he was walking quickly and scarcely seemed to see them until ffrench spoke its a queer time of day for him to be here said haworth when he was gone ffrenchs reply held a touch of embarrassment he is not usually here so early he said he has probably been doing some little errand for rachel the truth was that he had been with her for an hour and that on seeing haworth coming down the road with her father she had sent him away i want to be alone when he comes she had said and when murdoch said why she had answered because it will be easier when they came in she was sitting with the right side of her face toward them they could see nothing of the mark upon her left temple it was not a large mark nor a disfiguring one but there were traces of its presence in her pallor she did not rise and would have kept this side of her face out of view but haworth came and took his seat before her it would not have been easy for her to move or change her positionand he looked directly at the significant little bruise his glance turned upon it again and again as he talked to her or her father if it wandered off it came back and rested there during dinner she felt that place herself as she would in a few seconds she would be conscious again that he had baffled her for the first time in his experience it was he who had the advantage but when they returned to the parlor she held herself in check she placed herself opposite to him and turned her face toward him and let him look without flinching it was as if suddenly she wished that he should see and had a secret defiant reason for the wish it seemed a long evening but she did not lose an inch of ground after this when he was going away she rose and stood before him her father had gone to the other end of the room and was fussing unnecessarily over some memoranda as they waited together haworth took his last look at the mark upon her temple if it had been me you wore it for he said id have had my hands on the throat of the chap that did it before now it wasnt me but ill find him and pay him for it yet by george she had no time to answer him her father came toward them with the papers in his hands haworth listened to his wordy explanation without moving a line of his face he did not hear it and ffrench was dimly aware of the fact about half an hour after the door of the barparlor of the whod ha thowt it was flung open wheres briarley a voice demanded send him out here i want himhaworth mr briarley arose in even more than his usual trepidation he looked from side to side quaking wheer is he he asked haworth stood on the threshold here he answered come out mr briarley obeyed at the door haworth collared him and led him down the sanded passage and into the road outside a few yards from the house there was a pump he piloted him to it and set him against it and began to swear at him fluently you blasted scoundrel he said you let it out did you mr briarley was covered with confusion as with a garment im a misforchnit chap as is allus i trouble he said theers summat i ivverythin i lay hond on as seems to go agen me i dunnot see how it is happen theers summat i me abein a domd foo or happen its nowt but misforchin sararann haworth stopped him by swearing again something more sulphurously than beforeso sulphurously indeed that mr briarley listened with eyes distended and mouth agape lets hear what you know about th thing haworth ended mr

get behind it answered haworth and be damned to you he got behind it with alacrity and as it was not a large pump was driven by necessity to narrowing himself to its compass as it were and taking up very little room haworth himself drew back somewhat and yet kept within hearing four or five men came out and went their different ways and mr briarley made no sign but as the sixth a powerful clumsy fellow passed he uttered a cautious theer he is haworth did not stir it was a dark cloudy night and he was far enough from the road to be safe from discovery the man went on at a leisurely pace mr briarley reappeared breathing shortly i mun go whoam he said sararann and scarcely waiting for haworths signal of dismissal he departed as if he had been shot from a stringbow and fled forth into the shadows mr reddy went at a leisurely pace as has been before observed he usually went at a leisurely pace when he was on his way home he was a bad lot altogether and his home was a squalid place and his wife more frequently than not had a black eye or a bruised face and was haggard with hunger and full of miserable plaints and reproaches consequently he did not approach the scenes of his domestic joys with any haste he was in a worse humor than usual tonight from various causes the chief one perhaps being that he had only had enough spirituous liquor to make him savage and to cause him to enliven his way with blasphemy suddenly however at the corner of a lane which crossed the road he paused he heard behind him the sound of heavy feet nearing him with a quick tramp which somehow presented to his mind the idea of a purpose and for some reason not exactly clear to himself he turned about and waited whos that theer he asked its me he was answered stand up and take thy thrashin my lad the next instant he was struggling in the darkness with an assailant and the air was hot with oaths and they were writhing together and panting and striking blinding blows sometimes it was one man and then the other who was uppermost but at last it was haworth and he had his man in his grasp this is because you hit the wrong mark my lad he said because luck went agen you and because its gone agen me when he had done mr reddy lay beaten into seeming insensibility he had sworn and gnashed his teeth and beaten back in vain who is it by he panted who is it its haworth he was answered jem haworth my lad and he was left there lying in the dark while haworth walked away his heavy breathing a living presence in the air until he was gone chapter xxxvii a summer afternoon let it stay there a while murdoch had said i am not ready for it yet and it staid there between the headstone and the old stone wall covered with the long grass and closed in by it he was not ready for ityet the days were not long enough for him as it was his mother and christian rarely saw him but at such times as they did each recognized in him a new look and understood it he began to live a strange excited life rachel ffrench did nothing by halves he was seen with her constantly it continually happened that where she was invited he was invited also he forgot that he dreaded to meet strangers and had always held aloof from crowds there were no strangers now and no crowds in any gathering there was only one presence and this was enough for him when people would have cultivated him and drawn him out he did not see their efforts when men and women spoke to him they found that he scarcely heard them and that even as they talked he had unconsciously veered toward another point he did things sometimes which made them stare at him the fellow is like a ghost a man said of him once the simile was not a bad one he did not think of what he might be winning or losingfor the time being mere existence was allsufficient at night he scarcely slept at all often he got up and rambled over the country in the darkness not knowing where he was going or why he walked he went through the routine of the day in haste and impatience doing more work than was necessary and frequently amazing those around him by losing his temper and missing his mark ffrench began to regard him with wonder divers things were a source of wonder to ffrench in these days he understood rachel less than ever and found her less satisfactory he could not comprehend her motives he had become accustomed to feeling that she always had a motive in the background and he made the natural mistake of supposing that she had one now but she had none she had suddenly given way to a mysterious impulse which overmastered her and she let herself go as it were it did not matter to her that the time came when her course was discussed and marveled at upon the whole she felt a secret pleasure in defying public comment as usual and going steadily in her own path she did strange things too she began to go among the people who knew murdoch bestvisiting the families of the men who worked under him and leading them on to speak of him and his way of life it cannot be said that the honest matrons she honored by her visits were very fond of her or exactly rejoiced when she appeared they felt terribly out of place and awestricken when she sat down on their wooden chairs with her rich dress lying upon the pipeclayed floors her beauty and her grandeur stunned them however much they admired both i tell yo shes a lady they said she knows nowt about poor folk bless yo but shes getten brass to gie awayan she gies it wiout makin a doment i mun say it puts me out a bit to see her coom in but she does na go out wiout leavin summat she made no pretense of bringing sympathy and consolation she merely gave money and money was an equivalent and after all it was something of an event to have her carriage stop before the gate and to see her descend and enter in all her splendor the general vague idea which prevailed was that she meant to be charitable after the manner of her orderbut that was a mistake too it happened at last that one day her carriage drew up before the house at whose window murdochs mother and christian sat at work it was saturday and janey briarley in her cleanin up apparel opened the door for her theyre in th parlor she answered in reply to her question art tha coom to see em when she was ushered into the parlor in question mrs murdoch rose with her work in her hand christian rose also and stood in the shadow they had never had a visitor before and had not expected such a one as this they thought at first that she had come upon some errand but she had not she gave no reason for her presence other than she would have given in making any call of ceremony as she sat on the narrow sofa she saw all the room and its meagernessits smallness its scant plain furnishing its ugly carpet and walls the straight black dress of the older woman the dark beauty of the girl who did not sit down but stood behind her chair watching this beauty was the only thing which relieved the monotony of the place but it was the most grating thing she saw to rachel ffrench it roused within her a slow anger she resented it and felt that she would like to revenge herself upon it quietly she had merely meant to try the effect of these people and their surroundings upon herself as a fine experiment but the effect was stronger than she had anticipated when she went away christian accompanied her to the door in the narrow passage rachel ffrench turned and looked at hergiving her a glance from head to foot i think i have seen you before she said you know you have seen me the girl answered i have seen you on the continent your apartment was opposite to ours in pariswhen you were with your mother i used to watch the people go in and out you are very like your mother and she left her not looking back onceas if there was no living creature behind or as if she had forgotten that there was one christian went back to the room within she sat down but did not take up her work again do you know why she came she asked yes why she came to look at usto see what manner of people we wereto see how we livedto measure the distance between our life and hers as she went away she went on she remembered that she had seen me before she told me that i was very like my mother she leaned forward her hands clasped palm to palm between her knees there was a man who did my mother a great wrong once she said they had loved each other in a mad sort of way for a long time but in the end i suppose he got tired for suddenly he went away when he was gone my mother did not speak of him and it was as if he had never lived but she grew haggard and dreadful and lost her beauty i was a little child and she took me with her and began to travel from one place to another i did not know why at first but i found out afterward she was following him she found him in paris at last after two years one foggy night she took me to a narrow street near one of the theaters and after we got there i knew she was waiting for some one because she walked to and fro between two of the street lamps dragging me by the hand she walked so for half an hour and then the man came not knowing we were there she went to him dragging me with her and when she stood in front of him threw back her veil and let the light shine upon her she lifted her hand and struck himstruck him full upon the face panting for breath i am a woman she said i am a woman and i have struck you remember it to your last hour as i shall i thought that he would strike her back but he did not his hands fell at his sides and he stood before her pale and helpless i think it was even more terrible than she had meant it to be mrs murdoch stopped her almost angrily why do you go back to it she demanded why should you think of such a story now it came to me she answered i was thinking that it is true that i am like heri bear a grudge such a long time and it will not die out it is her blood which is strong in me she spoke the truth early in the afternoon rachel ffrench sauntering about the garden in the sun saw murdoch coming down the road toward the housenot until he had first seen her however his eyes were fixed upon her when she turned and it seemed as if he found it impossible to remove them even for a breaths time since his glance had first caught the pale blue of her dress he had not once looked away from it all the morning in the midst of the smoke and din of the workrooms he had been thinking of the hours to come the rest of the day lay before him the weather was dazzling the heat of summer was in the air the garden was ablaze with flowers whose brightness seemed never to have been there before there was here and there the drone of a bee and now and again a stir of leaves the day before had been of another color and so might the morrow be but today left nothing to be believed in except its own sun and beauty when at last he was quite near her he seemed for a little while to see nothing but the faint pale blue of her dress he never forgot it afterward and never remembered it without a sense of summer heat and languor he could not have told what he said to her or if he at first spoke at all soon she began to move down the path and he followed hersimply followed herstopping when she stopped to break a flower from its stem it was as she bent forward once that she told him of what she had done this morning she said i went to see your mother she told me so he answered she broke the stem of the flower and stood upright holding it in her hand you do not ask me why i went why he asked their eyes met and she was silent for a moment then she said with perfect deliberateness i have known nothing of the life you live i wanted to see it for myself i wantedto bring it near he drew quite close to her his face pale his eyes burning near he repeated to bring it near do youdo you know what you have said to bring it near she said again with no less deliberateness than before but with a strange softness just for today she had told herself she would try the sensation of being swept onward by the stream but she weighed herself as she spoke and weighed him and his passion and her power against its force but he came no closer to her he did not attempt to touch even her hand or her dress his own hands fell helplessly at his sides and he stood still before her oh god he said in a hushed voice how happy i am chapter xxxviii god bless you late the same night mrs haworth who had been watching for her son alone in the grand desolate room in which it was her lot to sit rose to her feet on hearing him enter the house the first object which met his eye when he came in was her little figure and her patient face turned toward the door as he crossed the threshold she took a few steps as if to meet him and then stopped jem she exclaimed jem her voice was tremulous and her eyes bright with the indefinable feeling which seized upon her the moment she saw his face her utterance of his name was a cry of anxiousness and fear what he said are you here yet he came to her and laid a hand upon her shoulder in a rough caress youd better go to bed he said to her its late and ive got work to do i felt she answered as if id like to wait an see you i knowed i should sleep better for iti always do there was a moments pause in which she stroked his sleeve with her withered hand then he spoke sleep better he said thats a queer notion youve got queer fancies you womensome on you then he stooped and kissed her awkwardly he always did it with more or less awkwardness and lack of ease but it never failed to make her happy now youve done it he said youd better go old lady and leave me to finish what ive got to do its late for work jem she answered you oughtnt to try yourself so much it aint work so much he said as thinking theres summat ive got to think out for the moment he seemed quite to forget her he stood with his hands thrust into his pockets and his feet apart staring at the carpet he did not stir when she moved away and was still standing so when she turned at the door to look at him what she saw brought her back hurried and tearful let me stay she cried let me stay theres trouble in your face jem for i see it dont keep it from mefor the sake of what weve been through together in times thats past he bestirred himself and looked up at her trouble he repeated thats not the word its not trouble old lady and its naught that can be helped theres me and it to fight it out go and get your sleep and leave us to it she went slowly and sadly she always obeyed him whatever his wish might be when the last sound of her faltering feet had died away upon the stairs he went to the sideboard and poured out a glass of raw brandy and drank it i want summat to steady me he saidand to warm me but it did not steady him at least when he sat down at the table the hand he laid upon it shook he looked at it curiously clinching and unclinching it im pretty well done for when it goes like that he said im farther gone than i thought its all over meover and through me im shaking like a fool he broke out with a torrent of curses is it me thats sitting here he cried or some other chap is it me that lucks gone agen on every side or a chap thats useder to it among all his pangs of humiliation and baffled passion there was not one so subtle and terrible in its influence upon him as his momentary sense of physical weakness he understood it less than all the rest and raged against it more his body had never failed him once and now for the first time he felt that its power faltered he was faint and cold and trembled not merely from excitement but from loss of strength opposite to him at the other side of the room was a fulllength mirror accidentally raising his eyes toward it he caught sight of his own face he started back and unconsciously glanced behind him who he began and then he stopped knowing the face for his ownwhitelipped damp with cold sweat lined with harsh furrowsevil to see he got up shaking his fist at it crying out through his shut teeth blast her he said whos to blame but her he had given up all for her his ambition which had swept all before it his greatest strength his very sins and coarseness and half an hour ago he had passed the open door of a room and had seen murdoch standing motionless not uttering a word but with his face fairly transfigured by his ecstasy and with her hand crushed against his breast he had gone in to see ffrench and had remained with him for an hour in one of the parlors knowing that the two were alone in the other he had heard their voices now and then and had known that once they went upon the terrace and talked there he had grown burning hot and deadly cold and strained his ears for every sound but never caught more than a word or low laugh coming from rachel ffrench at last he had left his partner and on his way out passed the open door they had come back to the room and murdoch was saying his goodnight he held rachel ffrenchs hand and she made no effort to withdraw it but gave it to his caress she did not move nor speak but her eyes rested upon his rapt face with an expression not easy to understand haworth did not understand it but the rage which seized and shook him was the most brutal emotion he had ever felt in his life it was a madness which left him weak he staggered down the stairs and out into the night blindly blaspheming as he went he did not know how he reached home the sight his mother had seen and which had drawn a cry from her and checked her midway in the room had been cause enough for tremor in her nothing but the most violent effort had saved him from an outbreak in her presence he was weaker for the struggle when she was gone he could think of nothing but of rachel ffrenchs untranslatable face and of murdochs close clasp of her surrendered hand what has she ever give me he cried me thats played the fool for her whats he done that he should stand there and fondle her as if hed bought and paid for her im the chap that paid for her shes mine body and soul by george if every man had his rights and then remembering all that had gone by he turned from hot to cold again ive stood up agen her a long time he said and what have i got i swore id make my way with her and how far have i gone shes never give me a word by george or a look thatd be what another woman would have give shes not even played with memost on em would have done thatbut shes not shes gone on her way and let me go on mine shes turned neither right nor left for mei wasnt man enough he wore himself out in the end and went to the brandy again and drank of it deeply it sent him upstairs with heated blood and feverish brain it was after midnight when he went to his room but not to sleep he lay upon his pillow in the darkness thinking of the things he had done in the past few months and of the fruit the first seed he had sown might bring forth theres things that may happen to any on us my lad he said and some on em might happen to you if its jem haworth thats to lose the other shant gain by george he had put the light out and lay in the darkness and was so lying with this mood at work upon him when there came a timid summons on the door and it opened and some one came in softly he knew who it was even before she spoke jem she said jem youre not asleep my dear no he answered she came to the bedside and stood there ii couldnt sleep she said somethings a little wrong with me im gettin foolish anan fearful i felt as if you wasnt quite safe i thought id come and speak to you youre out o sorts he answered youll have to be looked after its nothing but my foolish way she replied youre very good to mean me so full of fancies would youwould you mind me akneelin down an sayin a prayer here to myself as i used to when you was a boy jem i think itd do me good would you mind it no he answered hoarsely kneel down and she knelt and grasped for his hand and held it and he heard her whispering in the dark as he had been wont to hear her nearly thirty years before and when it was over she got up and kissed him on the forehead god bless you my dear she said god bless you and went away chapter xxxix it is done with after the departure of haworth and murdoch mr ffrench waited for some time for his daughters appearance he picked up a pamphlet and turned over its leaves uneasily trying to read here and there and making no great success of the effort he was in a disturbed and nervous mood the evening had been a trial to him more especially the latter part of it during which haworth sat on the other side of the table in his usual awkwardly free and easy posture his hands in his pockets his feet thrust out before him his silence and the expression he wore had not been of a kind to relieve his companion of any tithe of the burden which had gradually accumulated upon his not too muscular shoulders at the outset ffrench had been simply bewildered then somewhat anxious and annoyed but today he had been stunned haworths departure was an immense relief to him it was often a relief to him in these days then he heard murdoch descend the stairs and leave the house and he waited with mingled dread and anxiousness for rachels coming but she did not make her appearance he heard her walk across the room after murdoch left her and then she did not seem to move again after the lapse of half an hour he laid his pamphlet aside and rose himself he coughed two or three times and paced the floor a littlegradually he edged toward the folding doors leading into the front room and passed through them rachel stood at one of the windows which was thrown open she was leaning against its side and looking out into the night when she turned toward him something in her manner caused in ffrench an increase of nervousness amounting to irritation you wish to say something to me she remarked what is it yes he answered i wish to say something to you he could not make up his mind to say it for a moment or so he found himself returning her undisturbed glance with an excited and bewildered one ithe fact ishe broke forth desperately ii do not understand you that is not at all singular she replied you have often said so before he began to lose his temper and to walk about the room you have often chosen to seem incomprehensible he said but this is the most extraordinary thing you have done yet youyou must know that it looks very badthat people are discussing you openlyyou of all women suddenly he wheeled about and stopped staring at her with more uncertainty and bewilderment than ever i ought to know you better he said i do know you better than to think you capable of any weakness ofof that kind you are not capable of it you are too proud and too fond of yourself and yet and yet what she demanded in a peculiar low voice he faltered visibly and yet you are permitting yourself toto be talked over andmisunderstood do you think she asked in the same voice that i care for being talked over you would care if you knew what is said he responded you do not know i can guess she replied easily but she was deadly pale and he saw it and her humiliation was that she knew he saw it what you do he continued is of more consequence than what most women do you are not popular you have held yourself very high and have set people at defiance if you should be guilty of a romantic folly it would go harder with you than with others i know that she answered him far better than you do she held herself quite erect and kept her eyes steadily upon him what is the romantic folly she put it to him he could not have put it into words just then if his life had depended upon his power to do it you will not commit it he said it is not in you to do it but you have put yourself in a false position and it is very unpleasant for both of us she stopped him you are very much afraid of speaking plainly she said be more definite he flushed to the roots of his hair in his confusion and uneasiness there was no way out of the difficulty you have adopted such a manner with the world generally he floundered that a concession from you means a great deal youyou have been making extraordinary concessions it is easy to see that this young fellow is madly enamored of you he does not know how to conceal it and he does not try you have not seemed to demand that he should you have let him follow you and come and go as his passion and simplicity prompted him one might say you had encouraged himthough encouraged seems hardly the word to use no she interrupted it is not the word to use he has made himself conspicuous and you too and you have never protested by word or deed when he was in danger you actually risked your life for him great heaven she ejaculated the truth of what he said came upon her like a flash until this moment she had only seen the night from one standpoint and to see it from this one was a deadly blow to her she lost her balance how dare you she cried breathlessly i was mad with excitement if i had stopped to think you usually do stop to think he put in that was why i was amazed you did a thing without calculating its significance you never did so before in your life you know that it is true you pride yourself upon it he could have said nothing so bitter and terrible for the moment they had changed places it was he who had presented a weakness to her she did pride herself upon her cool power of calculation go on she exclaimed he has been here half the day he proceeded growing bolder you were out in the garden together all the afternoonhe has only just left you when you contrast his position with yours is not that an extraordinary thing what should you say if another woman had gone so far two years ago he was haworths engineer he is a wonderful fellow and a genius and the world will hear of him yet i should never think of anything but that if i were the only individual concerned but youyou treated him badly enough at first she turned paler and paler you think that ithat i she had meant to daunt him with the most daring speech she could make but it would not complete itself she faltered and broke down i dont know what to think he answered desperately it seems impossible good heavens it is impossibleyouit is not in your nature no she said it is not even in that brief space she had recovered herself wholly she met his glance just as she had met it before even with more perfect sang froid i will tell you what to think she went on i have been very dull here i wished from the first that i had never come i hate the people and i despise them more than i hate them i must be amused and interested and they are less than nothing the person you speak of was different i suppose what you say of him is true and he is a genius i care nothing for that in itself but he has managed to interest me at first i thought him only absurd he was of a low class and a common workman and he was so simple and ignorant of the world that he did not feel his position or did not care that amused me and i led him on to revealing himself then i found out that there was a difference between him and the rest of his class and i began to study him i have no sentimental notions about his honor and good qualities those things do not affect me but i have been interested and the time has passed more easily now the matter will end just as it begannot because i am tired of him or because i care for what people say but because i think it is timeand i choose that it should it is done with from tonight good heaven he cried you are not going to drop the poor fellow like that you may call it what you please she returned i have gone as far as i choose to go and it is done with from tonight mr ffrenchs excitement became something painful to see between his embarrassment as a weak nature before a strong onean embarrassment which was founded upon secret fear of unpleasant resultsbetween this and the natural compunctions arising from tendencies toward a certain refined and amiable sense of fairness he wellnigh lost all control over himself and became courageous he grew heated and flushed and burst forth into protest my dear he said i must say its aa deuced ungentlemanly business her lack of response absolutely inspired him its a deuced illbred business he added from first to last she did not reply even to that so he went on growing warmer and warmer you have taunted me with being afraid of you he said though you have never put it into so many words perhaps i have been afraid of you you can make yourself confoundedly unpleasant at timesand i may have shrunk from saying what would rouse youbut i must speak my mind about this and say it is a deucedly cruel and unfair thing and is unworthy of you a less wellbred woman might have done it a little color rose to her cheek and remained there but she did not answer still he is an innocent fellow he proceeded an unworldly fellow he has lived in his books and his work and he knows nothing of women his passion for you is a pure romantic one he would lay his world at your feet call it folly if you willit is follybut allow me to tell you it is worthy of a better object he was so astonished at his own daring that he stopped to see what effect it had produced she replied by asking a simple but utterly confounding question what she said would you wish me to do what would i wish you to do he stammered what ii hardly know and after regarding her helplessly a little longer he turned about and left the room chapter xl look out the next morning ffrench rather surprised murdoch by walking into his cell with the evident intention of paying him a somewhat prolonged visit it was not however the fact of his appearing there which was unusual enough to excite wonder but a certain degree of mingled constraint and effusiveness in his manner it was as if he was troubled with some mental compunctions which he was desirous of setting at rest at times he talked very fast and in a comparatively light and jocular vein and again he was silent for some minutes invariably rousing himself from his abstraction with a sudden effort several times murdoch found that he was regarding him with a disturbed air of anxiety before going away he made an erratic and indecisive tour of the little room glancing at drawings and picking up first one thing and then another you have a good many things here he said of one kind and another yes murdoch answered absently ffrench glanced around at the jumble of mechanical odds and ends the plans and models in various stages of neglect or completion its a queer place he commented and it has an air of significance its crammed with ideasof one kind and another yes murdoch answered as before ffrench approached him and laid his hand weakly on his shoulder you are a fellow of ideas he said and you have a good deal before you whatever disappointments you might meet with you would always have a great deal before you you have ideas i with apparent inconsequence i havent you know murdoch looked somewhat puzzled but he did not contradict him so he repeated his statement i havent you know i wish i had then he dropped his hand and looked indefinite again i should like you to always remember that i am your friend he said i wish i could have been of more service to you you are a fine fellow murdoch i have admired youi have liked you dont forget it and he went away carrying the burden of his indecision and embarrassment and good intention with much amiable awkwardness that day murdoch did not see rachel ffrench circumstances occurred which kept him at work until a late hour the next day it was the same story and the next also a series of incidents seemed to combine against him and the end of each day found him worn out and fretted but on the fourth he was free again and early in the evening found himself within sight of the iron gates every pulse in his body throbbed as he passed through them he was full of intense expectation he could scarcely bear to think of what was before him his desperate happiness was a kind of pain one of his chief longings was that he might find her wearing the pale blue dress again and that when he entered she might be standing in the centre of the room as he had left her then it would seem as if there had been no nights and days between the last terribly happy moment and this the thought which flashed across his mind that there might possibly be some one else in the room was a shock to him if she is not alone he said to himself it will be unbearable as he passed up the walk he came upon a tall white lily blooming on one of the border beds he was in a sufficiently mystical and emotional mood to be stopped by it it is like her he said and he gathered it and took it with him to the house the first thing upon which his eye rested when he stood upon the threshold of the room was the pale blue color and she was standing just as he had left her it seemed to him upon the very same spot upon which they had parted his wish had been realized so far at least he was obliged to pause a moment to regain his selfcontrol it was an actual truth that he could not have trusted himself so far as to go in at once it was best that he did not the next instant she turned and spoke to a third person at the other side of the room and even as she did so caught sight of him and stopped here is mr murdoch she said and paused waiting for him to come forward she did not advance to meet him did not stir until he was scarcely more than a pace from her she simply waited watching him as he moved toward her as if she were a little curious to see what he would do then she gave him her hand and he took it with a feeling that something unnatural had happened or that he was suddenly awakening from a delusion he did not even speak it was she who spoke turning toward the person whom she had addressed before he entered you have heard us speak of mr murdoch she said and then to himself this is m saint meran m saint meran rose and bowed profoundly he presented as his best points long graceful limbs and a pair of clear gray eyes which seemed to hold their opinions in check he regarded murdoch with an expression of suave interest and made a wellbred speech of greeting murdoch said nothing he could think of nothing to say he was never very ready of speech he bowed with an uncertain air and almost immediately wandered off to the other end of the room holding his lily in his hand he began to turn over the pages of a book of engravings seeing none of them after a little while a peculiar perfume close to him attracted his attention and he looked downward vacantly and saw the lily then he laid it down and moved farther away afterwardhe did not know how long afterwardffrench came in he seemed in a very feverish state of mind talking a great deal and rather inanely and forcing murdoch to reply and join in the conversation m saint meran held himself with a graceful air of security and selfpoise and made gentle efforts at scientific remark which should also have an interest for genius of a mechanical and inventive turn but murdochs replies were vague his glance followed rachel ffrench he devoured her with his eyesa violence which she bore very well at lasthe had not been in the house an hourhe left his chair and went to her i am going away he said in an undertone goodnight she did not seem to hear him she was speaking to saint meran good night he repeated in the same tone not raising it at all only giving it an intense concentrated sound she turned her face toward him goodnight she answered illustration she turned her face toward him goodnight she answered and he went away ffrench following him to the door with erratic and profuse regrets which he did not hear at all when he got outside he struck out across the country the strength with which he held himself in check was a wonder to him it seemed as if he was not thinking at allthat he did not allow himself to think he walked fast it might even be said violently the exertion made his head throb and his blood rush through his veins he walked until at last his heart beat so suffocatingly that he was forced to stop he threw himself downalmost fell down upon the grass at the wayside and lay with shut eyes he was giddy and exhausted and panted for breath he could not have thought then if he would he had gained so much at least he did not leave the place for an hour when he did so it was to walk home by another route slowly almost weakly this route led him by the briarley cottage and as he neared it he was seized with a fancy for going in the door was ajar and a light burned in the livingroom and this drew him toward it upon the table stood a basket filled with purchases and near the basket lay a shawl which janey wore upon all occasions requiring a toilet she had just come in from her shopping and sat on a stool in her usual posture not having yet removed the large bonnet which spread its brim around her small face a respectable and steadygoing aureole enlivened with bunches of flowers which in their better days had rejoiced mrs briarleys heart with exceeding great joy she looked up as he came in but she did not rise eh its thee is it she remarked i thowt it wur toime tha wur comin thast not

an a grand un shes lived i france a good bit an happen she does na moind their ways shes knowed him afore when he asked when she wur theer she lived theer yo know yes he remembered she had lived there he said nothing more only sat watching the little stunted figure and sharp small face with a sense of mild fascination wondering dully how much she knew and where she had learned it all and what she would say next but she gave him no further informationchiefly because she had no more on hand there being a limit even to her sagacity she became suddenly interested in himself yore as pale as if yod had th whoopincough she remarked whats wrong wi yo i am tired he answered worn out that was true enough but it did not satisfy her her matter of fact and matronly mind arrived at a direct solution of the question did yo ivver think she put it to him as shed ha yo he had no answer to give her he began to turn deathly white about the lips she surveyed him with increased interest and proceeded mother

burst into a harsh laugh and got up ive been pretty well talked over it seems he said i didnt know that before aye replied janey coolly weve talked yo ower a good bit are yo goin yes he answered i am going he went out with an uncertain movement leaving the door open behind him as he descended the steps the light from the room slanting out into the darkness struck athwart a face the body pertaining to which seemed to be leaning against the palings grasping them with both hands it was the face of mr briarley who regarded him with a mingled expression of anxiety and desire to propitiate is it yo he whispered as murdoch neared him yes he was answered somewhat shortly mr briarley put out a hand and plucked him by the sleeve ive been waitin fur yo he said in a sonorous whisper which only failed to penetrate the innermost recesses of the dwelling through some miracle murdoch turned out of the gate why he asked mr briarley glanced toward the house uneasily and also up and down the road les get out o th way a bit he remarked murdoch walked on and he shuffled a few paces behind him when they got well into the shadow of the hedge he stopped suddenly he dropped upon his knees and crawling through a very small gap into the field behind remained there for a few seconds then he reappeared panting theers no one theer he said i would na ha risked theer bein one on em lyin under th hedge one of whom murdoch inquired i did na say who he answered when he stood on his feet again he took his companion by the button theers a friend o moine he said as ha sent a messidge to yo this heres itlook

about him again and then without warning threw himself so to speak on murdochs shoulder and began to pour a flood of whispers into his ear theer wur a chap as were a foo he said an he was drawed into bein a bigger foo than common it wur him as getten yo i trouble wi th stroikers he did na mean no ill anan he ses ill tell him to look out ill run th risk he knowed what wur goin on an he ses ill tell

getten a way o gettin hissen i trouble an he ses ill tell him to look out tell him from me said murdoch that i am not afraid of anything that may happen it was a rash speech but was not so defiant as it sounded his only feeling was one of cold carelessness he wanted to get free and go away and end his night in his silent room at home but mr briarley kept up with him edging toward him apologetically as he walked yore set agen th chap fur bein a foo he persisted breathlessly an i dunnot blame yo hes set agen hissen hes a misforchnit chap as is allus i trouble its set heavy on him an ses he ill tell him to look out at a turn into a bylane he stopped ill go this road he said an ill tell him as ive done it chapter xli it has all been a lie in a weeks time saint meran had become a distinct element in the social atmosphere of broxton and vicinity he fell into his place at rachel ffrenchs side with the naturalness of a man who felt he had some claim upon his position he was her fathers guest they had seen a great deal of each other abroad any woman might have felt his wellbred homage a delicate compliment he was received as an agreeable addition to society he attended her upon all occasions from the window of his workroom murdoch saw him drive by with her in her carriage saw him drop into the bank for a friendly chat with ffrench who regarded him with a mixture of nervousness and admiration haworth having gone away again had not heard of him of late the works had seen little of its master he made journeys hither and hither and on his return from such journeys invariably kept the place in hot water he drove the work on and tyrannized over the hands from foremen to puddlers at such times there was mysterious and covert rebellion and some sharp guessing as to what was going on but it generally ended in this upon the whole the men were used to being bullied and some of them worked the better for it murdoch went about his work as usual though there was not a decent man on the place who did not gradually awaken to the fact that some singular change was at work upon him he concentrated all his mental powers upon what he had to do during work hours and so held himself in check but he spent all his leisure in a kind of apathy sitting in his cell at his worktable in his old posture his forehead supported by his hands his fingers locked in his tumbled hair sometimes he was seized with fits of nervous trembling which left him weak when he left home in the morning he did not return until night and he ate no midday meal as yet he was only drifting here and there he had arrived at no conclusions he did not believe in his own reasoning the first blow had simply stunned him a man who had been less reserved and who had begun upon a fair foundation of common knowledge would have understood he understood nothing but his passion his past rapture and that a mysterious shock had fallen upon him he lived in this way for more than a week and then he roused himself to make a struggle one bright sunny day after sitting dumbly for half an hour or so he staggered to his feet and took up his hat illtryagain he said mechanically ill try again i dont know what it means it may have been my fault i dont think it wasbut it may have been perhaps i expected too much and he went out after he had been absent some minutes ffrench came in from the bank he had been having a hard morning of it the few apparently unimportant indiscretions in the way of private speculation of which he had been guilty were beginning to present themselves in divers unpleasant forms and to assume an air of importance he had not believed possible his best ventures had failed him and things which he was extremely anxious to keep from haworths ears were assuming a shape which would render it difficult to manage them privately he was badgered and baited on all sides and naturally began to see his own folly his greatest fear was not so much that he should lose the money he had risked as that haworth should discover his luckless weakness and confront and crush him with it as he stood in fear of his daughter so he stood in fear of haworth but his dread of haworth was perhaps the stronger feeling of the two his very refinement added to it having gained the object of his ambition he had found it not exactly what he had pictured it haworth had not spared him the very hands had derided his enthusiastic and strenuous efforts he had secretly felt that his position was ridiculous and provocative of satire among the unscientific herd when he had done anything which should have brought him success and helped him to assert himself it had somehow always failed and now he sat down in the managerial chair before haworths great table strewn with papers and bills he had shut the door behind him and was glad to be alone i am extremely unfortunate he faltered aloud i dont know how to account for it and he glanced about him helplessly before the words had fairly left his lips his privacy was broken in upon the door was flung open and murdoch came in he had evidently walked fast for he was breathing heavily and he had plainly expected to find the room empty he looked at ffrench sat down and wiped his lips i want you he began with labored articulation i want youto tell mewhati have done ffrench could only stare at him i went to the house he said and asked for her he did not say for whom nor was it necessary that he should ffrench understood him perfectly i swear i saw her standing at the window as i went up the path she had a purple dress onand a white flower in her hairand saint meran was at her side before the man at the door never waited for me to speak this time he stood and looked at me i said i want to see miss ffrench he answered she is not at home not at homebreaking into a rough laughnot at home to me he clinched his fist and dashed it against the chair what does it mean he cried out what does it mean ffrench quaked ii dont know he answered and his own face gave him the lie murdoch caught his words up and flung them back at him you dont know he cried then i will tell you it means that she has been playing me false from first to last ffrench felt his position becoming weaker and weaker here was a state of affairs he had never seen before here was a madness which concealed nothing which defied all which flung all social presuppositions to the winds he ought to have been able to palter and equivocate to profess a wellbred surprise and some delicate indignation to be dignified and subtle but he was not he could only sit and wonder what would come next and feel uncomfortable and alarmed the thing which came next he had not expected any more than he had expected the rest of the outbreak suddenly a sullen calmness settled upon the young fellowa calm which spoke of some fierce determination i dont know why i should have broken out like this before you he said seeing you here when i expected to fight it out alone surprised me into it but there is one thing i am going to do ill hear the truth from her own lips when you go home i will go with you they wont turn me back then and ill see her face to face i began ffrench and then added completely overwhelmed veryperhaps it would bebe best best echoed murdoch with another laugh no it wont be best it will be worst but ill do it for all that and he dropped his head upon the arms he had folded on the chairs back and so sat in a forlorn comfortless posture not speaking not stirring as if he did not know that there was any presence in the room but his own and he kept his word as ffrench was going out into the street at dusk he felt a touch on his shoulder and turning found murdoch close behind him im ready he said if you are when they reached the house the man who opened the door stared at them blankly which so irritated ffrench that he found an excuse for administering a sharp rebuke to him about some trifle they are always making some stupid blunder he said to murdoch as they passed upstairs to the drawingroom but murdoch did not hear it was one of the occasions on which rachel ffrench reached her highest point of beauty her black velvet dress was almost severe in its simplicity and her one ornament was the jewelled star in her high coiffure m st meran held his place at her side he received murdoch with empressement and exhibited much tact and good feeling but murdoch would have none of him he had neither tact nor experience his time did not come until the evening was nearly over and it would never have come if he had not at last forced her to confront him by making his way to her side with a daring which was so novel in him that it would have mastered another woman near her he trembled a little but he said what he had come to say today he said when i calledyour servant told me you were not at home she paused a moment before answering but when she did answer he trembled no more that was unfortunate she said it was not truei saw you at the window she looked him quietly in the face answering him in two words did you he turned on his heel and walked away his brain whirled he did not know how he got out of the room he was scarcely conscious of existence until he found himself outofdoors he got beyond the gate and into the road and to the end of the road but there he stopped and turned back he went back until he found he was opposite the house again looking up at the lighted window he did not know why a sharp rain was falling but he did not feel it he stood staring at the window mechanically plucking at the leaves on the hedge near him he scarcely knew whether it was a curse or a sob which fell from his lips and awakened him at last am i going mad he said do men go mad through such things god forbid it has all been a liea liea lie chapter xlii another man in two days haworth returned he came from the station one morning not having been home he did not go to the works but to the bank and straight into ffrenchs private room the look this unhappy gentleman gave him when he saw him was a queer mixture of anxiety furtive query and amiably frank welcomethe frank welcome a very faint element indeed though it was brought to light by a violent effort haworth shut the door and locked it and then turned upon him his face black with rage say summat he ground out through his teeth say summat asll keep me from smashing every bone in your body ffrench gave him one hopeless glance and wilted into a drooping weakly protesting humiliated figure dontdont be so severe haworth he said ii blast you burst in haworth pitilessly youve ruined me he spoke under his breath no one in the room beyond could hear a word but it was a thousand times more terrible than if he had roared at the top of his voice as was his custom when things went amiss youve ruined me he repeated you a chap thats played gentleman manufacturer a chap ive laughed at a chap i took in to serve my own endsruined me by oh no no the culprit cried out my dear fellow no no no haworth strode up to him and struck his fist against the table have i ever told you a word of what was going on he demanded no no have i ever let you be aught but what i swore you should be at th firsta fellow to play second fiddle and do what he was told ffrench turned pale a less hard nature would have felt more sympathy for him no he answered you have not and his chin dropped on his breast haworth shook his fist in his face he was in a frenzy of rage and despair its been going from bad to worse for six months he said but you were not up to seeing it stare you in the face strikes are the things for trade to thrive on one place after another gone down and jem haworths stood up jem haworths outdone em all ive not slept for three month my lad ive fought it like a tiger ive not left a stone unturned ive held my mouth shut and my eyes openaye and held my breath too ive swore every time i saw daylight that id hold it out to the end and show em all what haworth was made of and how he stood when th nobs went down at the first drive id sooner have hell than whats bound to come now and its you thats done it youve lost me twenty thousand poundtwenty thousand when tens worth more to me than a hundred was a twelvemonth since ffrench quailed like a woman areare you going to murder me he said you look as if you were haworth turned on his heel youre not worth it he answered or id do it by the lord harry then he came back to him ive paid enow for what ive never had by george he said with bitter grimness for what you have ffrench began haworth stopped him by flinging himself down in a chair near himso near that their faces were brought within uncomfortably close range of each other there was no avoiding his eye you know what he sneered none better i ffrench faltered blast you said haworth you played her like bait to a fishin your gentlemans fashion ffrench felt a little sick it was not unnatural that he should a man of refined instincts likes less than any other man to be confronted brutally with the fact that he has however delicately tampered with a coarseness haworth went on you knew how to do it and you did itgentleman way you knew me and you knew i was hard hit and you knew id make a big throw that was between us two though we never said a word id never give up a thing in my life before and i was mad for her she knew how to hold me off and gave me plenty to think of what else had you my lad haworths didnt want a gentleman haworths didnt want brass and youd none to give if it did it wasnt you who was took in partner it was what jem haworth was aiming atand has missed by he got up and pushing his chair back made a stride toward the door ffrench was sure he was going away without another word but he suddenly stopped and turned back id sooner take hell than whats comin he repeated in a hoarse whisper and its you thats brought it on me but if id got what i aimed at it might have come and welcome then he went out he went across to the works and going into his room he found murdoch standing at one of the windows gazing out at something in the street he was haggard and gaunt and had a vacant look it occurred to haworth that some sudden physical ailment had attacked him he went up to his side what have you found lad he demanded the next instant his own eyes discovered what it was an open carriage was just drawing up before the bank rachel ffrench sat in it and saint meran was with her he looked at them a second or so and then looked at murdochat his wretched face and his hollow eyes an unsavory exclamation burst from him what he cried out after it theres another man is there is it that yes was murdochs monotonous reply theres another man chapter xliii even the same evening m saint meran had the pleasure of meeting a person of whom he had heard much and in whom he was greatly interested this person was the master of haworths who came in after dinner if he had found murdoch a little trying and wearisome m saint meran found haworth astounding he was not at all prepared for him when he walked into the room as if it were his own gave a bare halfnod to ffrench and carried himself aggressively to miss ffrenchs side saint meran was transfixed with astonishment he had heard faint rumors of something like this before but he never dreamed of seeing it he retreated within himself and proceeded to study minutely the manners and characteristics of the successful manufacturers of great britain he is very large he said with soft sarcasm to miss ffrench very large indeed that replied miss ffrench is probably the result of the iron trade the truth was that he seemed to fill the room the time had passed when he was ill at ease in the house now he was cool to defiance ffrench had never found him so embarrassing as he was upon this particular evening he spoke very little sitting in his chair silent with a gloomy and brooding look when he directed his attention upon any one it was upon rachel the prolonged gaze which he occasionally fixed upon her was one of evil scrutiny which stirred her usually cool blood not a little she never failed however to meet it with composure at last she did a daring thing under cover of a conversation between her father and saint meran she went to the table at his side and began to turn over the books upon it i think she said in an undertone that you have something to say to me aye he answered i have that and the timell come when i shall say it too you think im afraid to hear it she continued follow me into the next room and see then she addressed her father speaking aloud your plans for the new bank are in the next room i believe she said i wish to show them to mr haworth yyes he admitted somewhat reluctantly they are on my table she passed through the folding doors and haworth followed her she stopped at one of the windows and waited for him to speak and it was during this moment in which she waited that he saw in her face what he had not seen beforea faint pallor and a change which was not so much a real change as the foreshadowing of one to come he saw it now because it chanced that the light struck full upon her now she said say your say but let me tell you that i shall listen not because i feel a shadow of interest in it but because i know you thought i shrank from hearing it he pushed open the french window and strode on to the terrace step out here he said she went out this he said glancing about him this is th place you stood on th night you showed yourself to the strikers she made no answer its as good a place as any he went on im going to have it out with you he said with bitter significance then for the first time it struck her that she had overstepped the mark and done a dangerous thing but she would have borne a great deal sooner than turn back and so she remained ive stood it a long time he said and now im going to reckon up theres a good bit of reckoning up to be done betwixt you and me for all youve held me at arms length i am glad she put in that you acknowledge that i did hold you at arms length and that you were not blind to it oh he answered i wasnt blind to it no more than you were blind to the other and from first to last its been my comfort to remember that you werent blind to the otherthat you knew it as well as i did ive held to that he came close to her when i give up what id worked twenty year to get what did i give it up for for you when i took ffrench in partner what did i run the risk for for you what was to pay me you his close presence in the shadow was so intolerable to her that she could have cried out but she did not you made a poor bargain she remarked aye a poor bargain but you were one in it you bore it in your mind and youve bore it there from then till now and ive got a hold on you through it thats worth summat to me if i never came nigh nor touched you you knew it and you let it be no other chap can pay more for you than jem haworths paid ive got that to think of she made a gesture with her hand iihush she cried i will not hear it stop it if you can call em if you want and let em hearth new chap and all you shall hear if all broxton comes ive paid twentyfive year of work and sweat and grime ive paid haworthsfor im a ruined chap as i stand here and but for you id have got through there was a shock in these last words if they were true the blow would fall on her too what she falteredwhat do you mean th strikes begun it he answered laconically and with a jerk of his thumb toward the room in which her father sat he finished it he tried some of his gentleman pranks in a quiet way and he lost money on em hes lost it again and again and tried to cover it with fresh shifts and its haworths that must pay for em itll come sooner or later and you may make up your mind to it what were you doing she demanded sharply you might have known aye he returned what was i doing i used to be a sharp chap enow ive not been as sharp i th last twelvemonth and he was up to it he thought it was his own brass likelyhed give summat for it as belonged to him he came nearer to the light and eyed her over youve had your day he said youve made a worse chap of me than i need have been youyou lost me a friend i hadnt counted that in youve done worse by him than youve done by me he was th finer mak of th two and itll go harder with him when i came in he was hanging about the roadside looking up at the house he didnt see me but i saw him hell be there many a night i dare say id be ready to swear hes there now whom do you mean i meanmurdoch the very sound of his own voice seemed to fire him with rage she saw a look in his eye which caused her to shrink back but she was too late he caught her by the arm and dragged her toward him a second later when he released her she staggered to one of the rustic seats and sank crouching into it hiding her face in the folds of her dress she had not cried out however nor uttered a sound and he had known she would not he stood looking down at her a gentleman wouldnt have done it he said hoarsely im not a gentleman youve held me off and trampled me under foot thatll leave us a bit even and he turned on his heel and walked away into the darkness chapter xliv why do you cry for me when he said that he had seen murdoch standing in the road before the house he had spoken the truth it was also true that even as they stood upon the terrace he was there still he was there every night where he slept or when or if at all his mother and christian did not know they only knew that he never spent a night at home they barely saw him from day to day when he came home in the morning and evening it was to sit at the table rarely speaking scarcely tasting food only drinking greedily the cup of strong coffee christian always had in readiness for him the girl was very good to him in these days she watched him in terror of his unnatural mood he hardly seemed to see them when they were in the room with him his eyes were hollow and burning bright he grew thin and narrowchested and stooped his hands were unsteady when he lifted anything when she was alone christian said to herself again and again he will die there is no help for it he will dieor worse one morning she came down to find him lying on the sofa with closed eyes and such a deathly face that she almost cried out aloud but she restrained herself and went into the kitchen as if to perform her usual tasks not long afterward she returned carrying a little tray with a cup of hot coffee upon it will you drink this for me she said to him he opened his eyes a little impatiently but he sat up and drank it its very good he said as he fell back again into his old position but you mustnt put yourself to trouble for me afterward the coffee was always ready for him when he came in and he got into the habit of drinking it mechanically the books he had been accustomed to pore over at every leisure moment lay unopened he neither touched nor looked at them the two women tried to live their lives as if nothing were happening they studiously avoided questioning or appearing to observe him we must not let him think that we talk of him christian said she showed a wonderful gentleness and tact until long afterward mrs murdoch scarcely knew what support and comfort she had in her her past life had planted in her a readiness to despair he is like his father she said once he was like him as a child he is very trusting and faithful but when his belief is gone it is all over he has given up as his father did before he died he will not try to live he did not try to live but he did not think of death he was too full of other morbid thoughts he could not follow any idea far a thousand of them came and went and in the end were as nothing why he kept saying to himself weakly and wearilywhy was it what had i done it was a strange thing to choose me out of so many i was hardly worth it to have chosen another man would have served her better he did not know how the days passed at the works the men began to gaze at him askance and mutter when he went by th feyther went daft they said is this chap goin th same way it was only the look of his face which made them say so he got through his work one way or another but the days were his dread the nights strange and dreadful enough were better than the broad daylight with the scores of hands about him and the clangor of hammers and whir of machinery he fell into the habit of going to the engineroom and standing staring at the engine fascinated by it once he drew nearer and nearer with such a look in his eye that floxham began to regard him stealthily he went closer pace by pace and at last made a step which brought a shout from floxham who sprang upon him and tore him away what art at tha foo he yelled does tha want to go whoam on a shutter wakening with a long breath he said i forgot that was it i was thinking of another thing the time came at length when he had altered so that when he went out his mother and christian often sat up together half the night trembling with a fear neither of them would have put into words as they sat trying to talk each would glance at the other stealthily and when their eyes met each would start as if with some guilty thought on one of the worst and most dreadful of nights christian suddenly rose from her seat crossed the hearth and threw herself upon her knees before her companion i am going out she said dontdont try to keep me it is midnight said mrs murdoch andyou dont know where to go yes the girl returned i do for gods sake let me go i cannot bear it the woman gave her a long look and then said a strange and cruel thing you had better stay where you are it is not you he wants no she said bitterly it is not i he wants but i can find him and make surethathe will come back and then you will go to sleep she left her in spite of her efforts to detain her she was utterly fearless and went into the night as if there was no such thing as peril on earth she did know where to go and went there murdoch was standing opposite the house in which rachel ffrench slept she went to him and put her hand on his arm what are you doing here she said in a low voice he turned and gave her a cold vacant look he did not seem at all surprised at finding her dark beautiful young face at his very shoulder i dont know can you tell me we have been waiting for you she said we cannot rest when you are away do you want me to go home and go to bed decently and sleep he said do you suppose i would not if i could i always start from here and come back here i say to myself it will take me an hour to reach the place where i can see her window it is something to hold ones mind in check with this ramblingandand forgetting what one has meant to think about is a terrible thing come home with me she said we will not talk you can lie on the sofa and we will go away i want your mother to sleep something in her presence began to influence him to a saner mood what are you doing here he asked it is midnight i am not afraid i could not bear to stay in the house we sit there an idea seemed to strike him suddenly he stopped her and asked deliberately did you come because you thought i might do myself harm she would not answer and after waiting a second or so he went on slowly i have thought i might myselfsometimes but never for long you have no need to fear i am always stopped by the thought thatperhapsit is not worth it after all when things look clearer i shall get over it yesi think i shall get over itthough now there seems to be no end butsome dayit will comeand i shall get over it dont be afraid that i shall do myself harm if i am not killedbefore the end comesi shall not kill myself i shall know it was not worth it after all the tears had been running down her cheeks as she stood but she bit her lip and forced herself to breathe evenly so that he might not find her out but just then as he moved a great drop fell upon the back of his hand he stopped and began to tremble good heavens he cried you are crying why do you cry for me because i cannot help it she said in a halfwhisper i do not cry often i never cried for any one before ill take you home he said moving slowly along at her side dont cry chapter xlv it is worse than i thought a week or so later saint meran went away ffrench informed his partner of this fact with a secret hope of its producing upon him a somewhat softening effect but haworth received the statement with coolness hell come back again he said let him alone for that the general impression was that he would return the opinion most popular in the more humble walks of broxton society was that he had gone to get hissen ready an ha th papers drawed up and that he would appear some fine day with an imposing retinue settle an enormous fortune upon miss ffrench and having been united to her with due grandeur and solemnity would disappear with her to indefinitely furrin parts there seemed to be little change in rachel ffrenchs life and manner however she began to pay rather more strict attention to her social duties and consequently went out oftener this might possibly be attributed to the fact that remaining indoors was somewhat dull haworth and murdoch came no more and after saint merans departure a sort of silence seemed to fall upon the house ffrench himself felt it when he came in at night and was naturally restless under it perhaps miss ffrench felt it too though she did not say so one morning janey briarley sitting nursing the baby in the doorway of the cottage glanced upward from her somewhat arduous task to find a tall and graceful figure standing before her in the sun she had been too busily engaged to hear footsteps and there had been no sound of carriagewheels so the visitor had come upon her entirely unawares it cannot be said she received her graciously her whilom admiration had been much tempered by sharp distrust very early in her acquaintance with its object art tha coomin in she asked unceremoniously yes said miss ffrench i am coming in janey got up and made room for her to pass and when she had passed gave her a chair very much overweighted by the baby as she did so does tha want to see mother if your mother is busy you will serve every purpose the housekeeper told me that mrs dixon was ill and as i was passing i thought i would come in janeys utter disbelief in this explanation was a sentiment not easily concealed even by an adept in controlling facial expression and she was not an adept but miss ffrench was not at all embarrassed by any demonstration of a lack of faith which she might have perceived when janey resumed her seat she broke the silence by an entirely unexpected observation she touched the baby delicately with the point of her parasolvery delicately indeed i suppose she remarked that this is an extremely handsome child this with the air of one inquiring for information nay he is na retorted janey unrelentingly hes good enow but he nivver wur hurt wi good looks none on em wur an hes fouest o th lot i should think tha could see that fur thysen oh replied miss ffrench then i suppose i am wrong my idea was that at that age children all looked alike loike him said janey dryly did tha think as tha did as the young briarley in question was of a stolid and unornamental type uncertain of feature and noticeable chiefly for a large and unusually bald head of extraordinary phrenological development this gave the matter an entirely novel aspect perhaps said miss ffrench i scarcely regarded it from that point of view then she changed the subject how is mrs dixon she inquired shes neyther better nor worse was the answer an a mort o trouble that is unfortunate who cares for her mother shes th ony one as can do owt wi her is there no one else she has a fancy foryour father for instance inquired miss ffrench she conna bide th soight o him an hes feart to go nigh her th ony man as she ivver looked at wur murdoch answered janey i think i remember his saying she had made friends with him is she as fond of him now i dunnot know as i could ca it bein fond on him she is na fond o nobody but she says hes getten a bit more sense than th common run it is rather goodnatured on his part to come to see her he does na coom to see her he has na been nigh th house fur a month hes been ill hissen or summat hes up an about but hed getten a face loike death th last toime i seed him happen hes goin off loike his feyther how is that did na tha know with some impatience as he went crazy over summat he wur makkin an deed cause he could na mak out to finish it its th very thing murdoch took up hissen an th stroikers wur so set agin i think i remember there was a story about the father do youthink he is really ill murdoch aye i domakless noise tummos henry this to the child that is a great pity ah there is the carriage one of her gloves had been lying upon her lap when she stood up it dropped she bent to pick it up and as she did so something fell tinkling upon the flag floor and rolled under a table it was one of her rings janey brought it back to her it mun ha been too large fur thee she said or thart gettin thin seems loike thart a bit different to what tha wur with a glance at her never mind that she answered sharply as she handed her some money give this to your mother and she dropped the ring into her purse instead of putting it on again and went out to her carriage janey stood and watched her she is a bit thinner or summat she remarked but she need na moind that its genteel enow to be thin an i dunnot know as it ud hurt her rachel ffrench went home and the same afternoon murdoch came to her for the last time he had not intended to come in his wildest moments he had never thought of going to her again but as he passed along the road intending to spend the afternoon in wandering across the country he looked up at the windows of the house and a strange fancy seized upon him he would go in and ask her the question he had asked himself again and again it did not seem to him at the time a strange thing to do it looked wonderfully simple and natural in his strained and unnatural mood he turned in at the gate with only one feelingthat perhaps she would tell him and then it would be over she saw him come up the path and wondered if the man at the door would remember the charge she had given him it chanced that he did not remember or that he was thrown off his guard she heard feet on the stairs in a few seconds and almost immediately murdoch was in the room what she thought when being brought thus near to him she saw and recognized the dreadful change in him god knows she supported herself with her hand upon the back of her chair as she rose there was a look in his face almost wolfish he would not sit down and in three minutes broke through the barrier of her effort at controlling him it was impossible for her to control him as she might have controlled another man i have only a few words to say he said i have come to ask you a question i think that is allonly to ask you a question will you tell me he said what wrong i have done you she put her other hand on the chair and held it firmly will you tell me she said almost in a whisper what wrong i have done you she remained so looking at him and he at her with a terrible helplessness through a moment of dead silence she dropped her face upon her hands as she held the chair and so stood he fell back a pace gazing at her still i have heard of women who fancied themselves injured he said planning to revenge themselves upon the men who had intentionally or unintentionally wounded their pride i remember such things in books i have read not in real life and once or twice the thought has crossed my mind that at some time in the past i might in my poor ignorance have presumedorblundered in some way toanger youand that this has been my punishment it is only a wild thought but it was a straw to cling to and i would rather believe it wild as it is than believe that what you have done has been done wantonly can it beis it true no but she did not lift her face it is not no then it is worse than i thought he said the words slowly and clearly and they were his last having said them he went away without a backward glance chapter xlvi once again in half an hours time murdoch had left broxton far behind him he left the open road and rambled across fields and through lanes the people in the farmhouses who knew him saw him pass looking straight before him and walking steadily like a man with an end in view his mind was full of one purposethe determination to control himself and keep his brain clear now he said let me think it overnow let me look at it in cold blood the effort he made was something gigantic it was a matter of physical as well as mental force he had wavered and been vague long enough now the time had come to rouse himself through sheer power of will or give up the reins and drift with the current a lost man at dusk he reached dillup and roamed about the streets half conscious of his surroundings the saturdaynight shopping was going on and squalid women hurrying past him with their baskets on their arms glanced up wondering at his dark face and preoccupied air hes noan dillup they said one good woman going so far as to add that she did na loike th looks on him neyther with various observations upon the moral character of foreigners in general he saw nothing of the sensation he created however he rambled about erratically until he felt the need of rest and then went into a clean little shop and bought some simple food and ate it sitting upon the tall stool before the counter watched by the stout whiteaproned matron in charge tha looks poorly mester she said as she handed him his change he started a little on hearing her voice but recovered himself readily oh no he said im right enough i think im an american and i suppose we are rather a gauntlooking lot as a rule merikin art tha she replied well to be sure happen thats it good naturedly ive allus heerd they wur a poor color merikin wellsurely the fact of his being an american seemed to impress her deeply she received his thanks she was not often thanked by her customers as a mysterious though not disagreeable result of his nationality and as he closed the door after him he heard as an accompaniment to the tinkling of the shopbell her amiably surprised ejaculation a merikin wellsurely a few miles from broxton there was a substantial little stone bridge upon which he had often sat in passing it again and again it had gradually become a sort of resting place for him it was at a quiet point of the road and sitting upon it he had thought out many a problem when he reached it on his way back he stopped and took his usual seat looking down into the slow little stream beneath and resting against the low buttress he had not come to work out a problem now he felt that he had worked his problem out in the past six hours it was not worth it he said noit was not worth it after all when he went on his way again he was very tired and he wondered drearily whether when he came near the old miserable stopping place he should not falter and feel the fascination strong upon him again he had an annoying fear of the mere possibility of such a thing when he saw the light striking slantwise upon the trees it might draw him toward it as it had done so often beforeeven in spite of his determination and struggles half a mile above the house a great heat ran over him and then a deadly chill but he went on steadily there was this for him that for the first time he could think clearly and not lose himself he came nearer to it and nearer and it grew in brightness he fancied he had never seen it so bright before he looked up at it and then away he was glad that having once looked he could turn away there had been many a night when he could not then he was under the shadow of the trees and knew that his dread had been only a fancy and that he was a saner man than he had thought and the light was left behind him and he did not look back but went on when he reached home the house was utterly silent he entered with his latchkey and finding all dark went upstairs noiselessly the door of his own room was closed and when he opened it he found darkness there also he struck a match and turned on the light for a moment its sudden glare blinded him and then he turned involuntarily toward the farther corner of the room why he did so he did not know at the timethe movement was the result of an uncontrollable impulsebut after he had looked he knew the light shone upon the empty chair in its old placeand upon the table and upon the model standing on it he did not utter any exclamation strangely enough he did not at first feel any shock or surprise he advanced toward it slowly but when at last he stood near it the shock came his heart beat as if it would burst what falseness is there in me he cried that i should have forgotten it he was stricken with burning shame he did not ask himself how it was that it stood there in its place he thought of nothing but the lack in himself which was so deep a humiliation everything else was swept away he sank into the chair and sat staring at it i had forgotten it he saidforgotten it and then he put out his hand and touched and moved itand drew it toward him about an hour afterward he was obliged to go downstairs for something he needed it was to the sittingroom he went and when he pushed the door open he found a dim light burning and saw that some one was lying upon the sofa his first thought was that it was his mother who had waited for him but it was not sheit was christian murdoch fast asleep with her face upon her arm her hat and gloves were thrown upon the table and she still wore a long gray cloak which was stained and damp about the hem he saw this as soon as he saw her face and no sooner saw than he understood he went to the sofa and stood a moment looking down at her and though he did not speak or stir she awakened she sat up and pushed her cloak aside and he spoke to her it was you who brought it back he said yes she answered quietly i thought that if you saw it in the old place again you would remember you did not forget it i had nothing else to think of was her simple reply i must seem a poor sort of fellow to you he said wearily i am a poor sort of fellow no she said or i should not have thought it worth while to bring it back he glanced down at her dress and then up at her face you had better go upstairs to bed he said the dew has made your dress and cloak damp thank you for what you have done she got up and turned away goodnight she said goodnight he answered and watched her out of the room then he found what he required and went back to his work only more than once as he bent over it he thought again of the innocent look of her face as it had rested upon her arm while she slept chapter xlvii a footstep he went out no more at night from the moment he laid his hand upon the model again he was safer than he knew gradually the old fascination reasserted itself there were hours of lassitude and weariness to be borne and moments of unutterable bitterness and disgust for life in which he had to fight sharp battles against the poorer side of his nature but always at the worst there was something which made itself a point to fix thought upon he could force himself to think of this when if he had had no purpose in view he would have been a lost man the keen sense of treachery to his own resolve stung him but it was a spur after all the strength of the reaction had its physical effect upon him and sometimes he suddenly found himself weak to exhaustionso weak that any exertion was impossible and he was obliged to leave his post at the works and return home for rest at such times he lay for hours upon the narrow sofa in the dull little room as his father had done long before and wore a look so like him that one day his mother coming into the room not knowing he was there cried out aloud and staggered backward clutching at her breast her manner toward him softened greatly in these days it was more what it had been in his boyhood when she had watched over him with patient and unfailing fondness once he awakened to see her standing a few paces from his side seeming to have been there some moments ifi have seemed hard to you in your trouble she said forgive me she spoke without any prelude and did not seem to expect any answer turning away and going about her work at once but he felt that he need feel restless and chilled in her presence no longer he did not pursue his task at home but took the model down to the works and found a place for it in his little workcell the day he did so he was favored by a visit from haworth it was the first since the rupture between them since then they had worked day after day with only the door between them they had known each others incomings and outgoings but had been as far apart as if a world separated them haworth had known more of murdoch than murdoch had known of him no change in him had escaped his eye he had seen him struggle and reach his climax at last he had jeered at him as a poor enough fellow with fine whitelivered fancies and a womans way of bearing himself he had raged at and cursed him and now and then had been lost in wonder at him but he had never fathomed him from first to last but within the last few weeks his mood had changedslowly it is true but it had changed his bearing had changed too murdoch himself gradually awakened to a recognition of this fact in no small wonder he was less dogged and aggressive and showed less illwill that he should appear suddenly almost in his old way was a somewhat startling state of affairs but he crossed the threshold coolly he sat down and folded his arms on the table you brought summat down with you this morning he said what was it murdoch pointed to the wooden case which stood on a shelf a few feet from him it was that he answered that he repeated what youre at work at it again are you yes well look sharp after it thats all theres a grudge bore again it i know that murdoch answered to my cost i brought it here because i thought it would be safer aye itll be safer take my advice and keep it close and work at it at nights when th place is quiet theres a key asll let you in and he flung a key down upon the table murdoch picked it up mechanically he felt as if he could scarcely be awake it seemed as if the man must have brought his purpose into the room with him having thought it over beforehand his manner by no means disarmed the suspicion it is the favor i should have asked if i had thought haworth left his chair theres th key he said abruptly use it no other chap would get it he went back to his own room and murdoch was left to his surprise he finished his work for the day and went home remaining there until night came on then he went back to the works having first told christian of his purpose i am going to the works he said i may be there all night dont wait for me or feel anxious when the great building loomed up before him in the dark his mind recalled instantly the night he had entered it before attracted by the light in the window there was no light about it now but that shut in the lantern he carried the immensity and dead stillness would have been a trying thing for many a man to encounter but as he relocked the door and made his way to his den he thought of them only from one point of view it is the silence of the grave he said a man can concentrate himself upon his work as if there was not a human breath stirring within a mile of him somehow even his room wore a look which seemed to belong to the silence of nighta look he felt he had not seen before he marked it with a vague sense of mystery when he set his lantern down upon the table turning the light upon the spot on which his work would stand then he took down the case and opened it and removed the model it will not be forgotten again he thought aloud if it is to be finished it will be finished here half the night passed before he returned home when he did so he went to his room and slept heavily until daylight he had never slept as he slept in these nightsheavy dreamless sleep from which at first he used to awaken with a start and a perfectly blank sense of loss and dread but which became at last unbroken night after night found him at his labor it grew upon him he longed for it through the day he could not have broken from it if he would once as he sat at his table he fancied that he heard a lock click and afterward a stealthy footstep it was a sound so faint and indistinct that his disbelief in its reality was immediate but he got up taking his lantern with him and went out to look at the entrance passage it was empty and dark and the door was shut and locked as he had left it he went back to his work little disturbed he had not really expected to find the traces of any presence in the place but he had felt it best to make the matter safe perhaps the fact that once or twice on other nights the same light indefinite sound fell upon his ear again made him feel rather more secure than otherwise having examined the place again and with the same result it troubled him no more he set it down to some ordinary material cause after his first visit haworth came into his room often why he came murdoch did not understand very clearly he did not come to talk sometimes he scarcely spoke at all he was moody and abstracted he went about the place wearing a hard and reckless look utterly unlike any roughness and hardness he had shown before the hands who had cared the least for his not altogether illnatured tempests in days gone by shrank or were restive before him now he drove all before him or passed through the rooms sullenly it was plain to see that he was not the man he had beenthat he had even lost strength and was suddenly worn and broken though neither flesh nor color had failed him among those who had made a lion of him he was more popular than ever the fact that he had held out against ill luck when so many had gone down was constantly quoted the strikes which had kept up an uneven but prolonged struggle had been the ruin of many a manufacturer who had thought he could battle any storm haworths had held its own and weathered the worst this was what the county potentates were fond of saying upon all occasionsparticularly when they wanted haworth to dine with them at their houses he used to accept their invitations and then go and sit at their dinnertables with a sardonic face his humor it was remarked with some regret was often of a sardonic kind occasionally he laughed at the wrong time and his jokes were not always easy to smile under it was also remarked that mr ffrench scarcely seemed comfortable upon these festive occasions of late he had not been in the enjoyment of good health he explained that he suffered from nervous headaches and depression his refined wellmolded face had become rather thin and fatiguedlooking he had lost his effusive eloquence he often sat silent and started nervously when spoken to but he did not eschew society at all always going out upon any state occasion when his partner was to be a feature of the feast once upon such an occasion he had said privately and with some plaintiveness to haworth i dont think i can go tonight my dear fellow i really dont feel quite equal to it blast you said haworth dispensing with social codes youll go whether youre up to it or not well keep it up to the end itll be over soon enough he evinced interest in the model in his visits to the workroom which seemed a little singular to murdoch he asked questions about it and more than once repeated his caution concerning its being kept close ive got it into my head that youll finish it some of these days he said once if naught happens to it or you chapter xlviii finished one night murdoch on leaving the house said to christian dont expect me until morning i may not be back until then i think i shall work all night she did not ask him why for several days she had seen that a singular mood was upon him that he was restless sometimes when he met her eye unexpectedly he started and colored and turned away as if he was a little afraid she stood upon the step and watched him until he disappeared in the darkness and then shut the door and went in to his mother a quarter of an hour afterward he entered his workroom and shut himself in and brought out the model he sat looking at it a moment and then stretched forth his hand to touch it suddenly he drew it back and let it fall heavily upon the table good heavens he cried did he ever feel so near as this and then fail the shock was almost unbearable are there to be two of us he said was not one enough but he put forth his hand again a minute later though his heart beat like a triphammer it rests with me to prove it he saidwith me as he worked the dead silence about him seemed to become more intense his own breathing was a distinct sound light as it was the accidental dropping of a tool upon the table was a jar upon him the tolling of the church bell at midnight was unbearable he even took out his watch and stopped it but at length he knew neither sound nor stillness he forgot both it had been a dark night but the morning rose bright and clear the sun streaming in at the one window fell upon the model pushed far back upon the table and on murdoch himself sitting with his forehead resting upon his hands he had been sitting thus some timehe did not know how long he had laid his last tool down before the first streak of pink had struck across the gray sky he was tired and chill with the morning air but he had not thought of going home yet or even quite recognized that the night was past his lantern still burned beside him he was roused at last by a sound in the outer room the gates had not been unlocked nor the bell rung but some one had come in the next moment haworth opened the door and stood in the threshold looking in on him youve been here all night he said illustration youve been here all night yes answered murdoch he turned a little and pointed to the model speaking slowly as if he were but half awake i think he said that it is complete he said it with so little appearance of emotion or exultation that haworth was dumbfounded he laid a hand on his shoulder and shook him a little wake up man he said youre dazed no he answered not dazed ive had time to think it over it has been finished two or three hours all at once he burst into a laugh i did not think he said that it would be you i should tell the news to first haworth sat down near him with a dogged face nay he replied nor me either they sat and stared at each other for a moment in silence then murdoch drew a long wearied breath but it is done he said nevertheless after that he got up and began to make his preparations to go home while haworth sat and watched him i shall want to go away he said when i come back i shall know what the result is to be start tomorrow morning said haworth and keep close by the time you come back he stopped and left his chair and the bell which called the hands to work began its hurried clanging at the door he paused when shall you take it away he asked tonight murdoch answered after dark at home he only told them one thingthat in the morning he was going to london and did not know when he should return he did not go to the works during the day but remained at home trying to rest but he could not sleep and the day seemed to lag heavily in the afternoon he left the sofa on which he had lain through the morning and went out he walked slowly through the town and at last turned down the lane which led to the briarleys cottage he felt as if there would be a sort of relief to the tenseness of his mood in a brief interview with janey when he went into the house mr briarley was seated in mrs dixons chair unscientifically balancing his latestborn upon his knee his aspect was grave and absorbed he was heated and disheveled with violent exertion the knot of his blue cotton neckerchief had twisted itself under his right ear in a painfully suggestive manner under some stress of circumstances he had been suddenly pressed into service and his mode of placating his offspring was at once unprofessional and productive of frantic excitement but the moment he caught sight of murdoch an alarming change came upon him his eyes opened to their fullest extent his jaw fell and the color died out of his face he rose hurriedly dropped the youngest briarley into his chair and darted out of the house in such trepidation that his feet slipped under him when he reached the lower step where he fell with a loud clatter of wooden clogs scrambling up again with haste and difficulty and disappearing at once attracted by the disturbance janey darted in from the inner room barely in time to rescue the deserted young briarley wheers he gone she demanded signifying her father i towd her he wur na fit to be trusted wheers he gone i dont know murdoch answered i think he ran away because he saw me what is the trouble nay dunnot ax me we canna mak him out neyther mother nor me hes been settin i th house fur three days as if he wur feart to stir outsettin by th fire an shakin his yed an cryin ivvery now and then an heres her i th back room to wait on a noice toime this is fur him to pick to go off in he mowt ha waited till she wur done wi as conversation naturally could not flourish under these circumstances after a few minutes murdoch took his leave it seemed that he had not yet done with mr briarley passing through the gate he caught sight of a forlorn figure seated upon the roadside about twenty yards before him wearing a fustian jacket and a blue neckcloth knotted under the ear as he approached mr briarley looked up keeping his eyes fixed upon him in a despairing gaze he did not remove his glance at all in fact until murdoch was within ten feet of him when for some entirely inexplicable reason he rose hurriedly and passed to the other side of the road and at a distance of some yards ahead sat down and stared wildly at him again this singular course he pursued until they had reached the end of the lane where he sat and watched murdoch out of sight i thowt he said breathing with extreme shortness as he ha done fur me it wur a wonder as he did na if id coom nigh him or hed coom nigh me theyd ha swore it wur me as did it ans gone accordin if luck went agin em then a sudden panic seemed to seize him he pulled off his cap and holding it in both hands stared into it as if in desperate protest against fate a large tear fell into the crown and then another and another i canna help it he said in a loud and sepulchral whisper look out look out and then probably feeling that even in this he might be committing himself fatally he got up glanced fearfully about him and scuttled away chapter xlix if aughts for me remember it before he left the house at night murdoch had a brief interview with his mother i am going to london as he went he saidon the same errand the end may be what it was before i have felt very surebut he was sure too yes the woman answered he was very sure i dont ask you to trust itor me he said he gave a life to it i have not given a year and he was the better man a thousandfold i he said with a shadow falling on his face have not proved myself as he did he never faltered from the first no she said would to god he had but when he went she followed him to the door and said the words she had refused him when he had first told her he had taken the burden upon his shoulders god speed you she said i will try to believe his plan was to go to his room pack his case securely and then carry it with him to the station in time to meet the late train he had decided on taking he let himself into the works as usual and found his way along the passage in the darkness though he carried his lantern he knew his way so well that he did not need it there but when he reached haworths room and put out his hand to open the door he stopped his touch met no resistance for the door was wide open the discovery was so sharp a shock to him that for a few seconds he remained motionless but he recovered himself in a second or so more it might have been the result of carelessness after all so he turned on his light and went into his cell and began his task it did not take him long when he had finished the wooden case was simply a solid square brown parcel which might have contained anything he glanced at his watch and sat down a minute or so there is no use in going too early he said and so he waited a little thinking mechanically of the silence inside and the darkness out and of the journey which lay before him but at last he got up again and took his burden by the cord he had fastened about it now he said it is time at the very moment the words left his lips there was a sound outside the door and a rush upon him he was seized by the throat flung backward into the chair he had left and held there he made no outcry his first thought when he found himself clutched and overpowered was an incongruous one of briarley sitting on the roadside and looking up at him in panicstricken appeal he understood in a flash what his terror had meant the fellow who held him by the collarthere were three of them and one was reddyshook him roughly wheer is it he said you know whatten weve coom for my lad murdoch was conscious of a little chill which passed over him but otherwise he could only wonder at his own lack of excitement no better place to finish a man than such a one as this at dead of night and there was not one of the three who had not evil in his eye but he spoke without a tremor in his voicewith the calmness of being utterly without stay or help yes i suppose i know he said you came to me for it before what are you going to do with it smash it to h said one concisely an thee too it was not a pleasant thing to hear by the half light of a lantern in a place so deadly still murdoch felt the little chill again but he remembered that after all he had one slender chance if he could make them listen you are making a blunder he began reddy stopped him by addressing his comrades what art tha stondin hearkenin to him fur he demanded smack him i th mouth an stop him murdoch gave a lurch forward which it gave his captor some trouble to restrain he turned dangerously white and his eye blazed if you do you devil he panted ill murder you wheer is th thing we coom fur said the first man and then he caught sight of the package which had fallen upon the floor happen its i theer he suggested oppen it chaps then all at once murdochs calmness was gone he shook in their grasp for gods sake he cried dont touch it dont do it a harm its a mistake it has nothing to do with your trade it would be no hurt to you if it were known to the whole world for gods sake believe me weve heerd a different mak o tale fro that said reddy laughing its a liea lie who told it jem haworth he was answered jem haworth as it wur made fur he began to struggle with all his strength he cried out aloud and sprang up and broke loose and fought with the force of madness you shall pay for it he shrieked and three to one as they were he held them for a moment at bay gi him th knobstick cried one at him wi it it was reddy who aimed the blow at hima blow that would have laid him a dead man among thembut it never fell for he sprang forward with a mighty effort and struck the bludgeon upward and as it fell with a crash at the opposite side of the room they heard even above the tumult of their struggle a rush of heavy feet a voice every man among them knew and the sound they most dreadedthe sharp report of a pistol illustration it was reddy who aimed the blow its haworth they shouted haworth and they made a dash at the door in a body stumbling over one another striking and cursing and the scoundrel who first got through and away was counted a lucky man murdoch took a step forward and fellso close to the model that his helpless hand touched it as it lay it was not long before he returned to consciousness his sudden loss of strength had only been a sort of climax body and mind had reached together when he opened his eyes again his first thought was a wonder at himself and a vague effort to comprehend his weakness he looked up at haworth who bent over him lie still a bit lad he heard him say lie and rest thee he no sooner heard his voice than he forgot his weak wonder at himself in a stronger wonder at him he was ashen pale and a tremor shook him as he spoke lie still and rest thee he repeated and he touched his head with an approach to gentleness they thought there was more than me he said and theyre not fond of powder and lead theyre better used to knobsticks and vitriol in the dark they meant to murder me said murdoch aye make sure o that they werent for play theyve had their minds on this for a month or two if id been a minute later he did not finish a queer spasm of the throat stopped him he rose the next instant and struck a match and turned the gas on to full blaze lets have light he said theers a look about th place i cant stand his eyes were bloodshot his face looked gray and deeply lined and his lips were parched there was a new haggardness upon him and he was conscious of it and tried to bear it down with his old bravado theyll not come back he said theyve had enough for tonight if theyd known i was alone theyd have made a stand for it they think they were in luck to get off he came back and sat down they laid their plans better than i thought he added they got over me for once devil take em how art tha now lad murdoch made the effort to rise and succeeded though he was not very strong upon his feet and sank into a chair feeling a little irritated at his own weakness giddy he answered and a trifle faint its a queer business i went down as if id been shot i have an hour and a half to steady myself before the next train comes in let me make the best of it youll go tonight said haworth theres a stronger reason than ever that i should go he answered let me get it out of the way and safe for heavens sake haworth squared his arms upon the table and leaned on them then he said ive got an hour and a half to make a clean breast of it he said it almost with a swagger and yet his voice was hoarse and his coolness a miserable pretense ask me he said how i came here and not waiting for a reply even while murdoch gazed at him bewildered he answered the question himself i come he said for a good reasonfor the same reason thats brought me here every night youve been at work murdoch repeated his last words mechanically he was not quite sure the man was himself every night ive been at work aye every one on em theres not been a night ive not been nigh you and ready a memory flashed across murdochs mind with startling force it was you i heard come in he cried it was not fancy aye it was me there was a moments silence between them in which murdoch thought with feverish rapidity it was you he said with some bitterness at lastyou who set the plot on foot aye it was me i could have done the job i wanted to do in a quicker way he went on after a seconds pause but that wasnt my humor id a mind to keep out of it myself and i knew how to set the chaps on as would do it in their own way what do you mean by it cried murdoch were you devil enough to mean to have my blood ayewhile i was in the humorthat and worse murdoch sprang up and began to pace the room his strength had come back to him with the fierce sense of repulsion which seized him its a blacker world than i thought he said we were friends oncefriends so we were he said hoarsely you were the first chap i ever made friends with and youll be the last its brought no good to either of us it might returned murdoch if let me finish my tale he said even doggedly i said to myself before i came you should hear it i swore id stop at naught and i kept my word i sowed a seed here and there and th soil was just right for it they were in the mood to hearken to aught and they hearkened but there came a time when i found out that things were worse with you than with me and had gone harder with you if youd won where i lost it would have been different but you lost most of the twoyoud the most to loseand i changed my mind he stopped a second and looked at murdoch who had come back and thrown himself into his chair again ive said many a time that you were a queer chap he went on as if half dubious of himself you are a queer chap at th start you got a hold on me and when i changed my mind you got a hold on me again i swore id undo what id done if i could i knew if the thing was finished and you got away with it theyd soon find out it was naught they need fret about so i swore to see you safe through i gave you the keys to come here to work and every night i came and waited until youd done and gone away i brought my pistols with me and kept a sharp lookout tonight i was late and theyd laid their plans and got here before me theres th beginning and theres th end you saved my life said murdoch let me remember that i changed my mind and swore to undo what id done theres naught for me in that my lad and plenty to go agen me after a little he pushed his chair back the times not up he said ive made short work of it pick up thy traps and well go over th place together and see that its safe he led the way carrying the lantern and murdoch followed him they went from one end of the place to the other and found all quiet the bars of a small lower window had been filed and wrenched out of place mr reddy and his friends having made their entrance through it theyve been on the lookout many a night before they made up their minds said haworth and they chose the right place to try afterward they went out together locking the door and the iron gates behind them and went down in company to the dark little station with its dim twinkling lights naturally they did not talk very freely now and then there was a blank silence of many minutes between them but at last the train thundered its way in and stopped and there was a feeble bustle to and fro among the sleepy officials and an opening and shutting and locking of doors when murdoch got into his empty compartment haworth stood at its step at the very last he spoke in a strange hurry when you come back he said when you come backperhaps there was a porter passing with a lantern which struck upon his face and showed it plainly he shrank back a moment as if he feared the light but when it was gone he drew near again and spoke through the window if theres aught in whats gone by thats for me he said remember it and with a gesture of farewell he turned away and was gone chapter l an afterdinner speech at dinner the next evening mr ffrench had a story to tell it was the rather exciting story of the completion of murdochs labor the night attack and his sudden departure exciting as it was however mr ffrench did not relate it in his most vivid manner his nervous ailments had increased of late and he was not in a condition to be vivacious and dramatic the incident came from him rather tamely upon the whole if it is the success he thinks it is he terminated he is a made manand he is not the fellow to deceive himself well he said rather drearily i have said it would be so as haworth had foreseen saint meran appeared upon the scene again he was present when the story was told and was much interested in it as a dramatic incident bringing the peculiarities of the manufacturing class of broxton into strong play if they had murdered him he remarked with critical niceness it would have been the most tragic of tragedies on the very eve of his lifes success a tragedy indeed and it is not bad either that it should have been his master who saved him why do you say master said miss ffrench coldly pardon me i thought mr ffrench interposed in some hurry oh he has always been such an uncommon young fellow that we have scarcely thought of him as a servant he has not been exactly a servant in fact ah replied saint meran i ask pardon again he had been not a little bewildered at the change he found in the household mr ffrench no longer expounded his views at length with refined vigor he frequently excused himself from the family circle on plea of severe indisposition and at other times he sat in singular and depressing silence he was evidently ill there were lines upon his forehead and circles about his eyes he had a perturbed air and started without any apparent cause a change showed itself in miss ffrench alsoso subtle as not to be easily described it was a change which was not pallor nor fragility it was an alteration which baffled him and yet forced him to recognize its presence constantly and to endeavor to comprehend it ffrench himself had seen it and pondered over it in secret when he sat in his private room at the bank bewildered and terrified even by the mere effort to think and face the future his burden was not a little increased by his remembrance of his hours at home more than all the rest he shrank from the day of reckoning with his daughter he had confronted haworth and borne the worst of his wrath the account of himself which he must render to her would be the most scathing ordeal of his life some women would pity me he said to himself but she will not truth to tell he looked forward pathetically to the possibility that hereafter their paths might lie apart fate had saved him one fearful responsibility at least her private fortune had been beyond his reach and she would still be a rich woman even when the worst came he could live on very little he told himself and there was always some hope for a man of resources he still believed somewhat though rather vaguely in his resources a few days after murdochs departure there came to broxton on a visit of inspection a dignitary of great magnitudea political economist a member of parliament above all other things he was absorbed in the fortunes of the manufacturing districts he had done the tradesunions the honor of weighing their cause and reasoning with them he had parleyed with the strikers and held meetings with the masters he had heard of haworth and his extraordinary stand against the outbreak and was curious to see him he came as the guest of one of the county families who regarded haworth and his success a subject worth enlarging upon he was taken to the works and presented to their master haworth met him with little enthusiasm he showed him over the place but maintained his taciturnity he was not even moved to any exhibition of gratitude on being told that he had done wonders the finale of the visit was a stately dinner given by the county family haworth and the member were the features of the festivity and speeches were made which took a congratulatory and even a laudatory turn i cant go ffrench cried piteously when haworth came to his room at the bank with the news he turned quite white and sank back into his chair it is too much to ask ino i am not strong enough he felt himself as good as a dead man when haworth turned about and strode up to him livid and opening and shutting his hands blast you he hissed through his teeth you did it you and you shall pay for it as long as im nigh to make you saint meran was among the guests and miss ffrench whose wonderful beauty attracted the dignitarys eye at once years after he remembered and spoke of her he glanced toward her when he rose to make his afterdinner speech and caught her eye and was somewhat confused by it but he was very eloquent the master of haworths was his inspiration and text his resources his strength of will his giant enterprises his readiness and daring at the moment when all was at hazardthese were matters indeed for eloquence haworth sat leaning forward upon the table he played with his wineglass turning it round and round and not spilling a drop of the ruby liquid sometimes he glanced at the orator with a smile which no one exactly understood oftener he kept his eyes fixed upon the full wineglass when at length the speaker sat down with a swift final glance at rachel ffrench there was a silence of several seconds everybody felt that a reply was needed haworth turned his wineglass two or three times without raising his eyes but at last just as the pause was becoming embarrassing he looked across the table at ffrench who sat opposite im not a speechmaking chap myself he said my partner is hell say my say for me he gave ffrench a nod that gentleman had been pale and distracted through all the courses now he became paler than ever he hesitated glanced around him at the waiting guest and at haworth who nodded again and then rose it was something unusual that mr ffrench should hang back and show himself unready he began his speech of thanks in his partners name falteringly and as if at a loss for the commonest forms of expression he replied to the members compliments with hesitation he spoke of the difficulties they had encountered with a visibly strong effort he touched upon their success and triumph with such singular lack of exultation that those who listened began to exchange looks of questioning and suddenly in the midst of his wanderings and struggles at recovering himself he broke off and begged leave to sit down i am ill he said i havebeenindisposed for some time i must crave your pardon andand my partners for my inability to say whatwhat i would wish he sat down amid many expressions of sympathy the plea accounted for his unusual demeanor it was thought the member himself sought an interview with him in which he expressed his regret and his sense of the fact that nothing was more natural than that the result of so long bearing a weight of responsibility should be a strain upon the nervous system and a consequent loss of physical strength you must care for yourself my dear sir he added your firmnay the countrycannot afford to lose an element like yourself at such a crisis on the morning following the member left broxton on his way to the station he was moved to pay a final visit to haworth at the works i congratulate you he said with much warmth on shaking hands with him i congratulate england upon your determination and indomitable courage and upon your wonderful success there was a good deal of talk about murdoch during his absence the story of the attack and of haworths repulse of the attacking party became a popular incident mr reddy and his companions disappeared from the scene with promptness much interest was manifested in the ultimate success of the model which had previously been regarded with a mingling of indifference and disfavor as not loike to coom to owt the results of its agreeably disappointing people by coming to owt were estimated at nothing short of a million per annum th chapll roll i brass it was said haworthll be nowheer happen th ladll coom back an set up a works agen him an he coom here nowt but a workin chap a few year sin the two women in the little house in the narrow street heard the story of the attack only through report they had no letters i wont write murdoch had said you shall not be troubled by prospects that might end in nothing you will hear nothing from me till i come and tell you with my own lips that i have won or failed in the days of waiting christian proved her strength she would not let her belief be beaten or weighed down she clung to it in spite of what she saw hour by hour in the face of the woman who was her companion i have lived through it before it was not put into words but she read it in her eyes and believed in spite of it he had been away two weeks and he returned as his father had done at night the women were sitting together in the little inner room they were not talking or working though each had work in her hands it was christian who heard him first she threw down her work and stood up he is here she cried he is coming up the step she was out in the narrow entry and had thrown the door open before he had time to open it with his key the light fell upon his dark pale face and showed a strange excitement in it he was disheveled and travelworn but his eyes were bright his first words were enough it is all right he said in an exultant voice it is a success where is my mother he had taken her hand as if without knowing what he did and fairly dragged her into the room his mother had risen and stood waiting it is a success he cried out to her it is what he meant it to bei have finished his work she turned from him to the girl uttering a low cry of appeal christian she said christian the girl went to her and made her sit down and knelt before her clasping her arms about her waist and uplifting her glowing young face at the moment her beauty became such a splendor that murdoch himself saw it with wonder it is finished she said and it is he who has finished it is not that enough yes she answered butbut and the words died upon her lips and she sat looking before her into vacancy and trembling murdoch threw himself on the sofa and lay there his hands clasped above his head i shall be a rich man he said as if to himself a rich manand it is nothingbut it is done chapter li th ony one as is na a foo the next day all broxton knew the story well he wur na so soft after aw more than one excellent matron remarked mr ffrench heard the news from his valet in the morning he had been very unwell for several days he had eaten nothing and slept very little and had been obliged to call in his physician who pronounced his case the result of too great mental strain and prescribed rest he came down to breakfast with an unwholesome face and trifled with his food without eating it he glanced furtively at rachel again and again i shall not go to the bank today he said timorously at last i am worse than ever i shall remain at home and try to write letters and rest areare you going out yes she answered oh then after a pause he said i saw briarley yesterday and he said mrs dixon was very ill you sometimes go there i believe yes supposesuppose you call this morning to inquire it looks well to show aa sort of interest in them you might take something nourishing with you he flinched when she raised her eyes and let them rest a moment upon him her look was strongly suggestive of the fact that she could better rely upon the result of her own calculations concerning him than upon the truth of his replies if she deigned to ask him questions i thought he faltered that it would look well to evince some interest as the man has been in our employ and you have had the woman about the house certainly she replied it would be well enough i will go after breakfast she ordered the carriage and went to her room and made her toilette with some care why she did so was best known to herself nothing is more certain than that she scarcely expected to produce a great effect upon granny dixon the truth was she would have made her visit to the briarleys in any case and was not in the least moved thereto by her fathers unexpected anxiety but when she reached the cottage and entered it she began immediately to repent having come a neighbor woman sat nursing the youngest briarley there was a peculiar hush upon the house and the windows were darkened she drew back with a feeling of alarm and annoyance what is the matter she demanded impatiently of the woman why have you darkened the room th owd lass is deein was the businesslike answer an theyre hain some trouble wi her she conna even dee loike other foak she drew back her annoyance becoming violent repulsion she turned pale and her heart began to beat violently she knew nothing of death and was not fearless of it her inveterate calm failed her in thus being brought near it i will go away she said and she would have gone but at that moment there arose a sound of voices in the inner roommrs briarleys and janeys and above theirs granny dixons brokenly and yet with what seemed terrible loudness in the hush of the house bring her i here she was saying bring her i here an mak herdo it and then out came mrs briarley looking fagged and harassed i ax thy pardon miss she said but she says she wants thee she says she wants thee to be a witness to summat i will not go she replied ii am going away inever saw any one beforein that condition but the terrible voice raised itself again and despite her terror and anger held and controlled her i see her it cried mak her coom in i knowed her granfeytherwhen i wur a lassseventy year ago she will na harm thee said mrs briarley and partly because of a dread fascination and partly because the two women regarded her with such amazement she found herself forced to give way and enter it was a small room and dark and low the bed was a huge fourposter which had belonged to granny dixon herself in her young days the largeflowered patterns of its chintz hangings were faded with many washings of the woman lying upon it there was little left but skin and bone she seemed all eyes and voiceeyes which stared and shone in the gloom and voice which broke upon the silence with an awesome power shes been speaking awmost i a whisper till today explained mrs briarley under her breath an aw at onct th change set in an it coom back as loud as ivver she lifted her hands beckoning with crooked fingers coom tha here she commanded rachel ffrench went to her slowly she had no color left and all her hauteur could not steady her voice what do you want she asked standing close beside the bed for a few seconds there was silence in which the large eyes wandered from the border of her rich dress to the crown of her hair then granny dixon spoke out wheerst flower she cried thast getten it on thee again i con smell it it was true that she wore it at her throat as she had done before a panic of disgust took possession of her as she recollected it it was as if they two were somehow bound together by it she caught at it with tremulous fingers and would have flung it away but it fell from her uncertain clasp upon the bed and she would not have touched it for worlds gi it to me commanded granny dixon pick it up for her she said turning to mrs briarley and it was done and the shrivelled fingers held it and the old eye devoured it he used to wear em i his buttonhole proclaimed the voice an he wur a hansome chapseventy year ago did you send for me to tell me that demanded rachel ffrench granny dixon turned on her pile of pillows nay she said an imforgettin there was a gasp between the two last words as if suddenly her strength was failing her get thee a penanan write summat she ordered get it quickly said rachel ffrench and let me humor her and go she noticed the little gap between the words herself and the next instant saw a faint gray pallor spread itself over the old womans face get the pen and paper she repeated and call in the woman they brought her the pen and paper and called the woman who came in stolidly ready for any emergency then they waited for commands but for several seconds there was a dead pause and granny dixon lay back staring straight before her quick said rachel ffrench what do you want granny dixon rose by a great effort upright from her pillows she pointed to mrs briarley with the sharp bony forefinger ileave itawto her she proclaimed ivvery penny shes th ony one among em as is na a foo and then she fell back and panted and stared again mrs briarley lifted her apron and burst into tears she means th brass she wailed eh poor owd lass whod ha thowt it do you mean asked rachel ffrench that you wish her to have your money a nod was the answer and mrs briarley shed sympathetic tears again here was a reward for her labors indeed what she wrote miss ffrench scarcely knew in the end there was her own name signed below and a black scrawling mark from granny dixons hand the woman who had come in made her mark also mak a black un said the testatrix lets ha it plain then turning to rachel does ta want to know wheer th money come fro fro will ffrenchfro him he wur one o th gentry when aw wur said an donean i wur a hansome lass when it was done they all stood and looked at each other granny dixon lay back upon her pillows drawing sharp breaths she was looking only at rachel ffrench she seemed to have forgotten all the rest of them and what she had been doing all that was left of the voice was a loud halting whisper wheers th flower she said i conna smell it it was in her hand rachel ffrench drew back let me go she said to mrs briarley i cannot stay here he used to wear em i his buttonhole she heard seventy year agoan shes th very moral on him and scarcely knowing how she made her way past the women and out of the house and into the fresh air and sunshine drive home she said to the coachman as quickly as possible she leaned back in a corner of the carriage shuddering suddenly she burst into wild tears but there were no traces of her excitement when she reached home she descended from the carriage looking quite herself and after dismissing it went up to her own room about half an hour later she came down and went into the library her father was not there and on inquiring as to his whereabouts from a servant passing the open door she was told that he had gone out he had been writing letters it was evident his chair stood before his desk and there was an addressed envelope lying upon it she went to the desk and glanced at it without any special motive for doing so it was addressed to herself she opened and read it my dear rachel it ran in all probability we shall not meet again for some time i find myself utterly unable to remain to meet the blow which must inevitably fall before many days are over the anxiety of the past year has made me a coward i ask your forgiveness for what you may call my desertion of you we have never relied upon each other much and you at least are not included in my ruin you will not be called upon to share my poverty you had better return to paris at once with a faint hope that you will at least pity me i remain your affectionate father gerard ffrench chapter lii haworths is done with almost at the same moment haworth was reading in his room at the works the letter which had been left for himself i have borne as much as i can bear it ended my punishment for my folly is that i am a ruined man and a fugitive my presence upon the scene when the climax comes would be of no benefit to either of us pardon me if you can for the wrong i have unintentionally done you my illluck was sheerly the result of circumstances even yet i cannot help thinking that there were great possibilities in my plans but you will not believe this and i will say no more in haste ffrench when rachel ffrench finished reading her note she lighted a taper and held the paper to it until it was reduced to ashes and afterward turned away merely a shade paler and colder than before haworth having finished the reading of ffrenchs letter sat for a few seconds staring down at it as it lay before him on the table then he burst into a brutal laugh after that he sat stupefiedhis elbows on the table his head on his hands he did not move for half an hour the works saw very little of him during the day he remained alone in his room not showing himself and one of the head clerks coming in from the bank on business went back mystified and remarked in confidence to a companion that things had a queer look he did not leave the works until late and then went home all through the evening his mother watched him in her old tender way she tried to interest him with her history of the briarleys bereavement and unexpected good fortune she shed tears over her recital so old my dear she said old enough to have outlived her ownan her ways a little hard wiping her eyes id like to be grieved for more jemthough perhaps its only natral as it should be so she hadnt no son to miss her as youll miss me i shouldnt like to be the last jem he had been listening mechanically and he started and turned to her the last he said aye its a bit hard it was as if she had suggested a new thought to him of which he could not rid himself at once he kept looking at her his eyes wandering over her frail little figure and innocent old face restlessly but i havent no fear she went on though we never know whats to come but youre a strong man and theres not like to be many more years for methough im so well an happy you might live a score he answered in an abstracted way his eyes still fixed on her not without you she returned its you thats life to mean strengthan peace the innocent tears were in her voice again and her eyes were bright with them he lay down awhile but could not lie still he got up and came and stood near her and talked and then moved here and there picking up one thing and another holding them idly for a few seconds and then setting them aside at last she was going to bed and came to bid him goodnight he laid his hand on her shoulder caressingly theres never been aught like trouble between us two he said ive been a quiet enough chap and different somehowwhen ive been nigh you what ive done ive done for your sake and for the best in the morning the works were closed the doors of the bank remained unopened and the news spread like wildfire from house to house and from street to street and beyond the limits of the townuntil before noon it was known through the whole country side that ffrench had fled and jem haworth was a ruined man it reached the public ear in the first instance in the ordinary commonplace manner through the individuals who had suddenly descended upon the place to take possession a great crowd gathered about the closed gates and murmured and stared and anathematized theers been summat up for mony a month said one sage ive seed it he wur na hissen wur na haworth nay said another that he wur na th chap has na been o a decent spree sin ffrench coom happen added a third that wur what started him on th road downhill a chap is na good fur much as has na reglar habits aye an haworth wur reglar enow when he set up good lord whod ha thowt o that chap i bankrupcy at the outset the feeling manifested was not unamiable to haworth but it was not very long before the closing of the bank dawned upon the public in a new light it meant loss and ruin the first man who roused the tumult was a burly farmer who dashed into the town on a sweating horse spurring it as he rode and wearing a red and furious face he left his horse at an inn and came down to the bank booted and spurred and whip in hand wheers ffrench he shouted to the smaller crowd attracted there and whose views as to the ultimate settlement of things were extremely vague wheers ffrench an wheers haworth half a dozen voices volunteered information regarding ffrench but no one knew anything of haworth he might be in a dozen places but no one had yet seen him or heard of his whereabouts the man began to push his way toward the building swearing hotly he mounted the steps and struck violently on the door with his whip ill mak him hear if hes shut hissen i here he cried th shifty villains got ivvery shillin o brass ive been savin for my little wench for th last ten year ill ha it back if its to be gotten thalt neer see it again shouted a voice in the crowd thadst better ha stuck to th owd stockin lad then the uproar began one luckless depositor after another was added to the crowd they might easily be known among the rest by their pale faces some of them were stunned into silence but the greater portion of them were loud and passionate in their outcry a few women hung on the outskirts wiping their eyes every now and then with their aprons and sometimes bursting into audible fits of weeping ive been goin out charrin for four year said one to buy silks an satins fur th gentry yo nivver seed her i owt else and all knew whom she meant and joined in shouts of rage sometimes it was ffrench against whom their anger was most violentffrench who had been born among them a gentleman and who should have been gentleman enough not to plunder and deceive them and again it was haworthhaworth who had lived as hard as any of them and knew what their poverty was and should have done fairly by them if ever man should in the course of the afternoon murdoch gathering no news of haworth elsewhere went to his house a panicstricken servant let him in and led him into the great room where he had spent his first evening long ago despite its splendor it looked empty and lifeless but when he entered there rose from a carved and satin upholstered chair in one corner a little old figure in a black dressjem haworths mother who came to him with a white but calm face sir were her greeting words where is he i came to see him he answered i thought no she interrupted he is not here he has not been here since morning she began to tremble but she shed no tears theres been a good many to ask for him she went on gentlemen an them as was rough an didnt mind me bein a woman an old they were harder than youd think antroubled as ive been i was glad he was not here to see em but id be more comfortable if i could rightly understand i can only tell you what i know he said it isnt much i have only gathered it from people on the streets he led her back to her chair and did not loosen his light grasp on her hand while he told her the story as he had heard it his own mood was so subdued that it was easier than he had thought to use words which would lighten the first weight of the blow she asked no questions after his explanation was over hes a poor man she said at lasta poor man butwe was poor before suddenly her tears burst forth theyve said hard things to me today she cried i dont believe em jem my dearnow less than ever he comforted her as best he could he could easily understand what they had told her how much of the truth and how much of angry falsehood when he comes back she said i shall be here to meet him wherever he is an however much hes broke down with trouble he knows that hell come here tonight an i shall be here before he went away he asked if he might send christian or his mother to her but though she thanked him she refused i know how good theyd be she said an what a comfort in the lonesomeness but when he comes hell want to be alone an a unfamiliar face might trouble him but he did not come back the day went on and the excitement increased and waned by turns the crowd grew and surged about the bank and shouted itself hoarse and would have broken a few windows if it had not been restrained by the police force who appeared upon the field and there were yells for haworth and for ffrench but by this time mr ffrench had reached rotterdam and haworth wasno one knew where since he had not been seen at all and when at length dusk fell upon the town the crowd had dwindled away and gone home by ones and twos and in jem haworths house sat his mother watching and waiting and straining her ears to catch every passing sound she had kept up her courage bravely through the first part of the day but the strangers who came one after the other and sometimes even two or three together to demand her son with loud words and denunciations and even threats were a sore trial to her some of them flung their evil stories at her without remorse taking it for granted that they were nothing new to her ears and even those who had some compunction muttered among themselves and hinted angrily at what the others spoke outright her strength began to give way and she quailed and trembled before them but she never let their words pass without a desperate effort to defend her boy then they stared or laughed at her or went away in sullen silence and she was left to struggle with her grief and terror alone until some new call was made upon her and she must bear all again when the twilight came she was still alone and sat in the darkened room battling against a dread which had crept slowly upon her of all those who had come none had known where he was they did not know in the town and he had not come back he might go she whispered but hed not go without me hes been true and fond of his mother let them say what they will hed never leave me here alone her thoughts went back over the long years from his birth to the day of his highest success she remembered how he had fought with fate and made his way and refused to be conquered she thought of the wealth he had won the power the popularity and of his boast that he had never been beaten and she began to sob in the shadow of her corner hes lost it all she cried an he won it with his own hands an worked for it an bore up agen a world an its gone it was when she came to this point that her terror seized on her as it had never done before she got up shaking in every limb ill go to him myself she said who should go to him but his mother who should find him an be a help to him if i cant jemjem my dear its me thats comin to youme he had been sitting in a small back office in the bank all through the day when they had been calling and searching for him he had got in early and locked the door and waited knowing well enough all that was to come it was no feeling of fear that made him keep hidden he had done with fearif indeed he had ever felt it in his life he knew what he was going to do and he laid his plans coolly he was to stay here and do the work that lay before him and leave things as straight as he could and then at night when all was quiet he would make his way out in the dark and go to the works it was only a fancy this of going to the works but he clung to it persistently he had never been clearerheaded in his lifeonly sometimes as he was making a calculation or writing a letter he would dash down his work and fall to cursing theres not another chap in england that had done it he would say and its goneits goneits gone then again he would break into a short laugh remembering the m p and his speech and poor ffrenchs stumbling overwhelmed reply to it when he heard the crowd shouting and hooting at the front he went into a room facing the street and watched them through a chink in the shutter he heard the redfaced farmers anathemas and swore a little himself knowing his story was true tha shalt have all haworth can give chaps he muttered an welcome hell tak nowt with him he laughed again but suddenly stopped and walked back into the little office silently and waited there at nightfall he went out of a back door and slipped through unfrequented byways feeling his heart beat with heavy thuds as he went nothing stood in his way and he got in as he believed he should the instant his foot crossed the threshold a change came upon him he forgot all else but what lay before him he was less calm and in some little hurry he reached his room and lighted the gas dimlyonly so that he could see to move about then he went to his desk and opened it and took out one of a pair of pistols speaking aloud as he did so here he said is the end of jem haworth he knew where to aim the heavy thuds marked the spot for him ill count three he said and then he began slowly steadily but in a voice that fell with a hollow sound upon the dead stillness one he said two and his hand dropped at his side with his weapon in it for at the door stood his mother in an instant she had fallen upon her knees and dragged herself toward him and was clinging to his hand nojem she panted no not that my deargod forbid he staggered back though she still clung to him how he falteredhow did you come here the lord led me she sobbed he put it into my heart and showed me the way an you had forgot the door jemthank god yousawwhat i was going to do what you was goin to do but what youll never do jem an me to live an suffer when its doneme as youve been so good an such a comfort to in the dim light she knelt sobbing at his feet let me sit down he said and sit down nigh me ive summat to tell you but though he sank into the chair she would not get up but kept her place in spite of him and went on today there have been black tales told you he said yes she cried but theyre true he said th worst on em nono he stopped her by going on monotonously as if she had not spoken think of the worst youve ever knownyouve not known muchand then say to yourself hes worse a hundred times think of the blackest you have ever known to be done and then say to yourself what hes dones blacker yet if any chap has told you ive stood at naught until there was next to naught id left undone he spoke true if there was any one told you i set th decent ones by the ears and laughed em in the face he spoke true if any o em said i was a dread and a byword they spoke true too the night you came there were men and women in th house that couldnt look you in th face and that felt shame for th first time in their livesmayhapbecause you didnt know what they were an took em to be as innocent as yourself theres not a sin i havent tasted nor a wrong ive not done ive had murder in my mind an planned it ive been mad for a woman not worth even what jem haworth had to give herand ive won all id swore id winan lost it now tell me if theres aught else to do but what ive set my mind on she clung to his heavy hand as she had not clung to it before and laid her withered cheek upon it and kissed it bruised and crushed as she was with the blows he had dealt she would not let it go free yet her words came from her lips a broken cry with piteous sobs between them but she had her answer ready that as ive thanked god for all my life she said hell surely give me in the end he couldnt hold it backive so believed an been grateful to him if there hadnt been in you what would make a good man my dear i couldnt have been so deceived an so happy nonot deceivedthat aint the word jemthe good was there youve lived two lives may bebut one was good thank god youve been a good son to me youve never hurt me an it was your love as hid from me the wrong you did you did love me jemi wont give that upnever theres nothing youve done as can stand agen that with her as is your mother you loved me an was my own sonmy boy as was a comfort an a pride to me from the first he watched her with a stunned look you didnt believe them he said hoarsely and you dont believe me she put her hand to her heart and almost smiled it hasnt come home to me yet she said i dont think it ever will he looked helplessly toward the pistol on the table he knew it was all over and he should not use it what must i do he said in the same hoarse voice get up she said an come with me im a old woman but my hearts strong an weve been poor before well go away together an leave it all behindall the sorrow of it an the sin an the shame the life i thought you lived my dear is to be lived yet theers places where they wont know us an where we can begin again get up and come with me he scarcely grasped what she meant with you he repeated you want me to go now yes she answered for christs sake my dear now he began to see the meaning and possibility of her simple womans plan and got up ready to follow her and then he found that the want of food and the long day had worn upon him so that he was weak she put her arm beneath his and tried to support him lean on me my dear she said im stronger than you think they went out leaving the empty room and the pistol on the table and the dim light burning and then they had locked the gate and were outside with the few stars shining above and the great black works looming up before them he stopped a moment to look back and up and remembered the key suddenly he raised it in his hand and flung it across the top of the locked gate they heard it fall inside upon the pavement with a clang theyll wonder how it came there he said theyll take down the name tomorrow haworths is done with he turned to her and said come his voice was a little stronger they went down the lane together and were lost in the darkness chapter liii a bit o good black granny dixon was interred with pomp and ceremony or at least with what appeared pomp and ceremony in the eyes of the lower social stratum of broxton mrs briarleys idea concerning the legacy left her had been of the vaguest her revered relative had shrewdly kept the amount of her possessions strictly to herself if indeed she knew definitely what they were she had spent but little discreetly living upon the expectations of her kindred she had never been known to give anybody anything and had dealt out the money to be expended upon her own wants with a close hand consequently the principal which had been a mystery from the first had accumulated in an agreeably steady manner between her periodic fits of weeping in her character of sole legatee mrs briarley speculated with matronly prudence upon the possibility of the interest even amounting to a matter o ten or fifteen shillin a week and found the pangs of bereavement materially softened thereby there was a great deal of consolation to be derived from ten or fifteen shillin a week ill ha a bit o good black she said an well gi her a noice buryin only a severe sense of duty to the deceased rescued her from tempering her mournfulness with an air of modest cheer the bit o good black was the first investment there was a gown remarkable for such stiffness of lining and a tendency to crackle upon every movement of the wearer and there was a shawl of great weight and size and a bonnet which was a marvel of unmitigated affliction as expressed by floral decorations of black crape and beads have thee beads i thy bonnet an a pair o black gloves mother said janey an thalt be dressed up for onct i thy loife eh but id loike to go i mournin mysen aye and so tha should jane ann if i could afford it replied mrs briarley theers nowt loike a bit o black fur makkin foak look dressed theers summat cheerful about it i a quoiet way but nivver thee moind thalt get these here things o moine when im done wi em an happen thalt ha growed up to fit th bonnet by then the occasion of the putting on of the festive garb was mrs briarleys visit to manchester to examine into the state of her relatives affairs and such was the effect produced upon the mind of mr briarley by the air of high life surrounding him that he retired into the late mrs dixons chair and wept copiously i nivver thowt to see thee dressed up i so much luxshury sararann he said an it sets me back tha does na look loike thysen tha looks as though tha moight be one o th nobility goin to th duke o wellingtons funeral to ride behoind th hearse im not worthy o thee ive nivver browt thee luck im a misforchnit cha if thad shut thy mouth an keep it shut till some one axes thee to oppen it thad do well enow interposed mrs briarley with a manifest weakening toward the culprit even in the midst of her sternness he is na so bad she used to say leniently if he hadna been born a foo but this recalled to mr briarley such memories as only plunged him into deeper depression theer is na many as axes me to oppen it i these days sararann he said with mournfulness it has na oppent to mich purpose for mony a day even th hospittyblest on em gets toired o a chap as sees nowt but misforchin i mowt as well turn teetotal an git th credit on it happen theers a bit o pleasure to be getten out o staggerin through th streets wi a banner i th whit week possession i dunnot know ive thowt mysen as happen th tea a chap has to drink when th excitements ower an th speeches ud amost be a drorback even to that but i mun say ive thowt o tryin it may be here remarked that since mrs briarleys sudden accession to fortune mr briarleys manner had been that of an humble and sincere penitent whose sympathies were slowly but surely verging toward the noble cause of temperance he had repeatedly deplored his wanderings from the path of sobriety and rectitude with tearful though subdued eloquence and frequently intimated a mournful inclination to jine th teetotals though strange to say the effect of these sincere manifestations had not been such as to restore in the partner of his joys and sorrows that unlimited confidence which would allow of her confiding to his care the small amount he had once or twice feebly suggested her favoring him with to settle wi a violent and nottobepacified creditor of whom he stated he stood in bodily fear i dunnot know as i ivver seed a chap as were as desprit ower a little he remarked it is na but eighteen pence an he ses hell ha it oror see about it he stands at th street cornernear th whod ha thowt itan he will na listen to owt he says a chap as has coom i to property can pay eighteen pence he wunnot believe me he added weakly when i say as it is na me as has getten th brass but yo it maks him worse to try to mak him understand he will na believe me an hes a chap as would na stand back at owt theer wur a man i marfort as owed him thrippence as hehe mashed ito a jelly sararannan it wur fur thrippence aye said mrs briarley dryly an theers no knowin what hed do fur eighteen pence theers a bad lookout fur thee sure enow mr briarley paused and surveyed her for a few seconds in painful silence then he looked at the floor as if appealing to it for assistance but even here he met with indifference and his wounded spirit sought relief in meek protestations tha has na no confydence in me sararann he said happen th teetotals would na ha neyther happen they wouldnt an wheers th use o a chap thinkin o jinin em when they mowt ha no confydence i him when a mons famly mistrusts him an has na no belief in what he says he canna help feelin as he is na incouraged tha is na incouragin sararanntheers wheer it is but when after her visit to manchester mrs briarley returned even mr briarleys spirits rose though under stress of circumstances and in private on entering the house mrs briarley sank into a chair breathless and overawed its two pound ten a week janey she announced in a hysterical voice an tha can ha thy black as soon as tha wants it and mrs briarley burst at once into luxurious weeping janey dropped on to a stool rolled her arms under her apron and sat gasping two pound ten a week she exclaimed i dunnot believe it but she was persuaded to believe by means of sound proof and solid argument and even the proprieties were scarcely sufficient to tone down the prevailing emotion theers a good deal to be getten wi two pound ten a week soliloquized mr briarley in his corner ive heerd o heads o famlies as wur lowanced summat could be done wi three shillin a week wi four shillin a chap could be i parydise but this be it observed was merely soliloquy timorously ventured upon in the temporary security afforded by the prevailing excitement at the funeral the whole family appeared clothed in new garments of the most somber description there were three black coaches and mrs briarley was supported by numerous friends who alternately cheered and condoled with her tha mun remember they said as shes better off poor thing mr briarley who had been adorned with a hatband of appalling width and length and had been furthermore inserted into a pair of gloves some inches too long in the fingers overcame his emotion at this juncture sufficiently to make an endeavor to ingratiate himself he withdrew his handkerchief from his face and addressed mrs briarley aye he said tha mun bear up sararann she is better offhappenan so are we and he glanced round with a faint smile which however faded out with singular rapidity and left him looking somewhat aghast chapter liv it will be to you they found the key lying within the locked gate and the dim light burning and the pistol loaded upon the table the great house stood empty with all its grandeur intact the servants had been paid their wages a few days before the crash and had gone away nothing had been moved nothing taken the creditors who found to their amazement that all was left in their hands to dispose of as they chose agreed that this was not an orthodox case of absconding haworth was a more eccentric fellow than they had thought one man alone understood this was murdoch who amid all the buzz of excited amazement said nothing even to those in his own house when he heard the story of the pistol and the key his first thought was of the silence of the great place at nightthe deadness of it and the sense of desolation it brought it was a terrible thing to remember this and then picture a ruined man standing alone in the midst of it a pistol in his hand and only the low light burning we did not understand each other very well he said drearily but we were friends in our way and the mans farewell as he stood at the carriage door in the shadow came back to him again and again like an echo repeating itself if theres aught in whats gone by thats for meremember it even before his return home murdoch had made up his mind as to what his course for the next few years was to be his future was assured and he might follow his idlest fancy but his fancies were not idle they reached forward to freedom and new labors when the time came he wanted to be alone for a while at least and he was to return to america his plan was to travel with a purpose in view and to fill his life with work which would leave him little leisure rachel ffrench had not yet left her fathers house saint meran had gone away with some suddenness immediately after the dinner party at which the political economist had reigned various comments had been made on his departure but it was not easy to arrive at anything like a definite conclusion miss ffrench was seen no more in the town only a few servants remained with her in the house and these maintained that she was going to paris to her fathers sister with whom she had lived before her return from abroad they added that there was no change in her demeanor that she had dismissed their companions without any explanation one it is true thought she was rather thinand had gone off her looks but this version was not popular and was considered out of accordance with the ideal of her character held in the public mind she does na care it was said she is na hurt her brass is safe enow an thats aw as ud be loike to trouble her pale ideed shes too high an moighty murdoch made his preparations for departure as rapidly as possible they were rather for his mother and christian than for himself they were to leave broxton also and he had found a home for them elsewhere one day as they sat in the little parlor he rose hurriedly and went to christian and took both her hands try to be happy he said try to be happy he spared no effort to make the future bright for them he gave no thought to himself his every hour was spent in thinking for and devising new comfort for them but at last all was ready and there was but one day left to them the works were still closed and would not be reopened for some weeks but he had obtained permission to go down to his room and remove his possessions if he chose so on the morning of this last day he let himself into his den and shut himself up in it once behind the closed doors he began a strange labor he emptied drawers and desk and burnt every scrap of paper to ashesdrawings letters all then he destroyed the delicate models and every other remnant of his past labors there was not so much as an envelope or blottingpad remaining when he had done he had made a clean sweep the room was empty cold and bare he sat down at last in the midst of its desolate orderliness at that moment a hand was laid upon the doorhandle and the door opened there was a rustle of a womans dressand rachel ffrench stood before him what are you doing here in heavens name he said rising slowly to meet her she cast one glance around the bare room it is true you are going away yes he answered i am going i have done my last work here today she made a step forward and stood looking at him she spoke under her breath every one is going my father has left mei a scarlet spot came out on her cheek but she did not withdraw her eyes saint meran has gone also gradually as she looked at him the blood receded from her face and left it like a mask of stone ishe began in a sharp whisper do you not see do you not understand ahmy god there was a chair near her and she fell into it burying her face in the crushed velvet of her mantle as she bowed herself upon the table near hush she cried do not speak to me that it should be i who stooped and for thisfor this that having battled against my folly so long i should have let it drag me to the dust at last her passionate sobs suffocated her she could not check or control them her slender fingers writhed in their clasp upon each other i never thought of this god knows he said hoarsely though there have been hours when i could have sworn that you had loved me once i have thought of all things but never of thisnever that you could repent she lifted her head that i should repent she cried repent like this no he returned i never thought of that i swear and it is you she cried with scornyou who stand there and look at me and tell me that it is all over is it my fault that it is all over he demanded is it no she answered that is my consolation he drew nearer to her you left me nothing he saidnothing god knows what saved mei do not you loved me you battled against your love he laughed aloud i was a madman under your window night after night forget it if you can i cannot oh that i should have stooped for this you say no it is that i who have loved you should stand here with empty hands she had bowed her face and was sobbing again but suddenly she rose if i did not know you better she said i should say this was revenge it would be but a poor one he answered her coldly she supported herself with one hand on the chair i have fallen very low she said so low that i was weaker than i thought and now as you say it is over your hands are empty oh it was a poor passion and this is the fitting end for it she moved a little toward the door and stopped goodbye she said in a moment more all that was left was a subtle breath of flowerlike fragrance in the atmosphere of the bare room it was an hour before he passed through the iron gates though there had been nothing left to be done inside he came out slowly and having locked the gate turned toward the broxton road he was going to the little graveyard it had been a dull gray day but by the time he reached the place the sun had crept through the clouds and brightened them and noting it he felt some vague comfort it was a desolate place when there was no sun when he reached the mound he stood looking down since the night he had lain by it looking up at the sky and had made his resolve the grass had grown longer and thicker and turned from green to brown he spoke aloud just as he had done before it is done he said your thought was what you dreamed it would be i have kept my word he stopped as if for an answer but it was very stillso still that the silence was like a presence and the mound at his feet lay golden brown in the sunlight even its long grass unstirred they left broxton the next day and in a week he set sail as the ship moved away he stood leaning upon the taffrail watching a figure on the shore it was a girl in a long cloak of gray almost the color of the mist in which she stooda slender motionless figurethe dark young face turned seaward he watched her until he could see her face no longer but still she had not stirred when i return he said scarcely conscious that he spoke when i returnit will be to you then the grayness closed about her and she faded slowly from his sight
