httpswwwgutenbergorgdirshzip the dawn of a tomorrow by frances hodgson burnett i there are always two ways of looking at a thing frequently there are six or seven but two ways of looking at a london fog are quite enough when it is thick and yellow in the streets and stings a mans throat and lungs as he breathes it an awakening in the early morning is either an unearthly and grewsome or a mysteriously enclosing secluding and comfortable thing if one awakens in a healthy body and with a clear brain rested by normal sleep and retaining memories of a normally agreeable yesterday one may lie watching the housemaid building the fire and after she has swept the hearth and put things in order lie watching the flames of the blazing and crackling wood catch the coals and set them blazing also and dancing merrily and filling corners with a glow and in so lying and realizing that leaping light and warmth and a soft bed are good things one may turn over on ones back stretching arms and legs luxuriously drawing deep breaths and smiling at a knowledge of the fog outside which makes halfpast eight oclock on a december morning as dark as twelve oclock on a december night under such conditions the soft thick yellow gloom has its picturesque and even humorous aspect one feels enclosed by it at once fantastically and cosily and is inclined to revel in imaginings of the picture outside its rembrandt lights and orange yellows the halos about the streetlamps the illumination of shopwindows the flare of torches stuck up over coster barrows and coffeestands the shadows on the faces of the men and women selling and buying beside them refreshed by sleep and comfort and surrounded by light warmth and good cheer it is easy to face the day to confront going out into the fog and feeling a sort of pleasure in its mysteries this is one way of looking at it but only one the other way is marked by enormous differences a manhe had given his name to the people of the house as antony dart awakened in a thirdstory bedroom in a lodginghouse in a poor street in london and as his consciousness returned to him its slow and reluctant movings confronted the second point of viewmarked by enormous differences he had not slept two consecutive hours through the night and when he had slept he had been tormented by dreary dreams which were more full of misery because of their elusive vagueness which kept his tortured brain on a wearying strain of effort to reach some definite understanding of them yet when he awakened the consciousness of being again alive was an awful thing if the dreams could have faded into blankness and all have passed with the passing of the night how he could have thanked whatever gods there be only not to awakeonly not to awake but he had awakened the clock struck nine as he did so consequently he knew the hour the lodginghouse slavey had aroused him by coming to light the fire she had set her candle on the hearth and done her work as stealthily as possible but he had been disturbed though he had made a desperate effort to struggle back into sleep that was no useno use he was awake and he was in the midst of it all again without the sense of luxurious comfort he opened his eyes and turned upon his back throwing out his arms flatly so that he lay as in the form of a cross in heavy weariness and anguish for months he had awakened each morning after such a night and had so lain like a crucified thing as he watched the painful flickering of the damp and smoking wood and coal he remembered this and thought that there had been a lifetime of such awakenings not knowing that the morbidness of a fagged brain blotted out the memory of more normal days and told him fantastic lies which were but a hundredth part truth he could see only the hundredth part truth and it assumed proportions so huge that he could see nothing else in such a state the human brain is an infernal machine and its workings can only be conquered if the mortal thing which lives with it day and night night and dayhas learned to separate its controllable from its seemingly uncontrollable atoms and can silence its clamor on its way to madness antony dart had not learned this thing and the clamor had had its hideous way with him physicians would have given a name to his mental and physical condition he had heard these names oftenapplied to men the strain of whose lives had been like the strain of his own and had left them as it had left himjaded joyless breaking things some of them had been broken and had died or were dragging out bruised and tormented days in their own homes or in madhouses he always shuddered when he heard their names and rebelled with sick fear against the mere mention of them they had worked as he had worked they had been stricken with the delirium of accumulationaccumulationas he had been they had been caught in the rush and swirl of the great maelstrom and had been borne round and round in it until having grasped every coveted thing tossing upon its circling waters they themselves had been flung upon the shore with both hands full the rocks about them strewn with rich possessions while they lay prostrate and gazed at all life had brought with dull hopeless anguished eyes he knewif the worst came to the worstwhat would be said of him because he had heard it said of others he worked too hardhe worked too hard he was sick of hearing it what was wrong with the world what was wrong with man as manif work could break him like this if one believed in deity the living creature it breathed into being must be a perfect thingnot one to be wearied sickened tortured by the life its breathing had created a mere man would disdain to build a thing so poor and incomplete a mere human engineer who constructed an engine whose workings were perpetually at faultwhich went wrong when called upon to do the labor it was made forwho would not scoff at it and cast it aside as a piece of worthless bungling something is wrong he muttered lying flat upon his cross and staring at the yellow haze which had crept through crannies in windowsashes into the room someone is wrong is it ior you his thin lips drew themselves back against his teeth in a mirthless smile which was like a grin yes he said i am pretty far gone i am beginning to talk to myself about god bryan did it just before he was taken to dr hewletts place and cut his throat he had not led a specially evil life he had not broken laws but the subject of deity was not one which his scheme of existence had included when it had haunted him of late he had felt it an untoward and morbid sign the thing had drawn himdrawn him he had complained against it he had argued sometimes he knewshudderingthat he had raved something had seemed to stand aside and watch his being and his thinking something which filled the universe had seemed to wait and to have waited through all the eternal ages to see what heone manwould do at times a great appalled wonder had swept over him at his realization that he had never known or thought of it before it had been there alwaysthrough all the ages that had passed and sometimesonce or twicethe thought had in some unspeakable untranslatable way brought him a moments calm but at other times he had said to himselfwith a shivering soul cowering within himthat this was only part of it all and was a beginning perhaps of religious monomania during the last week he had known what he was going to dohe had made up his mind this abject horror through which others had let themselves be dragged to madness or death he would not endure the end should come quickly and no one should be smitten aghast by seeing or knowing how it came in the crowded shabbier streets of london there were lodginghouses where one by taking precautions could end his life in such a manner as would blot him out of any world where such a man as himself had been known a pistol properly managed would obliterate resemblance to any human thing months ago through chance talk he had heard how it could be doneand done quickly he could leave a misleading letter he had planned what it should bethe story it should tell of a disheartened mediocre venturer of his poor all returning bankrupt and humiliated from australia ending existence in such pennilessness that the parish must give him a paupers grave what did it matter where a man lay so that he sleptsleptslept surely with ones brains scattered one would sleep soundly anywhere he had come to the house the night before dressed shabbily with the pitiable respectability of a defeated man he had entered droopingly with bent shoulders and hopeless hang of head in his own sphere he was a man who held himself well he had let fall a few dispirited sentences when he had engaged his back room from the woman of the house and she had recognized him as one of the luckless in fact she had hesitated a moment before his unreliable look until he had taken out money from his pocket and paid his rent for a week in advance she would have that at least for her trouble he had said to himself he should not occupy the room after tomorrow in his own home some days would pass before his household began to make inquiries he had told his servants that he was going over to paris for a change he would be safe and deep in his paupers grave a week before they asked each other why they did not hear from him all was in order one of the mocking agonies was that living was done for he had ceased to live work pleasure sun moon and stars had lost their meaning he stood and looked at the most radiant loveliness of land and sky and sea and felt nothing success brought greater wealth each day without stirring a pulse of pleasure even in triumph there was nothing left but the awful days and awful nights to which he knew physicians could give their scientific name but had no healing for he had gone far enough he would go no farther tomorrow it would have been over long hours and there would have been no public declaiming over the humiliating pitifulness of his end and what did it matter how thick the fog was outsidethick enough for a man to lose himself in it the yellow mist which had crept in under the doors and through the crevices of the windowsashes gave a ghostly look to the rooma ghastly abnormal look he said to himself the fire was smouldering instead of blazing but what did it matter he was going out he had not bought the pistol last nightlike a fool somehow his brain had been so tired and crowded that he had forgotten forgotten he mentally repeated the word as he got out of bed by this time tomorrow he should have forgotten everything this time tomorrow his mind repeated that also as he began to dress himself where should he be should he be anywhere suppose he awakened again to something as bad as this how did a man get out of his body after the crash and shock what happened did one find oneself standing beside the thing and looking down at it it would not be a good thing to stand and look down oneven for that which had deserted it but having torn oneself loose from it and its devilish aches and pains one would not careone would see how little it all mattered anything else must be better than thisthe thing for which there was a scientific name but no healing he had taken all the drugs he had obeyed all the medical orders and here he was after that last hell of a nightdressing himself in a back bedroom of a cheap lodginghouse to go out and buy a pistol in this damned fog he laughed at the last phrase of his thought the laugh which was a mirthless grin i am thinking of it as if i was afraid of taking cold he said and tomorrow there would be no tomorrow tomorrows were at an end no more nightsno more daysno more morrows he finished dressing putting on his discriminatingly chosen shabbygenteel clothes with a care for the effect he intended them to produce the collar and cuffs of his shirt were frayed and yellow and he fastened his collar with a pin and tied his worn necktie carelessly his overcoat was beginning to wear a greenish shade and look threadbare so was his hat when his toilet was complete he looked at himself in the cracked and hazy glass bending forward to scrutinize his unshaven face under the shadow of the dingy hat it is all right he muttered it is not far to the pawnshop where i saw it the stillness of the room as he turned to go out was uncanny as it was a back room there was no street below from which could arise sounds of passing vehicles and the thickness of the fog muffled such sound as might have floated from the front he stopped halfway to the door not knowing why and listened to whatfor what the silence seemed to spread through all the houseout into the streetsthrough all londonthrough all the world and he to stand in the midst of it a man on the way to deathwith no tomorrow what did it mean it seemed to mean something the world withdrawn life withdrawnsound withdrawnbreath withdrawn he stood and waited perhaps this was one of the symptoms of the morbid thing for which there was that name if so he had better get away quickly and have it over lest he be found wandering about not knowingnot knowing but now he knewthe silence he waitedwaited and tried to hear as if something was calling himcalling without sound it returned to him the thought of that which had waited through all the ages to see what heone manwould do he had never exactly pitied himself beforehe did not know that he pitied himself now but he was a man going to his death and a light cold sweat broke out on him and it seemed as if it was not he who did it but some otherhe flung out his arms and cried aloud words he had not known he was going to speak lord lord what shall i do to be saved but the silence gave no answer it was the silence still and after standing a few moments panting his arms fell and his head dropped and turning the handle of the door he went out to buy the pistol ii as he went down the narrow staircase covered with its dingy and threadbare carpet he found the house so full of dirty yellow haze that he realized that the fog must be of the extraordinary ones which are remembered in afteryears as abnormal specimens of their kind he recalled that there had been one of the sort three years before and that traffic and business had been almost entirely stopped by it that accidents had happened in the streets and that people having lost their way had wandered about turning corners until they found themselves far from their intended destinations and obliged to take refuge in hotels or the houses of hospitable strangers curious incidents had occurred and odd stories were told by those who had felt themselves obliged by circumstances to go out into the baffling gloom he guessed that something of a like nature had fallen upon the town again the gaslight on the landings and in the melancholy hall burned feeblyso feebly that one got but a vague view of the rickety hatstand and the shabby overcoats and headgear hanging upon it it was well for him that he had but a corner or so to turn before he reached the pawnshop in whose window he had seen the pistol he intended to buy when he opened the streetdoor he saw that the fog was upon the whole perhaps even heavier and more obscuring if possible than the one so well remembered he could not see anything three feet before him he could not see with distinctness anything two feet ahead the sensation of stepping forward was uncertain and mysterious enough to be almost appalling a man not sufficiently cautious might have fallen into any open hole in his path antony dart kept as closely as possible to the sides of the houses it would have been easy to walk off the pavement into the middle of the street but for the edges of the curb and the step downward from its level traffic had almost absolutely ceased though in the more important streets linkboys were making efforts to guide men or fourwheelers slowly along the blind feeling of the thing was rather awful though but few pedestrians were out dart found himself once or twice brushing against or coming into forcible contact with men feeling their way about like himself one turn to the right he repeated mentally two to the left and the place is at the corner of the other side of the street he managed to reach it at last but it had been a slow and therefore long journey all the gasjets the little shop owned were lighted but even under their flare the articles in the windowthe one or two once cheaply gaudy dresses and shawls and mens garmentshung in the haze like the dreary dangling ghosts of things recently executed among watches and forlorn pieces of oldfashioned jewelry and odds and ends the pistol lay against the folds of a dirty gauze shawl there it was it would have been annoying if someone else had been beforehand and had bought it inside the shop more dangling spectres hung and the place was almost dark it was a shabby pawnshop and the man lounging behind the counter was a shabby man with an unshaven unamiable face i want to look at that pistol in the righthand corner of your window antony dart said the pawnbroker uttered a sound something between a halflaugh and a grunt he took the weapon from the window antony dart examined it critically he must make quite sure of it he made no further remark he felt he had done with speech being told the price asked for the purchase he drew out his purse and took the money from it after making the payment he noted that he still possessed a fivepound note and some sovereigns there passed through his mind a wonder as to who would spend it the most decent thing perhaps would be to give it away if it was in his roomtomorrow the parish would not bury him and it would be safer that the parish should he was thinking of this as he left the shop and began to cross the street because his mind was wandering he was less watchful suddenly a rubbertired hansom moving without sound appeared immediately in his paththe horses head loomed up above his own he made the inevitable involuntary whirl aside to move out of the way the hansom passed and turning again he went on his movement had been too swift to allow of his realizing the direction in which his turn had been made he was wholly unaware that when he crossed the street he crossed backward instead of forward he turned a corner literally feeling his way went on turned another and after walking the length of the street suddenly understood that he was in a strange place and had lost his bearings this was exactly what had happened to people on the day of the memorable fog of three years before he had heard them talking of such experiences and of the curious and baffling sensations they gave rise to in the brain now he understood them he could not be far from his lodgings but he felt like a man who was blind and who had been turned out of the path he knew he had not the resource of the people whose stories he had heard he would not stop and address anyone there could be no certainty as to whom he might find himself speaking to he would speak to no one he would wander about until he came upon some clew even if he came upon none the fog would surely lift a little and become a trifle less dense in course of time he drew up the collar of his overcoat pulled his hat down over his eyes and went onhis hand on the thing he had thrust into a pocket he did not find his clew as he had hoped and instead of lifting the fog grew heavier he found himself at last no longer striving for any end but rambling along mechanically feeling like a man in a dreama nightmare once he recognized a weird suggestion in the mystery about him tomorrow might one be wandering about aimlessly in some such haze he hoped not his lodgings were not far from the embankment and he knew at last that he was wandering along it and had reached one of the bridges his mood led him to turn in upon it and when he reached an embrasure to stop near it and lean upon the parapet looking down he could not see the water the fog was too dense but he could hear some faint splashing against stones he had taken no food and was rather faint what a strange thing it was to feel faint for want of foodto stand alone cut off from every other human beingeverything done for no wonder that sometimes particularly on such days as these there were plunges made from the parapetno wonder he leaned farther over and strained his eyes to see some gleam of water through the yellowness but it was not to be done he was thinking the inevitable thing of course but such a plunge would not do for him the other thing would destroy all traces as he drew back he heard something fall with the solid tinkling sound of coin on the flag pavement when he had been in the pawnbrokers shop he had taken the gold from his purse and thrust it carelessly into his waistcoat pocket thinking that it would be easy to reach when he chose to give it to one beggar or another if he should see some wretch who would be the better for it some movement he had made in bending had caused a sovereign to slip out and it had fallen upon the stones he did not intend to pick it up but in the moment in which he stood looking down at it he heard close to him a shuffling movement what he had thought a bundle of rags or rubbish covered with sackingsome tramps deserted or forgotten belongingswas stirring it was alive and as he bent to look at it the sacking divided itself and a small head covered with a shock of brilliant red hair thrust itself out a shrewd small face turning to look up at him slyly with deepset black eyes it was a human girl creature about twelve years old are yer goin to do it she said in a hoarse streetstrained voice yer would be a fool if yer didwith as much as that on yer she pointed with a reddened chapped and dirty hand at the sovereign pick it up he said you may have it her wild shuffle forward was an actual leap the hand made a snatching clutch at the coin she was evidently afraid that he was either not in earnest or would repent the next second she was on her feet and ready for flight stop he said ive got more to give away she hesitatednot believing him yet feeling it madness to lose a chance more she gasped then she drew nearer to him and a singular change came upon her face it was a change which made her look oddly human gawd mister she said yer can give away a quid like it was nothinan yerve got morean yer goin to do thatjes cos yer ad a bit too much lars night an theres a fog this mornin you take it straight from medont yer do it i give yer that tip for the suvrink she was for her years so ugly and so ancient and hardened in voice and skin and manner that she fascinated him not that a man who has no tomorrow in view is likely to be particularly conscious of mental processes he was done for but he stood and stared at her what part of the power moving the scheme of the universe stood near and thrust him on in the path designed he did not know thenperhaps never did he was still holding on to the thing in his pocket but he spoke to her again what do you mean he asked glumly she sidled nearer her sharp eyes on his face i bin watchin yer she said i sat down and pulled the sack over me ead to breathe inside it an get a bit warm an i see yer come i knowed wot yer was after i did i watched yer through a ole in me sack i wasnt goin to call a copper i shouldnt want ter be stopped meself if i made up me mind i seed a gal

straight wishyermaydieill go with yer an get a cup myself i aint ad a bite since yesterdayan t want nothin but a slice o polony sossidge i found on a dusteap come on mister she pulled his coat with her cracked hand he glanced down at it mechanically and saw that some of the fissures had bled and the roughened surface was smeared with the blood they stood together in the small space in which the fog enclosed themhe and shethe man with no tomorrow and the girl thing who seemed as old as himself with her sharp small nose and chin her sharp eyes and voiceand yetperhaps the fogs enclosing did itsomething drew them together in an uncanny way something made him forget the lost clew to the lodginghouse something made him turn and go with hera thing led in the dark how can you find your way he said i lost mine there aint no fog can lose me she answered shuffling along by his side sides its goin to lift look at that man comin toards us it was true that they could see through the orangecolored mist the approaching figure of a man who was at a yards distance from them yes it was lifting slightlyat least enough to allow of ones making a guess at the direction in which one moved where are you going he asked apple blossom court she answered the cawfeestands in a street near itand theres a shop where i can buy things apple blossom court he ejaculated what a name there aint no appleblossoms there chuckling nor no smell of em t aint as nice as its nime isapple blossom court aint what do you want to buy a pair of shoes the shoes her naked feet were thrust into were

her neck i aint ad a noo un since i went to the last drorinroom it was impudent street chaff but there was cheerful spirit in it and cheerful spirit has some occult effect upon morbidity antony dart did not smile but he felt a faint stirring of curiosity which was after all not a bad thing for a man who had not felt an interest for a year what is it you are going to buy im goin to fill me stummick fust with a grin of elation three thick slices o bread an drippin an a mug o cawfee an then im goin to get sumethin earty to carry to polly she aint no good pore thing who is she stopping a

cautiously when the swellins gone down round er eye dart startedand it was because he had for the last five minutes forgotten something i shall not be here tomorrow he said his grasp upon the thing in his pocket had loosened and he tightened it i have some more money in my purse he said deliberately i meant to give it away before going i want to give it to people who need it very much she gave him one of the sly squinting glances deservin cases she put it to him in brazen mockery i dont care he answered slowly and heavily i dont care a damn her face changed exactly as he had seen it change on the bridge when she had drawn nearer to him its ugly hardness suddenly looked human and that she could look human was fantastic ow much ave yer she asked ow much is it about ten pounds she stopped and stared at him with open mouth gawd she broke out ten pounds d send apple blossom court to eving leastways itd take some of it out o ell take me to it he said roughly take me she began to walk quickly breathing fast the fog was lighter and it was no longer a blinding thing a question occurred to dart why dont you ask me to give the money to you he said bluntly dunno she answered as bluntly but

andles em i gets many a bite an a copper cos o that folks likes yer i shall get on better than polly when im old enough to go on the street the organ of whose lagging sick pumpings antony dart had scarcely been aware for months gave a sudden leap in his breast his blood actually hastened its pace and ran through his veins instead of crawlinga distinct physical effect of an actual mental condition it was produced upon him by the mere matteroffact ordinariness of her tone he had never been a sentimental man and had long ceased to be a feeling one but at that moment something emotional and normal happened to him you expect to live in that way he said aint nothin else fer me to do wisht i was better lookin but ive got a lot of air clawing her mop an its red one day chuckling a gent ses to mehe ses oh yerll do yer an ugly little devilbut ye are a devil she was leading him through a narrow filthy back street and she stopped grinning up in his face i say mister she wheedled lets stop at the cawfeestand its up this way when he acceded and followed her she quickly turned a corner they were in another lane thick with fog which flared with the flame of torches stuck in costers barrows which stood here and therebarrows with fried fish upon them barrows with secondhandlooking vegetables and others piled with more than secondhandlooking garments trade was not driving but near one or two of them dirty illused looking women a man or so and a few children stood at a corner which led into a black hole of a court a coffeestand was stationed in charge of a burly ruffian in corduroys come along said the girl there it is it aint strong but its ot she sidled up to the stand drawing dart with her as if glad of his protection ello barney she said eres a gent warnts a mug o yer best ive ad a bit o luck an i wants one mesself garn growled barney you an yer luck gent may want a mug but yd show yer money fust strewth ive got it y aint got the chinge fer wot i ave in me and ere as e mister show it taunted the man and then turning to dart yer wants a mug o cawfee yes the girl held out her hand cautiouslythe piece of gold lying upon its palm look ere she said there were two or three men slouching about the stand suddenly a hand darted from between two of them who stood nearest the sovereign was snatched a screamed oath from the girl rent the thick air and a forlorn enough scarecrow of a young fellow sprang away the blood leaped in antony darts veins again and he sprang after him in a wholly normal passion of indignation a thousand years agoas it seemed to himhe had been a good runner this man was not one and want of food had weakened him dart went after him with strides which astonished himself up the street into an alley and out of it a dozen yards more and into a court and the man wheeled with a hoarse baffled curse the place had no outlet hell was all the creature said dart took him by his greasy collar even the brief rush had left him feeling like a living thingwhich was a new sensation give it up he ordered the thief looked at him with a halflaugh and obeyed as if he felt the uselessness of a struggle he was not more than twentyfive years old and his eyes were cavernous with want he had the face of a man who might have belonged to a better class when he had uttered the exclamation invoking the infernal regions he had not dropped the aspirate i m as hungry as she is he raved hungry enough to rob a child beggar said dart hungry enough to rob a starving old womanor a baby with a defiant snort wolf hungrytiger hungryhungry enough to cut throats he whirled himself loose and leaned his body against the wall turning his face toward it suddenly he made a choking sound and began to sob hell he choked ill give it up ill give it up what a figurewhat a figure as he swung against the blackened wall his scarecrow clothes hanging on him their once decent material making their pinning together of buttonless places their looseness and rents showing dirty linen more abject than any other squalor could have made them antony darts blood still running warm and well was doing its normal work among the braincells which had stirred so evilly through the night when he had seized the fellow by the collar his hand had left his pocket he thrust it into another pocket and drew out some silver go and get yourself some food he said as much as you can eat then go and wait for me at the place they call apple blossom court i dont know where it is but i am going there i want to hear how you came to this will you come the thief lurched away from the wall and toward him he stared up into his eyes through the fog the tears had smeared his cheekbones god he said will i come look and see if ill come dart looked yes youll come he answered and he gave him the money i m going back to the coffeestand the thief stood staring after him as he went out of the court dart was speaking to himself i dont know why i did it he said but the thing had to be done in the street he turned into he came upon the robbed girl running panting and crying she uttered a shout and flung herself upon him clutching his coat gawd she sobbed hysterically i thort id lost yer i thort id lost all of it i did strewth i m glad ive found yer and she stopped choking with her sobs and sniffs rubbing her face in her sack here is your sovereign dart said handing it to her she dropped the corner of the sack and looked up with a queer laugh did yer find a copper did yer give him in charge no answered dart he was worse off than you he was starving i took this from him but i gave him some money and told him to meet us at apple blossom court she stopped short and drew back a pace to stare up at him well she gave forth y are a queer one and yet in the amazement on her face he perceived a remote dawning of an understanding of the meaning of the thing he had done he had spoken like a man in a dream he felt like a man in a dream being led in the thick mist from place to place he was led back to the coffeestand where now barney the proprietor was pouring out coffee for a hoarsevoiced coster girl with a draggled feather in her hat who greeted their arrival hilariously hello glad she cried out got yer suvrink back gladit seemed to be the creatures wild namenodded but held close to her companions side clutching his coat lets go in there an change it she said nodding toward a small pork and ham shop near by an then yer can take care of it for me what did she call you antony dart asked her as they went glad dont know as i ever ad a nime o me own

to carry it she inquired ill ave to get a few penworth o coal an wood an a screw o tea an sugar my wig wot a feed me an pollyll ave as they returned to the coffeestand she broke more than once into a hop of glee barney had changed his mind concerning her a solid sovereign which must be changed and a companion whose shabby gentility was absolute grandeur when compared with his present surroundings made a difference she received her mug of coffee and thick slice of bread and dripping with a grin and swallowed the hot sweet liquid down in ecstatic gulps aint i in luck she said handing her mug back when it was empty gi me another barney antony dart drank coffee also and ate bread and dripping the coffee was hot and the bread and dripping dashed with salt quite eatable he had needed food and felt the better for it come on mister said glad when their meal was ended i want to get back to polly an theres coal and bread and things to buy she hurried him along breaking her pace with hops at intervals she darted into dirty shops and brought out things screwed up in paper she went last into a cellar and returned carrying a small sack of coal over her shoulders bought sack an all she said elatedly a sacks a good thing to ave let me carry it for you said antony dart spile yer coat with her sidelong upward glance i dont care he answered i dont care a damn the final expletive was totally unnecessary but it meant a thing he did not say whatsoever was thrusting him this way and that speaking through his speech leading him to do things he had not dreamed of doing should have its will with him he had been fastened to the skirts of this beggar imp and he would go on to the end and do what was to be done this day it was part of the dream the sack of coal was over his shoulder when they turned into apple blossom court it would have been a black hole on a sunny day and now it was like hades lit grimly by a gasjet or two small and flickering with the orange haze about them filthy flagging murky doorways broken steps and broken windows stuffed with rags and the smell of the sewers let loose had apple blossom court glad with the wealth of the pork and ham shop and other riches in her arms entered a repellent doorway in a spirit of great good cheer and dart followed her past a room where a drunken woman lay sleeping with her head on a table a child pulling at her dress and crying up a stairway with broken balusters and breaking steps through a landing upstairs again and up still farther until they reached the top glad stopped before a door and shook the handle crying out s only me polly you can open it she added to dart in an undertone she as to keep it locked no knowin whod want to get in polly shaking the doorhandle again pollys only me the door opened slowly on the other side of it stood a girl with a dimpled round face which was quite pale under one of her childishly vacant blue eyes was a discoloration and her curly fair hair was tucked up on the top of her head in a knot as she took in the fact of antony darts presence her chin began to quiver i aint fit toto see no one she stammered pitifully why did you gladwhy did you aint no arm in im said glad es one o the friendly ones e give me a suvrink look wot ive got hopping about as she showed her parcels you need not be afraid of me antony dart said he paused a second staring at her and suddenly added poor little wretch her look was so scared and uncertain a thing that he walked away from her and threw the sack of coal on the hearth a small grate with broken bars hung loosely in the fireplace a battered tin kettle tilted drunkenly near it a mattress from the holes in whose ticking straw bulged lay on the floor in a corner with some old sacks thrown over it glad had without doubt borrowed her shoulder covering from the collection the garret was as cold as the grave and almost as dark the fog hung in it thickly there were crevices enough through which it could penetrate antony dart knelt down on the hearth and drew matches from his pocket we ought to have brought some paper he said glad ran forward wot a gent ye are she cried y aint never goin to light it yes she ran back to the rickety table and collected the scraps of paper which had held her purchases they were small but useful that wot was round the sausage an the puddins greasy she exulted polly hung over the table and trembled at the sight of meat and bread plainly she did not understand what was happening the greased paper set light to the wood and the wood to the coal all three flared and blazed with a sound of cheerful crackling the blaze threw out its glow as finely as if it had been set alight to warm a better place the wonder of a fire is like the wonder of a soul this one changed the murk and gloom to brightness and the deadly damp and cold to warmth it drew the girl polly from the table despite her fears she turned involuntarily made two steps toward it and stood gazing while its light played on her face glad whirled and ran to the hearth yeve put on a lot she cried but oh my gawd dont it warm yer come on pollycome on she dragged out a wooden stool an empty soapbox and bundled the sacks into a heap to be sat upon she swept the things from the table and set them in their paper wrappings on the floor lets all sit down close to itclose she said an get warm an eat an eat she was the leaven which leavened the lump of their humanity what this leaven iswho has found out but shelittle rat of the gutterwas formed of it and her mere pure animal joy in the temporary animal comfort of the moment stirred and uplifted them from their depths iii they drew near and sat upon the substitutes for seats in a circleand the fire threw up flame and made a glow in the fog hanging in the black hole of a room it was glad who set the battered kettle on and when it boiled made tea the other two watched her being under her spell she handed out slices of bread and sausage and pudding on bits of paper polly fed with tremulous haste glad herself with rejoicing and exulting in flavors antony dart ate bread and meat as he had eaten the bread and dripping at the stallaccepting his normal hunger as part of the dream suddenly glad paused in the midst of a huge bite mister she said praps that coves waitin fer yer lets ave im in ill go and fetch im she was getting up but dart was on his feet first i must go he said he is expecting me and aw said glad lemme go along o yer misterjest to show theres no ill feelin very well he answered it was she who led and he who followed at the door she stopped and looked round with a grin keep up the fire polly she threw back aint it warm and cheerful itll do the cove good to see it she led the way down the black unsafe stairway she always led outside the fog had thickened again but she went through it as if she could see her way at the entrance to the court the thief was standing leaning against the wall with fevered unhopeful waiting in his eyes he moved miserably when he saw the girl and she called out to reassure him i aint up to no arm she said i ony come with the gent antony dart spoke to him did you get food the man shook his head i turned faint after you left me and when i came to i was afraid i might miss you he answered i darent lose my chance i bought some bread and stuffed it in my pocket ive been eating it while ive stood here come back with us said dart we are in a place where we have some food he spoke mechanically and was aware that he did so he was a pawn pushed about upon the board of this days life come on said the girl yer can get enough to last fer three days she guided them back through the fog until they entered the murky doorway again then she almost ran up the staircase to the room they had left when the door opened the thief fell back a pace as before an unexpected thing it was the flare of firelight which struck upon his eyes he passed his hand over them a fire he said i havent seen one for a week coming out of the blackness it gives a man a start improvident joy gleamed in glads eyes well be warm onct she chuckled if we aint never warm agaen she drew her circle about the hearth again the thief took the place next to her and she handed out food to hima big slice of meat bread a thick slice of pudding fill yerself up she said then yell feel like yer can talk the man tried to eat his food with decorum some recollection of the habits of better days restraining him but starved nature was too much for him his hands shook his eyes filled his teeth tore the rest of the circle tried not to look at him glad and polly occupied themselves with their own food antony dart gazed at the fire here he sat warming himself in a loft with a beggar a thief and a helpless thing of the street he had come out to buy a pistolits weight still hung in his overcoat pocketand he had reached this place of whose existence he had an hour ago not dreamed each step which had led him had seemed a simple inevitable thing for which he had apparently been responsible but which he knew yes somehow he knewhe had of his own volition neither planned nor meant yet here he sata part of the lives of the beggar the thief and the poor thing of the street what did it mean tell me he said to the thief how you came here by this time the young fellow had fed himself and looked less like a wolf it was to be seen now that he had bluegray eyes which were dreamy and young i have always been inventing things he said a little huskily i did it when i was a child i always seemed to see there might be a way of doing a thing bettergetting more power when other boys were playing games i was sitting in corners trying to build models out of wire and string and old boxes and tin cans i often thought i saw the way to things but i was always too poor to get what was needed to work them out twice i heard of men making great names and for tunes because they had been able to finish what i could have finished if i had had a few pounds it used to drive me mad and break my heart his hands clenched themselves and his huskiness grew thicker there was a man catching his breath who leaped to the top of the ladder and set the whole world talking and writingand i had done the thing firsti swear i had it was all clear in my brain and i was half mad with joy over it but i could not afford to work it out he could so to the end of time it will be his he struck his fist upon his knee aw the deep little drawl was a groan from glad i got a place in an office at last i worked hard and they began to trust me ihad a new idea it was a big one i needed money to work it out ii remembered what had happened before i felt like a poor fellow running a race for his life i knew i could pay back ten times a hundred timeswhat i took you took money said dart the thiefs head dropped no i was caught when i was taking it i wasnt sharp enough someone came in and saw me and there was a crazy row i was sent to prison there was no more trying after that its nearly two years since and ive been hanging about the streets and falling lower and lower ive run miles panting after cabs with luggage in them and not had strength to carry in the boxes when they stopped ive starved and slept out of doors but the thing i wanted to work out is in my mind all the time like some machine tearing round it wants to be finished it never will be thats all glad was leaning forward staring at him her roughened hands with the smeared cracks on them clasped round her knees things as to be finished she said they finish theirselves how do you know dart turned on her dunno ow i knowbut i do when things begin they finish its like a wheel rollin down an ill her sharp eyes fixed themselves on darts all of usll finish somethincos weve begun you willpolly wille willi will she stopped with a sudden sheepish chuckle and dropped her forehead on her knees giggling dunno wot i m talking about she said but its true dart began to understand that it was and he also saw that this ragged thing who knew nothing whatever looked out on the world with the eyes of a seer though she was ignorant of the meaning of her own knowledge it was a weird thing he turned to the girl polly tell me how you came here he said he spoke in a low voice and gently he did not want to frighten her but he wanted to know how she had begun when she lifted her childish eyes to his her chin began to shake for some reason she did not question his right to ask what he would she answered him meekly as her fingers fumbled with the stuff of her dress i lived in the country with my mother she said we was very happy together in the spring there was primroses andand lambs icant abide to look at the sheep in the park these days they remind me so there was a girl in the village got a place in town and came back and told us all about it it made me silly i wanted to come here too ii came she put her arm over her face and began to sob she cant tell you said glad there was a swell in the ouse made love to her she used to carry up coals to is parlor an e talked to er e ad a wye with im polly broke into a smothered wail oh i did love him soi did she cried id have let him walk over me id have let him kill me e nearly did it said glad e went away sudden an shes never eard word of im since from under pollys facehiding arm came broken words i couldnt tell my mother i did not know how i was too frightened and ashamed now its too late i shall never see my mother again and it seems as if all the lambs and primroses in the world was dead oh theyre deadtheyre deadand i wish i was too glads eyes winked rapidly and she gave a hoarse little cough to clear her throat her arms still clasping her knees she hitched herself closer to the girl and gave her a nudge with her elbow buck up polly she said we aint none of us finished yet look at us nowsittin by our own fire with bread and puddin inside usan think wot we was this mornin who knows wot well ave this time tomorrer then she stopped and looked with a wide grin at antony dart ow did i come ere she said yes he answered how did you come here i dunno she said i was ere first thing i remember i lived with a old woman in another ouse in the court one mornin when i woke up she was dead sometimes ive begged an sold matches sometimes ive took care of womens children or elped em when they ad to lie up ive

thats all about me and she chuckled again dart picked up some fresh sticks and threw them on the fire there was some fine crackling and a new flame leaped up if you could do what you liked he said what would you like to do her chuckle became an outright laugh if i ad ten pounds she asked evidently prepared to adjust herself in imagination to any form of unlookedfor good luck if you had more his tone made the thief lift his head to look at him if i ad a wand like the one jem told me was in the pantermine yes he answered she sat and stared at the fire a few moments and then began to speak in a low luxuriating voice id get a better room she said revelling theres one in the next ouse id ave a few sticks o furnisher in ita bed an a chair or two id get some warm petticuts an a shawl an a atwith a ostrich feather in it polly an me d live together wed ave fire an grub every day id get drunken bets biby put in an ome id elp the women when they ad to lie up idid elp im a bit with a jerk of her

fixed look showing itself in her eyes if i ad money i could do it ow much with sudden prudence could a body ave with one o them wands more than enough to do all you have spoken of answered dart its a shime a body couldnt ave it apple blossom court d be a different thing itd be the sime as miss montaubyn says its goin to be she laughed again this time as if remembering something fantastic but not despicable who is miss montaubyn shes a old woman as lives next floor below when she was young she was pretty an used to dance in the alls drunken bet says she was one o the wust when she got old it made er mad an she got wusser she was ready to tear gals eyes out an when shed get took for makin a row shed fight like a tiger cat about a year ago she tumbled downstairs when shed ad too much an she

arter a bit they liked to ear erjust along o the cheerfleness said it was like a pantermine drunken bet says if she could get old f it an believe it sime as jinny montaubyn does itd be as cheerin as drink an last longer is it a kind of religion dart asked having a vague memory of rumors of fantastic new theories and halfborn beliefs which had seemed to him weird visions floating through fagged brains wearied by old doubts and arguments and failures the world was tiredthe whole earth was sad centuries had wrought only to the end of this twentieth centurys despair was the struggle waking even herein this back water of the huge citys human tide he wondered with dull interest is it a kind of religion he said its cheerfler glad thrust out her sharp chin uncertainly again theres no ell fire in it an there aint no blime laid on godamighty the word as she uttered it seemed to have no connection whatever with her usual colloquial invocation of the deity when a dray run over little billy an crushed im inter a rag an is mother was screamin an draggin er air down the curick e ses its gawds will e sesan e aint no bad sort neither an is fice was white an wet with sweatgawd done it e ses an me id nussed the child an i clawed me air sime as if i was is mother an i screamed out then damn im an the curick e dropped sittin down on the curbstone an id is fice in is ands dart hid his own face after the manner of the wretched curate no wonder he groaned his blood turned cold but said glad miss montaubyns lidy she says godamighty never done it nor never intended it an if we kep sayin an believin es close to us an not millyuns o miles away wed be took care of whilst we was alive an not ave to wait till we was dead she got up on her feet and threw up her arms with a sudden jerk and involuntary gesture i m alive i m alive she cried out ive got ter be took care of now thats why i like wot she tells about it so does the women we aint no more reason ter be sure of wot the curick says than ter be sure o this dunno as ive got ter choose either way but if i ad id choose the cheerflest dart had sat staring at herso had pollyso had the thief dart rubbed his forehead i do not understand he said t aint understanding its believin bless yer she doesnt understand i say lets go an talk to er a bit she dont mind nothin an shell let us in we can leave polly an im ere they can make some more tea an drink it it ended in their going out of the room together again and stumbling once more down the stairways crookedness at the bottom of the first short flight they stopped in the darkness and glad knocked at a door with a summons manifestly expectant of cheerful welcome she used the formula she had used before s ony me miss montaubyn she cried out s ony glad the door opened in wide welcome and confronting them as she held its handle stood a small old woman with an astonishing face it was astonishing because while it was withered and wrinkled with marks of past years which had once stamped their reckless unsavoriness upon its every line some strange redeeming thing had happened to it and its expression was that of a creature to whom the opening of a door could only mean the entrancethe tumbling in as it wereof hopes realized its surface was swept clean of even the vaguest anticipation of anything not to be desired smiling as it did through the black doorway into the unrelieved shadow of the passage it struck antony dart at once that it actually implied thisand that in this placeand indeed in any placenothing could have been more astonishing what could indeed well well she said come in glad bless yer ive brought a gent to ear yer talk a bit glad explained informally the small old woman raised her twinkling old face to look at him ah she said as if summing up what was before her e thinks its worse than it is doesnt e now come in sir do this time it struck dart that her look seemed actually to anticipate the evolving of some wonderful and desirable thing from himself as if even his gloom carried with it treasure as yet undisplayed as she knew nothing of the ten sovereigns he wondered what in gods name she saw the poverty of the little square room had an odd cheer in it much scrubbing had removed from it the objections manifest in glads room above there was a small red fire in the grate a strip of old but gay carpet before it two chairs and a table were covered with a harlequin patchwork made of bright odds and ends of all sizes and shapes the fog in all its murky volume could not quite obscure the brightness of the often rubbed window and its harlequin curtain drawn across upon a string bless yer said miss montaubyn sit down dart sat and thanked her glad dropped upon the floor and girdled her knees comfortably while miss montaubyn took the second chair which was close to the table and snuffed the candle which stood near a basket of colored scraps such as without doubt had made the harlequin curtain yer wont mind me goin on with me bit o work she chirped tell im wot it is glad suggested they come from a dressmaker as is in a small way designating the scraps by a gesture i clean up for er an she lets me ave em i make em up into anythink i canpincushions an bags an curtings an balls nobodyd think wot they run to sometimes now an then i sell some of em wot i cant sell i give away drunken bets biby plays with er ball all day

might ave broke your back might ave a fever might be in jail for knifin someone e wants to ear you talk miss montaubyn tell im all about yerself me her expectant eyes on him e wouldnt want to ear it i shouldnt want to ear it myself bein on the alls when yer a pretty girl aint an elpful life an bein took up an dropped down till yer dropped in the gutter an dont know ow to get outits wot yer mustnt let yer mind go back to thats wot the lidy said called out glad tell im about the lidy she doesnt even know who she was the remark was tossed to dart never even eard er name with unabated cheer said

she ses never think of nothin else an then youll begin an see things everybodys been afraid there aint no need you believe that believe said dart heavily she nodded yes ses i to er thats where the trouble comes inbelievin and she answers as cool as could be yes it is she ses weve all been thinkin weve been believin an none of us as if we ad what d there be to be afraid of if we believed a king was givin us our livin an takin care of us whod be afraid of not avin enough to eat who groaned dart he sat hanging his head and staring at the floor this was another phase of the dream where is e i ses im as breaks old womens legs an crushes babies under wheelsso as theyll be resigned an all of a sudden she calls out quite loud nowhere she ses an never was but im as stretched forth the eavens an laid the foundations of the earth im as is the life an love of the world es ere stretch out yer and she ses an call out speak lord thy servant eareth an yell ear an see an never you stop sayin itlet yer eart beat it an yer breath breathe itan yer ll find yer goin about laughin soft to yerself an lovin everythin as if it was yer own child at breast an no arm can come to yer try it when yer go ome

loud all night id got a bit low in me stummick an she stopped suddenly and turned on dart as if light had flashed across her mind dunno nothin about it she stammered but i said itjust like she doesan you come plainly she had uttered whatever words she had used in the form of a sort of incantation and here was the result in the living body of this man sitting before her she stared hard at him repeating her words you come yes you did it was the answer said miss montaubyn with entire simplicity as she bit off her thread thats wot it was antony dart lifted his heavy head you believe it he said i m livin on believin it she said confidingly i aint got nothin else an answers keeps comin and comin what answers bits o workan things as elps glad there shes one aw said glad i aint nothin i likes to ear yer tell about it she ses to dart again a little slowly as she watched his face with curiously questioning eyesshe ses es in the roomsame as es everywherein this ere room sometimes she talks out loud to im what cried dart startled again the strange majestic awful ideathe deity of the agesto be spoken of as a mere unfeared reality and even as the vaguely formed thought sprang in his brain he started once more suddenly confronted by the meaning his sense of shock implied what had all the sermons of all the centuries been preaching but that it was reality what had all the infidels of every age contended but that it was unreal and the folly of a dream he had never thought of himself as an infidel perhaps it would have shocked him to be called one though he was not quite sure but that a little superannuated dancer at musichalls battered and worn by an unlawful life should sit and smile in absolute faith at such aa superstition as this stirred something like awe in him for she was smiling in entire acquiescence its what the curick ses she enlarged radiantly though e don t believe it pore young man e ony thinks e does its for igh an low e ses for you an me as well as for them as is royal fambleys the almighty es everywhere yes ses i ive felt im ereas near as y are yerself sir i avean ive spoke to im what did the curate say dart asked amazed seemed like it frightened

unknown is the knownand with her suppose it were true he uttered aloud in response to a sense of inward tremor supposeitweretrue and he was not speaking either to the woman or the girl and his

fantastic laugh ended for her with a little choking vaguely hysteric sound blimme she said aint it queer us not knowinif its true antony dart bent forward in his chair he looked far into the eyes of the exdancer as if some unseen thing within them might answer him miss montaubyn herself for the moment he did not see what he stammered hoarsely his voice broken with awe what of the hideous wrongsthe woes and horrorsand hideous wrongs there wouldnt be none if we was rightif we never thought nothin but goods comingood s ere if we everyone of us thought itevery minit of every day she did not know she was speaking of a millenniumthe end of the world she sat by her one candle threading her needle and believing she was speaking of today he laughed a hollow laugh if we were right he said

in the street miss montaubyn heard it and stopped in her sewing holding her needle and thread extended glad heard it and sprang to her feet somethins appened she cried out someones urt she was out of the room in a breaths space she stood outside listening a few seconds and darted back to the open door speaking through it they could hear below commotion exclamations the wail of a child somethins appened to bet she cried out again i can ear the child she was gone and flying down the staircase antony dart and miss montaubyn rose together the tumult was increasing people were running about in the court and it was plain a crowd was forming by the magic which calls up crowds as from nowhere about the door the childs screams rose shrill above the noise it was no small thing which had occurred i must go said miss montaubyn limping away from her table praps i can elp praps you can elp too as he followed her they were met by glad at the threshold she had shot back to them panting she was blind drunk she said an she went out to get more she tried to cross the street an fell under a car shell be dead in five minits im goin for the biby dart saw miss montaubyn step back into her room he turned involuntarily to look at her she stood still a secondso still that it seemed as if she was not drawing mortal breath her astonishing expectant eyes closed themselves and yet in closing spoke expectancy still speak lord she said softly but as if she spoke to something whose nearness to her was such that her hand might have touched it speak lord thy servant eareth antony dart almost felt his hair rise he quaked as she came near her poor clothes brushing against him he drew back to let her pass first and followed her leading the court was filled with men women and children who surged about the doorway talking crying and protesting against each others crowding dart caught a glimpse of a policeman fighting his way through with a doctor a dishevelled woman with a child at her dirty bare breast had got in and was talking loudly just outside the court it was she proclaimed an i saw it if shed bin erself it couldnt ave appened no time for osspitles ses i shes not twenty breaths to dror let er die in er own bed pore thing and both she and her baby breaking into wails at one and the same time other women some hysteric some maudlin with gin joined them in a terrified outburst get out you women commanded the doctor who had forced his way across the threshold send them away officer to the policeman there were others to turn out of the room itself which was crowded with morbid or terrified creatures all making for confusion glad had seized the child and was forcing her way out into such air as there was outside the beda strange and loathly thingstood by the empty rusty fireplace drunken bet lay on it a bundle of clothing over which the doctor bent for but a few minutes before he turned away antony dart standing near the door heard miss montaubyn speak to him in a whisper may i go to er and the doctor nodded she limped lightly forward and her small face was white but expectant still what could she expect nowo lord what an extraordinary thing happened an abnormal silence fell the owners of such faces as on stretched necks caught sight of her seemed in a flash to communicate with others in the crowd jinny montaubyn someone whispered and jinny montaubyn was passed along leaving an awed stirring in its wake those whom the pressure outside had crushed against the wall near the window in a passionate hurry breathed on and rubbed the panes that they might lay their faces to them one tore out the rags stuffed in a broken place and listened breathlessly jinny montaubyn was kneeling down and laying her small old hand on the muddied forehead she held it there a second or so and spoke in a voice whose low clearness brought back at once to dart the voice in which she had spoken to the something upstairs bet she said bet and then more soft still and yet more clear bet my dear it seemed incredible but it was a fact slowly the lids of the womans eyes lifted and the pupils fixed themselves on jinny montaubyn who leaned still closer and spoke again t aint true she said not this t aint true there is no death slow and soft but passionately distinct thereisno death the muscles of the womans face twisted it into a rueful smile the three words she dragged out were so faint that perhaps none but darts strained ears heard them wotpriceme the soul of her was loosening fast and straining away but jinny montaubyn followed it thereisnodeath and her low voice had the tone of a slender silver trumpet in a minit yer ll knowin a minit lord lifting her expectant face show her the wye mysteriously the clouds were clearing from the sodden facemysteriously miss montaubyn watched them as they were swept away a minutetwo minutesand they were gone then she rose noiselessly and stood looking down speaking quite simply as if to herself ah she breathed she does know nowfer sure an certain then antony dart turning slightly realized that a man who had entered the house and been standing near him breathing with light quickness since the moment miss montaubyn had knelt was plainly the person glad had called the curick and that he had bowed his head and covered his eyes with a hand which trembled iv he was a young man with an eager soul and his work in apple blossom court and places like it had torn him many ways religious conventions established through centuries of custom had not prepared him for life among the submerged he had struggled and been appalled he had wrestled in prayer and felt himself unanswered and in repentance of the feeling had scourged himself with thorns miss montaubyn returning from the hospital had filled him at first with horror and protest but who knowswho knows he said to dart as they stood and talked together afterward faith as a little child that is literally hers and i was shocked by itand tried to destroy it until i suddenly saw what i was doing i wasin my cloddish egotismtrying to show her that she was irreverent because she could believe what in my soul i do not though i dare not admit so much even to myself she took from some strange passing visitor to her tortured bedside what was to her a revelation she heard it first as a child hears a story of magic when she came out of the hospital she told it as if it was one ii he bit his lips and moistened them argued with her and reproached her christ the merciful forgive me she sat in her squalid little room with her magicsometimes in the darksometimes without fire and she clung to it and loved it and asked it to help her as a child asks its father for bread when she was answeredand god forgive me again for doubting that the simple good that came to her was an answerwhen any small help came to her she was a radiant thing and without a shadow of doubt in her eyes told me of it as proofproof that she had been heard when things went wrong for a day and the fire was out again and the room dark she said i avent kept near enoughi avent trusted true it will be gave me soon and when once at such a time i said to her we must learn to say thy will be done she smiled up at me like a happy baby and answered thy will be done on earth as it is in eaven lor theres no cold there nor no unger nor no cryin nor pain thats the way the will is done in eaven thats wot i arst for all day longfor it to be done on earth as it is in eaven what could i say could i tell her that the will of the deity on the earth he created was only the will to do evilto give painto crush the creature made in his own image what else do we mean when we say under all horror and agony that befalls it is gods willgods will be done base unbeliever though i am i could not speak the words oh she has something we have not her poor little misspent life has changed itself into a shining thing though it shines and glows only in this hideous place she herself does not know of its shining but drunken bet would stagger up to her room and ask to be told what she called her pantermine stories i have seen her there sitting listeninglistening with strange quiet on her and dull yearning in her sodden eyes so would other and worse women go to her and i who had struggled with them could see that she had reached some remote longing in their beings which i had never touched in time the seed would have stirred to lifeit is beginning to stir even now during the months since she came back to the courtthough they have laughed at herboth men and women have begun to see her as a creature weirdly set apart most of them feel something like awe of her they half believe her prayers to be bewitchments but they want them on their side they have never wanted mine that i have knownknown she believes that her deity is in apple blossom courtin the dire holes its people live in on the broken stairway in every nook and awful cranny of ita great glory we will not seeonly waiting to be called and to answer do i believe itdo youdo any of those anointed of us who preach each day so glibly god is everywhere who is the one who believes if there were such a man he would go about as moses did when he wist not that his face shone they had gone out together and were standing in the fog in the court the curate removed his hat and passed his handkerchief over his damp forehead his breath coming and going almost sobbingly his eyes staring straight before him into the yellowness of the haze who he said after a moment of singular silence who are you antony dart hesitated a few seconds and at the end of his pause he put his hand into his overcoat pocket if you will come upstairs with me to the room where the girl glad lives i will tell you he said but before we go i want to hand something over to you the curate turned an amazed gaze upon him what is it he asked dart withdrew his hand from his pocket and the pistol was in it i came out this morning to buy this he said i intendednever mind what i intended a wrong turn taken in the fog brought me here take this thing from me and keep it the curate took the pistol and put it into his own pocket without comment in the course of his labors he had seen desperate men and desperate things many times he had even beenat momentsa desperate man thinking desperate things himself though no human being had ever suspected the fact this man had faced some tragedy he could see had he been on the verge of a crimehad he looked murder in the eyes what had made him pause was it possible that the dream of jinny montaubyn being in the air had reached his brainhis being he looked almost appealingly at him but he only said aloud let us go upstairs then so they went as they passed the door of the room where the dead woman lay dart went in and spoke to miss montaubyn who was still there if there are things wanted here he said this will buy them and he put some money into her hand she did not seem surprised at the incongruity of his shabbiness producing money well now she said i was wonderin an askin id like er clean an nice an theres milk wanted bad for the biby in the room they mounted to glad was trying to feed the child with bread softened in tea polly sat near her looking on with restless eager eyes she had never seen anything of her own baby but its limp newborn and dead body being carried away out of sight she had not even dared to ask what was done with such poor little carrion the tyranny of the law of life made her want to paw and touch this lately born thing as her agony had given her no fruit of her own body to touch and paw and nuzzle and caress as mother creatures will whether they be women or tigresses or doves or female cats let me hold her glad she half whimpered when shes fed let me get her to sleep all right glad answered we could look after er between us well enough the thief was still sitting on the hearth but being full fed and comfortable for the first time in many a day he had rested his head against the wall and fallen into profound sleep wots up said glad when the two men came in is anythin appenin i have come up here to tell you something dart answered let us sit down again round the fire it will take a little time glad with eager eyes on him handed the child to polly and sat down without a moments hesitance avid of what was to come she nudged the thief with friendly elbow and he started up awake es got somethin to tell us she explained the curicks come up to ear it too sit ere polly with elbow jerk toward the bundle of sacks its got its stummick full an itll go to sleep fast enough so they sat again in the weird circle neither the strangeness of the group nor the squalor of the hearth were of a nature to be new things to the curate his eyes fixed themselves on darts face as did the eyes of the thief the beggar and the young thing of the street no one glanced away from him his telling of his story was almost monotonous in its semireflective quietness of tone the strangeness to himselfthough it was a strangeness he accepted absolutely without protestlay in his telling it at all and in a sense of his knowledge that each of these creatures would understand and mysteriously know what depths he had touched this day just before i left my lodgings this morning he said i found myself standing in the middle of my room and speaking to something aloud i did not know i was going to speak i did not know what i was speaking to i heard my own voice cry out in agony lord lord what shall i do to be saved the curate made a sudden movement in his place and his sallow young face flushed but he said nothing glads small and sharp countenance became curious speak lord thy servant eareth she quoted tentatively no answered dart it was not like that i had never thought of such things i believed nothing i was going out to buy a pistol and when i returned intended to blow my brains out why asked glad with passionately intent eyes why because i was worn out and done for and all the world seemed worn out and done for and among other things i believed i was beginning slowly to go mad from the thief there burst forth a low groan and he turned his face to the wall ive been there he said i m near there now dart took up speech again there was no answernone as i stood waitinggod knows for whatthe dead stillness of the room was like the dead stillness of the grave and i went out saying to my soul this is what happens to the fool who cries aloud in his pain ive cried aloud said the thief and sometimes it seemed as if an answer was comingbut i always knew it never would in a tortured voice t aint fair to arst that wye glad put in with shrewd logic miss montaubyn she allers knows it will comean it does somethingnot myselfturned my feet toward this place said dart i was thrust from one thing to another i was forced to see and hear things close at hand it has been as if i was under a spell the woman in the room belowthe woman lying dead he stopped a second and then went on there is too much that is crying out aloud a man such as i amit has forced itself upon mecannot leave such things and give himself to the dust i cannot explain clearly because i am not thinking as i am accustomed to think a change has come upon me i shall not use the pistolas i meant to use it glad made a friendly clutch at the sleeve of his shabby coat right o she cried thats it you buck up sime as i told yer y aint stony broke an theres allers tomorrer antony darts expression was weirdly retrospective i did not think so this morning he answered but there is said the girl aint there now curick theres a lot o work in yer yet yer could do all sorts o things if y aint too proud ill elp yer so ll the curick y aint found out yet what a little folks can live on till luck turns me im goin to try miss montaubyns wye les both try les believe things is comin les get er to talk to us some more the curate was thinking the thing over deeply yer see glad enlarged cheerfully yer look almost like a gentleman praps yer can write a good and an spell all right can yer yes i think perhaps the curate began reflectively particularly if you can write well i might be able to get you some work i do not want work dart answered slowly at least i do not want the kind you would be likely to offer me the curate felt a shock as if cold water had been dashed over him somehow it had not once occurred to him that the man could be one of the educated degenerate vicious for whom no power to help lay in any hands yet he was not the common vagrantand he was plainly on the point of producing an excuse for refusing work the other man seeing his start and his amazed troubled flush put out a hand and touched his arm apologetically i beg your pardon he said one of the things i was going to tell youi had not finishedwas that i am what is called a gentleman i am also what the world knows as a rich man i am sir oliver holt each member of the party gazed at him aghast it was an enormous name to claim even the two female creatures knew what it stood for it was the name which represented the greatest wealth and power in the world of finance and schemes of business it stood for financial influence which could change the face of national fortunes and bring about crises it was known throughout the world yesterday the newspaper rumor that its owner had mysteriously left england had caused men on change to discuss possibilities together with lowered voices glad stared at the curate for the first time she looked disturbed and alarmed blimme she ejaculated es gone off is nut pore chapes gone off it no the man answered you shall come to mehe hesitated a second while a shade passed over his eyestomorrow and you shall see he rose quietly to his feet and the curate rose also abnormal as the climax was it was to be seen that there was no mistake about the revelation the man was a creature of authority and used to carrying conviction by his unsupported word that made itself by some clear unspoken method plain you are sir oliver holt and a few hours ago you were on the point of ending it allin an obscure lodging afterward the earth would have been shovelled on to a workhouse coffin it was an awful thing he shook off a passionate shudder there was no wealth on earth that could give me a moments easesleephopelife the whole world was full of things i loathed the sight and thought of the doctors said my condition was physical perhaps it wasperhaps today has strangely given a healthful jolt to my nervesperhaps i have been dragged away from the agony of morbidity and plunged into new intense emotions which have saved me from the last thing and the worstsaved me he stopped suddenly and his face flushed and then quite slowly turned pale saved me he repeated the words as the curate saw the awed blood creepingly recede who knows who knows how many explanations one is ready to give before one thinks of what we say we believe perhaps it wasthe answer the curate bowed his head reverently perhaps it was the girl glad sat clinging to her knees her eyes wide and awed and with a sudden gush of hysteric tears rushing down her cheeks thats the wye thats the wye she gulped out no one wont never believethey wont never thats what she sees miss montaubyn you dont e dont with a jerk toward the curate i aint nothin but me but blimme if i dontblimme sir oliver holt grew paler still he felt as he had done when jinny montaubyns poor dress swept against him his voice shook when he spoke so do i he said with a sudden deep catch of the breath it was the answer in a few moments more he went to the girl polly and laid a hand on her shoulder i shall take you home to your mother he said i shall take you myself and care for you both she shall know nothing you are afraid of her hearing i shall ask her to bring up the child you will help her then he touched the thief who got up white and shaking and with eyes moist with excitement you shall never see another man claim your thought because you have not time or money to work it out you will go with me there are tomorrows enough for you glad still sat clinging to her knees and with tears running but the ugliness of her sharp small face was a thing an angel might have paused to see you dont want to go away from here sir oliver said to her and she shook her head no not me i told yer wot i wanted lemme do it you shall he answered and i will help you the things which developed in apple blossom court later the things which came to each of those who had sat in the weird circle round the fire the revelations of new existence which came to herself aroused no amazement in jinny montaubyns mind she had asked and believed all thingsand all this was but another of the answers
