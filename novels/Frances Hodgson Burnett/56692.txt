editha frontispiece she spent most of her time in the library reading her papas big books through the newspapers she found there were men who lived by breaking into peoples houses never mind about the burglars nixie the burglars miss that broke into number eighteen last night kitty he said i am obliged to go to glasgow dont be frightened she said i dont want to hurt you he laughed so hard that he doubled up its curious that you should know just where to look for things said editha to think o me forgettin my cardcase he said editha came slowly down the staircase with her treasures he threw his head very far back which was vulgar to think of her risking her dear little life to save me the burglar brought from under his mattress a box which he handed to the little girl edithas burglar by frances hodgson burnett illustration illuminated capital i i will begin by saying that editha was always rather a queer little girl and not much like other children she was not a strong healthy little girl and had never been able to run about and play and as she had no sisters or brothers or companions of her own size she was rather oldfashioned as her aunts used to call it she had always been very fond of books and had learned to read when she was such a tiny child that i should almost be afraid to say how tiny she was when she read her first volume through her papa wrote books himself and was also the editor of a newspaper and as he had a large library editha perhaps read more than was quite good for her she lived in london and as her mamma was very young and pretty and went out a great deal and her papa was so busy and her governess only came in the morning she was left to herself a good many hours in the day and when she was left to herself she spent the greater part of her time in the library reading her papas big books and even his newspapers she was very fond of the newspapers because she found so many curious things in themstories for instance of strange events which happened every day in the great city of london and yet never seemed to happen anywhere near where she lived through the newspapers she found that there were actually men who lived by breaking into peoples houses and stealing all the nice things they could carry away and she read that such men were called burglars when she first began to read about burglars she was very much troubled in the first place she felt rather timid about going to bed at night and in the second place she felt rather sorry for the burglars i suppose no one ever taught them any better she thought illustration she spent most of her time in the library reading her papas big books in fact she thought so much about the matter that she could not help asking her papa some questions one morning when he was at breakfast he was reading his paper and eating his chops both at once when she spoke to him papa she said in a solemn little voice and looking at him in a very solemn manner papa dear what do you think of burglarsas a class she said as a class because she had heard one of her papas friends say it and as he was a gentleman she admired very much she liked to talk as he did her papa gave a little jump in his chair as if she had startled him and then he pushed his hair off his forehead and stared at her burglars as a class he said and then he stared at her a minute again in rather a puzzled way bless my soul he said as a class nixie that was his queer pet name for her nixie where is your mother she is in bed papa dear and we mustnt disturb her said editha the party last night tired her out i peeped into her room softly as i came down she looks so pretty when she is asleep what do you think of burglars papa i think theyre a bad lot nixie said her papa a bad lot are there no good burglars papa well nixie answered papa i should say not as a rule you know and here he began to smile as people often smiled at editha when she asked questionsas a rule burglars are not distinguished for moral perspicuity and blameless character but editha did not understand what moral perspicuity meant and besides she was thinking again miss lane was talking to me the other day about some poor children who had never been taught anything they had never had any french or music lessons and scarcely knew how to read and she said they had never had any advantages perhaps that is the way with the burglars papaperhaps they have never had any advantagesperhaps if they had had advantages they mightnt have been burglars lessons in french and music are very elevating to the mind my dear nixie papa began in his laughing way which was always a trial to editha but suddenly he stopped and looked at her rather sadly how old are you nixie he asked illustration through the newspapers she found there were men who lived by breaking into peoples houses i am seven answered editha seven years going on eight papa sighed come here little one he said holding out his strong white hand to her she left her chair and went to him and he put his arms around her and kissed her and stroked her long brown hair dont puzzle your little brain too much he said never mind about the burglars nixie well said editha i cant help thinking about them a little and it seems to me that there must be perhaps one good burglar among all the bad ones and i cant help being rather sorry even for the bad ones you see they must have to be up all night and out in the rain sometimes and they cant help not having had advantages it was strange that the first thing she heard when she went up to her mammas room was something about burglars she was very very fond of her mamma and very proud of her she even tried to take care of her in her small way she never disturbed her when she was asleep and she always helped her to dress bringing her things to her buttoning her little shoes and gloves putting the perfume on her handkerchiefs and holding her wraps until she wanted them this morning when she went into the dressing room she found the chambermaid there before her and her dear little mamma looking very pale ah mem if you please mem the chambermaid was saying what a blessing it was they didnt come here who janet editha asked the burglars miss that broke into number eighteen last night and carried off all the silver and the missuss jewelry if burglars ever do break in here said mamma i hope none of us will hear them though it would almost break my heart to have my things taken if i should waken in the night and find a burglar in my room i think it would kill me and i know i should scream and then there is no knowing what they might do if ever you think there is a burglar in the house nixie whatever you do dont scream or make any noise it would be better to have ones things stolen than to be killed by burglars for screaming illustration never mind about the burglars nixie she was not a very wise little mamma and often said rather thoughtless things but she was very gentle and loving and editha was so fond of her that she put her arms round her waist and said to her mamma dearest i will never let any burglars hurt you or frighten you if i can help it i do believe i could persuade them not to i should think even a burglar would listen to reason that made her mamma laugh so that she forgot all about the burglars and began to get her color again and it was not long before she was quite gay and was singing a song she had heard at the opera while editha was helping her to dress but that very night editha met a burglar just before dinner her papa came up from the city in a great hurry he dashed up to the front door in a cab and jumping out ran upstairs to mamma who was sitting in the drawing room while editha read aloud to her kitty my dear he said i am obliged to go to glasgow by the five train i must throw a few things into a portmanteau and go at once oh francis said mamma and just after that burglary at the norriss i dont like to be left alone the servants are here said papa and nixie will take care of you wont you nixie nixie is interested in burglars i am sure nixie could do more than the servants said mamma all three of them sleep in one room at the top of the house when you are away and even if they awakened they would only scream nixie wouldnt scream said papa laughing nixie would do something heroic i will leave you in her hands he was only joking but editha did not think of what he said as a joke she felt that her mamma was really left in her care and that it was a very serious matter she thought about it so seriously that she hardly talked at all at dinner and was so quiet afterward that her mamma said dear me nixie what are you thinking of you look as solemn as a little owl i am thinking of you mamma the child answered illustration the burglars miss that broke into number eighteen last night and then her mamma laughed and kissed her and said well i must say i dont see why you should look so grave about me i didnt think i was such a solemn subject at last bedtime came and the little girl went to her mothers room because she was to sleep there i am glad i have you with me nixie said mamma with a rather nervous little laugh i am sure i shouldnt like to sleep in this big room alone but after she was in bed she soon fell asleep and lay looking so happy and sweet and comfortable that editha thought it was lovely to see her editha did not go to sleep for a long time she thought of her papa trying to sleep on the train rushing through the dark night on its way to scotland she thought of a new book she had just begun to read she thought of a child she had once heard singing in the street and when her eyes closed at length her mind had just gone back to the burglars at number eighteen she slept until midnight and then something wakened her at first she did not know what it was but in a few minutes she found that it was a queer little sound coming from downstairsa sound like a stealthy filing of iron she understood in a moment then because she had heard the chambermaid say that the burglars broke into number eighteen by filing through the bars of the shutters it is a burglar she thought and he will awaken mamma if she had been older and had known more of the habits of burglars she might have been more frightened than she was she did not think of herself at all however but of her mother she began to reason the matter over as quickly as possible and she made up her mind that the burglar must not be allowed to make a noise ill go down and ask him to please be as quiet as he can she said to herself and ill tell him why certainly this was a queer thing to think of doing but i told you when i began my story that she was a queer little girl she slipped out of bed so quietly that she scarcely stirred the clothes and then slipped just as quietly out of the room and down the stairs the filing had ceased but she heard a sound of stealthy feet in the kitchen and though it must be confessed her heart beat rather faster than usual she made her way to the kitchen and opened the door illustration kitty he said i am obliged to go to glasgow imagine the astonishment of that burglar when on hearing the door open he turned round and found himself looking at a slender little girl in a white frilled nightgown and with bare feeta little girl whose large brown eyes rested on him in a by no means unfriendly way ill be polite to him editha had said as she was coming downstairs i am sure hell be more obliging if i am very polite miss lane says politeness always wins its way so the first words she spoke were as polite as she could make them dont be frightened she said in a soft voice i dont want to hurt you i came to ask a favor of you the burglar was so amazed that he actually forgot he was a burglar and staggered back against the wall i think he thought at first that editha was a little ghost you see i couldnt hurt you if i wanted to she went on wishing to encourage him im too little im only sevenand a little overand im not going to scream because that would waken mamma and thats just what i dont want to do that did encourage the burglar but still he was so astonished that he did not know what to do well im blowed he said in a whisper if this aint a rummy go which was extremely vulgar language but unfortunately he was one of those burglars who as miss lane said had not had any advantages which is indeed the case with the majority of the burglars of my acquaintance then he began to laughin a whisper also if one can be said to laugh in a whisper he put his hand over his mouth and made no noise but he laughed so hard that he doubled up and rocked himself to and fro the rummiest go he said in his uneducated way an she haint agoin to urt me oh my heye he was evidently very badly educated indeed for he not only used singular words but sounded his hs all in the wrong places editha noticed this even in the midst of her surprise at his laughter she could not understand what he was laughing at then it occurred to her that she might have made a mistake if you please she said with great delicacy are you really a burglar illustration dont be frightened she said i dont want to hurt you he stopped laughing just long enough to answer her lor no miss he said by no manner o means im a dear friend o yer pars come to make a evenin call an not a wishin to trouble the servants i stepped in through the winder ah said editha looking very gravely at him i see you are joking with me as papa does sometimes but what i wanted to say to you was this papa has gone to scotland and all our servants are women and mamma would be so frightened if you were to waken her that i am sure it would make her ill and if you are going to burgle would you please burgle as quietly as you can so that you wont disturb her the burglar stopped laughing and staring at her once more uttered his vulgar exclamation well ill be blowed why dont you say ill be blown asked editha im sure it isnt correct to say youll be blowed she thought he was going off into one of his unaccountable fits of laughter again but he did not he seemed to check himself with an effort there haint no time to waste she heard him mutter no i suppose there isnt she answered mamma might wake and miss me what are you going to burgle first youd better go upstairs to yer mar he said rather sulkily editha thought deeply for a few seconds you oughtnt to burgle anything she said of course you know that but if you have really made up your mind to do it i would like to show you the things youd better take what fer instance said the burglar with interest you mustnt take any of mammas things said editha because they are all in her room and you would waken her and besides she said it would break her heart and dont take any of the things papa is fond of ill tell you what turning rather pale you can take my things what kind o things asked the burglar illustration he laughed so hard that he doubled up my locket and the little watch papa gave me and the necklace and bracelets my grandmamma left methey are worth a great deal of money and they are very pretty and i was to wear them when i grew to be a young lady butyou can take them andthen very slowly and with a deep sigh there aremy books im very fond of them but i dont want no books said the burglar dont you exclaimed she ah thank you well said the burglar as if to himself and staring hard at her brightening face i never see no sich a start afore shall i go upstairs and get the other things said editha no he said you stay where you areor stay come along o me inter the pantry an sit down while im occypied he led the way into the pantry and pushed her down on a step and then began to open the drawers where the silver was kept its curious that you should know just where to look for things and that your key should fit isnt it said editha yes he answered its werry singlar indeed theres a good deal in bein eddicated are you educated asked editha with a look of surprise did yer think i wasnt said the burglar well said editha not wishing to offend him you see you pronounce your words so very strangely its all a matter o taste interrupted the burglar oxford an cambridge as different vocabillaries did you go to oxford asked editha politely no said he nor yet to cambridge then he laughed again and seemed to be quite enjoying himself as he made some forks and spoons up into a bundle i ope there haint no plated stuff ere he said plates wulgar an i ope yer parents haint wulgar cos thatd be settin yer a werry bad example an spilin yer morals i am sure papa and mamma are not vulgar said editha the burglar opened another drawer and chuckled again and this suggested to edithas mind another question is your business a good one she suddenly inquired of him illustration its curious that you should know just where to look for things said editha taint as good as it ought to be by no manner o means said the burglar every one haint as hobligin as you my little dear oh said editha you know you obliged me by not making a noise well said the burglar as a rule we dont make a practice o makin no more noise than we can help it haint considered ealthy in the perfession would you mind leaving us a few forks and spoons to eat with if you please i beg pardon for interrupting you but im afraid we shall not have any to use at breakfast haint yer got no steel uns inquired the burglar mamma wouldnt like to use steel ones im sure editha answered ill tell you what you can do please leave out enough for mamma and i can use steel i dont care about myself much the man seemed to think a moment and then he was really so accommodating as to do as she asked and even went to the length of leaving out her own little fork and knife and spoon oh you are very kind said editha when she saw him do this thats a reward o merit cos yer didnt squeal said the burglar he was so busy for the next few minutes that he did not speak though now and then he broke into a low laugh as if he was thinking of something very funny indeed during the silence editha sat holding her little feet in her nightgown and watching him very curiously a great many new thoughts came into her active brain and at last she could not help asking some more questions would you really rather be a burglar than anything else she inquired respectfully well said the man praps id prefer to be lord mayor or a member o the ouse o lords or heven the prince o wales honly for there bein hobstacles in the way of it oh said editha you couldnt be the prince of wales you know i meant wouldnt you rather be in some other profession my papa is an editor she added how would you like to be an editor well said the burglar hif yer par ud change with me or hif he chanced to know hany heditor with a roarin trade as ud be so hobligin as to and it hover hits wot ive allers ad a leanin to illustration to think o a forgettin my cardcase he said i am sure papa would not like to be a burglar said editha thoughtfully but perhaps he might speak to his friends about you if you would give me your name and address and if i were to tell him how obliging you were and if i told him you really didnt like being a burglar the burglar put his hand to his pocket and gave a start of great surprise to think o me a forgettin my cardcase he said an a leavin it on the pianner when i come hout im sich a bloomin forgetful cove i might hev knowed id hev wanted it it is a pity said editha but if you told me your name and your number i think i could remember it im afeared yer couldnt said the burglar regretfully but ill try yer lord halgernon hedward halbert de pentonwille ydepark can you think o that are you a lord exclaimed editha dear me how strange it is singlar said the burglar shaking his head ive hoften thought so myself but not wishin to detain a lady no longer than can be elped spose we take a turn in the libery among yer respected pars things dont make a noise said editha as she led the way but when they reached the library her loving little heart failed her all the things her father valued most were there and he would be sure to be so sorry if one thing was missing when he returned she stood on the threshold a moment and looked about her oh she whispered please do me another favor wont you please let me slip quietly upstairs and bring down my own things instead they will be so easy to carry away and they are very valuable andand i will make you a present of them if you will not touch anything that belongs to papa he is so fond of his things and besides that he is so good the burglar gave a rather strange and disturbed look at her go an get yer gimcracks he said in a somewhat grumbling voice illustration editha came slowly down the staircase with her treasures her treasures were in her own room and her bare feet made no sound as she crept slowly up the staircase and then down again but when she handed the little box to the burglar her eyes were wet papa gave me the watch and mamma gave me the locket she whispered tremulously and the pearls were grandmammas and grandmamma is in heaven it would not be easy to know what the burglar thought he looked queerer than ever perhaps he was not quite so bad as some burglars and felt rather ashamed of taking her treasures from a little girl who loved other people so much better than she loved herself but he did not touch any of papas belongings and indeed did not remain much longer he grumbled a little when he looked into the drawingroom saying something to himself about folks never avin no consideration for a cove an leavin nothin portable andy a expectin of him to carry off seventyfive pound bronze clocks an marble stattoos but though editha was sorry to see that he appeared annoyed she did not understand him after that he returned to the pantry and helped himself to some cold game pie and seemed to enjoy it and then poured out a tumbler of wine which editha thought a great deal to drink at once yer elth my dear he said an appy returns an many on em may yer grow up a hornyment to yer sect an a comfort to yer respected mar an par and he threw his head very far back and drank the very last drop in the glass which was vulgar to say the least of it then he took up his bundles of silver and the other articles he had appropriated and seeing that he was going away editha rose from the pantry step are you going out through the window she asked yes my dear he answered with a chuckle its a little abit ive got into i prefers em to doors well goodby she said holding out her hand politely and thank you my lord she felt it only respectable to say that even if he had fallen into bad habits and become a burglar he shook hands with her in quite a friendly manner and even made a bow yer welcome my dear he said an i must hadd that if i ever see a queerer or better behaved little kid may i be blowedor as yer told me it would be more correcter to say ill be blown illustration he threw his head very far back which was vulgar editha did not know he was joking she thought he was improving and that if he had had advantages he might have been a very nice man it was astonishing how neatly he slipped through the window he was gone in a second and editha found herself standing alone in the dark as he had taken his lantern with him she groped her way out and up the stairs and then for the first time she began to feel cold and rather weak and strange it was more like being frightened than any feeling she had had while the burglar was in the house perhaps if he had been a very bad burglar he might have killed me she said to herself trembling a little i am very glad he did not kill me forfor it would have hurt mamma so and papa too when he came back and they told him her mamma wakened in the morning with a bright smile nobody hurt us nixie she said we are all right arent we yes mamma dear said editha she did not want to startle her just then so she said nothing more and she even said nothing all through the excitement that followed the discovery of the robbery and indeed said nothing until her papa came home and then he wondered so at her pale face and petted her so tenderly and thought it so strange that nothing but her treasures had been taken from upstairs that she could keep her secret no longer papa she cried out all at once in a trembling voice i gave them to him myself you nixie you exclaimed her papa looking alarmed kitty the fright has made the poor little thing ill no papa said editha her hands shaking and the tears rushing into her eyes she did not know why i heard him andi knew mamma would be so frightenedand it came into my mind to ask himnot to waken herand i crept down stairsand asked himand he was not at all unkind though he laughed and i stayed with him andand told him i would give him all my things if he would not touch yours nor mammas hehe wasnt such a bad burglar papaand he told me he would rather be something more respectable illustration to think of her risking her dear little life to save me and she hid her face on her papas shoulder kitty papa cried out oh kitty then her mamma flew to her and knelt down by her kissing her and crying aloud oh nixie if he had hurt youif he had hurt you he knew i was not going to scream mamma said editha and he knew i was too little to hurt him i told him so she scarcely understood why mamma cried so much more at this and why even papas eyes were wet as he held her close up to his breast it is my fault francis wept the poor little mamma i have left her too much to herself and i have not been a wise mother oh to think of her risking her dear little life just to save me from being frightened and to think of her giving up the things she loves for our sakes i will be a better mother to her after this and take care of her more but i am happy to say that the watch and locket and pearls were not altogether lost and came back to their gentle little owner in time about six months after the burglar was caught as burglars are apt to be and after being tried and sentenced to transportation to the penal settlements which means that he was to be sent away to be a prisoner in a far country a police officer came one day to see edithas papa and he actually came from that burglar who was in jail and wanted to see editha for a special reason edithas papa took her to see him and the moment she entered his cell she knew him how do you do my lord she said in a gentle tone not as lively as common miss he answered in consekence o the confinement not bein good fer my elth none of your chaff said the police officer say what you have to say and then strange to say the burglar brought forth from under his mattress a box which he handed to the little girl one o my wisitors brought em in to me this mornin he said i thought yer might as well hev em i kep em partly cos it was more convenienter an partly cos i took a fancy to yer ive seed a many curis things sir he said to edithas papa but never nothin as bloomin queer as that little kid acomin in an tellin me she wont urt me nor yet wont scream and please wont i burgle quietly so as to not disturb her mar it brought my art in my mouth when first i see her an then lor how i larft i almost made up my mind to give her things back to her afore i left but i didnt quite do thatit was agin human natur illustration the burglar brought from under his mattress a box which he handed to the little girl but they were in the box now and editha was so glad to see them that she could scarcely speak for a few seconds then she thanked the burglar politely i am much obliged to you she said and im really very sorry you are to be sent so far away i am sure papa would have tried to help you if he could though he says he is afraid you would not do for an editor the burglar closed one eye and made a very singular grimace at the police officer who turned away suddenly and did not look round until editha had bidden her acquaintance goodbye and even this was not quite all a few weeks later a box was left for editha by a very shabby queerlooking man who quickly disappeared as soon as he had given it to the servant at the door and in this box was a very large oldfashioned silver watch almost as big as a turnip and inside the lid were scratched these words to the little kid from er frend and wel
