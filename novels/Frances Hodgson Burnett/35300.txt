i louisiana olivia ferrol leaned back in her chair her hands folded upon her lap people passed and repassed her as they promenaded the long gallery as it was called they passed in couples in trios they talked with unnecessary loudness they laughed at their own and each others jokes they flirted they sentimentalized they criticised each other but none of them showed any special interest in olivia ferrol nor did miss ferrol on her part show much interest in them she had been at oakvale springs for two weeks she was alone out of her element and knew nobody the fact that she was a new yorker and had never before been so far south was rather against her on her arrival she had been glanced over and commented upon with candor she is a yankee said the pretty and remarkably youthfullooking mother of an apparently grownup family from new orleans you can see it and though the remark was not meant to be exactly severe olivia felt that it was very severe indeed under existing circumstances she heard it as she was giving her orders for breakfast to her own particular jetblack and highly excitable waiter and she felt guilty at once and blushed hastily taking a sip of icewater to conceal her confusion when she went upstairs afterward she wrote a very interesting letter to her brother in new york and tried to make an analysis of her sentiments for his edification you advised me to come here because it would be novel as well as beneficial she wrote and it certainly is novel i think i feel like a pariaha little i am aware that even the best bred and most intelligent of them hearing that i have always lived in new york will privately regret it if they like me and remember it if they dislike me goodnatured and warmhearted as they seem among themselves i am sure it will be i who will have to make the advancesif advances are madeand i must be very amiable indeed if i intend that they shall like me but she had not been well enough at first to be in the humor to make the advances and consequently had not found her position an exciting one she had looked on until she had been able to rouse herself to some pretty active likes and dislikes but she knew no one she felt this afternoon as if this mild recreation of looking on had begun rather to pall upon her and she drew out her watch glancing at it with a little yawn it is five oclock she said very soon the band will make its appearance and it will bray until the stages come in yes there it is the musical combination to which she referred was composed of six or seven gentlemen of color who played upon brazen instruments each in different keys and different time three times a day they collected on a rustic kiosk upon the lawn and played divers popular airs with an intensity fervor and muscular power worthy of a better cause they straggled up as she spoke took their places and began and before they had played many minutes the most exciting event of the day occurred as it always did somewhere about this hour in the midst of the gem of their collection was heard the rattle of wheels and the crack of whips and through the rapturous shouts of the juvenile guests the two venerable rickety stages dashed up with a lumbering flourish and a spasmodic pretense of excitement calculated to deceive only the feeblest mind at the end of the gallery they checked themselves in their mad career the drivers making strenuous efforts to restrain the impetuosity of the four steeds whose harness rattled against their ribs with an unpleasant bony sound half a dozen waiters rushed forward the doors were flung open the steps let down with a bang the band brayed insanely and the passengers alightedone two three four counted olivia ferrol mechanically as the first vehicle unburdened itself and then as the door of the second was opened oneonly one and a very young one too dear me poor girl this exclamation might naturally have fallen from any quicksighted and sympathetic person the solitary passenger of the second stage stood among the crowd hesitating and plainly overwhelmed with timorousness three waiters were wrestling with an ugly shawl a dreadful shining valise and a painted wooden trunk such as is seen in country stores in their enthusiastic desire to dispose creditably of these articles they temporarily forgot the owner who after one desperate timid glance at them looked round her in vain for succor she was very pretty and very young and very illdressedher costume a bucolic travesty on prevailing modes she did not know where to go and no one thought of showing her the loungers about the office stared at her she began to turn pale with embarrassment and timidity olivia ferrol left her chair and crossed the gallery she spoke to a servant a little sharply why not show the young lady into the parlor she said the girl heard and looked at her helplessly but with gratitude the waiter darted forward with hospitable rapture dis yeahs de way miss he said right inter de ceptionroom foller me maam olivia returned to her seat people were regarding her with curiosity but she was entirely oblivious of the fact that is one of them she was saying mentally that is one of them and a very interesting type it is too to render the peculiarities of this young woman clearer it may be well to reveal here something of her past life and surroundings her father had been a literary man her mother an illustrator of books and magazine articles from her earliest childhood she had been surrounded by men and women of artistic or literary occupations some who were drudges some who were geniuses some who balanced between the two extremes and she had unconsciously learned the tricks of the trade she had been used to people who continually had their eyes open to anything peculiar and interesting in human nature who were enraptured by the discovery of new types of men women and emotions since she had been left an orphan she had lived with her brother who had been reporter editor contributor critic one after the other until at last he had established a very enviable reputation as a brilliant practical young fellow who knew his business and had a fine career open to him so it was natural that having become interested in the general friendly fashion of dissecting and studying every scrap of human nature within reach she had followed more illustrious examples and had become very critical upon the subject of types herself during her sojourn at oakvale she had studied the north carolinian mountaineer type with the enthusiasm of an amateur she had talked to the women in sunbonnets who brought fruit to the hotel and sat on the steps and floor of the galleries awaiting the advent of customers with a composure only to be equaled by the calmness of the noble savage she had walked and driven over the mountain roads stopping at wayside houses and entering into conversation with the owners until she had become comparatively well known even in the space of a fortnight and she had taken notes for her brother until she had roused him to sharing her own interest in her discoveries i am sure you will find a great deal of material here she wrote to him you see how i have fallen a victim to that dreadful habit of looking at everything in the light of material a man is no longer a manhe is material sorrow is not sorrow joy is not joyit is material there is something rather ghoulish in it i wonder if anatomists look at peoples bodies as we do at their minds and if to them every one is a subject at present i am interested in a species of girl i have discovered sometimes she belongs to the better classthe farmers who have a great deal of land and who are the rich men of the communitysometimes she lives in a log cabin with a mother who smokes and chews tobacco but in either case she is a surprise and a mystery she is always pretty she is occasionally beautiful and in spite of her house her people her education or want of it she is instinctively a refined and delicately susceptible young person she has always been to some common school where she has written compositions on sentimental or touching subjects and when she belongs to the better class she takes a fashion magazine and tries to make her dresses like those of the ladies in the colored plates and i may add frequently fails i could write a volume about her but i wont when your vacation arrives come and see for yourself it was of this class miss ferrol was thinking when she said that is one of them and a very interesting type it is too when she went in to the diningroom to partake of the six oclock supper she glanced about her in search of the new arrival but she had not yet appeared a few minutes later however she entered she came in slowly looking straight before her and trying very hard to appear at ease she was prettier than before and worse dressed she wore a blue muchruffled muslin and a wide collar made of imitation lace she had tucked her sleeves up to her elbow with a band and bow of black velvet and her round smooth young arms were adorable she looked for a vacant place and seeing none stopped short as if she did not know what to do then some magnetic attraction drew her eye to olivia ferrols after a moments pause she moved timidly toward her ii wish a waiter would come she faltered at that moment one on the wing stopped in obedience to a gesture of miss ferrolsa delicate authoritative movement of the head give this young lady that chair opposite me she said the chair was drawn out with a flourish the girl was seated and the bill of fare was placed in her hands thank you she said in a low astonished voice olivia smiled that waiter is my own special and peculiar property she said and i rather pride myself on him but her guest scarcely seemed to comprehend her pleasantry she looked somewhat awkward idont know much about waiters she ventured im not used to them and i suppose they know it i never was at a hotel before you will soon get used to them returned miss ferrol the girl fixed her eyes upon her with a questioning appeal they were the loveliest eyes she had ever seen miss ferrol thoughtlargeirised and with wonderful long lashes fringing them and curling upward giving them a tender very wideopen look she seemed suddenly to gain courage and also to feel it her duty to account for herself i shouldnt have come here alone if i could have got father to come with me she revealed but he wouldnt come he said it wasnt the place for him i havent been very well since mother died and he thought id better try the springs awhile i dont think i shall like it i dont like it replied miss ferrol candidly but i dare say you will when you know people the girl glanced rapidly and furtively over the crowded room and then her eyes fell i shall never know them she said in a depressed undertone in secret miss ferrol felt a conviction that she was right she had not been presented under the right auspices it is rather clever and sensitive in her to find it out so quickly she thought some girls would be more sanguine and be led into blunders they progressed pretty well during the meal when it was over and miss ferrol rose she became conscious that her companion was troubled by some new difficulty and a second thought suggested to her what its nature was are you going to your room she asked i dont know said the girl with the look of helpless appeal again i dont know where else to go i dont like to go out there signifying the gallery alone why not come with me said miss ferrol then we can promenade together ah she said with a little gasp of relief and gratitude dont you mind on the contrary i shall be very glad of your society miss ferrol answered i am alone too so they went out together and wandered slowly from one end of the starlit gallery to the other winding their way through the crowd that promenaded and upon the whole finding it rather pleasant i shall have to take care of her miss ferrol was deciding but i do not think i shall mind the trouble the thing that touched her most was the girls innocent trust in her sincerityher taking for granted that this stranger who had been polite to her had been so not for worldly good breedings sake but from true friendliness and extreme generosity of nature her first shyness conquered she related her whole history with the unreserve of a child her father was a farmer and she had always lived with him on his farm he had been too fond of her to allow her to leave home and she had never been away to school he has made a pet of me at home she said i was the only one that lived to be over eight years old i am the eleventh ten died before i was born and it made father and mother worry a good deal over meand father was worse than mother he said the time never seemed to come when he could spare me he is very good and kindis father she added in a hurried softvoiced way hes rough but hes very good and kind before they parted for the night miss ferrol had the whole genealogical tree by heart they were an amazingly prolific family it seemed there was uncle josiah who had ten children uncle leander who had fifteen aunt amanda who had twelve and aunt nervy whose belongings comprised three sets of twins and an unlimited supply of odd numbers they went upstairs together and parted at miss ferrols door their rooms being near each other the girl held out her hand goodnight she said im so thankful ive got to know you her eyes looked bigger and wideropen than ever she smiled showing her even sound little white teeth under the bright light of the lamp the freckles the day betrayed on her smooth skin were not to be seen dear me thought miss ferrol how startlingly pretty in spite of the cotton lace and the dreadful polonaise she touched her lightly on the shoulder why you are as tall as i am she said yes the girl replied depressedly but im twice as broad oh nono such thing and then with a delicate glance down over her she saidit is your dress that makes you fancy so perhaps your dressmaker does not understand your figureas if such a failing was the most natural and simple thing in the world and needed only the slightest rectifying i have no dressmaker the girl answered i make my things myself perhaps that is it it is a little dangerous it is true replied miss ferrol i have been bold enough to try it myself and i never succeeded i could give you the address of a very thorough woman if you lived in new york but i dont live there you see i wish i did i never shall though father could never spare me another slight pause ensued during which she looked admiringly at miss ferrol then she said goodnight again and turned away but before she had crossed the corridor she stopped i never told you my name she said miss ferrol naturally expected she would announce it at once but she did not an air of embarrassment fell upon her she seemed almost averse to speaking well said miss ferrol smiling what is it she did not raise her eyes from the carpet as she replied unsteadily its louisiana miss ferrol answered her very composedly the name of the state yes father came from there but you did not tell me your surname oh that is rogers youyou didnt laugh i thought you would at the first name replied miss ferrol oh no it is unusualbut names often are and louise is pretty so it is she said brightening i never thought of that i hate louisa they will call it lowizy or lousyanny i could sign myself louise couldnt i yes miss ferrol replied and then her protegee said goodnight for the third time and disappeared chapter ii worth she presented herself at the bedroom door with a timid knock the next morning before breakfast evidently expecting to be taken charge of miss ferrol felt sure she would appear and had indeed dressed herself in momentary expectation of hearing the knock when she heard it she opened the door at once i am glad to see you she said i thought you might come a slight expression of surprise showed itself in the girls eyes it had never occurred to her that she might not come oh yes she replied i never could go down alone when there was any one who would go with me there was something on her mind miss ferrol fancied and presently it burst forth in a confidential inquiry is this dress very shortwaisted she asked with great earnestness merciful delicacy stood in the way of miss ferrols telling her how shortwaisted it was and how it maltreated her beautiful young body it is rather shortwaisted it is true perhaps the girl went on with a touch of guileless melancholy i am naturally this shape here it must be confessed miss ferrol forgot herself for the moment and expressed her indignation with undue fervor perish the thought she exclaimed why child your figure is a hundred times better than mine louisiana wore for a moment a look of absolute fright oh no she cried oh no your figure is magnificent magnificent echoed miss ferrol giving way to her enthusiasm and indulging in figures of speech dont you see that i am thinabsolutely thin but my things fit me and my dressmaker understands me if you were dressed as i ampausing to look her over from head to footah she exclaimed pathetically how i should like to see you in some of my clothes a tender chord was touched a gentle sadness aroused by this instance of wasted opportunities rested upon her but instantaneously she brightened seemingly without any particular cause a brilliant idea had occurred to her but she did not reveal it i will wait she thought until she is more at her ease with me she really was more at her ease already just this one little scrap of conversation had done that she became almost affectionate in a shy way before they reached the diningroom i want to ask you something she said as they neared the door what is it she held miss ferrol back with a light clasp on her arm her air was quite tragic in a small way please say louise when you speak to me she said never say miss louisiananevernever no i shall never say miss louisiana her companion answered how would you like miss rogers i would rather have louise she said disappointedly well returned miss ferrol louise let it be and louise it was thenceforward if she had not been so pretty so innocent and so affectionate and humble a young creature she might have been troublesome at times it occurred to olivia ferrol she clung so pertinaciously to their chance acquaintanceship she was so helpless and desolate if left to herself and so inordinately glad to be taken in hand again she made no new friendswhich was perhaps natural enough after all she had nothing in common with the young women who played tenpins and croquet and rode out in parties with their cavaliers she was not of them and understood them as little as they understood her she knew very well that they regarded her with scornful tolerance when they were of the illnatured class and with illsubdued wonder when they were amiable she could not play tenpins or croquet nor could she dance what are the men kneeling down for and why do they keep stopping to put on those queer little caps and things she whispered to miss ferrol one night they are trying to dance a german replied miss ferrol and the man who is leading them only knows one figure as for the riding she had been used to riding all her life but no one asked her to join them and if they had done so she would have been too wiseunsophisticated as she wasto accept the invitation so where miss ferrol was seen she was seen also and she was never so happy as when she was invited into her protectors room and allowed to spend the morning or evening there she would have been content to sit there forever and listen to miss ferrols graphic description of life in the great world the names of celebrated personages made small impression upon her it was revealed gradually to miss ferrol that she had private doubts as to the actual existence of some of them and the rest she had never heard of before you never read the scarlet letter asked her instructress upon one occasion she flushed guiltily no she answered nornor any of the others miss ferrol gazed at her silently for a few moments then she asked her a question in a low voice specially mellowed so that it might not alarm her do you know who john stuart mill is she said no she replied from the dust of humiliation have you never heardjust heardof ruskin no nor of michael angelo nnoyees i think soperhaps but i dont know what he did do you she continued very slowly doyouknowanythingaboutworth no nothing her questioner clasped her hands with repressed emotion oh she cried howhow you have been neglected she was really depressed but her protegee was so much more deeply so that she felt it her duty to contain herself and return to cheerfulness never mind she said i will tell you all i know about them andafter a pause for speculative thought upon the subjectbytheby it isnt much and i will lend you some books to read and give you a list of some you must persuade your father to buy for you and you will be all right it is rather dreadful not to know the names of people and things but after all i think there are very few people whoahem she was checked here by rigid conscientious scruples if she was to train this young mind in the path of learning and literature she must place before her a higher standard of merit than the somewhat shady and slipshod one her eagerness had almost betrayed her into upholding she had heard people talk of standards and ideals and when she was kept to the point and in regulation working order she could be very eloquent upon these subjects herself you will have to work very seriously she remarked rather incongruously and with a rapid change of position if you wish toto acquire anything you must read conscientiously andand with a purpose she was rather proud of that last clause must i inquired louise humbly i should like toif i knew where to begin who was worth was he a poet miss ferrol acquired a fine high color very suddenly oh she answered with some uneasiness youyou have no need to begin with worth he doesnt matter so muchreally i thought miss rogers said meekly that you were more troubled about my not having read what he wrote than about my not knowing any of the others oh no you seethe fact is hehe never wrote anything what did he do she asked anxious for information heit isnt did it is does hemakes dresses dresses this single word but no exclamation point could express its tone of wild amazement yes a man yes there was a dead silence it was embarrassing at first then the amazement of the unsophisticated one began to calm itself it gradually died down and became another emotion merging itself into interest doesguilelessly she inquiredhe make nice ones nice echoed miss ferrol they are works of art i have got three in my trunk oo h sighed louisiana oh dear miss ferrol rose from her chair i will show them to you she said ii should like you to try them on to try them on ejaculated the child in an awestricken tone me yes said miss ferrol unlocking the trunk and throwing back the lid i have been wanting to see you in them since the first day you came she took them out and laid them upon the bed on their trays louise got up from the floor and approaching reverently stood near them there was a creamcolored eveningdress of soft thick closeclinging silk of some antiquemodern sort it had golden fringe and golden flowers embroidered upon it look at that said miss ferrol softlyeven religiously she made a mysterious majestic gesture come here she said you must put it on louise shrank back a pace ioh i darent she cried it is too beautiful come here repeated miss ferrol she obeyed timorously and gave herself into the hands of her controller she was so timid and excited that she trembled all the time her toilette was being performed for her miss ferrol went through this service with the manner of a priestess officiating at an altar she laced up the back of the dress with the slender golden cords she arranged the antique drapery which wound itself around in close swathing folds there was not the shadow of a wrinkle from shoulder to hem the lovely young figure was revealed in all its beauty of outline there were no sleeves at all there was not very much bodice but there was a great deal of effect and this it is to be supposed was the object walk across the floor commanded miss ferrol louisiana obeyed her do it again said miss ferrol having been obeyed for the second time her hands fell together her attitude and expression could be said to be significant only of rapture i said so she cried i said so you might have been born in new york it was a grand climax louisiana felt it to the depths of her reverent young heart but she could not believe it she was sure that it was too sublime to be true she shook her head in deprecation it is no exaggeration said miss ferrol with renewed fervor laurence himself if he were not told that you had lived here would never guess it i should like to try you on him whois he inquired louisiana is he a writer too well yesbut not exactly like the others he is my brother it was two hours before this episode ended only at the sounding of the second bell did louisiana escape to her room to prepare for dinner miss ferrol began to replace the dresses in her trunk she performed her task in an abstracted mood when she had completed it she stood upright and paused a moment with quite a startled air dear me she exclaimed iactually forgot about ruskin chapter iii he is different the same evening as they sat on one of the seats upon the lawn miss ferrol became aware several times that louisiana was regarding her with more than ordinary interest she sat with her hands folded upon her lap her eyes fixed on her face and her pretty mouth actually a little open what are you thinking of olivia asked at length the girl started and recovered herself with an effort iwell i was thinking aboutauthors she stammered any particular author inquired olivia or authors as a class about your brother being one i never thought i should see any one who knew an authorand you are related to one her companions smile was significant of immense experience it was plain that she was so accustomed to living on terms of intimacy with any number of authors that she could afford to feel indifferent about them my dear she said amiably they are not in the least different from other people it sounded something like blasphemy not different cried louisiana oh surely they must be isntisnt your brother different miss ferrol stopped to think she was very fond of her brother privately she considered him the literary man of his day she was simply disgusted when she heard experienced critics only calling him clever and brilliant instead of great and worldmoving yes she replied at length he is different i thought he must be said louisiana with a sigh of relief you are you know am i returned olivia thank you but i am not an authorat leastshe added guiltily nothing i have written has ever been published oh why not exclaimed louisiana why not she repeated dubiously and thoughtfully and then knitting her brows she said i dont know why not i am sure if you have ever written anything it ought to have been published protested her adorer i thought so said miss ferrol butbut they didnt they echoed louisiana who are they the editors she replied in a rather gloomy manner there is a great deal of wirepulling and favoritism andeven envy and malice of which those outside know nothing you wouldnt understand it if i should tell you about it for a few moments she wore quite a fell expression and gloom reigned she gave her head a little shake they regret it afterward she remarkedfrequently from which louisiana gathered that it was the editors who were so overwhelmed and she could not help sympathizing with them in secret there was something in the picture of their unavailing remorse which touched her despite her knowledge of the patent fact that they deserved it and could expect nothing better she was quite glad when olivia brightened up as she did presently laurence is handsomer than most of them and has a more distinguished air she said he is very charming people always say so i wish i could see him ventured louisiana you will see him if you stay here much longer replied miss ferrol it is quite likely he will come to oakvale for a moment louisiana fluttered and turned pale with pleasure but as suddenly she drooped i forgot she faltered you will have to be with him always and i shall have no one he wont want me olivia sat and looked at her with deepening interest she was thinking again of a certain whimsical idea which had beset her several times since she had attired her protegee in the creamcolored robe louise she said in a low mysterious tone how would you like to wear dresses like mine all the rest of the time you are here the child stared at her blankly i havent got any she gasped no said miss ferrol with deliberation but i have she rose from her seat dropping her mysterious air and smiling encouragingly come with me to my room she said i want to talk to you if she had ordered her to follow her to the stake it is not at all unlikely that louisiana would have obeyed she got up meekly smiling too and feeling sure something very interesting was going to happen she did not understand in the least but she was quite tractable and after they had reached the room and shut themselves in she found that it was something very interesting which was to happen you remember what i said to you this morning miss ferrol suggested you said so many things oh but you cannot have forgotten this particular thing i said you looked as if you had been born in new york louisiana remembered with a glow of rapture oh yes she answered and i said laurence himself would not know if he was not told that you had lived all your life here yes and i said i should like to try you on him yes miss ferrol kept her eyes fixed on her and watched her closely i have been thinking of it all the morning she added i should like to try you on him louisiana was silent a moment then she spoke hesitatingly do you mean that i should pretend she began oh no interrupted miss ferrol not pretend either one thing or the other only let me dress you as i choose and then take care that you say nothing whatever about your past life you will have to be rather quiet perhaps and let him talk he will like that of coursemen always doand then you will learn a great many things from him it will bea very strange thing to do said louisiana it will be a very interesting thing answered olivia her enthusiasm increasing how he will admire you louisiana indulged in one of her blushes have you a picture of him yes why she asked in some surprise because i should like to see his face do you think miss ferrol said in further bewilderment that you might not like him i think he might not like me not like you cried miss ferrol you he will think you are divinewhen you are dressed as i shall dress you she went to her trunk and produced the picture it was not a photograph but a little crayon headthe head of a handsome man whose expression was a singular combination of dreaminess and alertness it was a fascinating face one of his friends did it said miss ferrol his friends are very fond of him and admire his good looks very much they protest against his being photographed they like to sketch him they are always making studies of his head what do you think of him louisiana hesitated he is different she said at last i thought he would be she gave the picture back to miss ferrol who replaced it in her trunk she sat for a few seconds looking down at the carpet and apparently seeing very little then she looked up at her companion who was suddenly a little embarrassed at finding her receive her whimsical planning so seriously she herself had not thought of it as being serious at all it would be interesting and amusing and would prove her theory i will do what you want me to do said louisiana then said miss ferrol wondering at an unexpected sense of discomfort in herself i will dress you for supper now you must begin to wear the things so that you may get used to them chapter iv a new type when the two entered the supperroom together a little commotion was caused by their arrival at first the supple young figure in violet and gray was not recognized it was not the figure people had been used to it seemed so tall and slenderly round the reddishbrown hair was combed high and made into soft puffs it made the pretty head seem more delicately shaped and showed how white and graceful the back of the slender neck was it was several minutes before the problem was solved then a sharp young woman exclaimed sotto voce its the little countrygirl in new clothesin clothes that fit would you believe it dont look at your plate so steadily whispered miss ferrol lean back and fan yourself as if you did not hear you must never show that you hear things i shall be obliged to give her a few hints now and then she had said to herself beforehand but i feel sure when she once catches the cue she will take it it really seemed as if she did too she had looked at herself long and steadily after she had been dressed and when she turned away from the glass she held her head a trifle more erect and her cheeks had reddened perhaps what she had recognized in the reflection she had seen had taught her a lesson but she said nothing in a few days olivia herself was surprised at the progress she had made sanguine as she was she had not been quite prepared for the change which had taken place in her she had felt sure it would be necessary to teach her to control her emotions but suddenly she seemed to have learned to control them without being told to do so she was no longer demonstrative of her affection she no longer asked innocent questions nor did she ever speak of her family her reserve was puzzling to olivia you are very clever she said to her one day the words breaking from her in spite of herself after she had sat regarding her in silence for a few minutes you are even cleverer than i thought you were louise was that very clever the girl asked yes it was olivia answered but not so clever as you are proving yourself but louisiana did not smile or blush as she had expected she would she sat very quietly showing neither pleasure nor shyness and seeming for a moment or so to be absorbed in thought in the evening when the stages came in they were sitting on the front gallery together as the old rattletraps bumped and swung themselves up the gravel drive olivia bent forward to obtain a better view of the passengers he ought to be among them she said louisiana laid her hand on her arm who is that sitting with the driver she asked as the second vehicle passed them isnt that to be sure it is exclaimed miss ferrol she would have left her seat but she found herself detained her companion had grasped her wrist wait a minute she said dont leave me ohi wish i had not done it miss ferrol turned and stared at her in amazement she spoke in her old uncontrolled childish fashion she was pale and her eyes were dilated what is the matter said miss ferrol hurriedly when she found her voice is it that you really dont like the idea if you dont there is no need of our carrying it out it was only nonsensei beg your pardon for not seeing that it disturbed you perhaps after all it was very bad taste in me but she was not allowed to finish her sentence as suddenly as it had altered before louisianas expression altered again she rose to her feet with a strange little smile she looked into miss ferrols astonished face steadily and calmly your brother has seen you and is coming toward us she said i will leave you we shall see each other again at supper and with a little bow she moved away with an air of composure which left her instructress stunned she could scarcely recover her equilibrium sufficiently to greet her brother decently when he reached her side she had never been so thoroughly at sea in her life after she had gone to her room that night her brother came and knocked at the door when she opened it and let him in he walked to a chair and threw himself into it wearing a rather excited look olivia he began at once what a bewildering girl olivia sat down opposite to him with a composed smile miss rogers of course she said of course he echoed and then after a pause of two or three seconds he added in the tone he had used before what a delightfully mysterious girl mysterious repeated olivia there is no other word for it she has such an adorable face she looks so young and she says so little and then with serious delight he added it is a new type olivia began to laugh why are you laughing he demanded because i was so sure you would say that she answered i was waiting for it but it is true he replied quite vehemently i never saw anything like her before i look at her great soft eyes and i catch glimpses of expression which dont seem to belong to the rest of her when i see her eyes i could fancy for a moment that she had been brought up in a convent or had lived a very simple isolated life but when she speaks and moves i am bewildered i want to hear her talk but she says so little she does not even dance i suppose her relatives are serious people i dare say you have not heard much of them from her her reserve is so extraordinary in a girl i wonder how old she is nineteen i think i thought so i never saw anything prettier than her quiet way when i asked her to dance with me she said simply i do not dance i have never learned it was as if she had never thought of it as being an unusual thing he talked of her all the time he remained in the room olivia had never seen him so interested before the fascination is that she seems to be two creatures at once he said and one of them is stronger than the other and will break out and reveal itself one day i begin by feeling i do not understand her and that is the most interesting of all beginnings i long to discover which of the two creatures is the real one when he was going away he stopped suddenly to say how was it you never mentioned her in your letters i cant understand that i wanted you to see her for yourself olivia answered i thought i would wait well he said after thinking a moment i am glad after all that you did chapter v i have hurt you from the day of his arrival a new life began for louisiana she was no longer an obscure and unconsidered young person suddenly and for the first time in her life she found herself vested with a marvellous power it was a power girls of a different class from her own are vested with from the beginning of their lives they are used to it and regard it as their birthright louisiana was not used to it there had been nothing like it attending her position as that purty gal o rogerses she was accustomed to the admiration of men she was indifferent tomen who wore shortwaisted bluejean coats and turned upon their elbows to stare at her as she sat in the little white frame church after making an effort to cultivate her acquaintance they generally went away disconcerted shes mighty still they said she haint got nothin to say seems like thar aint much to herbut shes powerful purty though this was nothing like her present experience she began slowly to realize that she was a little like a young queen now here was a man such as she had never spoken to before who was always ready to endeavor to his utmost to please her who without any tendency toward sentimental nonsense was plainly the happier for her presence and favor what could be more assiduous and gallant than the everyday behavior of the wellbred thoroughly experienced young man of the period toward the young beauty who for the moment reigns over his fancy it need only be over his fancy there is no necessity that the impression should be any deeper his suavity his chivalric air his ready wit in her service are all that could be desired when louisiana awakened to the fact that all this homage was rendered to her as being only the natural result of her girlish beautyas if it was the simplest thing in the world and a state of affairs which must have existed from the firstshe experienced a sense of terror just at the very first she would have been glad to escape from it and sink into her old obscurity it does not belong to me she said to herself it belongs to some one elseto the girl he thinks i am i am not that girl though i will remember that but in a few days she calmed down she told herself that she always did remember but she ceased to feel frightened and was more at ease she never talked very much but she became more familiar with the subjects she heard discussed one morning she went to olivias room and asked her for the address of a bookseller i want to send for some books andand magazines she said confusedly i wish youif you would tell me what to send for father will give me the money if i ask him for it olivia sat down and made a list it was along list comprising the best periodicals of the day and several standard books when she handed it to her she regarded her with curiosity you mean to read them all she asked isnt it time that i should replied her pupil wellit is a good plan returned olivia rather absently truth to tell she was more puzzled every day she had begun to be quite sure that something had happened it seemed as if a slight coldness existed between herself and her whilom adorer the simplicity of her enthusiasm was gone her affection had changed as her outward bearing it was a better regulated and less noticeable emotion once or twice olivia fancied she had seen the girl looking at her even sadly as if she felt for the moment a sense of some loss perhaps it was very clumsy in me she used to say to herself perhaps i dont understand her after all but she could not help looking on with interest she had never before seen laurence enjoy himself so thoroughly he had been working very hard during the past year and was ready for his holiday he found the utter idleness which was the chief feature of the place a good thing there was no town or village within twenty miles newspapers were a day or two old when they arrived there were very few books to be found and there was absolutely no excitement at night the band brayed in the emptylooking ballroom and a few very young couples danced in a desultory fashion and without any ceremony the primitive domesticated slowness of the place was charming most of the guests had come from the far south at the beginning of the season and would remain until the close of it so they had had time to become familiar with each other and to throw aside restraint there is nothing to distract one ferrol said nothing to rouse one nothing to inspire onenothing it is delicious why didnt i know of it before he had plenty of time to study his sisters friend she rode and walked with him and olivia when they made their excursions she listened while he read aloud to them as he lay on the grass in a quiet corner of the grounds he thought her natural reserve held her from expressing her opinion on what he read very freely it certainly did not occur to him that she was beginning her literary education under his guidance he could see that the things which pleased him most were not lost upon her her face told him that one moonlight night as they sat on an upper gallery he began to speak of the novelty of the aspect of the country as it presented itself to an outsider who saw it for the first time it is a new life and a new people he said and by the way olivia where is the new species of young woman i was to seethe daughter of the people who does not belong to her sphere he turned to louisiana have you ever seen her he asked i must confess to a dubiousness on the subject before he could add another word louisiana turned upon him he could see her face clearly in the moonlight it was white and her eyes were dilated and full of fire why do you speak in that way she cried as ifas if such people were so far beneath you what right have you she stopped suddenly laurence ferrol was gazing at her in amazement she rose from her seat trembling i will go away a little she said i beg your pardonand miss ferrols she turned her back upon them and went away ferrol sat holding her little round whitefeather fan helplessly and staring after her until she disappeared it was several seconds before the silence was broken it was he who broke it i dont know what it means he said in a low voice i dont know what i have done in a little while he got up and began to roam aimlessly about the gallery he strolled from one end to the other with his hands thrust in his coat pockets olivia who had remained seated knew that he was waiting in hopes that louisiana would return he had been walking to and fro looking as miserable as possible for about half an hour when at last she saw him pause and turn half round before the open door of an upper corridor leading out upon the verandah a black figure stood revealed against the inside light it was louisiana and after hesitating a moment she moved slowly forward she had not recovered her color but her manner was perfectly quiet i am glad you did not go away she said ferrol had only stood still at first waiting her pleasure but the instant she spoke he made a quick step toward her i should have felt it a very hard thing not to have seen you again before i slept he said she made no reply and they walked together in silence until they reached the opposite end of the gallery miss ferrol has gone in she said then he turned to look and saw that such was the case suddenly for some reason best known to herself olivia had disappeared from the scene louisiana leaned against one of the slender supporting pillars of the gallery she did not look at ferrol but at the blackness of the mountains rising before them ferrol could not look away from her if you had not come out again he said after a pause i think i should have remained here baying at the moon all night then as she made no reply he began to pour himself forth quite recklessly i cannot quite understand how i hurt you he said it seemed to me that i must have hurt you but even while i dont understand there are no words abject enough to express what i feel now and have felt during the last half hour if i only dared ask you to tell me she stopped him i cant tell you she said but it is not your faultit is nothing you could have understoodit is my faultall my fault andi deserve it he was terribly discouraged i am bewildered he said i am very unhappy she turned her pretty pale face round to him swiftly it is not you who need be unhappy she exclaimed it is i the next instant she had checked herself again just as she had done before let us talk of something else she said coldly it will not be easy for me to do so he answered but i will try before olivia went to bed she had a visit from her she received her with some embarrassment it must be confessed day by day she felt less at ease with her and more deeply selfconvicted of some blunderingwhich to a young woman of her temperament was a sharp penalty louisiana would not sit down she revealed her purpose in coming at once i want to ask you to make me a promise she said and i want to ask your pardon dont do that said olivia i want you to promise that you will not tell your brother the truth until you have left here and are at home i shall go away very soon i am tired of what i have been doing it is different from what you meant it to be but you must promise that if you stay after i have goneas of course you willyou will not tell him my home is only a few miles away you might be tempted after thinking it over to come and see meand i should not like it i want it all to stop herei mean my part of it i dont want to know the rest olivia had never felt so helpless in her life she had neither selfpoise nor tact nor any other daring quality left i wish she faltered gazing at the girl quite pathetically i wish we had never begun it so do i said louisiana do you promise yyes i would promise anything ii have hurt your feelings she confessed in an outbreak she was destined to receive a fresh shock all at once the girl was metamorphosed again it was her old ignorant sweet simple self who stood there with trembling lips and dilated eyes yes you have she cried yes you have and she burst into tears and turned about and ran out of the room chapter vi the road to the right the morning after ferrol heard an announcement which came upon him like a clap of thunder after breakfast as they walked about the grounds olivia who had seemed to be in an abstracted mood said without any preface miss rogers returns home tomorrow laurence stopped short in the middle of the path tomorrow he exclaimed oh no he glanced across at louisiana with an anxious face yes she said i am going home to new york i do not live in new york she spoke quite simply but the words were a shock to him they embarrassed him there was no coldness in her manner no displeasure in her tone but of course he understood that it would be worse than tactless to inquire further was it possible that she did not care that he should know where she lived there seemed no other construction to be placed upon her words he flushed a little and for a few minutes looked rather gloomy though he quickly recovered himself afterward and changed the subject with creditable readiness did not you tell me she lived in new york he asked olivia the first time they were alone together no olivia answered a trifle sharply why new york more than another place for no reason whateverreally he returned more bewildered than ever there was no reason why i should choose new york only when i spoke to her of certain places there sheshe he paused and thought the matter over carefully before finishing his sentence he ended it at last in a singular manner she said nothing he said it is actually truenow i think of itshe said nothing whatever and because she said nothing whatever began olivia he drew his hand across his forehead with a puzzled gesture i fancied she looked as if she knew he said slowly i am sure she looked as if she knew what i was talking aboutas if she knew the places i mean it is very queer there seems no reason in it why shouldnt she wish us to know where she lives ii must confess cried olivia that i am getting a little tired of her it was treacherous and vicious and she knew it was but her guilty conscience and her increasing sense of having bungled drove her to desperation if she had not promised to keep the truth to herself she would have been only too glad to unburden herself it was so stupid after all and she had only herself to blame laurence drew a long breath you can not be tired of her he said that is impossible she takes firmer hold upon one every hour this was certainly true as far as he was concerned he was often even surprised at his own enthusiasm he had seen so many pretty women that it was almost inconsistent that he should be so much moved by the prettiness of one charming creature and particularly one who spoke so little who after all wasbut there he always found himself at a full stop he could not say what she was he did not know yet really he seemed no nearer the solution of the mystery than he had been at first there lay the fascination he felt so sure there was an immense deal for him to discover if he could only discover it he had an ideal in his mind and this ideal he felt confident was the real creature if he could only see her during the episode on the upper gallery he fancied he had caught a glimpse of what was to be revealed the sudden passion on her pale young face the fire in her eyes were what he had dreamed of if he had not been possessed of courage and an honest faith in himself born of a goodly amount of success he would have been far more depressed than he was she was going away and had not encouraged him to look forward to their meeting again i own it is rather bad to look at he said to himself if one quite believed that fate would serve one such an ill turn she never played me such a trick however and i wont believe she will i shall see her againsometime it will turn out fairly enough surely so with this consolation he supported himself there was one day left and he meant to make the best of it it was to be spent in driving to a certain mountain about ten miles distant all tourists who were possessed of sufficient energy made this excursion as a matter of duty if from no more enthusiastic motive a strong light carriage and a pair of horses were kept in the hotel stables for the express purpose of conveying guests to this special point this vehicle ferrol had engaged the day before and as matters had developed he had cause to congratulate himself upon the fact he said to louisiana what he had before said to himself we have one day left and we will make the best of it olivia who stood upon the gallery before which the carriage had been drawn up glanced at louisiana furtively on her part she felt privately that it would be rather hard to make the best of it she wished that it was well over but louisiana did not return her glance she was looking at ferrol and the horses she had done something new this morning she had laid aside her borrowed splendor and attired herself in one of her own dresses which she had had the boldness to remodel she had seized a hint from some one of olivias possessions and had given her costume a pretty air of primitive simplicity it was a plain white lawn with a little frilled cape or fichu which crossed upon her breast and was knotted loosely behind she had a black velvet ribbon around her lithe waist a rose in her bosom where the fichu crossed and a broad gainsborough hat upon her head one was reminded somewhat of the picturesque young woman of the good old colony times ferrol at least when he first caught sight of her was reminded of pictures he had seen of them there was no trace of her last nights fire in her manner she was quieter than usual through the first part of the drive she was gentle to submissiveness to olivia there was something even tender in her voice once or twice when she addressed her laurence noticed it and accounted for it naturally enough she is really fonder of her than she has seemed he thought and she is sorry that their parting is so near he was just arriving at this conclusion when louisiana touched his arm dont take that road she said he drew up his horses and looked at her with surprise there were two roads before them and he had been upon the point of taking the one to the right but it is the only road to take he continued the other does not lead to the mountain i was told to be sure to take the road to the right hand it is a mistake she said in a disturbed tone the lefthand road leads to the mountain tooat least we can reach it by striking the wagonroad through the woods iyes i am sure of it but this is the better road is there any reason why you prefer the other could you pilot us if you can he stopped and looked at her appealingly he was ready to do anything she wished but the necessity for his yielding had passed her face assumed a set look i cant she answered take the road to the right why not chapter vii she aint yere ferrol was obliged to admit when they turned their faces homeward that the day was hardly a success after all olivia had not been at her best for some reason or other and from the moment they had taken the righthand road louisiana had been wholly incomprehensible in her quietest mood she had never worn a cold air before today she had been cold and unresponsive it had struck him that she was absorbed in thinking of something which was quite beyond him she was plainly not thinking of him nor of olivia nor of the journey they were making during the drive she had sat with her hands folded upon her lap her eyes fixed straight before her she had paid no attention to the scenery only rousing herself to call their attention to one object this object was a house they passedthe rambling lowroofed white house of some welltodo farmer it was set upon a small hill and had a long front porch mottled with blue and white paint in a sanguine attempt at imitating variegated marble she burst into a low laugh when she saw it look at that she said that is one of the finest houses in the country the man who owns it is counted a rich man among his neighbors ferrol put up his eyeglasses to examine it it is to be deplored that he was a trifle nearsighted by george he said that is an idea isnt it that marble business i wonder who did it do you know the man who lives there i have heard of him she answered from several people he is a namesake of mine his name is rogers when they returned to their carriage after a ramble up the mountainside they became conscious that the sky had suddenly darkened ferrol looked up and his face assumed a rather serious expression if either of you is weatherwise he said i wish you would tell me what that cloud means you have been among the mountains longer than i have louisiana glanced upward quickly it means a storm she said and a heavy one we shall be drenched in half an hour ferrol looked at her white dress and the little frilled fichu which was her sole protection oh but that wont do he exclaimed what insanity in me not to think of umbrellas umbrellas echoed louisiana if we had each six umbrellas they could not save us we may as well get into the carriage we are only losing time they were just getting in when an idea struck ferrol which caused him to utter an exclamation of ecstatic relief why he cried there is that house we passed get in quickly we can reach there in twenty minutes louisiana had her foot upon the step she stopped short and turned to face him she changed from red to white and from white to red again as if with actual terror there she exclaimed there yes he answered we can reach there in time to save ourselves is there any objection to our goingin the last extremity for a second they looked into each others eyes and then she turned and sprang into the carriage she laughed aloud oh no she said go there it will be a nice place to stayand the people will amuse you go there they reached the house in a quarter of an hour instead of twenty minutes they had driven fast and kept ahead of the storm but when they drew up before the picket fence the clouds were black and the thunder was rolling behind them it was louisiana who got out first she led the way up the path to the house and mounted the steps of the variegated porch she did not knock at the door which stood open but somewhat to fermis amazement walked at once into the front room which was plainly the room of state not to put too fine a point upon it it was a hideous room the ceiling was so low that ferrol felt as if he must knock his head against it it was paperedceiling and allwith paper of an unwholesome yellow enlivened with large blue flowers there was a bedstead in one corner and the walls were ornamented with colored lithographs of moonfaced houris with round eyes and round red cheeks and wearing lownecked dresses and flowers in their bosoms and bright yellow gold necklaces these works of art were the first things which caught ferrols eye and he went slowly up to the most remarkable and stood before it regarding it with mingled wonderment and awe he turned from it after a few seconds to look at louisiana who stood near him and he beheld what seemed to him a phenomenon he had never seen her blush before as other women blushnow she was blushing burning red from chin to brow therethere is no one in this part of the house she said ii know more of these people than you do i will go and try to find some one she was gone before he could interpose not that he would have interposed perhaps somehowwithout knowing whyhe felt as if she did know more of the situation than he didalmost as if she were in a manner doing the honors for the time being she crossed the passage with a quick uneven step and made her way as if well used to the place into the kitchen at the back of the house a stout negro woman stood at a table filling a pan with newly made biscuits her back was toward the door and she did not see who entered aunt cassandry the girl began when the woman turned toward her whos dar she exclaimed lor honey how ye skeert me i aint no csandry the face she turned was a strange one and it showed no sign of recognition of her visitor it was an odd thing that the sight of her unfamiliar face should have been a shock to louisiana but it was a shock she put her hand to her side where is mywhere is mr rogers she asked i want to see him out on de back poch honey right now dar he goes the girl heard him and flew out to meet him her heart was throbbing hard and she was drawing quick short breaths father she cried father dont go in the house and she caught him by both shoulders and drew him round he did not know her at first in her fancifulsimple dress and her gainsborough hat he was not used to that style of thing believing that it belonged rather to the world of pictures he stared at her then he broke out with an exclamation lord louisianny she kept her eyes on his face they were feverishly bright and her cheeks were hot she laughed hysterically dont speak loud she said there are some strange people in the house andand i want to tell you something he was a slow man and it took him some time to grasp the fact that she was really before him in the flesh he said again lord louisianny adding cheerfully how yeve serprised me then he took in afresh the change in her dress there was a pile of stovewood stacked on the porch to be ready for use and he sat down on it to look at her why yeve got a new dress on he said thet thars what made ye look sorter curis i hardly knowed ye then he remembered what she had said on first seeing him why dont ye want me to go in the house he asked what sort o folks air they they came with me from the springs she answered andand i want toto play a joke on them she put her hands up to her burning cheeks and stood so a joke on em he repeated yes she said speaking very fast they dont know i live here they think i came from some citythey took the notion themselvesand i want to let them think so until we go away from the house it will be such a good joke she tried to laugh but broke off in the middle of a harsh sound her father with one copperascolored leg crossed over the other was chewing his tobacco slowly after the manner of a ruminating animal while he watched her dont you see she asked waal no he answered not rightly she actually assumed a kind of spectral gayety i never thought of it until i saw it was not cassandry who was in the kitchen she said the woman who is there didnt know me and it came into my mind thatthat we might play off on them using the phraseology to which he was the most accustomed waal we mought he admitted with a speculative deliberateness thets so we moughtif thar was any use in it its only for a joke she persisted hurriedly thets so he repeated thets so he got up slowly and rather lumberingly from his seat and dusted the chips from his copperascolored legs hev ye ben enjyin yerself louisianny he asked yes she answered never better ye must hev he returned or ye wouldnt be in sperrits to play jokes then he changed his tone so suddenly that she was startled what do ye want me to do he asked she put her hand on his shoulder and tried to laugh again to pretend you dont know meto pretend i have never been here before thats joke enough isnt it they will think so when i tell them the truth you slow old father why dont you laugh praps he said its on account o me bein slow louisianny mebbe i shall begin arter a while dont begin at the wrong time she said still keeping up her feverish laugh or youll spoil it all now come along in andand pretend you dont know me she continued drawing him forward by the arm they might suspect something if we stay so long all youve got to do is to pretend you dont know me thats so louisianny with a kindly glance downward at her excited face as he followed her out thar aint no call fur me to do nothin else is therejust pretend i dont know ye it was wonderful how well he did it too when she preceded him into the room the girl was quivering with excitement he might break down and it would be all over in a second but she looked ferrol boldly in the face when she made her first speech this is the gentleman of the house she said i found him on the back porch he had just come in he has been kind enough to say we may stay until the storm is over oh yes said he hospitably stay an welcome ye aint the first as has stopped over storms come up sorter suddent an we haint the kind as turns folks away ferrol thanked him olivia joining in with a murmur of gratitude they were very much indebted to him for his hospitality they considered themselves very fortunate their host received their protestations with much equanimity if yed like to set out on the front porch and watch the storm come up he said thars seats thar or would ye druther set here womenfolks is genrally fond o settin indoors whar thars a parlor but they preferred the porch and followed him out upon it having seen them seated he took a chair himself it was a splitseated chair painted green and he tilted it back against a pillar of the porch and applied himself to the full enjoyment of a position more remarkable for ease than elegance ferrol regarded him with stealthy rapture and drank in every word he uttered this he had exclaimed delightedly to olivia in privatewhy this is delightful these are the people we have read of i scarcely believed in them before i would not have missed it for the world in ginral now their entertainer proceeded wimminfolk is fonder o settin in parlors my wife was powerful sot on her parlor she wasnt never satisfied till she hed one an hed it fixed up to her notion she was allers tradin fur picters fur it she tuk a heap o pride in her picters she allers had it in her mind that her little gal should have a showy parlor when she growed up you have a daughter said ferrol their host hitched his chair a little to one side he bent forward to expectorate and then answered with his eyes fixed upon some distant point toward the mountains waal yes he said but she aint yere louisianny aint miss ferrol gave a little start and immediately made an effort to appear entirely at ease did you say asked ferrol that your daughters name was louisianny promptly i come from thar louisiana got up and walked to the opposite end of the porch the storm will be upon us in a few minutes she said it is beginning to rain now come and look at this cloud driving over the mountaintop ferrol rose and went to her he stood for a moment looking at the cloud but plainly not thinking of it his daughters name is louisiana he said in an undertone louisiana isnt that delicious suddenly even as he spoke a new idea occurred to him why he exclaimed your name is louise isnt it i think olivia said so yes she answered my name is louise how should you have liked it he inquired absentmindedly if it had been louisiana she answered him with a hard coolness which it startled him afterward to remember how would you have liked it she said they were driven back just then by the rain which began to beat in upon their end of the porch they were obliged to return to olivia and mr rogers who were engaged in an animated conversation the fact was that in her momentary excitement olivia had plunged into conversation as a refuge she had suddenly poured forth a stream of remark and query which had the effect of spurring up her companion to a like exhibition of frankness he had been asking questions too shes ben tellin me he said as ferrol approached thet youre a littery man an write fur the papersnovelstories an pomes an things i never seen one beforenot as i know on i wonder why not remarked ferrol we are plentiful enough air ye now he asked reflectively i had an idee thar was only one on ye now an aginjest now an agin he paused there to shake his head ive often wondered how ye could do it he said i couldnt thars some as thinks they could if they tried but i want never thatawayi want never thataway i haint no idee i could do it not if i tried ever so seems to me he went on with the air of making an announcement of so novel a nature that he must present it modestly seems to me now as if them as does it must hev a kinder gift furit now lord i couldnt write a novel i wouldnt know whar to begin it is difficult to decide where said ferrol he did not smile at all his manner was perfectso full of interest indeed that mr rogers quite warmed and expanded under it the scenes on em all now bein mostly laid in bagdad would be agin me if nothin else war he proceeded being laid queried ferrol in bagdad orwaal furrin parts tharabouts ye see i couldnt tell nothin much about no place but north caliny an folks wouldnt buy it but why not exclaimed ferrol why lord bless ye he said hilariously theyd know it want true theyd say in a minnit why thars thet fool rogers

allers writ about things ahappenin in bagdad ye kin say most anythin ye like about bagdad an no one caynt contradict ye i dont seem to remember many novels ofof that particular description remarked

ferrol and it was a story of life in bagdad yes an ive heard tell of others as was the same hance claiborn now he was atellen me of one he checked himself to speak to the negro woman who had presented herself at a room door were acomin nancy he said with an air of goodfellowship now ladies an gentlemen he added rising from his chair walk in an have some supper ferrol and olivia rose with some hesitation you are very kind they said we did not intend to give you trouble trouble he replied as if scarcely comprehending this yere aint no trouble ye haint ben in north caliny before hev ye he continued goodnaturedly were bound to hev ye eat if ye stay with us long enough we wouldnt let ye go way without eatin bless ye we aint that kind walk straight in he led them into a long low room half kitchen half diningroom it was not so ugly as the room of state because it was entirely unadorned its ceiled walls were painted brown and stained with many a winters smoke the pine table was spread with a clean homespun cloth and heaped with wellcooked appetizing food if ye can put up with country fare yell not find it so bad said the host nancy prides herself on her way o doin things there never was more kindly hospitality ferrol thought the simple generosity which made them favored guests at once warmed and touched him he glanced across at louisiana to see if she was not as much pleased as he was himself but the food upon her plate remained almost untouched there was a strange look on her face she was deadly pale and her downcast eyes shone under their lashes she did not look at their host at all it struck ferrol that she avoided looking at him with a strong effort her pallor made him anxious you are not well he said to her you do not look well at all their host started and turned toward her why no ye aint he exclaimed quite tremulously lord no ye caynt be ye haint no color whatwhats the trouble loulord i was gwine to call ye louisianny anshe aint yere louisianny aint he ended with a nervous laugh im used to takin a heap o care on her he said ive lost ten on em an shes all thats left me anan i think a heap on her ii wish she was yere ye musnt git sick maam the girl got up hurriedly i am not sick really she said the thunderi have a little headache i will go out on to the porch its clearing up now the fresh air will do me good the old man rose too with rather a flurried manner if louisianny was yere he faltered she could give ye something to help ye camphire nowsperrits of camphirelet me git ye some nono said the girl no thank you and she slipped out of the door and was gone mr rogers sat down again with a sigh i wish shed let me git her some he said wistfully i know how it is with young critters like that theyre delecate anxiously lord theyre delecate theyd oughter hev their mothers round em i know how it is with louisianny a cloud seemed to settle upon him he rubbed his grizzled chin with his hand again and again glancing at the open door as he did it it was evident that his heart was outside with the girl who was like louisianny chapter viii nothing has hurt you the storm was quite over and the sun was setting in flames of gold when the meal was ended and they went out on the porch again mr rogers had scarcely recovered himself but he had made an effort to do so and had so far succeeded as to begin to describe the nature of the one novel he had read still he had rubbed his chin and kept his eye uneasily on the door all the time he had been talking it was about a frenchman he said seriously an his name wasfrankoysefrancois frankoyse thet thars a french name aint it me an ianthy lowed it was common to the country it dont belong yere frankoyse dont an its got a furrin sound ityes it is a french name assented ferrol a few minutes afterward they went out louisiana stood at the end of the porch leaning against a wooden pillar and twisting an arm around it are ye better mr rogers asked i am goin to tend to my stock an if ye aint mebbe the camphiresperrits of camphire i dont need it she answered i am quite well so he went away and left them promising to return shortly and gear up their critters for them that they might go on their way when he was gone there was a silence of a few seconds which ferrol could not exactly account for almost for the first time in his manhood he did not know what to say gradually there had settled upon him the conviction that something had gone very wrong indeed that there was something mysterious and complicated at work that somehow he himself was involved and that his position was at once a most singular and delicate one it was several moments before he could decide that his best plan seemed to be to try to conceal his bewilderment and appear at ease and very naturally the speech he chose to begin with was the most unlucky he could have hit upon he is charming he said what a lovable old fellow what a delicious old fellow he has been telling me about the novel it is the story of a frenchman and his nametry to guess his name but louisiana did not try you couldnt guess it he went on it is better than all the rest his name wasfrankoyse that instant she turned round she was shaking all over like a leaf good heavens flashed through his mind this is a climax this is the real creature dont laugh again she cried dont dare to laugh i wont bear it he is my father for a second or so he had not the breath to speak your father he said when he found his voice your father yours yes she answered mine this is my home i have lived here all my lifemy name is louisiana you have laughed at me too it was the real creature indeed whom he saw she burst into passionate tears do you think that i kept up this pretense today because i was ashamed of him she said do you think i did it because i did not love himand respect himand think him better than all the rest of the world it was because i loved him so much that i did itbecause i knew so well that you would say to each other that he was not like methat he was rougher and that it was a wonder i belonged to him it is a wonder i belong to him i am not worthy to kiss his shoes i have been ashamedi have been bad enough for that but not bad enough to be ashamed of him i thought at first it would be better to let you believe what you wouldthat it would soon be over and we should never see each other again but i did not think that i should have to sit by and see you laugh because he does not know the world as you dobecause he has always lived his simple good life in one simple country place ferrol had grown as pale as she was herself he groaned aloud oh he cried what shall i say to you for heavens sake try to understand that it is not at him i have laughed but he has never been away from home she broke in he has worked too hard to have time to read and she stopped and dropped her hands with a gesture of unutterable pride why should i tell you that she said it sounds as if i were apologizing for him and there is no need that i should if i could understand began ferrolif i could realize ask your sister she replied it was her plan ii with a little sob am only her experiment olivia came forward looking wholly subdued her eyes were wet too it is true she said it is all my fault may i ask you to explain said ferrol rather sternly i suppose some of this has been for my benefit dont speak in that tone said olivia it is bad enough as it is ii never was so wretched in my life i never dreamed of its turning out in this way she was so pretty and gentle and quick to take a hint andi wanted to try the experimentto see if you would guess at the truth ii had a theory and i was so much interested thati forgot toto think of her very much i did not think she would care louisiana broke in yes she said her eyes bright with pain she forgot i was very fond of her and i knew so very little that she forgot to think of me i was only a kind of playthingbut i was too proud to remind her i thought it would be soon over and i knew how ignorant i was i was afraid to trust my feelings at first i thought perhapsit was vanity and i ought to crush it down i was very fond of her oh cried olivia piteously dont say was louise dont say louise was the reply say louisiana i am not ashamed of it now i want mr ferrol to hear it i have nothing to say in selfdefense laurence replied hopelessly there is nothing for any of us to say but goodby said louisiana we shall never see each other again it is all over between us you will go your way and i shall go mine i shall stay here tonight you must drive back to the springs without me i ought never to have gone there laurence threw himself into a chair and sat shading his face with his hand he stared from under it at the shining wet grass and leaves even yet he scarcely believed that all this was true he felt as if he were walking in a dream the worst of it was this desperate feeling that there was nothing for him to say there was a long silence but at last louisiana left her place and came and stood before him i am going to meet my father she said i persuaded him that i was only playing a joke he thought it was one of my fancies and he helped me out because i asked him to do it i am going to tell him that i have told you the truth he wont know why i did it i will make it easy for you i shall not see you again goodby ferrols misery got the better of him i cant bear this he cried springing up i cant indeed she drew back why not she said nothing has hurt you the simple coldness of her manner was very hard upon him indeed you think i have no right to complain he answered and yet see how you send me away you speak as if you did not intend to let me see you again no she interposed you shall not see me again why should you ask your sister to tell you how ignorant i am she knows why should you come here there would always be as much to laugh at as there has been today go where you need not laugh this is not the place for you goodby then he knew he need say no more she spoke with a childs passion and with a womans proud obstinacy then she turned to olivia he was thrilled to the heart as he watched her while she did it her eyes were full of tears but she had put both her hands behind her goodby she said olivia broke down altogether is that the way you are going to say goodby she cried i did not think you were so hard if i had meant any harmbut i didntand you look as if you never would forgive me i may some time answered the girl i dont yet i did not think i was so hard either her hands fell at her sides and she stood trembling a second all at once she had broken down too i loved you she said but you did not love me and then she turned away and walked slowly into the house it was almost half an hour before their host came to them with the news that their carriage was ready he looked rather off color himself and wore a wearied air but he was very uncommunicative louisianny lowed shed go to bed an sleep off her headache instead of goin back to the springs he said ill be thar in a day or two to tend to her bill an the rest on it i low the waters haint done her much good she aint at herself rightly i knowed she wasnt when she was so notionate this evenin she aint notionate when shes at herself we are much indebted to you for your kindness said ferrol when he took the reins oh thet aint nothin youre welcome youd hev hed a better time if louisianny had been at herself goodby to ye yell hev plenty of moonlight to see ye home their long ride was a silent one when they reached the end of it and olivia had been helped out of the carriage and stood in the moonlight upon the deserted gallery where she had stood with louisiana in the morning she looked very suitably miserable laurence she said i dont exactly see why you should feel so very severe about it i am sure i am as abject as any one could wish he stood a moment in silence looking absently out on the moonlightflooded lawn everything was still and wore an air of desolation we wont talk about it he said at last but you have done me an illturn olivia chapter ix dont ye louisianny as he said it louisiana was at home in the houseroom sitting on a low chair at her fathers knee and looking into the fire she had not gone to bed when he returned to the house her father had found her sitting here and she had not left her place since a wood fire had been lighted because the mountain air was cool after the rains and she seemed to like to sit and watch it and think mr rogers himself was in a thoughtful mood after leaving his departing guests he had settled down with some deliberation he had closed the doors and brought forward his favorite woodenbacked splitseated chair then he had seated himself and drawing forth his twist of tobacco had cut off a goodly chaw he moved slowly and wore a serious and somewhat abstracted air afterward he tilted backward a little crossed his legs and proceeded to ruminate louisianny he said louisianny id like to hear the rights of it she answered him in a low voice it is not worth telling she said it was a very poor joke after all he gave her a quick side glance rubbing his crossed legs slowly was it he remarked a poor one after all why thets bad the quiet patience of his face was a study he went on rubbing his leg even more slowly than before thets bad he said again now what dye think was the trouble louisianny i made a mistake she answered that was all suddenly she turned to him and laid her folded arms on his knee and her face upon them sobbing i oughtnt to have gone she cried i ought to have stayed at home with you father his face flushed and he was obliged to relieve his feelings by expectorating into the fire louisianny he said id like to ask ye one question was thar anybody thar

aint none left but you honey lord he added in a queer burst of tenderness why shouldnt ye hev things if ye want em i dont want them she protested i want nothing but you for a moment there was a dead silence he kept his eyes fixed on the fire he seemed to be turning something over in his mind but at last he spoke dont ye louisianny he said no she answered nothing and she drew his hand under her cheek and kissed it he took it very quietly yeve got a kind heart louisianny he said young folks ginrally has i think its sorter natral but lord thars other things besides us old folks an its natral

there was a little silence again and at the end of it he said in a gentle forbearing voice just as he had said before dont ye louisianny they sat silent again for some time afterwardindeed but little more was said until they separated for the night then when she kissed him and clung for a moment round his neck he suddenly roused himself from his prolonged reverie lord he said quite cheerfully it caynt last long at the longest arter allan youre young yet youre young what cant last long she asked timidly he looked into her eyes and smiled nothin he answered nothin caynt nothin dontan youre young and he was so far moved by his secret thought that he smoothed her hair from her forehead the wrong way again with a light touch before he let her go chapter x the great world the next morning he went to the springs ill go an settle up and bring ye your trunk an things he said mebbe i maynt git back till tomorrer so dont ye be oneasy ef i feel tired when i git thar ill stay overnight she did not think it likely he would stay she had never known him to remain away from home during a night unless he had been compelled to do so by business he had always been too childishly fond of his home to be happy away from it he liked the routine he had been used to through forty years the rising at daylight the regular common duties he assumed as his share his own seat on the hearth or porch and at table folks may be clever enough he used to say they air clever as a rulebut it dont come natral to be away thar aint nothin like home an home ways but he did not return that night or even the next morning it was dusk the next evening before louisiana heard the buggy wheels on the road she had been sitting on the porch and rose to greet him when he drove up and descended from his conveyence rather stiffly ye wasnt oneasy was ye he asked no she answered only it seemed strange to know you were away i haint done it but three times since me an ianthy was married he said two o them times was conference to barnsville an one was when marcelly died when he mounted the porch steps he looked up at her with a smile on his weatherbeaten face was ye lonesome he asked i bet ye was a little she replied not very she gave him his chair against the wooden pillar and watched him as he tilted back and balanced himself on its back legs she saw something new and disturbed in his face and manner it was as if the bit of outside life he had seen had left temporary traces upon him she wondered very much how it had impressed him and what he was thinking about and after a short time he told her ye must be lonesome he said arter stayin down thar its natral a body dont know until they see it theirselves its gay thar lord yes its gay an what suits young folks is to be gay some of the people who were there did not think it was gay louisiana said a little listlessly they were used to gayer places and they often called it dull but it seemed very gay to me i shouldnt want it no gayer myself he returned seriously not if i was young folks thar must hev bin three hundred on em in thet thar dininroom the names o the vittles writ down on paper to pick an choose from an fifty or sixty waiters flyin round an the dressin i sot an watched em as they come in i sot an watched em all day thar was a heap o curosities in the way of dressin i never seen before i went into the dancinroom at night too an sot thar a spell an watched em they played a play some on em put little caps an aperns on an rosettes an fixins they sorter danced in it an they hed music while they was doin it it was purty too if a body could hev follered it out it is a dance they call the german said louisiana remembering with a pang the first night she had seen it as she sat at her new friends side german is it he said with evident satisfaction at making the discovery waal now i aint surprised it hed a kinder dutch look to mekinder dutch an furrin just then nancy announced that his supper was ready and he went in but on the threshold he stopped and spoke again them folks as was here he said theyd gone they started the next mornin arter they was here they live up north somewhars an theyve went thar after he had gone in louisiana sat still for a little while the moon was rising and she watched it until it climbed above the treetops and shone bright and clear then one desperate little sob broke from heronly one for she choked the next in its birth and got up and turned toward the house and the room in which the kerosene lamp burned on the supper table ill go an talk to him she said he likes to have me with him and it will be better than sitting here she went in and sat near him resting her elbows upon the table and her chin on her hands and tried to begin to talk but it was not very easy she found that she had a tendency to fall back in long silent pauses in which she simply looked at him with sad tender eyes i stopped at caseys as i came on he said at last thet thar was one thing as made me late tharsthars somethin i hed on my mind fur him to do fur me for casey to do she said he poured his coffee into his saucer and answered with a heavy effort at speaking unconcernedly im agoin to hev him fix the house he said she was going to ask him what he meant to have done but he did not give her time ianthy an me he said wed useder say wed do it sometime an im agoin to do it now the rooms now theyre lowwhar theyre not to say small theyre low anan oldtimey thar aint no style to em them rooms to the springs now theyve got style to em an rooms kin be altered easy enough he drank his coffee slowly set his saucer down and went on with the same serious air of having broached an ordinary subject goin to the springs has sorter started me off he said seein things diffrent does start a man off casey an his menll be here monday it seems sosudden louisiana said she gave a slow wondering glance at the old smokestained room i can hardly fancy it looking any other way than this it wont be the same place at all he glanced around too with a start his glance was hurried and nervous why no he said it wont butitll be stylisher itll be kinder onfamilar at first but i dessay we shall get used to itan itll be stylisher an stylewhar thars young folks thets whats wantedstyle she was so puzzled by his manner that she sat regarding him with wonder but he went on talking steadily about his plans until the meal was over he talked of them when they went back to the porch together and sat in the moonlight he scarcely gave her an opportunity to speak once or twice the idea vaguely occurred to her that for some reason he did not want her to talk it was a relief to her only to be called upon to listen but still she was puzzled when we git fixed up he said ye kin hev your friends yere thars them folks now as was yere the other day from the springswhen were fixed up ye mought invite emnext summer fur instants like as not i shall be away myself anyed hev room a plenty ye wouldnt need me ye see an lord how itd serprise em to come an find ye all fixed i should never ask them she cried impetuously andthey wouldnt come if i did mebbe they would he responded gravely if ye was fixed up i dont want them she said passionately let them keep their place i dont want them dont ye he said in his quiet voice dont ye louisianny and he seemed to sink into a reverie and did not speak again for quite a long time chapter xi a rusty nail on monday casey and his men came louisiana and her father were at breakfast when they struck their first blow at the end of the house which was to be renovated first the old man hearing it started violentlyso violently that he almost upset the coffee at his elbow he laughed a tremulous sort of laugh why im narvous he said now jest to think o me abein narvous i suppose said louisiana i am nervous as well it made me start too it had such a strange sound waal now he answered come to think on it it hedsorter seems like it wasnt scacely natral praps thats it neither of them ate much breakfast and when the meal was over they went out together to look at the workmen they were very busy tearing off weatherboarding and wrenching out nails louisiana watched them with regretful eyes in secret she was wishing that the low ceilings and painted walls might remain as they were she had known them so long i am afraid he is doing it to please me she thought he does not believe me when i say i dont want it altered he would never have had it done for himself her father had seated himself on a pile of plank he was rubbing his crossed leg as usual but his hand trembled slightly i druv them nails in myself he said ianthy wasnt but nineteen shed set yere an watch me it was two or three months arter we was married she was mighty proud on it when it was all done little tom he was born in thet thar room the rest on em was born in the front room n they all died thar ianthy she died thar id useder think i should he stopped and glanced suddenly at louisiana he pulled himself up and smiled ye aint in the notion o hevin the cupoly he said we kin hev it as soon as notn seems ter me thars a heap o style to em anything that pleases you will please me father she said he gave her a mild cheerful look ye dont take much intruss in it yet do ye he said but ye will when it gits along kinder lord yell be as impatient as ianthy an me war when it gits along she tried to think she would but without very much success she lingered about for a while and at last went to her own room at the other end of the house and shut herself in her trunk had been carried upstairs and set in its old place behind the door she opened it and began to drag out the dresses and other adornments she had taken with her to the springs there was the blue muslin she threw it on the floor and dropped beside it half sitting half kneeling she laughed quite savagely i thought it was very nice when i made it she said i wonder how she would like to wear it she pulled out one thing after another until the floor around her was strewn then she got up and left them and ran to the bed and threw herself into a chair beside it hiding her face in the pillow oh how dull it is and how lonely she said what shall i do what shall i do and while she sobbed she heard the blows upon the boards below before she went downstairs she replaced the things she had taken from the trunk she packed them away neatly and having done it turned the key upon them father she said at dinner there are some things upstairs i want to send to cousin jenny i have done with them and i think shed like to have them dresses an things louisianny he said yes she answered i shall not need them any more idont care for them dont he began but stopped short and lifting his glass swallowed the rest of the sentence in a large glass of milk ill tell leander to send fer it he said afterward jennyll be real sot up i reckon her pappy bein so onfortnit she dont git much he ate scarcely more dinner than breakfast and spent the afternoon in wandering here and there among the workmen sometimes he talked to them and sometimes sat on his pile of plank and watched them in silence once when no one was looking he stooped down and picked up a rusty nail which had fallen from its place in a piece of board after holding it in his hand for a little he furtively thrust it into his pocket and seemed to experience a sense of relief after he had done it ye dont do nothin toward helpin us uncle elbert said one of the young men every youngster within ten miles knew him as uncle elbert ye aint as smart as ye was when last ye built air ye no boys he answered i aint thats so i aint as smart an he added rather hurriedly itd sorter go agin me to holp ye at what yere doin now not as i dont think its time it was done butitd sorter go agin me when louisiana entered the houseroom at dusk she found him sitting by the fire his body drooping forward his head resting listlessly on his hand ive got a touch o dyspepsy louisianny he said an the knockin hes kinder giv me a headache ill go to bed airly chapter xii mebbe she had been so full of her own sharp pain and humiliation during the first few days that perhaps she had not been so quick to see as she would otherwise have been but the time soon came when she awakened to a bewildered sense of new and strange trouble she scarcely knew when it was that she first began to fancy that some change had taken place in her father it was a change she could not comprehend when she recognized its presence it was no alteration of his old slow quiet faithfulness to her he had never been so faithfully tender the first thing which awakened her thought of change was his redoubled tenderness she found that he watched her constantly in a patient anxious way when they were together she often discovered that he kept his eyes fixed upon her when he thought she was not aware of his gaze he seemed reluctant to leave her alone and continually managed to be near her and yet it grew upon her at last that the old homely goodfellowship between them had somehow been broken in upon and existed no longer it was not that he loved her any lessshe was sure of that but she had lost something without knowing when or how she had lost it or even exactly what it was but his anxiety to please her grew day by day he hurried the men who were at work upon the house louisianny shell enjoy it when its done he said to them hurry up boys an do yer plum best she had been at home about two weeks when he began to drive over to the nearest depot every day at train time it was about three miles distant and he went over for several days in his spring wagon at first he said nothing of his reason for making the journey but one morning as he stood at his horses heads he said to louisiana without turning to look at her and affecting to be very busy with some portion of the harness ive ben expectin of some things fer a day or so an they haint come i wasnt sure when i oughter to look fer emmebbe ive ben lookin too soonfer they haint come yet where were they to come from she asked fromfrom new york city from new york she echoed trying to show an interest i did not know you sent there father i haint never done it afore he answered these yere thingsmebbe theyll come today an then yell see em she asked no further questions fancying that he had been buying some adornments for the new rooms which were to be a surprise for her after he had gone away she thought a little sadly of his kindness to her and her unworthiness of it at noon he came back and brought his prize with him he drove up slowly with it behind him in the wagona large shining new trunkquite as big and ponderous as any she had seen at the springs he got down and came up to her as she stood on the porch he put his hand on her shoulder ill hev em took in an ye kin look at em he said its some new things ye was aneedin she began to guess dimly at what he meant but she followed the trunk into the house without speaking when they set it down she stood near while her father fumbled for the key and found it turned it in the lock and threw back the lid theyre some things ye was aneedin he said i hope yell like em honey she did not know what it was in his voice or his face or his simple manner that moved her so but she did not look at what he had brought at allshe ran to him and caught his arm dropped her face on it and burst into tears fatherfather she cried oh father look at em louisianny he persisted gently an see if they suit ye thar aint no reason to cry honey the words checked her and made her feel uncertain and bewildered again she stopped crying and looked up at him wondering if her emotion troubled him but he did not meet her eye and only seemed anxious that she should see what he had brought i didnt tell ye all i hed in my mind when i went to the springs he said i hed a notion id like to see fer myself how things was i knowed yed hev an idee thet ye couldnt ask me fer the kind o things ye wanted an i knowed i knowed nothin about what they was so i ses to myself ill go an stay a day an watch and find out an i went an i found out thar was a young woman thar as was dressed purtier than any of em an she was clever an friendly an i managed it so we got atalkin she hed on a dress that took my fancy it was mighty black an thickye know it was cold after the rainsan when we was talkin i asked her if she mind atellin me the name of it an whar shed bought it an she laughed some an said it was velvet an shed got it to some store in new york city an i asked her if shed write it down id a little gal at home i wanted a dress offn it feran then someways we warmed up an i ses to her she aint like me if ye could see her yed never guess we was kin she hadnt never seen ye she come the night ye left but when i told her more about ye she ses i think ive heern on her i heern she was very pretty an i told her what id hed in my mind an it seemed like it took her fancy an she told me to get a paper an pencil an shed tell me what to send fer an whar to send an i sent fer em an thar they air she could not tell him that they were things not fit for her to wear she looked at the rolls of silk and the laces and feminine extras with a bewildered feeling they are beautiful things she said i never thought of having such things for my own thars no reason why ye shouldnt hev em he said id oughter hev thought of em afore do they suit ye louisianny i should be very hard to please if they didnt she answered they are only too beautiful fora girl like me they caynt be that he said gravely i didnt see none no handsomer than you to the springs louisianny an i ses to the lady as writ it all down fer me i ses what i want is fer

shes all thats left an she desarves it all shes young an handsome and she desarves it all what did she say to that louisiana asked he hesitated a moment before answering she looked at me kinder queer fer a minnit he replied at length an then she ses shed oughter be a very happy gal ses she with such a father an i ses i low she ismebbe only maybe said the girl only maybe father she dropped the roll of silk she had been holding and went to him she put her hand on his arm again and shook it a little laughing in the same feverish fashion as when she had gone out to him on the porch on the day of her return she had suddenly flushed up and her eyes shone as he had seen them then only maybe she said why should i be unhappy theres no reason look at me with my fine house and my new things there isnt any one happier in the world there is nothing left for me to wish for i have got too much a new mood seemed to have taken possession of her all at once she scarcely gave him a chance to speak she drew him to the trunks side and made him stand near while she took the things out one by one she exclaimed and laughed over them as she drew them forth she held the dress materials up to her waist and neck to see how the colors became her she tried on laces and sacques and furbelows and the hats which were said to have come from paris what will they say when they see me at meeting in them she said brother horner will forget his sermons there never were such things in bowersville before i am almost afraid they will think i am putting on airs when she reached a box of long kid gloves at the bottom she burst into such a shrill laugh that her father was startled there was a tone of false exhilaration about her which was not what he had expected see she cried holding one of the longest pairs up eighteen buttons and cream color i can wear them with the creamcolored silk and cashmere atat a festival when she had looked at everything the rag carpet was strewn with her richeswith fashionable dress materials with rich and delicate colors with a hundred feminine and pretty whims how could i help but be happy she said i am like a queen i dont suppose queens have very much more though we dont know much about queens do we she hung round her fathers neck and kissed him in a fervent excited way you good old father she said you sweet old father he took one of her soft supple hands and held it between both his brown and horny ones louisianny he said i low to make ye happy ef the lord haint nothin agin it i low to do it he went out after that and left her alone to set her things to rights but when he had gone and closed the door she did not touch them she threw herself down flat upon the floor in the midst of them her slender arms flung out her eyes wide open and wild and dry chapter xiii a new plan at last the day came when the house was finished and stood big and freshly painted and bare in the sun late one afternoon in the indian summer casey and his men having bestowed their last touches collected their belongings and went away leaving it a lasting monument to their ability inside instead of the low ceilings and painted wooden walls there were high rooms and plaster and modern papering outside instead of the variegated piazza was a substantial portico the whole had been painted a warm gray and casey considered his job a neat one and was proud of it when they were all gone louisiana went out into the front yard to look at it she stood in the grass and leaned against an appletree it was near sunset and both trees and grass were touched with a yellow glow so deep and mellow that it was almost a golden haze now that the longcontinued hammering and sawing was at an end and all traces of its accompaniments removed the stillness seemed intense there was not a breath of wind stirring or the piping of a bird to be heard the girl clasped her slender arms about the trees trunk and rested her cheek against the rough bark she looked up piteously i must try to get used to it she said it is very much nicerand i must try to get used to it but the strangeness of it was very hard on her at first when she looked at it she had a startled feelingas if when she had expected to see an old friend she had found herself suddenly face to face with a stranger her father had gone to bowersville early in the day and she had been expecting his return for an hour or so she left her place by the tree at length and went to the fence to watch for his coming down the road but she waited in vain so long that she got tired again and wandered back to the house and around to the back to where a new barn and stable had been built painted and ornamented in accordance with the most novel designs there was no other such barn or stable in the country and their fame was already widespread and of an enviable nature as she approached these buildings louisiana glanced up and uttered an exclamation her father was sitting upon the doorsill of the barn and his horse was turned loose to graze upon the grass before him father the girl cried i have been waiting for you i thought you had not come ive been yere a right smart while louisianny he answered ye wasnt round when i come an so ye didnt see me i reckon he was pale and spoke at first heavily and as if with an effort but almost instantly he brightened ive jest ben asettin yere asteddyin he said a man wants to see it a few times an take it sorter gradual afore he kin do it jestice alookin at it from yere now with a wide sweep of his hand toward the improvements ye kin see how much style thar is to it seems to me thet thethe mountains now they look better itwaal it kinder sets em offit kinder sets em off it is very much prettier she answered lord yes thar aint no comparison i was jest asettin thinkin thet anyone thetd seed it as it was afore theyd not know it ianthy fer instantsianthy she wouldnt scacely know it was homethars so much style to it he suddenly stopped and rested against the doorlintel he was pale again though he kept up a stout air of good cheer lord he said after a little pause its a heap stylisher presently he bent down and picked up a twig which lay on the ground at his feet he began to strip the leaves from it with careful slowness and he kept his eyes fixed on it as he went on talking yell never guess who ive ben atalkin to today an what ive ben talkin to em

have no heart and no soul and nothing to be grateful with have i ever been bad and cruel and hard to you that you can think it she poured forth her love and grief and tender reproach on his breast with such innocent fervor that he could scarcely bear it his eyes were wet too and his furrowed sunburnt cheeks and his breath came short and fast while he held her close in his arms honey he said just as he had often spoken to her when she had been a little child louisianny honey no no never i never hed a thought agin ye not in my bottermost heart did ye think it lord no thar aint nothin yeve

love me just as i am and you would love me if i knew even less and was more simple let me stay with you let us stay together alwaysalwaysalways he let her cry her fill holding her pretty head tenderly and soothing her as best he could somehow he looked a little brighter himself and not quite so pale as he had done when she found him sitting alone trying to do the new house jestice when at length they went in to supper it was almost dusk and he had his arm still around her he did not let her go until they sat down at the table and then she brought her chair quite close to his and while he ate looked at him often with her soft wet eyes chapter xiv confessions they had a long quiet evening together afterward they sat before the fire and louisiana drew her low seat near him so that she could rest her head upon his knee its almost like old times she said let us pretend i never went away and that everything is as it used to be would ye like it to be thataway louisianny he asked she was going to say yes but she remembered the changes he had made to please her and she turned her face and kissed the hand her cheek rested against you mustnt fancy i dont think the new house is beautiful she said it isnt that i mean what i would like to bring back isis the feeling i used to have that is allnothing but the old feeling and people cant always have the same feelings can they things change

oughtnt to hev said it its a way old folks hevbut its a bad way things git to seem sorter near to eman ordinary the whole day had been to louisiana a slow approach to a climax sometimes when her father talked she could scarcely bear to look at his face as the firelight shone on it so when she had bidden him goodnight at last and walked to the door leaving him standing upon the hearth watching her as she moved away she turned round suddenly and faced him again with her hand upon the latch father she cried i want to tell youi want to tell you what he said what louisianny she put her hand to her side and leaned against the doora slender piteous figure dont look at me kindly she said i dont deserve it i deserve nothing i have been ashamed he stopped her putting up his shaking hand and turning pale dont say nothin as yell be sorry fer when ye feel better louisianny he said dont git carried away by yer feelins into sayin nothin es is hard on yerself dont ye do it louisianny thar aint no need fer it honey yer kinder wrought up now an ye caynt do yerself jestice but she would not be restrained i must tell you she said it has been on my heart too long i ought never to have gone away everybody was different from usand had new ways i think they laughed at me and it made me bad i began to ponder over things until at last i hated myself and everything and was ashamed that i had been content when i told you i wanted to play a joke on the people who came here it was not true i wanted them to go away without knowing that this was my home it was only a queer place to be laughed at to them and i was ashamed of it and bitter and angry when they went into the parlor they laughed at it and at the pictures and everything in it and i stood by with my cheeks burning when i saw a strange woman in the kitchen it flashed into my mind that i had no need to tell them that all these things that they laughed at had been round me all my life they were not sneering at themit was worse than thatthey were only interested and amused and curious and were not afraid to let me see thegentleman had been led by his sister to think i came from some city he thought i waswas pretty and educatedhis equal and i knew how amazed he would be and how he would say he could not believe that i had lived here and wonder at me and talk me over and i could not bear it i only wanted him to go away without knowing and never never see me again remembering the pain and fever and humiliation of the past and of that dreadful day above all she burst into sobbing you did not think i was that bad did you she said but i was i was louisianny he said huskily come yere thar aint no need fer ye to blame yerself thataway yer kinder wrought up dont be kind to me she said dont i want to tell you allevery word i was so bad and proud and angry that i meant to carry it out to the end and tried toonly i was not quite bad enough for one thing fatheri was not bad enough to be ashamed of you or to bear to sit by and see them cast a slight upon you they didnt mean it for a slightit was only their clever way of looking at thingsbut i loved you you were all i had left and i knew you were better than they were a thousand times did they think i would give your warm good heartyour kind faithful heartfor all they had learned or for all they could ever learn it killed me to see and hear them and it seemed as if i was on fire and i told them the truththat you were my father and that i loved you and was proud of youthat i might be ashamed of myself and all the rest but not of younever of youfor i wasnt worthy to kiss your feet for one moment her father watched her his lips parted and trembling it seemed as if he meant to try to speak but could not then his eyes fell with an humble bewildered questioning glance upon his feet encased in their large substantial brogansthe feet she had said she was not worthy to kiss what he saw in them to touch him so it would be hard to tellfor he broke down utterly put out his hand groping to feel for his chair fell into it with head bowed on his arm and burst into sobbing too she left her selfimposed exile in an instant ran to him and knelt down to lean against him oh she cried have i broken your heart have i broken your heart will god ever forgive me i dont ask you to forgive me father for i dont deserve it at first he could not speak but he put his arm round her and drew her head up to his breastand with all the love and tenderness he had lavished upon her all her life she had never known such love and tenderness as he expressed in this one movement louisianny he said brokenly when he had found his voice its you as should be aforgivin me i she exclaimed he held her in his trembling arm so close that she felt his heart quivering to think he almost whispered as i should not hev ben doin ye jestice to think as i didnt know ye well enough to do ye jestice to think yer own father thets knowed ye all yer life could hev give in to its bein likely as

chapter xv ianthy it was later than usual when louisiana awakened in the morning she awakened suddenly and found herself listening to the singing of a bird on the tree near her window its singing was so loud and shrill that it overpowered her and aroused her to a consciousness of fatigue and exhaustion it seemed to her at first that no one was stirring in the house below but after a few minutes she heard some one talking in her fathers roomtalking rapidly in monotonous tone i wonder who it is she said and lay back upon her pillow feeling tired out and bewildered between the birds shrill song and the strange voice and then she heard heavy feet on the stairs and listened to them nervously until they reached her door and the door was pushed open unceremoniously the negro woman nancy thrust her head into the room miss louisianny honey she said ye aint up yet no yed better git up honeyan come down stairs but the girl made no movement why she asked listlessly yer pappy honeyhes sorter curus he dont seem to be right well he didnt seem to be quite at hisself when i went to light his fire he louisiana sat upright in bed her great coil of black hair tumbling over one shoulder and making her look even paler than she was father she said he was quite well late last night it was after midnight when we went to bed and he was well then the woman began to fumble uneasily at the latch dont ye git skeered chile she said mebbe taint nothinbut seemed to me likelike he didnt know me louisiana was out of bed standing upon the floor and dressing hurriedly he was well last night she said piteously only a few hours ago he was well and talked to me and she stopped suddenly to listen to the voice downstairsa new and terrible thought flashing upon her who is with him she asked who is talking to him thar aint no one with him was the answer hes by hisself honey louisiana was buttoning her wrapper at the throat such a tremor fell upon her that she could not finish what she was doing she left the button unfastened and pushed past nancy and ran swiftly down the stairs the woman following her the door of her fathers room stood open and the fire nancy had lighted burned and crackled merrily mr rogers was lying high upon his pillow watching the blaze his face was flushed and he had one hand upon his chest he turned his eyes slowly upon louisiana as she entered and for a second or so regarded her wonderingly then a change came upon him his face lighted upit seemed as if he saw all at once who had come to him ianthy he said i didnt scacely know ye yeve bin gone so long whar hev ye bin but even then she could not realize the truth it was so short a time since he had bidden her goodnight and kissed her at the door father she cried it is louisiana father look at me but he was looking at her and yet he only smiled again its bin such a long time ianthy he said sometimes ive thought ye wouldnt never come back at all and when she fell upon her knees at the bedside with a desolate cry of terror and anguish he did not seem to hear it at all but lay fondling her bent head and smiling still and saying happily lord i am glad to see ye when the doctor camehe was a mountaineer like the rest of them a rough goodnatured fellow who had read a course with somebody and tended lectures in cincinnattyhe could tell her easily enough what the trouble was pneumony he said and pretty bad at that he haint hed no health fer a right smart while he haint never got over thet spell he hed last winter this yere change in the weathers whats done it he was acomplainin to me the other day about thet thar old pain in his chist things hes bin kinder cumylatin on him he does not know me said louisiana he is very illhe is very ill doctor hankins looked at his patient for a moment dubiously waal thets so he said at length hes purty bad offpurty bad by night the house was full of visitors and volunteer nurses the fact that uncle elbert rogers was down with pneumony an louisianny thar without a soul anigh her was enough to rouse sympathy and curiosity aunt mandy aunt caline and aunt nervy came up one after the other louisianny now she aint nothin but a young thing an dont know nothin they said an elbert bein sich nigh kin itd look powerful bad if we didnt go they came in wagons or ricketty buggies and brought their favorite medicines and liniments with them in slabsided enamelcloth valises they took the patient under their charge applied their nostrums and when they were not busy seemed to enjoy talking his symptoms over in low tones they were very good to louisiana relieving her of every responsibility in spite of herself and shaking their heads at each other pityingly when her back was turned she never give him no trouble they said shes got thet to hold to an they was powerful sot on her both him an ianthy ive heern em say she allus was kinder tender an easy to manage their husbands came to sit up with them at night and sat by the fire talking about their crops and the elections and expectorating with regularity into the ashes they tried to persuade louisiana to go to bed but she would not go let me sit by him if there is nothing else i can do she said if he should come to himself for a minute he would know me if i was near him in his delirium he seemed to have gone back to a time before her existencethe time when he was a young man and there was no one in the new house he had built but himself and ianthy sometimes he fancied himself sitting by the fire on a winters night and congratulating himself upon being there jest to think he would say in a quiet speculative voice that two year ago i didnt know yean thar ye air asittin sewin and the fire acracklin an the house all fixed this yeres what i call solid comfort ianthyjest solid comfort once he wakened suddenly from a sleep and finding louisiana bending over him drew her face down and kissed her i didnt know ye was so nigh ianthy he whispered lord jest to think yer allers nigh an thar caynt nothin separate us the desolateness of so living a life outside his was so terrible to the poor child who loved him that at times she could not bear to remain in the room but would go out into the yard and ramble about aimless and heartbroken looking back now and then at the new strange house with a wild pang there will be nothing left if he leaves me she said there will be nothing and then she would hurry back panting and sit by him again her eyes fastened upon his unconscious face watching its every shade of expression and change shell take it mighty hard she heard aunt caline whisper one day ef and she put her hands to her ears and buried her face in the pillow that she might not hear the rest chapter xvi dont do no one a onjestice he was not ill very long toward the end of the second week the house was always full of visitors who came to sympathize and inquire and prescribe and who in many cases came from their farms miles away attracted by the news that uncle elbert rogers was mighty bad off they came on horseback and in wagons or buggiesmen in homespun and women in sunbonnetsand they hitched their horses at the fence and came into the house with an awkwardly subdued air and stood in silence by the sick bed for a few minutes and then rambled towards the hearth and talked in spectral whispers the old mans purty low they always said hes purty low and then they added among themselves that he had allers bin mighty clever an a good neighbor when she heard them speak of him in this manner louisiana knew what it meant she never left the room again after the first day that they spoke so and came in bodies to look at him and turn away and say that he had been good to them the men never spoke to her after their first nod of greeting and the women but rarely but they often glanced hurriedly askance at her as she sat or stood by the sick mans pillow somehow none of them had felt as if they were on very familiar terms with her though they all spoke in a friendly way of her as being a mighty purty still kind o a harmless young critter they thought when they saw her pallor and the anguish in her eyes that she was takin it powerful hard an no wonder but they knew nothing of her desperate loneliness and terror uncle elbert hell leave a plenty they said in undertones shell be well pervided fer will louisianny and they watched over their charge and nursed him faithfully feeling not a little sad themselves as they remembered his simple good nature and neighborliness and the kindly prayers for which he had been noted in meetin on the last day of the second week the doctor held a consultation with aunt nervy and aunt caline on the front porch before he went away and when they reentered the room they spoke in whispers even lower than before and moved about stealthily the doctor himself rode away slowly and stopped at a house or so on the wayside where he had no patients to tell the inhabitants what he had told the head nurses we couldnt hev expected him to stay allers he said but well miss him mightily he haint a enemy in the countynary one that afternoon when the sun was setting the sick man wakened from a long deep sleep the first thing he saw was the bright paleyellow of a tree out in the yard which had changed color since he had seen it last it was a golden tree now as it stood in the sun its leaves rustling in a faint chill wind the next thing he knew that there were people in the room who sat silent and all looked at him with kindly even reverent eyes then he turned a little and saw his child who bent towards him with dilated eyes and trembling parted lips a strange vague memory of weary pain and dragging uncertain days and nights came to him and he knew and yet felt no fear louisianny he said he could only speak in a whisper and tremulously those who sat about him hushed their very breath lay yer headon the pillernigh me he said she laid it down and put her hand in his the great tears were streaming down her face but she said not a word i haint got longhoney he faltered the lordhell keerfer ye then for a few minutes he lay breathing faintly but with his eyes open and smiling as they rested on the golden foliage of the tree how yallerit is he whispered like gold ianthy was powerfulsot on it itkinder beckons it seemed as if he could not move his eyes from it and the pause that followed was so long that louisiana could bear it no longer and she lifted her head and kissed him father she cried say something to me say something to me it drew him back and he looked up into her eyes as she bent over him yell be happy he said afore long i kinderknow lord how iveloved ye honeyan yeve desarved itall dont yedo no onea onjestice and then as she dropped her white face upon the pillow again he saw her no longernor the people nor the room but lay quite still with parted lips and eyes wide open smiling still at the golden tree waving and beckoning in the wind this he saw last of all and seemed still to see even when some one came silently though with tears and laid a hand upon his eyes chapter xvii a leaf there was a sunny old graveyard half a mile from the town where the people of bowersville laid their dead under the long grass and tangle of wildcreeping vines and the whole countryside gathered there when they lowered the old man into his place at his wifes side his neighbors sang his funeral hymn and performed the last offices for him with kindly hands and when they turned away and left him there was not a man or woman of them who did not feel that they had lost a friend they were very good to louisiana aunt nervy and aunt caline deserted their families that they might stay with her until all was over doing their best to give her comfort it was aunt nervy who first thought of sending for the girl cousin to whom the trunkful of clothes had been given les send for leanders jenny caline she said mebbe itd help her some to hev a gal nigh her gals kinder onderstands each other an jenny was allus powerful fond o lowizyanny so jenny was sent for and came from her lowly position as one of the fifteen in an onfortnit family she had adored and looked up to louisiana all her life all the brightest days in her experience had been spent at uncle elberts with her favorite cousin but there was no brightness about the house now when she arrived and was sent upstairs to the pretty new room louisiana occupied she found the girl lying upon the bed she looked white and slender in her black dress her hands were folded palm to palm under her check and her eyes were wide open jenny ran to her and knelt at her side she kissed her and began to cry oh she sobbed somehow i didnt ever think i should come here and not find uncle elbert it dont seem rightit makes it like a strange place then louisiana broke into sobs too it is a strange place she crieda strange placea strange place oh if one old room was leftjust one that i could go into and not feel so lonely but she had no sooner said it than she checked herself oh i oughtnt to say that she cried i wont say it he did it all for me and i didnt deserve it yes you did said jenny fondling her he was always saying what a good child you had beenand that you had never given him any trouble that was because he was so good said louisiana no one else in the whole world was so good and now he is gone and i can never make him know how grateful i was and how i loved him he did know said jenny no returned louisiana it would have taken a long long life to make him know all i felt and now when i look back it seems as if we had been together such a little while oh i thought the last night we talked that there was a long life before usthat i should be old before he left me and we should have had all those years together after the return from the graveyard there was a prolonged discussion held among the heads of the different branches of the family they gathered at one end of the back porch and talked of louisiana who sat before the log fire in her room upstairs she aint in the notion o leavin the place said aunt nervy she cried powerful when i mentioned it to her an wouldnt hear to it she says over an over agin

lureny nance came and was formally installed in her position she was a tall stronglybuilt woman with blue eyes black hair and thick black eyebrows she wore when she arrived her best alpaca gown and a starched and frilled blue sunbonnet when she presented herself to louisiana she sat down before her removed this sunbonnet with a scientific flap and hung it on the back of her chair ye look mighty

themselves aunt nervy and aunt caline and the rest had returned to their respective homes even jenny had gone back to bowersville where she boarded with a relation and went to school the days after this seemed so long to louisiana that she often wondered how she lived through them in the first passion of her sorrow she had not known how they passed but now that all was silence and order in the house and she was alone she had nothing to do but to count the hours there was no work for her no one came in and out for whom she might invent some little labor of love there was no one to watch for no one to think of she used to sit for hours at her window watching the leaves change their color day by day and at last flutter down upon the grass at the least stir of wind once she went out and picked up one of these leaves and taking it back to her room shut it up in a book everything has happened to me since the day it was first a leaf she said i have lived just as long as a leaf that isnt long when the trees were bare she one day remembered the books she had sent for when at the springs and she went to the place where she had put them brought them out and tried to feel interested in them again i might learn a great deal she said if i persevered i have so much time but she had not read many pages before the tears began to roll down her cheeks if he had lived she said i might have read them to him and it would have pleased him so i might have done it often if i had thought less about myself he would have learned too he thought he was slow but he would have learned too in a little while and he would have been so proud she was very like her father in the simple tenderness of her nature she grieved with the hopeless passion of a child for the unconscious wrong she had done it was as she sat trying to fix her mind upon these books that there came to her the first thought of a plan which was afterwards of some vague comfort to her she had all the things which had furnished the old parlor taken into one of the unused roomsthe chairs and tables the carpet the ornaments and pictures she spent a day in placing everything as she remembered it doing all without letting any one assist her after it was arranged she left the room and locked the door taking the key with her no one shall go in but myself she said it belongs to me more than all the rest i never knowed her to do nothin notionate but thet remarked mrs nance in speaking of it afterwards shes mighty still an sits an grieves a heap but she aint never notionate thet was kinder notionate fer a gal

but she did not get over it as soon as mrs nance had expected in view of her youth the days seemed longer and lonelier to her as the winter advanced though they were really so much shorter and she had at last been able to read and think of what she read when the snow was on the ground and she could not wander about the place she grew paler still louisianny said mrs nance coming in upon her one day

dark when the buggy returned as jake drove up to the gate he bent forward to look at something thars a critter hitched to the fence he remarked taint no critter from round yere i never seen it afore mrs nance came out upon the porch to meet them she was gently excited by an announcement she had to make louisianny she said thars a man in the settinroom hes awaitin to see ye i asked him ef he hed

hed the fire made up sence he come louisiana removed her hat and cloak and gave them to mrs nance she did it rather slowly and having done it crossed the hall to the sittingroom door opened it and went in there was no light in the room but the light of the wood fire but that was very bright it was so bright that she had not taken two steps into the room before she saw clearly the face of the man who waited for her it was laurence ferrol she stopped short and her hands fell at her sides her heart beat so fast that she could not speak his heart beat fast too and it beat faster still when he noted her black dress and saw how pale and slight she looked in it he advanced towards her and taking her hand in both his led her to a chair i have startled you too much he said dont make me feel that i was wrong to come dont be angry with me she let him seat her in the chair and then he stood before her and waited for her to speak it was rathersudden she said but i am notangry there was a silence of a few seconds because he was so moved by the new look her face wore that he could not easily command his voice and words have you been ill he asked gently at last he saw that she made an effort to control herself and answer him quietly but before she spoke she gave up even the effort she did not try to conceal or wipe away the great tears that fell down her cheeks as she looked up at him no i have not been ill she said my father is dead and as she uttered the last words her voice sank almost into a whisper just for a breaths space they looked at each other and then she turned in her chair laid her arm on the top of it and her face on her arm with a simple helpless movement he has been dead three months she whispered weeping his own eyes were dim as he watched her he had not heard of this before he walked to the other end of the room and back again twice when he neared her the last time he stopped must i go away he asked unsteadily i feel as if i had no right here but she did not tell him whether he must go or stay if i stay i must tell you why i came and why i could not remain away he said she still drooped against her chair and did not speak and he drew still nearer to her it does not seem the right time he said but i must tell you even if i go away at once afterwards i have never been happy an hour since we parted that wretched day i have never ceased to think of what i had begun to hope for i felt that it was useless to ask for it theni feel as if it was useless now but i must ask for it oh desperately how miserably i am saying it all how weak it sounds in an instant he was kneeling on one knee at her side and had caught her hand and held it between both his own ill say the simplest thing he said i love you everything is against me but i love you and i am sure i shall never love another woman he clasped her hand close and she did not draw it away wont you say a word to me he asked if you only tell me that this is the wrong time and that i must go away now it will be better than some things you might say she raised her face and let him see it no she said it is not that it is the wrong time it is a better time than any other because i am so lonely and my trouble has made my heart softer than it was when i blamed you so it is not that it is the wrong time but wait a minute he broke in dontdont do me an injustice he could not have said anything else so likely to reach her heart she remembered the last faltering words she had heard as she bent over the pillow when the sun was shining on the golden tree with the wind waving its branches dont do no one a onjestice honeydont yedo no onea onjestice oh she cried out he told me that i must nothe told me before he died what said ferrol he told you not to be unjust to me it was you he meant she answered he knew i had been hard to youand he knew i she cowered down a little and ferrol folded her in his arms dont be hard to me again he whispered i have been so unhappyi love you so tenderly did he know that youspeak to me louise she put her hand upon his shoulder he knew that i loved you she said with a little sob she was a great favorite among her husbands friends in new york the next year one of her chief attractions for them was that she was a new type they said that of her invariably when they delighted in her and told each other how gentle she was and how simple and sweet the artists made studies of her and adored her and were enthusiastic over her beauty while among the literary ones it was said again and again what a foundation she would be for a heroine of the order of those who love and suffer for loves sake and grow more adorable through their pain but these of course were only the delightful imaginings of art talked over among themselves and louisiana did not hear of them she was very happy and very busy there was a gay joke current among them that she was a most tremendous bookworm and that her literary knowledge was something for weak ordinary mortals to quail before the story went that by some magic process she committed to memory the most appalling works half an hour after they were issued from the press and that secretly laurence stood very much in awe of her and was constantly afraid of exposing his ignorance in her presence it was certainly true that she read a great deal and showed a wonderful aptness and memory and that laurences pride and delight in her were the strongest and tenderest feelings of his heart almost every summer they spent in north carolina filling their house with those of their friends who would most enjoy the simple quiet of the life they led there were numberless pictures painted among them at such times and numberless new types discovered but youd scarcely think it was said sometimes that it is here that mrs laurence is on her native heath and though all the rest of the house was open there was one room into which no one but laurence and louisiana ever wenta little room with strange ugly furniture in it and brightcolored lithographs upon the walls end transcribers note the source book for this text contained many punctuation and spelling variants eg wontwont dontdont waalwaalwal
