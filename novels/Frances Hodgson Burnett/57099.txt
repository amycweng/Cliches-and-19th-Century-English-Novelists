despard oh yes said lisbeth and of course a little music and then a little supper and a little dancing and all that sort of thing and she frowned impatiently mrs despard looked at her in some displeasure you are in one of your humors again lisbeth she said sharply why shouldnt i be answered miss crespigny not a whit awed by her patroness peoples humors are their privileges i would not help mine if i could i like them because they are my own private property and no one else can claim them i should hardly think any one would want to claim yours said mrs despard dryly but at the same time regarding the girl with a sort of curiosity lisbeth crespigny shrugged her shoulders those expressive shoulders of hers a peculiar girl even the mildest of people called her and as to her enemies what did they not say of her and her enemies were not in the minority but peculiar was not an unnatural term to apply to her she was peculiar seeing her kneeling close before the fender this winter evening ones first thought would have been that she stood apart from other girls her very type was her own and no one had ever been heard to say of any other woman she is like lisbeth crespigny she was rather small of figure she had magnificent hair her black brows and lashes were a wonder of beauty her eyes were dark mysterious supercilious she often frightened people she frightened modest people with her nerve and coolness bold people with her savage sarcasms quiet people with her moods she had alarmed mrs despard occasionally when she had first come to live with her but after three years mrs despard who was strong of nerve herself had become used to her caprices though she had not got over being curious and interested in spite of herself she was a widow this mrs despard she had been an ambitious nobody in her youth and having had the luck to marry a reasonably rich man her ambition had increased with her good fortune she was keen like lisbeth quick witted and restless she had no children no cares and thus having no particular object in life formed one for herself in making herself pleasingly conspicuous in society it was her whim to be conspicuous not in a vulgar way however she was far too clever for that she wished to have a little social court of her own and to reign supreme in it it was not rich people she wanted at her entertainments nor powerful people it was talented people people shall it be said who would admire her sthetic soires and talk about her a little afterward and feel the distinction of being invited to her house and it was because lisbeth crespigny was peculiar that she had picked her up during a summer visit to a quaint picturesque village on the welsh coast she had made the acquaintance of the owners of a cottage whose picturesqueness had taken her fancy three elderly maiden ladies were the misses tregarthyn and lisbeth was their niece and the apple of each gentle spinsters eye poor dear philips daughter and poor dear philip who had been their half brother and the idol of their house had gone abroad and seen the world and after marrying a french girl who died young had died himself and left lisbeth to them as a legacy and then they had transferred their adoration and allegiance to lisbeth and lisbeth as her manner was had accepted it as her right and taken it rather coolly mrs despard had found her at seventeen years old a restless lawless ambitious young woman a young woman when any other girl would have been almost a child she found her shrewd well read daring and indifferent to audacity tired of the picturesque little village secretly a trifle tired of being idolized by the three spinsters inwardly longing for the chance to try her mettle in the great world then too she had another reason for wanting to escape from the tame old life in the dearth of excitement she had been guilty of the weakness of drifting into what she now called an absurd flirtation which had actually ended in an equally absurd engagement and of which she now not absurdly as she thought was tired i scarcely know how it happened she said with cool scorn to mrs despard when they knew each other well enough to be confidential it was my fault i suppose if i had let him alone he would have let me alone i think i am possessed of a sort of devil sometimes when i have nothing to do and he is such a boy with a shrug though he is actually twenty three and then my aunts knew his mother when she was a girl and so when he came to penyllan he must come here and stay with them and they must encourage him to admire me and i should like to know what woman is going to stand that woman indeed thought mrs despard and then of course he has some sense of his own or at least he has what will be sense some day and he began to be rather entertaining after a while and we boated and walked and talked and read and at last i was actually such a little fool as to let it end in a sort of promise for which i was sorry the minute it was half made if he had kept it to himself it would not have been so bad but of course being such a boyish animal he must confide in aunt millicent and aunt millicent must tell the others and then they must all gush and cry and kiss me as if everything was settled and i was to be married in ten minutes and bid them all an everlasting farewell in fifteen so i began to snub him that instant and have snubbed him ever since in hopes he would get as tired of me as i am of him but he wont he does nothing but talk rubbish and say he will bear it for my sake and the fact is i am beginning to hate him and it serves me right she had always interested mrs despard but she interested her more than ever after this explanation she positively fascinated her and the end of it all was that when the lady left penyllan she carried lisbeth with her the misses tregarthyn wept and appealed and only gave in under protest at last because lisbeth was stronger than the whole trio she wanted to see the world she said mrs despard was fond of her she had money enough to make her so far independent that she could return when the whim seized her and she was tired of penyllan so why should she not go she might only stay a month or a week but however that was she had made up her mind to see life while the four fought their battle out mrs despard looked on and smiled she knew lisbeth would win and of course lisbeth did she packed her trunk and went her way but the night before her departure she had an interview with poor hector anstruthers who came to the garden to speak to her his boyish face pale and haggard his sea blue eyes wild and hollow with despair and like the selfish heartless cool little wretch that she was she put an end to his pleadings peremptorily no she said i would rather you would not write to me i want to be let alone and it is because i want to be let alone that i am going away from penyllan i never promised one of the things you are always insisting that i promised you may call me as many hard names as you like but you cant deny that no burst forth the poor lad in a frenzy you did not promise but you let me understand understand echoed his young tyrant i tried hard enough to make you understand that i wanted to be let alone if you had been in your right senses you might have seen what i meant you have driven me almost out of my mind and you must take the consequences and then she turned away and left him stunned and helpless standing watching her as she trailed over the grass between the lines of rose bushes the moonlight falling on her white dress and the little light blue scarf she had thrown over her long loose dusky hair three years ago all this had happened and she was with mrs despard still though of course she had visited penyllan occasionally she had not tired her patroness if patroness she could be called she was not the sort of girl to tire people of their fancy for her she was too clever too cool too well poised she interested mrs despard as much to day as she had done in the first week of their acquaintance she was just as much of a study for her even in her most vexatious moods have you a headache asked mrs despard after a while no answered lisbeth have you had bad news from penyllan lisbeth looked up and answered mrs despard with a sharp curiousness how did you know i had heard from penyllan she demanded oh said mrs despard i guessed so from the fact that you seemed to have no other reason for being out of humor and lately that has always been a sufficient one i cannot see why it should be said lisbeth tartly what can penyllan have to do with my humor but you have had a letter said mrs despard yes from aunt clarissa there is no bad news in it however indeed no news at all how did i ever exist there her small face lowering you would not like to go back suggested mrs despard lisbeth shrugged her shoulders would you like me to go back she questioned i in some impatience you know as well as i do that i cannot do without you you would never miss me lisbeth as i should miss you it is not your way to attach yourself to people how do you know interposed lisbeth what can you know about me what can any one man or woman know of another that is nonsense it is the truth nevertheless was the reply whom were you ever fond of were you fond of the misses tregarthyn who adored you were you fond of that poor boy who was so madly in love with you have you been fond of any of the men who made simpletons of themselves because you had fine eyes and a soft voice and knew better than any other woman in the world how to manage them no you know you have not lisbeth shrugged her shoulders again well then it is my way i suppose she commented and my ways are like my humors as you call them so we may as well let them rest there was a pause after this then lisbeth rose and going to the table began to gather together the parcels she had left there when she returned from her shopping expedition you have not seen the dress she said no it is a work of art the pansies are as real as any that ever bloomed they might have been just gathered how well that woman understands her business chapter ii another gentleman of the same name she went up stairs after this to her own room a comfortable luxurious little place near mrs despards own apartment a clear bright fire burned in the grate and her special sleepy hollow chair was drawn before it and when she had laid aside her hat and disposed of her purchases she came to this chair and seated herself in it then she drew the penyllan letter from her pocket and laid it on her lap and left it there while she folded her hands and leaned back looking at the fire dreamily and thinking to herself the truth is that letter that gentle sweet tempered old fashioned letter of miss clarissas stung the girl worldly and selfish as she was three years ago she would not have cared much but seeing the world ah the world had taught her a lesson she had seen a great deal of this world under mrs despards guidance she had ripened marvelously she had grown half a score of years older she had learned to be bitter and clear sighted and now a curious mental process was going on with her we shall never cease to feel your absence my dear wrote miss tregarthyn indeed we sometimes say to each other that we feel it more every day but at the same time we cannot help seeing that our life is not the life one so young and attractive ought to live it was not a congenial life for our poor dear old philip and how could it seem congenial to his daughter and if by a little sacrifice we can make our dear lisbeth happy ought we not to be more than willing to submit to it we are so proud of you my dear and it delights us so to hear that you are enjoying yourself and being so much admired that when we receive your letters we forget everything else do you think you can spare us a week in the summer if you can you know how it will rejoice us to see you even for that short time etc etc through half a dozen pages and this letter now lay on lisbeths lap as we have said while she pondered over the contents moodily i do not see she said at last i do not see what there is in me for people to be so fond of a loosened coil of her hair hung over her shoulder and bosom and she took this soft and thick black tress and began to twist it round and round her slender mite of a wrist with a sort of vindictive force where is the fascination in me she demanded of the fire one might have thought it is not for my amiability it is not for my odd fine eyes and odd soft voice as mrs despard puts it that those three women love me and lay themselves under my feet if they were men with scorn one could understand it but women is it because they are so much better than i am that they cannot help loving something even me yes it is defiantly yes it is she was angry and all her anger was against herself or at least against the fate which had made her what she was lisbeth knew herself better than other people knew her it was a fate she told herself she had been born cold blooded and immovable and it was not to be helped but she never defended herself thus when others accused her she would have scorned to do it it was only against her own secret restless inner accusations that she deigned to defend herself it was characteristic of her that she should brave the opinions of others and feel rebellious under her own what lisbeth crespigny thought in secret of lisbeth crespigny must have its weight at last she remembered the dress lying upon the bed the dress lecomte had just sent home she was passionately fond of dress especially fond of a certain striking yet artistic style of setting for her own unusually effective face and figure she turned now to this new dress as a refuge from herself i may as well put it on now she said it is seven oclock and it is as well to give ones self plenty of time so she got up and began her toilet leisurely she found it by no means unpleasant to watch herself grow out of chrysalis form she even found a keen pleasure in standing in the brilliant light before the mirror working patiently at the soft cloud like masses of her hair until she had wound and twisted it into some novel graceful fancifulness and yet even this scarcely arose from a vanity such as the vanity of other women she went down to the drawing room when she was dressed she knew she was looking her best without being told the pale gray tissue pale as a gray sea mist the golden hearted purple pansies with which it was lightly sown and which were in her hair and on her bosom and in her hands suited her entirely her eyes too soft dense mysterious under their sweeping straight black lashes well lisbeth crespignys eyes and no other creatures a first glance would tell me who had designed that dress said mrs despard it is not lecomte it is your very self in every touch and tint lisbeth smiled and looking down the length of the room where she stood reflected in a mirror at the end of it unfurled her fan a gilded fan thickly strewn with her purple pansies but she made no reply a glass door in the drawing room opened into a conservatory all aglow with light and bloom and in this conservatory she was standing half an hour later when the first arrivals came the door a double one was wide open and she in the midst of the banks and tiers of flowers was bending over a vase of heliotrope singing a low snatch of song the fairest rose blooms but a day the fairest spring must end with may and you and i can only say good by good by good by she just sang this much and stopped one of the two people who had arrived was speaking to mrs despard she lifted her head and listened she could not see the speakers face because a tall tropical leaved lily interposed itself but the voice startled her uncomfortably who is that man she said to herself who is that man and then without waiting another moment she left the heliotrope and made her way to the glass door mrs despard looked first and saw her standing there ah lisbeth she said and then turned with a little smile toward the gentleman who stood nearest to her here is an old friend she added as lisbeth advanced you are indebted to mr lyon for the pleasure of seeing mr anstruthers again lisbeth came forward feeling as if she was on the verge of losing her amiable temper what was hector anstruthers doing here what did he want had he been insane enough to come with any absurd fancy that that he could that but her irritated hesitance carried her no farther than this the young man met her halfway with the greatest self possession imaginable this is an unexpected pleasure he said holding out his hand frankly i was not aware when lyon brought me to his friends that i should find you here all this as complacently be it observed as if he had been addressing any other woman in the world as if that little affair of a few years ago had been too mere a bagatelle to be remembered as if his boyish passion and misery and despair had faded utterly out of his mind mrs despard smiled again and watched her young friend closely but if lisbeth was startled and annoyed by the too apparent change she was too clever to betray herself she was a sharp secretive young person and had her emotions well under control she held out her hand with a smile of her own a slow well bred not too expressive affair not an effusive affair by any means delighted i am sure she said i have just been reading a letter from aunt clarissa and naturally it has prepared me to be doubly glad to see one of her special favorites after that the conversation became general anstruthers somehow managing to take the lead lisbeth opened her eyes was this the boy she had left in the moonlight at penyllan the young simpleton who had been at her feet on the sands spouting poetry and adoring her and making himself her grateful slave the impetuous tiresome lad who had blushed and raved and sighed and in the end had succeeded in wearying her so completely three years had made a difference here was a sublime young potentate wondrously altered and absolutely wondrously well looking the mustache she had secretly sneered at in its budding youth was long silken brown the slight long figure had developed into the fairest of proportions the guileless freshness of color had died away and left an interesting if rather significant pallor having been a boy so long he seemed to have become a man all at once and as he stood talking to mrs despard and occasionally turning to lisbeth his serenity of manner did him credit was it possible that he knew what to say it appeared so he did not blush his hands and feet evidently did not incommode him he was talking vivaciously and with the air of a man of the world he was making mrs despard laugh and there was every now and then a touch of daring yet well bred sarcasm in what he was saying bah he was as much older as she herself was and yet incongruous as the statement may appear she hardly liked him any the better how long she asked abruptly of bertie lyon has mr anstruthers been in london lyon that radiant young dandy was almost guilty of staring at her amazedly beg pardon he said did you say how long yes the young man managed to recover himself perhaps after all she was as ignorant about anstruthers as she seemed to be and it was not one of her confounded significant speeches they were nice enough people of course and mrs despard was the sort of woman whose parties a fellow always liked to be invited to but then they were not exactly in the set to which anstruthers belonged and of which he himself was a shining member well you see he said he has spent the greater part of his life in london but it was not until about three years ago that he began to care much about society he came into his money then when young scarsbrook shot himself accidentally in scotland and he has lived pretty rapidly since with an innocent faith in miss crespignys ability to comprehend even a modest bit of slang he is a tremendously talented fellow anstruthers paints and writes and takes a turn at everything he is the art critic on the cynic and people talk about what he does all the more because he has no need to do anything and it makes him awfully popular lisbeth laughed a rather savage little laugh what is it that amuses you asked lyon not anstruthers i hope oh no answered the young lady not this anstruthers but another gentleman of the same name whom i knew a long time ago a long time ago said the young man gallantly if not with wondrous sapience if it is a long time ago i should think you must have been so young that your acquaintance would be hardly likely to make any impression upon you ludicrous or otherwise for he was one of the victims too and consequently liked to make even a stupidly polite speech chapter iii pansies for thought lisbeth gave him a sweeping little curtsy and looked at him sweetly with her immense dense eyes that was very nice indeed in you she said with a gravely obliged air pray take one of my pansies and selecting one from her bouquet she held it out to him and hector anstruthers chancing to glance toward them at the moment had the pleasure of seeing the charming bit of by play it was the misfortune of miss crespignys admirers that they were rarely quite sure of her she had an agreeable way of saying one thing and meaning another of speaking with the greatest gravity and at the same time making her hearer feel extremely dubious and uncomfortable she was a brilliant young lady a sarcastic young lady and this was her mode of dealing with young men and women who otherwise might have remained too well satisfied with themselves bertie lyon felt himself somewhat at a loss before her always it was not easy to resist her when she chose to be irresistible but he invariably grew hot and cold over her confounded significant speeches and this was one of them she was making a cut at him for his clumsy compliment and yet he was compelled to accept her pansy and fasten it on his coat as if he was grateful mr hector anstruthers had been installed by universal consent that evening as a sort of young lion whose gentlemanly roar was worth hearing young ladies had heard of him from their brothers and one or two had seen those lovely little pictures of his last season matrons had heard their husbands mention him as a remarkable young fellow who had unexpectedly come into a large property and yet wrote articles for the papers and painted when the mood seized him for dear life a really extraordinary young man and very popular among highly desirable people rather reckless they would say perhaps and something of a cynic as these young swells are often apt to be but nevertheless a fine fellow a fine fellow and anstruthers had condescended to make himself very agreeable to the young ladies to whom he was introduced had danced a little had talked with great politeness to the elder matrons and in short had rendered himself extremely popular indeed he was so well employed that until the latter part of the evening lisbeth saw very little of him then he appeared suddenly to remember her existence and dutifully made his way to her side to ask for a dance which invitation being rather indifferently accepted they walked through a quadrille together i hope he said with punctilious politeness that the misses tregarthyn are well i am sorry to say answered lisbeth staring at her vis vis that i dont know then i must have mistaken you i understood you to say that you had just received a letter from miss clarissa it was not a mistake returned lisbeth i had just received one but unfortunately they dont write about themselves they write about me which must necessarily render their letters interesting said anstruthers lisbeth barely deigned a slight shrug of her shoulders necessarily she replied if one is so happily disposed as never to become tired of ones self it would be rank heresy to suppose said anstruthers that any of miss crespignys friends would allow it possible that any one could become tired of miss crespigny even miss crespigny herself this is the third figure i believe was lisbeths sole reply and the music striking up again they went on with their dancing he supposes said the young lady scornfully to herself that he can play the grand seigneur with me as he does with other women i dare say he is congratulating himself on the prospect of making me feel sorry some day me are men always simpletons it really seems so and it is the women whom we may blame for it bah he was a great deal more worthy of respect when he was nothing but a tiresome amiable young bore i hate these simpletons who think they have seen the world and used up their experience she was very hard upon him as she was rather apt to be hard upon every one but lisbeth crespigny and it is not improbable that she was all the more severe because he reminded her unpleasantly of things she would have been by no means unwilling to forget was she so heartless as not to have a secret remembrance of the flush of his first young passion of his innocent belief in her girlish goodness of his generous eagerness to ignore all her selfish caprices of his tender readiness to bear all her cruelty for she had been cruel and wantonly cruel enough god knows was she so utterly heartless as to have no memory of his suffering and struggles with his boyish pain of his passionate frantic appeal when she had reached the climax of her selfishness and indifference to the wrong she might do surely no woman could be so hard and i will not say that she was and that she was not inwardly stung this night by the thought that if he had hardened and grown careless and unbelieving the chances were that it was she herself who had helped to bring about the change for the worse the two young men lyon and his friend spending that night together had a little conversation on the subject of their entertainment and it came to pass in this wise accompanying anstruthers to his chambers lyon though by no means a sentimental individual carried miss crespignys gold and purple pansy in his button hole and finding it there when he changed his dress coat for one of his friends dressing gowns he took it out and put it in a small slender vase upon the table anstruthers had flung himself into an easy chair with his chibouque and through the wreaths of smoke ascending from the fragrant weed he saw what the young man was doing where did you get that he demanded abruptly it is one of those things miss crespigny wore was the modestly triumphant reply you saw them on her dress and in her hair and on her fan this is a real one though out of her bouquet i believe they call them hearts ease hearts ease be began anstruthers roughly but he checked himself in time she is the sort of a woman to wear hearts ease he added with a sardonic laugh she ought to wear hearts ease and violets and lilies and snowdrops and wild roses in the bud with a more bitter laugh for each flower he named such fresh innocent things suit women of her stamp i say said lyon staring at his sneering face amazedly what is the matter you talk as if you had a spite against her whats up anstruthers sneer only seemed to deepen in its intensity a spite he echoed what is the matter oh nothing nothing of any consequence only i wish she had given her hearts ease to me or i wish you would give it to me that i might show you what i advise you to do with the pretty things such creatures give you toss it into the fire old fellow and let it scorch and blacken and writhe as if it was a living thing in torment or fling it on the ground and set your heel upon it and grind it out of sight i dont see what good that would do said lyon coming to the mantelpiece and taking down his meerschaum you are a queer fellow anstruthers i did not think you knew the girl i know her with a fresh sneer i know her well enough by jove exclaimed lyon suddenly as if a thought had struck him then she did mean something she generally means something returned the other such women invariably do they mean mischief she generally does when she laughs in that way lyon proceeded incautiously she is generally laughing at a man instead of with him as she pretends to be and when she laughed this evening and looked in that odd style at you i thought there was something wrong anstruthers turned white the dead white of suppressed passion laugh he said she laughed you see explained lyon she had been asking about you and when i finished telling her what i knew she looked at you under her eyelashes as you stood talking to mrs despard and then she laughed and when i asked her if she was laughing at you she said ah no not at you but at another gentleman of the same name whom she had known a long time ago it was not the best thing for himself that hector anstruthers could have heard he had outlived his boyish passion but he had not lived down the sting of it having had his first young faith broken he had given faith up as a poor mockery he had grown cynical and sneering bah why should he cling to his old ideals of truth and purity what need that he should strive to be worthy of visions such as they had proved themselves what was truth after all what was purity in the end what had either done for him when he had striven after and believed in them the accidental death of his cousin had made him a rich man and he had given himself up to his own caprices he had seen the world and lived a lifetime during the last few years what had there been to hold him back not love he had done with that he told himself not hope of any quiet bliss to come if he ever married he should marry some woman who knew what she was taking when she accepted what he had to offer and then he had gradually drifted into his artistic and literary pursuits and his success had roused his vanity he would be something more than the rest and incited by this noble motive and his real love for the work he had made himself something more he had had no higher incentive than this vanity and a fancy for popularity it was not unpleasant to be pointed out as a genius a man who having no need to labor had the whim to labor as hard when the mood seized as the poorest bohemian among them and who would be paid for his work too they will give me praise for nothing he would say sardonically they wont give me money for nothing as long as they will pay me my work means something when it ceases to be worth a price it is not worth my time the experience of this evening had been a bad thing altogether for anstruthers it had roused in him much of sleeping evil his meeting with lisbeth crespigny had been as he told her wholly unexpected and because it had been unexpected its effect had double force he did not want to see her if he had been aware of her presence in the house he was going to visit he would have avoided it as he would have avoided the plague the truth was that in these days she had in his mind become the embodiment of all that was unnatural and hard and false and meeting her suddenly face to face every bitter memory of her had come back to him with a fierce shock when he had turned as mrs despard spoke and had seen her standing in the doorway framed in as it were with vines and flowers and tropical plants he had almost felt that he could turn on his heel and walk out of the room without a word of explanation she would know well enough what it meant being the man he was his eye had taken in at a glance every artistic effect about her and she was artistic enough for when lisbeth crespigny was not artistic she was nothing he saw that the promise of her own undeveloped girlhood had fulfilled itself after its own rare peculiar fashion doubly and trebly he saw in her what other men seldom saw at first sight but always learned afterward and his sense of repulsion and anger against her was all the more intense having been such a girl what might she not be as such a woman having borne such blossoms what could the fruit be but hard and bitter at the core only his ever ruling vanity saved him from greeting her with some insane caustic speech vanity will serve both men and women a good turn by chance sometimes and his saved him from making a blatant idiot of himself barely saved him and having got through this it was not soothing to hear that she had stood in her sly way and looked at him under her eyelashes and laughed he knew how she would laugh he had heard her laugh at people in that quiet fashion when she was fifteen and the sound had always hurt him through its suggestion of some ungirlish satire he could not grasp and which was not worthy of so perfect a being as he deemed her so he could not help breaking out again in new fury when bertie lyon explained himself it did not matter so much breaking out before lyon men could keep each others secrets he flung his pipe aside with a rough word and began to pace the room there is more of devil than woman in her he said there always was id give a few years of my life clenching his hand to be sure that she would find her match some day i should think you would be match enough for her remarked lyon astutely but what has she done to make you so savage when were you in love with a woman never bitterly i was in love with her and she never belonged to the race not even at fifteen years old i was in love with her and she has been the ruin of me i should scarcely have thought it answered lyon you are a pretty respectable wreck for your age the young man was not prone to heroics himself and not seeing his friend indulge in them often he did not regard them with enthusiasm this complacency checked anstruthers what a frantic fool he was to let such a trifle upset his boasted cynicism he flung out another short laugh of defiant self ridicule he came back to his chair as abruptly as he had left it bah he said so i am you are a wise boy lyon and i am glad you stopped me i thought i had lived down all this sort of nonsense but but i have seen that girl wear pansies before hearts ease by jove and it gave me a twinge to think of it keep that one in the glass over there keep it as long as you choose my boy it will last as long as your fancy for her does i wager women of the crespigny stamp dont wear well here hand me that bottle or stay ill ring for my man and we will have some brandy and soda to cool our heated fancies we are too young to stay up so late too young and innocent we ought to have gone to bed long ago like good boys chapter iv a lunch party the studio of that popular and fortunate young man mr hector anstruthers was really a most gorgeous and artistic affair it was beautifully furnished and wondrously fitted up and displayed in all its arrangements the fact that its owner was a young man of refined and luxurious tastes and was lucky enough to possess the means to gratify them to their utmost people admired this studio and talked about it almost as much as they talked about anstruthers himself indeed it had become a sort of fashion to visit it the most exclusive of mammas ladies who were so secure in their social thrones that they were privileged to dictate to fashion instead of being dictated to by that fickle goddess ladies who made much of anstruthers and petted him often stopped their carriages at his door on fine mornings and descended therefrom with their marriageable girls went up to the charming room and loitered through half an hour or even more talking to the young potentate admiring his pictures and picturesque odds and ends and rarities and making themselves very agreeable he was an extravagant creature and needed some one to control him these ladies told him but really it was all very pretty and exquisitely tasteful and upon the whole they could hardly blame him as much as it was their duty to do anstruthers received these delicate attentions with quite a grace he listened and smiled amiably replying with friendly deprecation of their reproaches was he not paid a thousand fold by their kind approval of his humble efforts what more could he ask than that they should grace the little place with their presence and condescend to admire his collection most men had their hobbies and art was his art and the artistic a harmless if extravagant one and then he would beg his fair visitors and their escort to honor his small temple by partaking of the luncheon his man would bring in and then the little luncheon would appear as if by magic a marvelous collation as much a work of art as everything else and this being set out upon some carven wonder of a table the ladies would deign to partake and would admire more than ever until in course of time to visit mr hector anstruthers among his pictures and carvings and marbles and be invited to enjoy his dandified little feasts became the most fashionable thing the most exclusive of people could do so it was by no means extraordinary that one sunny morning in april my lord while chatting with his usual condescending amiability to one party of visitors should receive another there were three in this last party an elderly beau a young lady of uncertain age and mrs despard anstruthers who was standing by the side of a pretty girl with bright eyes started a little on the entrance of this lady and the bright eyes observed it who is that asked their owner she is a very distingu sort of person and then she smiled it was quite certain that he could not be enamored of such mature charms as these distingu though they might be that is mrs despard miss esmond answered anstruthers excuse me one moment and then he advanced to meet his guests with the cordiality of the most graceful of hosts this was indeed a pleasure he said blandly he had been half afraid that mrs despard had forgotten her kind promise that lady shook hands with him in a most friendly manner she rather shared the universal tendency people had to admire the young man were not all young men extravagant and at least this one had money enough to afford to be extravagant honestly and attractions enough to render even conceit a legitimate article you must thank mr estabrook and his sister for bringing me she said they have been before and knew the way we met them as they were coming here and they asked us to come with them lisbeth would not get out of the carriage she was either lazy or ill humored she was driven round to the library and is to call for us in half an hour her eyes twinkled a little as she told him this as i have said before lisbeth always interested her and she was interested now in her mode of managing this old love affair it was so plain that it rasped her to be brought in contact with him and that she would have preferred very much to keep out of his way that the fact of her being thrown in his path against her will could not fail to have its spice and afford mrs despard a little malicious amusement in secret she was obliged to confess that ill natured as it seemed she would not have been very sorry to see lisbeth at bay of anstruthers sentiments she was not quite sure as yet but she was very sure of lisbeths lisbeth knew that she had acted atrociously in the past and hating herself in private for her weak wickedness hated anstruthers too for his share in it it was not lisbeths way to be either very just or very generous all her pangs of self reproach were secret ones of which she had taught herself to be ashamed and which she would have died rather than confess she let her caprices rule her wholly and did her best to make them rule other people if she was angry she made vicious speeches if she was pleased she behaved like an angel or an angelic creature without a fault she did not care enough for other people to mold her moods to their taste the person of most consequence to her was lisbeth crespigny mrs despard found her visit to her young friends studio very entertaining she saw things to admire and things to be amused at she discovered that his own efforts were really worth looking at and that the fixtures he had collected were both valuable and exquisite he had bought no costly lots of ugliness he had bought beauty as to the appurtenances of the room a woman could not have chosen them better most women would not have chosen them so well indeed a touch of effeminate fancifulness in the general arrangement of things made her smile more than once he had arranged a sort of miniature conservatory in a wide deep bay window filled it with tiers of flowers growing in fanciful vases and hanging baskets full of delicate long vines and bright bloom what a dandy we are she said smiling when she drew aside the sweeping lace curtain which cut this pretty corner off from the rest of the apartment and what fine tastes we display anstruthers blushed a little he had accompanied her on her tour of exploration and had been secretly flattered by her evident admiration and surprise is that a compliment or is it not he answered i like to hear that i have fine taste but i dont like to be called a dandy isnt it a trifle dandified to know how to do all these things so well she asked it is a mans province to be clumsy and ignorant about the small graces isnt it better than doing them ill he said pray let me give you two or three pale rosebuds and a few sweet violets if you bribe me with violets and rosebuds i shall say it is better that you should be sthetic enough to care to cultivate them than that i should not have the pleasure of receiving them as a gift it is very pretty of you to do such things there was no denying that they had become excellent friends there were not many people to whom his lordship would have offered his rosebuds and violets but for some reason or other he had taken a sudden fancy to mrs despard and was anxious to show himself to advantage he was even ready to answer her questions and once or twice they were somewhat close ones it must be confessed tell me something about that nice girl she said glancing at miss esmond who was talking to the rest of the party what a pretty creature she is and how bright her eyes and her color are there are very few girls who look like that in these days very few answered anstruthers that nice girl is miss georgie esmond and she is one of the few really nice girls who have the luck to take public fancy by storm as they ought to she has not been out long and she is considered a belle and a beauty and yet i assure you mrs despard that i have seen that girl playing with a troop of little brothers and sisters as if she was enjoying herself helping a snuffy old french governess to correct exercises and bringing a light for the old colonels pipe as if she had never seen a ball room in her life oh said mrs despard then i suppose you have seen her in the bosom of her family a trifle slyly i know them very well replied the young man with a grave air i have known georgie esmond since she wore pinafores my poor cousin who died has played blindmans buff with us at scarsbrook park when we were children many a time the fact is i believe we are distant relations i congratulate you on the distance of the relationship said mrs despard she is a fresh bright charming girl she is a good girl said anstruthers congratulate her on that and congratulate her father and her mother and her brothers and sisters and the snuffy old governess whose life she tries to make less of a burden to her it was at this moment that the carriage in which lisbeth had driven away returned it drove by the window and drew up at the door and mrs despard saw her young friends face alter its expression when he caught sight of it with its prancing bays and faultless accompaniments and lisbeth crespigny leaning back upon the dove colored cushions with a book in her little dove colored hand she saw mrs despard among the flowers but did not see her companion and being in an amiable humor she gave her a smile and a nice little gesture of greeting her eyes looked like midnight in the sunshine and with a marvel of a cream colored rose in her hat and in perfect toilet she was like a bit of a picture dark and delicate and fine she struck anstruthers in an instant just as anything else artistic would have struck him and held his attention i wonder if she would come up mrs despard said i wish she would she ought to see this it would suit her exactly allow me to go down and ask her if she will do us the honor said anstruthers colonel esmond and his daughter have promised to take luncheon and i was in hopes that i could persuade your party to join us it will be brought on almost immediately that is as novel as the rest said mrs despard by no means displeased however if you can induce lisbeth to come up i am not sure that i shall refuse i wonder what he will say to her was her mental comment when he left the room and she looked out of her window with no small degree of interest she saw him standing upon the pavement by the carriage a moment or so later his face slightly upturned as he spoke to the girl the spring wind playing softly with his loose fair hair and the spring sunshine brightening it and something in his manner she scarcely knew what brought back to her a sudden memory of the frank boyish young fellow he had been when lisbeth first amused herself with her cool contempt for his youth and impetuousness at penyllan and just as suddenly it occurred to her what a wide difference she found in him now how ready he was to say caustic things to take worldly views and indulge in worldly sneers and she recollected the stories she had drifted upon stories which proved him a lifes journey from the boy whose record had been pure whose heart had been fresh whose greatest transgression might have been easily forgiven and remembering all this she felt a sharp anger against lisbeth an anger sharper than she had ever felt toward her in the whole of her experience when anstruthers appeared upon the pavement and advanced toward the carriage side lisbeth turned toward him with a feeling of no slight displeasure since she had made an effort to keep out of his way must he follow her up is not mrs despard coming she asked somewhat abruptly mrs despard was so kind as to say that if i could induce you to leave the carriage and join our little party she would not refuse to take luncheon with us and then he stood and waited for her reply i was not aware that she thought of staying said lisbeth if i had known then she checked herself if i refuse she said in secret he will think i am afraid of him and she regarded him keenly but he was quite immovable and merely appeared politely interested if you will be so good as to let me help you down he said opening the low door himself and extending his hand courteously we shall be delighted to have such an addition to our number he added you are very kind answered lisbeth rising he should not think his presence could influence her one way or the other she made up her mind to face this position since it was unavoidable as if it had been the most ordinary one in the world she entered the room up stairs as if she had expected to lunch there miss esmond who was always good naturedly ready to be enthusiastic turned to look at her with a smile of pleasure what an unusual type she said to her father do look papa she is actually exquisite and being introduced to her her frank bright eyes became brighter than ever she was one of those lovable trusting young creatures who are ready to fall in love with pleasant people or objects on the shortest notice and she was captivated at once by lisbeths friendly air her age and lisbeths were about the same but by nature and experience they were very wide apart miss crespigny being very much the older and more worldly wise of the two if it had come to a matter of combat between them miss georgie would have had no chance whatever chapter v georgie esmond it suited lisbeth to be charming this morning and she was really very agreeable indeed she knew enough of art to appear to advantage among pictures and she had withal a certain demure and modest way of admitting her ignorance which was by no means unattractive she was bright amiable and as it seemed in the best of spirits she made friends with miss georgie and delighted colonel esmond she propitiated miss estabrook and rendered that inflammable elderly beau her brother supremely happy by her friendly condescension she treated anstruthers as if there had been no other event in their two lives but this one morning and this one nice little party she made the luncheon even more entertaining than such small feasts usually were in short she was lisbeth crespigny at her best her spiciest and in her most engaging mood oh said that open hearted georgie when she shook hands with her as they parted oh i have enjoyed myself so much i am so glad to have met you i hope we shall see each other again please ask me to call mrs despard laughing prettily i should like it so much i do so hate to lose people whom i like does that mean that you are so good as to like me a little said lisbeth in her sweetest tone wondering at the same time how on earth the girl could have lived so long and yet have retained that innocent believing air and impulsive way i hope it does georgie quite blushed with innocent fervor indeed it does she answered i should not say it if it did not and i am sure that if i see you more i shall like you better and better it is so delightful to meet somebody one is sure one can be fond of it was an odd thing but as lisbeth looked at her for a moment she positively felt that she blushed faintly herself blushed with a sense of being a trifle ashamed of lisbeth crespigny it would be dreadful to have such a girl as this find her out see her just as she was read her record just as the past had left it she was half inclined to put such a thing beyond the pale of possibility by drawing back i want mamma to know you said georgie mamma is so fond of clever people that it makes me wish often enough that i was not such an ordinary sort of girl we shall be delighted to see you my dear said mrs despard you may be sure of that come as soon and as often as possible and so the matter was decided and lisbeth had not the power to draw back if she had determined to do so you must have known miss crespigny quite a long time georgie esmond said cheerfully to anstruthers before she went away with her father mrs despard said something about your having met her at that little welsh place penyllan wasnt it and you havent been at penyllan to stay for two or three years you ought not to have kept such a charming creature to yourself for three years my boy said the old colonel i should think not indeed chimed in miss georgie it was selfish and we are never selfish with him are we papa we show him all our nice people dont we but said anstruthers i have not seen miss crespigny once during the three years after leaving penyllan we lost sight of each other somehow or other and did not meet again until a short time ago and then it was quite by accident it was very careless of you to lose her then protested miss georgie i would not have lost her for the world gentlemen are so cold in their friendships i dont believe you ever really loved any of your friends in your life mr hector anstruthers smiled a satirical smile ought i to have loved miss crespigny he demanded ought i to begin to love her now if you think it is my duty i will begin to do it at once georgie the girl shook her pretty head reproachfully oh she said that is always the way you talk you grand young gentlemen it is the fashion to be sarcastic and not to admire anybody very much or anything but yourselves saucily and you would sneer at your best friends rather than not be in the fashion i am sure i dont know what the world is coming to who is sarcastic now i should like to know said anstruthers i think it is miss georgie esmond who out herods herod admire ourselves indeed we only do what we are taught to do what women themselves teach us what exclaimed georgie do we teach you to admire yourselves and nothing else no was his answer you do not teach us that but you do worse not you my kind honest georgie but women who would have us believe they are as honest and tender they teach us that if we cling to our first beliefs we are fools and deserve to be laughed at they teach us to sneer and then scold us prettily for sneering they leave us nothing to believe in and then make sad poetic speeches about our want of faith there are men in the world for whom it would have been better if they had never seen a woman georgie esmonds eyes opened wider and wider she did not understand such bitterness she was a simple healthful minded girl and had seen very little of the world but its pleasant side why she said this is dreadful and you say it as if you actually meant it i shall have to talk to mamma about you hector such cases as yours are too much for me to deal with what good is all your money and your genius and your popularity and and good looks making a charming mischievous bow what pleasure can you derive from your pretty rooms and lovely pictures and fine articles of vertu if you have such wicked thoughts as those somebody ought to take your things from you as we do harrys toys when he is willful and they ought to be locked up in a cupboard until you are in a frame of mind to enjoy them anstruthers looked at her sweet bright face with a kind of sad admiration why had he not fallen in love with this girl instead of with the other it was a hard fate which had led or driven him what a different man he might have been if three years ago georgie esmond had stood in lisbeth crespignys place you dont quite understand georgie he said in a low rather tender tone you are too good and kind my dear to quite comprehend what makes people hard and bitter and old before their time and colonel esmond coming into the room to take her away at this moment he gave her nice little hand the ghost of an affectionate pressure when she offered it to him in farewell and while mr hector anstruthers was railing in this exalted strain at the falseness of womankind the fair cause of his heresy was driving home in a rather unpleasant frame of mind it is never pleasant to find that one has lost power and it was a specially galling thing to lisbeth crespigny to find herself at any time losing influence of any kind she did not find it agreeable to confront the fact that one of her slaves had purchased his freedom with his experience petty as the emotion was she had felt something akin to anger this morning when she had been compelled to acknowledge as once or twice she had been that her whilom victim could address her calmly meet her glance with polite indifference regard her upon the whole as he would have regarded any far less accomplished woman less than four years ago she said to herself with scorn if i had trampled upon him he would have kissed my feet to day he only sees in me an unpleasant young woman whom he overrated and accordingly cherishes a grudge against i have no doubt he looked at that pretty fresh esmond girl as we sat together and drew invidious comparisons between us let us give her credit for one thing however she felt no anger against the girl who she fancied had taken her place somehow georgie esmond with her bright eyes and her roses and her ready good nature had found a soft spot in lisbeths rather hard heart miss crespigny could not have explained why it was but she had taken a fancy to georgie esmond she liked her and she wanted the feeling to be a mutual one she would have experienced something very like a pang even thus early in their acquaintance if she had thought that the sweet honest young creature would ever see her with hector anstruthers eyes men are always disproportionately bitter she said to herself it is their way to make themselves heard when they are hurt they seem to have a kind of pride in their pain any ordinarily clever woman could see that my lord of the studio had a grievance lisbeth said mrs despard breaking in upon her reverie isnt it rather astonishing how that boy has improved he has improved said lisbeth because he has ceased to be a boy he is a man in these days and a very personable and entertaining man i must say returned mrs despard nodding her head in approval of him he is positively handsome and that luncheon was a very pretty graceful affair and quite unique i shall pay him a visit again one of these fine days being thus installed as one of mrs despards favorites it was not at all singular that they should see a great deal of the young gentleman and they did see him pretty often gradually he forgot his objection to meeting lisbeth and rather sneered in secret at the violence of that first shock of repulsion it was all over now he said and why should such a woman trouble him indeed what greater proof of his security could he give himself than the fact that he could meet her almost daily and still feel indifferent it must be confessed that he rather prided himself upon his indifference he was drawn also into greater familiarity with the household through georgie esmond for in expressing her wish to make friends with lisbeth georgie had been sincere as was her habit a very short time after the luncheon her first visit was made and the first visit was the harbinger of many others mamma who was her daughters chief admiration came with her and mamma was as much charmed in her way as georgie had been in hers it was impossible for lisbeth to help pleasing people when she was in the right mood and mrs esmond and georgie invariably put her in the right mood she could not help showing her best side to these two sweet natures chapter vi a song thus a friendship arose which in the course of time became a very close one colonel esmonds house was luxurious and pleasant and everybodys heart opened to a favorite of georgies accordingly lisbeths niche in the family was soon found it was rather agreeable to go among people who admired and were ready to love her so she went pretty often in fact georgie kept firm hold upon her there appeared always some reason why it was specially necessary that lisbeth should be with her she had visitors or she was alone and wanted company she had some new music and wanted lisbeths help or she had found some old songs lisbeth must try lisbeth whose voice was so exquisite indeed it was lisbeth lisbeth lisbeth from week to week until more than one of miss esmonds admirers wished that there had been no such person as miss crespigny in the world as anstruthers had said miss georgie esmond was quite a belle in this the first year of her reign and if she had been so inclined it was generally believed that she might have achieved some very brilliant social triumphs indeed but i am afraid that she had the bad taste not to aspire as she might have done i dont want to be uncharitable she had said innocently to her friend and i dont in the least believe the things people often say about society the things hector says for instance but really lisbeth i have sometimes thought that the life behind all the glare and glitter was just the least bit stupid and hollow i know i should get dreadfully tired of it if i had nothing else to satisfy me no real home life and no true single hearted close friends to love like you and mamma it made lisbeth wince this pretty speech georgie esmond often made her wince and mr hector anstruthers discovered this fact before any great length of time had passed and the discovery awakened in him divers new sensations he had looked on at the growing friendship with a secret sneer but the sneer was not at georgie honestly he liked the girl something the better for her affectionate credulity nothing could contaminate her not even lisbeth crespigny but sometimes just now and then he found it a trifle difficult to control himself and resist the impulse to be openly sarcastic he encountered this difficulty in special force one evening about a month after the studio luncheon the girls had spent the afternoon together and dinner being over lisbeth was singing one of georgies favorite songs it was a love song too for though miss georgie had as yet had no practical experience in the matter of love she had some very pretty ideas of that tender passion and was very fond of love songs and poems and love stories such as touched her heart and caused her to shed a few gentle tears and this song was a very pretty one indeed all for love and the world well lost was the burden of its guileless refrain all for love love which is always true and always tender and never deceives us what is the world it demanded what is life what rest can we find if we have not love the world is our garden and love is the queen of roses its fairest bloom let us gather what flowers we may but oh let us gather the rose first and tend it most delicately it will give its higher beauty to our lives it will make us more fit for heaven itself it will shame our selfishness and help us to forget our sordid longings all for love and the world well lost and so on through three or four verses with a very sweet accompaniment which georgie played with great taste and lisbeth was singing and as she had a trick of doing was quite forgetting herself and her exquisite full toned voice rose and fell with a wondrous fervor and her immense dark eyes glared and her small pale face glowed and a little pathetic shadow seemed to rest upon her so well did she sing indeed that one might have fancied that she had done nothing all her life but sing just such sweetly sentimental songs and believe every word of them implicitly and when she had finished georgies eyes were full of tears oh lisbeth she cried looking up at her affectionately you make everything sound so beautiful and and true i could never never sing in that way it must be because you can feel beautiful tender things so deeply so much more deeply than other people do lisbeth awoke from her dream suddenly hector anstruthers who had been standing at the other side of the piano looked at her with a significance which would have roused her at any time their eyes met and both pair flashed his with the very intensity of contempt hers with defiance my dear georgie he said i admire your enthusiasm but scarcely think you quite understand miss crespigny she is one of those fortunate people who cannot help doing things well it is a habit she has acquired no sentiment would suffer in her hands even a sentiment quite opposite to the one she has just illustrated the force of so artistically georgie looked a little amazed she did not liked to be chilled when all her gentle emotions were in full play and apart from this did not such a speech sound as if it suggested a doubt of the sincerity of her beloved lisbeth people cannot teach themselves to be innocent and loving she said almost indignantly at least they cannot be artistically loving and innocent you cannot make art of truth and faith and you cannot be generous and kind through nothing but habit your heart must be good before you can be good yourself at least that is my belief and i would rather have my beliefs than your cynicisms and so would lisbeth i am sure even if they are not so brilliant and popular you are too sarcastic sir and you have quite spoiled our pretty song i did not mean to spoil it he answered forgive me i beg with a satirical bow and pray favor me with another that i may learn to believe perhaps i shall i am inclined to think miss crespigny could convince a man of anything you dont deserve another said georgie does he lisbeth hardly said lisbeth who was turning over some music with an indifferent face but she sang again nevertheless and quite as well as she had done before though it must be admitted that she influenced georgie to a choice of songs of a less arcadian nature the following morning anstruthers called to see mrs despard and found that lady absent and miss crespigny in the drawing room consequently it fell to miss crespignys lot to entertain him during his brief visit he made it as brief as possible but when he rose to take his leave to his surprise lisbeth detained him there is something i should like to say to you she began after she had risen with him he paused hat in hand it is about georgie miss esmond she added you were very kind to speak to her of me as you did last night it was very generous i feel that i ought to thank you for trying to make her despise me and her eyes flashed with an expression not easy to face i ask pardon he returned loftily if i had understood that your friendship was of such a nature if its object had been a man instead of an innocent girl you would have understood easily enough i have no doubt she interposed angrily he bowed with the suspicion of a sneer upon his face perhaps he answered thank you said she however since you need the matter explained i will explain it i am fond of georgie esmond and she is fond of me and i do not choose to lose her affection so i must resort to the poor expedient of asking you to deny yourself the gratification of treating me contemptuously in her presence say what you please when we are alone as we are sometimes forced to be but when we are with your cousin be good enough to remember that she is my friend and trusts me it was so like the girl lisbeth this daring summary course this confronting and settling the matter at once without the least sign of hesitation or reluctance that he began to feel very uncomfortable had he really behaved himself so badly indeed was it possible that he had allowed himself to appear such a rampant brute as her words implied he who so prided himself upon his thoroughbred impassibility i treat you contemptuously he exclaimed it is not you i care for she answered him it is georgie esmond he had no resource left but to accept his position the very humiliating position of a man whose apologies if he offered any would be coolly set aside whose humiliation was of no consequence and who was expected to receive punishment like a culprit whose sensations were not for a moment to be regarded he left the house feeling angry and helpless and returning to his chambers wrote a stinging criticism of a new book poor blanke who had written the book received the benefit of the sentiments miss crespigny had roused on her part lisbeth resorted to one of her humors to use mrs despards expression she was out of patience with herself she had lost her temper almost as soon as she had spoken her first words and she had been so sure of perfect self control before she began that was her secret irritant why could she not have managed it better it was not usual with her to give way when she was sure of herself somebody has been here said mrs despard when she came in and found her sitting alone with her sewing some one you do not like or some one who has said something awkward or unpleasant to you hector anstruthers has been here was lisbeths answer but she deigned no further explanation and did not even lift her eyes as she spoke chapter vii a new experience the next time that georgie found herself alone with mr anstruthers she read him a very severe little lecture on the subject of his shortcomings i knew that you liked to be satirical and make fine cutting speeches she said with the prettiest indignation but i did not think you would have gone so far as to be openly rude and to lisbeth of all people lisbeth who is so good and unselfish and kind and who is my dearest friend hector anstruthers looked at her sweet face almost mournfully is she good and unselfish and kind he said but the question was not a satire he only asked it in a tender wonder at the girls innocent faith there is no one like her no one so good unless it is mamma herself exclaimed miss georgie with warmth but lisbeths is not a common surface goodness and i suppose that is the reason that you cannot see it you too who are so far sighted and clever i for one am glad i am not a genius if to be a genius one must be blind to everything but the failings of ones friends ah hector a sudden pity kindling in her gentle breast as she met his eyes ah hector people often envy you and call you fortunate but there are times when i am sorry for you sorry from my heart georgie answered the young man not quite able to control a tremor in his voice there are more times than you dream of when i am sorry for myself sorry for yourself said georgie softening at once then you must be more unhappy than i thought to be sorry for ones self one must be unhappy indeed but why is it why should you be unhappy after all why should you be cynical and unbelieving hector the world has been very good to you or as i think we ought to say god has been very good to you what have you not got that you can want what is there that you lack not money not health not friends isnt it a little ungrateful to insist on being wretched when you have so much yes answered anstruthers gloomily it is very ungrateful indeed ungrateful i should think it was returned georgie with her favorite dubious shake of the head ah poor fellow i am afraid it is a little misfortune that you need and i am very sorry to see it it was no marvel that georgie esmond was popular she was one of those charming girls who invariably have a good effect upon people she was so good herself so innocent so honest so trustful that she actually seemed to create a sweeter atmosphere wherever she went the worst of men while listening to her gentle bright speeches felt that the world was not so bad after all and that there was still sweetness and purity left to render sin the more shameful by their white contrast a fellow wants to forget his worst side when he is with her said one she makes a man feel that he would like to hide his shadinesses even from himself her effect upon hector anstruthers was a curious and rather a dangerous one she made him ashamed of himself too and she filled his heart with a tender longing and regret had it not been for his experience with lisbeth he would have loved the girl passionately as it was his affection for her would never be more than a brotherly though intensely admiring one he was constantly wishing that fate had given georgie to him georgie who seemed to him the purest and loveliest of young home goddesses georgie who would have made his life happy and pure and peaceful if it had only been georgie instead of lisbeth but it had been lisbeth and his altar fires had burned out and left to him nothing but a waste of cold gray ashes and yet knowing this he could not quite give georgie up the mere sight of her fresh bright eyed face was a help to him and the sound of her voice a balm he grew fonder of her every day in his way her kindly little girlish homilies touched and warmed him as lisbeth had made him worse so georgie esmond made him better but the danger the danger was not for himself it was for georgie the day was slowly dawning when the girls innocent friendship and admiration for him would become something else when she began to pity him she began to tread on unsafe ground she had lived through no miserable experience she had felt no desolating passion her heart was all untried and his evident affection stirred it softly even before she understood her own feelings she thought her budding love was pity and her tenderness sympathy he had gone wrong poor fellow somehow and she was sorry for him i am sure he does not mean the hard things he sometimes says she said to lisbeth i think that satirical way of speaking is more a bad habit than anything else mamma thinks so too but with a little guileless blush we are both so fond of him that we cannot help being sorry that he has fallen into it it is a sort of fashion in these days returned lisbeth and she longed to add a scorching little sneer to the brief comment but she restrained it for georgies sake positively such a thing had become possible she who had never restrained her impulses before had gradually learned to control them for this simple girls sake on the one or two occasions early in their acquaintance when she had let her evil spirit get the better of her the sudden pain and wonder in georgies face had stung her so quickly that she had resolved to hide her iniquities at least in her presence sometimes she had even wished that she had been softer at heart and less selfish it was so unpleasant to see herself just as she was when she breathed that sweet atmosphere of which i have spoken georgie esmond caused her to lose patience with lisbeth crespigny upon more than one occasion i am a hypocrite she said to herself if she knew me as i am what would she think of me what would mrs esmond say if she knew how cavalierly her dear lisbeth had treated those three loving old souls at penyllan i am gaining everything on false pretenses and one night as she sat combing her hair before her mirror she added fiercely i am false and selfish all through and i believe they are teaching me to be ashamed of myself the fact was these two sweet women this sweet mother and daughter were teaching her to be ashamed of herself she quite writhed under her conviction for she felt herself convicted her self love was wounded but the day came when that perfect obstinate self confidence which was her chief characteristic was not a little shaken i should like to be a better woman she would say in a kind of stubborn anger it has actually come to this that i would be a better woman if i could but i cannot it is not in me i was not born to be a good woman the more she saw of the esmonds the more she learned the household was such a pleasant one and was so full of the grace of home and kindly affection how proud the good old colonel was of his pretty daughter how he enjoyed her triumphs and approved of the taste of her many admirers how delighted he was to escort her to evening parties or to the grandest of balls and to spend the night in watching her dance and smile and hold her gay little court entirely ignoring the fact that his gout was apt to be troublesome when he wore tight boots instead of his huge slippers it was quite enough for him that his girl was enjoying herself and that people were admiring her grace and freshness and bloom how fond the half dozen small brothers and sisters were of georgie and what a comfort and pleasure the girl was to her mother it was an education to lisbeth crespigny to see them all together it even seemed that in time she fell somewhat into georgies own way of caring for other people how could she help caring for the kind hearts that beat so warmly toward her then through acquiring as it were a habit of graciousness she remembered things she had almost forgotten if she was not born to be a good woman why not try and smooth the fact over a little was her cynical fancy why not give the three good spinsters at penyllan the benefit of her new experience it would be so little trouble to gladden their hearts so with an impatient pity for herself and them she took upon herself the task of writing to them oftener and at greater length and frequently before her letters were completed she found herself touched somewhat and even prompted to be a trifle more affectionate than had been her wont a poor little effort to have made but the dear simple souls at penyllan greeted the change with tenderest joy and aunt millicent and aunt clarissa and aunt hetty each shed tears of ecstasy in secret in secret because to have shed them openly would have been to admit to one another that they had each felt their dear lisbeths former letters to be cold or at least not absolutely all that could be desired so like dear dear philips own child said miss clarissa who was generally the family voice you know how often i have remarked sister henrietta that our dear lisbeth was like brother philip in every respect even though at times she is perhaps a little more a little more reserved as it were her nature i am sure is most affectionate that fortunate and much caressed young man mr hector anstruthers not only met miss crespigny frequently but heard much of her imperfect as she may appear to us who sit in judgment upon her the name of her admirers was legion her intimacy with the esmonds led her into very gay and distinguished society far more illustrious society than mrs despards patronage had been able to afford her and having this her little peculiarities did the rest her immense dusky eyes her small pale piquant face her self possession her wit and her numerous capabilities attracted people wondrously even battered old beaux who had outlived two or three generations of beauties and who were fastidious accordingly found an indescribable charm in this caustic clever young person who was really not a beauty at all if measured according to the usual standard she was too small too pale too odd but then where could one find such great changeable dark eyes such artistic taste such masses of fine hair such a voice and apart from that it was said of her there is something else hear her talk by jove see how she can manage a man when she chooses to take the trouble see how little she cares for the fine speeches that would influence other women see her dance hear her sing and you will begin to understand her a fellow can never tire of her for she is everything she has the whim to be and she is everything equally well so she is heaven knows hector anstruthers muttered bitterly looking across the room at her as she stood talking to colonel esmond old denbighs laudatory speech fell upon his ears with a significance of its own she could be anything she chose so long as her whim lasted and there was the end of it it all meant nothing she was as false when she played her pretty part for the benefit of the esmonds young and old as when she encouraged these dandies and ensnared them with georgie she took up the rle of ingnue that was all she was bad through and through he felt all this sincerely this night when he heard the men praising her and he was savage accordingly chapter viii i will tell you the truth for once but how was it the very next night when he dropped in to see mrs despard and surprised the syren reading a letter of miss clarissas and reading it in the strangest of moods reading it with a pale face and heavy wet lashes she did not pretend to hide the traces of her mental disturbance she did not condescend to take the trouble she evidently resented his appearance as untimely but she greeted him with indifferent composure mrs despard will come down as soon as she hears that you are here she said and then proceeded to fold the letter and replace it in its envelope and thus he saw that it bore the penyllan post mark what did such a whim as this mean he asked himself impatiently taking in at a glance the new expression in her face and the heaviness of her gloomy eyes this was not one of her tricks there was no one here to see her and even if there had been what end could she serve by crying over a letter from penyllan what on earth had she been crying for he had never seen her shed a tear before in his life he had often thought that such a thing was impossible she was so hard could it be that she was not really so hard after all and that those three innocent old women could reach her heart but the next minute he laughed at the absurdity of the idea and lisbeth chancing to raise her eyes and coolly fixing them on his face at that moment saw his smile what is the matter she asked a demon took possession of him at once what if he should tell her and see how she would answer they knew each other why should they keep up this pretense of being nothing but ordinary acquaintances with no unpleasant little drama behind i was thinking what an amusing blunder i had been on the verge of making he said she did not answer but still kept her eyes fixed upon him i was trying to account for your sadness on the same grounds that i would account for sadness in another woman i was almost inclined to believe that something in your letter had touched your heart as it might have touched georgie esmonds but i checked myself in time you checked yourself in time she said slowly that was a good thing there was a brief silence during which he felt that as usual he had gained nothing by his sarcasm and then suddenly she held out her mite of a hand with miss clarissas letter in it rather taking him aback would you like to read it she said suppose you do aunt clarissa is an old friend of yours she speaks of you as affectionately as ever he could not comprehend the look she wore when she said this it was a queer calculating look and had a meaning of its own but it was a riddle he could not read take it she said seeing that he hesitated i mean what i say i want you to read it all it may do you good so feeling uncomfortable enough he took it and before he had read two pages it had affected him just as lisbeth had intended that it should the worst of us must be touched by pure unselfish goodness miss clarissas simple affectionate outpourings to her dear lisbeth were somewhat pathetic in their way she was so grateful for the tenderness of their dear girls last letter so sweet tempered were her ready excuses for its rather late arrival her kind old heart was plainly so wholly dedicated to the perfections of the dear girl in question that by the time anstruthers had reached the conclusion of the epistle he found himself indescribably softened in mind though he really could not have told why he did not think that he had softened toward lisbeth herself but it was true nevertheless that he had softened toward her in a secretly puzzled way lisbeth had risen from her seat and was standing before him when he handed back the letter and she met his eyes just as she had done before they are very fond of me you see she said they even believe that i have a real affection for them they think i am capable of it just as georgie esmond does poor georgie poor aunt clarissa poor aunt millicent poor everybody indeed and she suddenly ended and turned away from him toward the fire but in a minute more she spoke again i wonder if i am capable of it she said i wonder if i am he could only see her side face but something in her tone roused him to a vehement reply god knows he said i do not i do not understand you and never shall she turned to him abruptly then and let him see her whole face pale with a strange excited pallor her eyes wide and sparkling and wet that is true she said you do not understand i do not understand myself but well i have told you lies enough before when it has suited me now i will tell you the truth for once your blunder was not such a blunder after all my heart has been touched just as a better womans might have been almost as georgies might have been and this letter touched it this effusion of poor aunt clarissas and that was why i was crying when you came into the room why i am crying now and having made this unlooked for confession she walked out of the room just as mrs despard came in on his next visit to his friends the esmonds mr anstruthers found the pretty head of the lovely miss georgie full of a new project had he not heard the news she was going to penyllan with lisbeth and they were to stay with the misses tregarthyn miss clarissa had written the kindest letter the dearest most affectionate letter as affectionate as if she had known her all her life wasnt it delightful so much nicer you know than going to some stupid fashionable place said miss georgie with bright eyes and the brightest of fresh roses on her cheeks not that i am so ungrateful as to abuse poor old brighton and the rest but this will be something new and new things are always better than old ones suggested anstruthers some new things always are answered georgie with spirit new virtues for instance are better than old follies new resolutions to be charitable instead of old tendencies to be harsh new i give it up interposed hector and i will agree with you i always agree with you georgie in a softer tone the poor pretty face bloomed into blush rose color and the sweet eyes met his with innocent trouble not always said georgie you dont agree with me when i tell you that you are not as good as you ought to be as you might be if you would try am i such a bad fellow then drawing nearer to her ah georgie etc etc until in fact he wandered off in spite of himself into that most dangerous ground of which i have already spoken actually within the last few days the idea had occurred to him that perhaps possibly just possibly he would not be going so far wrong if he let himself drift into a gentle passion for georgie perhaps after all he could give her a better love than he had ever given to lisbeth crespigny it would be a quieter love was not a mans second love always quieter than the first and at the same time was it not always more endurable and deep but perhaps he could make it a love worthy of her mind you he was not shallow or coarse enough to think that anything would do any mock sentiment any semblance of affection it was only that he longed to anchor himself somehow and admired and trusted this warm souled young creature so earnestly that he instinctively turned toward her she was far too good for him he told himself and it was only her goodness that could help her to overlook his many faults but perhaps she would overlook them and perhaps in time out of the ashes of that wretched passion of his youth might arise a phnix fair enough to be worthy of her womanhood so he was something more tender and so his new tenderness showed itself in his handsome face and in a certain regret that he was to lose what penyllan and the misses tregarthyn were to gain will you let me come to see you he asked at last will you but there he stopped remembering lisbeth how would she like such a plan why should you not said georgie with a pleased blush i have heard you say that the misses tregarthyn have asked you again and again and they seem so fond of you and i am sure mamma and papa would be quite glad if you would run down and look at us and then run back and tell them all the news and as to lisbeth lisbeth never objects to anything i think she likes you well enough when you are good come by all means and she seemed to regard his proposition as so natural and pleasant that he had no alternative but to profess to regard it as such himself and so it was agreed upon that in course of time he should follow them to penyllan chapter ix we must always be true indeed he drifted so far this evening that there is no knowing how sad a story this of mine might have been if the fates had not been kinder to pretty georgie esmond than they are to the generality of people surely it must have been because she deserved something better than the fortune of a disappointed woman that chance interposed in her behalf before she went to sleep that night she had enjoyed herself very much during hectors visit she had sung her sweetest songs and had been in the brightest of good spirits indeed she had been very happy and perhaps had felt her innocent warm heart stirred a little once or twice by the young mans tender speeches though she was very far from being in the frame of mind to analyze the reasons for her gentle pleasure when her visitor had taken his departure she came to the colonels arm chair and possibly feeling somewhat conscience stricken because she had left papa to his own resources for so long a time she applied herself to the task of petting him in her most seductive manner you are very quiet papa she said settling herself upon a footstool at his side i hope you are not going to have the gout again darling mamma what shall we do with him if he insists on having the gout when i am going to penyllan i shall have to stay at home and so will lisbeth he cannot possibly dispense with us when he has the gout but i am not going to have the gout protested the colonel stoutly i am quite well my dear but the fact is the fact is i was thinking of a discovery i made this evening a discovery about anstruthers hector exclaimed georgie half unconsciously and then turned her bright eyes upon the shining fender yes proceeded colonel esmond hector himself i believe i have found out what has changed him so so deucedly not to put too fine a point upon it during the last four or five years you remember what a frank warm hearted lad he was at three and twenty jennie to mrs esmond papa interposed georgie do you really think he has changed for the worse in his heart i mean he has not changed for the better answered the colonel but his heart is all right my dear i am sure said georgie a little piteously i am sure he is good at heart of course he is said the colonel but he has altered very much in many respects and jennie my dear i have discovered that the trouble was the one you hinted at in the beginning there was a woman in the case a woman who treated him shamefully she must have been very heartless said georgie poor hector the colonel warmed up she was shamefully heartless she was disgracefully unnaturally heartless such cold blooded selfish cruelty would have been unnatural in a mature woman and she was nothing more than a school girl a mere child i congratulate myself that i did not learn her name the man who told me the story had not heard it if i knew it and should ever chance to meet her by george with virtuous indignation i dont see how a man of honor could remain in the same room with such a woman and then he poured out what he had heard of the story and an unpleasant enough sound it had when related with all the additional coloring confidential report had given it it was bad enough to begin with but it was worse for having passed through the hands of the men who had gathered it together by scraps and odds and ends and joined it as they thought best and the worst of it is ended colonel esmond that he has not lived it down as he fancies he has done at least there are those who think so it is said the girl is here in town now and though they are not friends anstruthers cannot keep away from her altogether and is always most savage and reckless when he has seen her poor fellow said georgie in a low quiet voice poor hector but she did not look up at any one as she spoke indeed she had not looked up even once during the time in which this unpleasant story had been told having heard it she confronted it very sensibly when indeed was she not sweet and sensible while she listened a hundred past incidents rushed back upon her she remembered things she had heard hector say and things she had seen him do she remembered certain restless moods of his certain desperate whims and fancies and she began to comprehend what their meaning was her vague fancies of his unhappiness found a firm foundation he was wretched and broken in faith because this cruel girl had robbed him of his honest belief in love and truth and goodness ah poor hector she did not say very much while the colonel and mrs esmond discussed the matter but she was thinking very deeply and when she bade them good night and went up to her room there was a sad sort of thoughtfulness in her face she did not begin to undress at once but sat down by her toilet table and rested her fresh cheek on her hand i wonder who it was she said softly who could it be whom did he know when he was three and twenty surely some fate guided her eyes just at that moment guided them to the small half opened note lying at her elbow a note so opened that the signature alone presented itself to her glance your affectionate lisbeth she gave a little start and then flushed up with a queer agitation lisbeth she said lisbeth and then with quite a self reproach in her tone oh no not lisbeth how could i say it not lisbeth she put out her hand and took up the note protestingly i could not bear to think it she said it might be any one else but not lisbeth and yet the next minute a new thought forced itself upon her a memory of some words of lisbeths own we were nothing but a couple of children when we met at penyllan that young lady had said a few days before a trifle cavalierly he was only three and twenty and as for me what was i but a child a school girl not much more than sixteen but protested georgie her eyes shining piteously and the moisture forcing itself into them but it might not have been she and if it was lisbeth he loved the story may have been exaggerated such stories always are and if any part of it is true she was so young and did not know what she was doing it was not half so wrong in lisbeth as it would have been in me who have had mamma all my life to teach me the difference between right and wrong she had nobody but the misses tregarthyn and people who are good are not always wise she was not very wise herself poor loving little soul at least she was not worldly wise she could not bear the thought of connecting that cruel story with her most precious lisbeth in whom she had never yet found a fault and if it must be connected with her what excuses might there not be oh she was so sure that it was an exaggerated story and that if the truth were known lisbeths fault had only risen out of lisbeths youth and innocence she was so disturbed about her friend that it was quite a long time before she remembered that she had a quiet little pain of her own to contend with only the ghost of a pain as yet but a ghost which but for this timely check might have been very much harder to deal with than it was i think she said at last blushing a little at the sound of her own words i think that perhaps i was beginning to care for hector more than for any one else and i am glad that papa told me this before before it was too late i think i should have been more sorry after a little time than i am now and i ought to be thankful if i did not mean to be sensible instead of sentimental perhaps i should try to believe that what is said is not true and that he has really lived his trouble down but i would rather be sensible and believe that he only means to think of me as his friend as he has done all his life i must think that she thought eagerly i must remember it always when he is with me it would be best and if it is lisbeth he has loved and he loves her yet i i must try to help them to forgive each other and here she bent her face and as she touched the note lightly with her lips a bright drop like a jewel fell upon the paper we must always be true to each other she whispered tremulously this would be a sad world if people were not true to each other and ready to make little sacrifices for the sake of those they love and thus it was that the innocent white rose of love just turning to the sun folded its fresh petals and became a bud again it was better as it was much better that it should be a bud for a longer time than that it should bloom too early and lose its too lavish beauty before the perfect summer came chapter x penyllan emulating the example of the misses tregarthyn penyllan had put on its best dress to grace the occasion of the arrival of the visitors as they drove from the little railway station lisbeth was of the opinion that she had never seen the sea so blue and cool and sparkling the sands so silver white or the village so picturesque the truth was the sight of it quite subdued her and invested her with one of her softest and most charitable moods i did not know it was so pretty she said i believe we shall enjoy ourselves georgie georgie was enraptured everything pleased her the sea the beach the sky the quaint white cottages the bare legged children the old welsh women in their steeple hats and woollen petticoats the up hill streets of the village were delightful the little bandbox of a railway station was incomparable she had been rather pale and tired during the journey but as soon as she set her feet upon the platform at penyllan her pallor and fatigue disappeared the fresh breeze from the sea tinged her cheeks and made her eyes sparkle and she was in the best of good spirits i never saw such a dear little place in my life she said delightedly enjoy ourselves lisbeth why as you know i feel just as i used to when we were all children and went to the sea side with mamma and the nurses and dug caves in the sand with wooden spades and built forts and looked for shells i am going to make friends with those little urchins on the beach to morrow and ask them to play with me behold the tregarthyn household arrayed in all its modest splendor when the carriage drove up to the garden gate behold the neatest of young handmaidens brisk and blue eyed and the smallest of pages standing ready to assist with the boxes and admire the young ladies with an exceeding admiration behold also the three misses tregarthyn in the trimmest of company dresses and in such a state of affectionate tremor and excitement that they kissed their dear lisbeth on the tip of the nose by one consent instead of bestowing their delighted caresses upon her lips so very happy to see you my love said miss clarissa squeezing georgies hand as she led the way into the parlor our dear lisbeths friend i hope you are not tired and that you left your mamma and papa quite well our dear lisbeth is so tenderly attached to your mamma and papa that if such a thing were possible we should be quite jealous they are quite as much attached to her i can assure you answered georgie in her pretty earnest way indeed we all are miss clarissa everybody is fond of lisbeth and thereby rendered her position as a favorite secure at once indeed she found her way to the heart of the spinster household in an incredibly short space of time miss millicent and miss hetty and miss clarissa were charmed with her her pretty face and figure her girlish gayety her readiness to admire and enjoy everything were attractions enough to enchant any spinster trio even if she had not possessed that still greater charm of being lisbeths dearest friend the two girls shared lisbeths old room together a cool nest of a place with white draperies and quaint ornaments and all the child lisbeths treasures of land and sea still kept in their original places it looks exactly as it did when i went away with mrs despard said lisbeth glancing round with a sigh which meant she scarce knew what i gathered that sea weed when i was fourteen and i was always engaged in difficulties with the cooks because i would bring in more shells than i wanted and leave piles of them in the kitchen aunt clarissa sent one woman away because we had a row and she said i was a imperent young minx allus litterin the place with my rubbidge how the dear old souls did spoil me if i had brought a whale into the drawing room they would have regretted but never resented it i had my own way often enough when i ought to have had my ears boxed you must have been very happy in their loving you so said georgie who had drawn a low wicker chair to the open window and was enjoying the moonlight and the sea you would have been returned lisbeth drawing up chair number two and you would have behaved yourself better than i did i was an ill conditioned young person even in those days they were both silent for a while after this there was a lovely view from the window and all was so still that neither cared to stir for a few moments then the thoughtfulness on georgies face attracted lisbeths attention i should like to know she said what you are thinking about the girl drew a positively ecstatic little sigh i was thinking how sweet and quiet everything looked she said innocently and how much happier i am happier exclaimed lisbeth when were you unhappy georgie the surprise in her tone brought georgie to a recognition of what her words had unconsciously implied she found herself blushing and wondering at her own simplicity she had not meant to say so much she could not comprehend why she should have said anything of that kind at all it is strange enough to hear that you can be made happier than you always seem to be said lisbeth you speak as if and then her quick eye taking in the girls trepidation she stopped short you never had a trouble georgie she added in a voice very few of her friends would have known it was so soft no said georgie oh no lisbeth not a trouble exactly not a trouble at all indeed only and suddenly she turned her bright appealing eyes to lisbeths face i dont know why i said it she said it was nothing real lisbeth or else i am sure you would have known but it well i might have had a trouble and i was saved from it and i am glad and thankful and to miss crespignys surprise she bent forward and kissed her softly on the cheek lisbeth asked her no questions she was not fond of asking questions and she was a young person of delicacy and tact when she was in an affectionate mood she was too partial to georgie to wish to force her into telling her little secrets but a certain thought flashed through her mind as she sat with her eyes resting on the sea she is the sort of girl she said sharply to herself who would be likely to have no trouble but a love trouble who has been making love to her or rather who among all her admirers would be likely to touch her heart but this mental problem was by no means easy to solve there were so many men who admired georgie esmond and such a large proportion of them were men whom any girl might have loved it was one of lisbeths chief wonders that georgie who was so soft of heart and ready with affection should have held her own so long against so agreeable a multitude of adorers certainly if she had lived through any little romance she had kept her secret well she did not look like a love lorn young lady when she came down the next morning fresh and rosy and prepared to explore penyllan in all its fastnesses it was exhilarating to see her and the misses tregarthyn were delighted beyond bounds she made a pilgrimage through half the up and down hill little streets in the village and before dinner had managed to drag lisbeth a mile along the shore against a stiff breeze which blew their long loose hair about and tinted their cheeks brilliantly lisbeth followed her with an amused wonder at her enthusiasm mingled with discontent at her own indifference it was she who ought to have been in raptures and she was not in raptures at all had she no natural feeling whatever any other woman would have felt a sentimental tenderness for the place which had been her earliest home they had found a comfortable nook behind a cluster of sheltering rocks and were sitting on the sand when lisbeth arrived at this stage of thought the place was an old haunt of hers and hector anstruthers had often followed her there in their boy and girl days and the sight of the familiar stretch of sea and sand irritated her somehow she picked up a shell and sent it skimming away toward the water with an impatient gesture georgie she said i should like to know what you see in penyllan to please you so everything said georgie and then somehow i seem to know it i think its chief attraction is that you lived here so long lisbeth picked up another shell and sent it skimming after the other what a girl you are she said it is always your love and your heart that are touched you are all heart you love people and you love everything that belongs to them their homes their belongings their relations it is not so with me it never was you are like what hector anstruthers was when i first knew him bah with a shrug of her shoulders how fond the foolish fellow was of aunt hetty and aunt millicent and aunt clarissa her tongue had slipped just as georgies had done the night before for the moment she forgot herself entirely and only remembered that old sentimental affection of her boyish lover that affection for her spinster relatives which in the past had impressed her as being half troublesome and half absurd chapter xi a confession georgie turned to her taking sudden courage lisbeth she said you never told me much about your acquaintance with hector anstruthers i wonder how it was you knew him very well it seems i wish broke out lisbeth almost angrily that i had never known him at all the faithful heart beating in the breast of the girl at her side leaped nervously it was lisbeth said she to herself it was lisbeth i wish repeated lisbeth frowning at the sea that i had never seen him why was georgies quiet question because because it was a bad thing for us both in greater impatience than ever georgie looked up at her sadly why again she ventured in her soft voice she could not help it but for a moment lisbeth did not answer she had risen and stood leaning against the rock a queer look on her face a queer darkening in her eyes at length she broke into a little hard laugh as if she meant to defy herself to be emotional how horror stricken you would be if i were to tell you why she said does that mean georgie put it to her that you were unkind to him it means was her strange reply it means that it was i who ruined his life forever she made the confession fairly in spite of herself and she was emotional vehement she could not stand this innocent georgie and her beliefs any longer she had been slowly approaching this mood for months and now every inner and outer influence seemed to combine against her natural stubborn secretiveness perhaps penyllan the sea the shore the sky helped her on to the end at any rate she must tell the truth this once and hear what this innocent georgie would say to it i ruined his life for him she repeated i broke his faith i believe i am to blame for every evil change the last few years have wrought in him i myself lisbeth do you hear georgie the face under georgies straw hat was rather pale but it was not horror stricken you were too young she faltered to understand too young echoed lisbeth i never was young in my life i was born old i was born a woman and i was born cold and hard that was it if i had been like other girls he would have touched my heart after he had touched my vanity or he might even have touched my heart first you would have loved him with all your soul are you willing to hear the whole history georgie quite willing only and she raised her face with a bright resolute affectionate look you cannot make me think harshly of you so dont try lisbeth lisbeth regarded her with an entirely new expression which had nevertheless a shade of her old wonder in it i really do not believe i could she said you are very hard to deal with at least i find it hard to deal with you you are a new experience if there was just a little flavor of insincerity or uncharitableness in you if you would be false to your beliefs now and then i should know what to do but as it is you are perplexing notwithstanding here comes the story she put her hands behind her and bracing herself against the rock told it from beginning to end in her coolest most daring way even with a half defiant air if she had been telling some one elses story she could not have been more caustic and unsparing more determined to soften no harsh outline or smooth over anything she set the girl lisbeth before her listener just as lisbeth crespigny at seventeen had been selfish callous shallow and deep at once restless ungrateful a half ripe coquette who notwithstanding her crudeness was yet far too ripe for her age she pictured the honest boyish young fellow who had fallen victim to her immature fascinations simply because he was too guileless and romantic to see in any woman anything but a goddess she described his sincerity his unselfish willingness to bear her caprices and see no wrong in them his lavish affection for every thing and every one who shared his love for her his readiness to believe his tardiness to doubt and see her as she really was the open hearted faith which had made the awakening so much harder to bear when it forced itself upon him at last she left out the recital of no petty wrong she had done him and no small tyranny or indignity she had made him feel she told the whole story in fact as she saw it now not as she had seen it in that shallow self ruled girlhood and when she had touched upon everything and ended with that last scene in the garden among aunt clarissas roses she stopped and there was a silence georgies eyelashes were wet and so were her cheeks a tear or so stained her pink cravat it was so sorrowful poor hector again and then of course poor lisbeth by her own showing lisbeth deserved no pity but the warm young heart gave her pity enough and to spare something had been wrong somewhere indeed it seemed as if everything had been wrong but poor lisbeth she was so fond of lisbeth herself and mamma was so fond of her and the misses tregarthyn so many people were fond of lisbeth and then lisbeths voice startled her a new voice tremulous and as if her mood was a sore and restive one you are crying of course georgie i knew you would i have been crying pause enough to allow of a struggle and then well since you are crying i suppose i may cry too it is queer enough that i should cry but and to georgies amazement and trouble lisbeth put her hand up on the rough rock and laid her face against it lisbeth cried the girl wait a moment said lisbeth i dont know what has come over me it is a new thing for me i i it was a new thing indeed and it did not last very long when she raised her head and turned again her eyelashes were wet too and she was even pale ah lisbeth said georgie pitying her you are sorry lisbeth smiled faintly i never was sorry before for anything i had done never in my life she answered i have had a theory that people should take care of themselves as i did but now well i suppose i am sorry for hector anstruthers and perhaps a little for myself no one will offer me such an unreasoning love again very few women are offered such a love once but i always got more than my share of everything it is my way i suppose i was born under a lucky star georgie what do you think of me now georgie got up and kissed her in a most earnest fashion what cried lisbeth with a dubious smile you cant be moral and improving and sanctimonious even now think what an eloquent lecture you might read me i have sometimes thought i was merely created to point a moral or adorn a tale see how reckless i am after all you ought to be down on me georgie it is your duty as a well trained young woman of the period then said georgie i cant do my duty you are so different from other people how can i pretend to understand what has made you do things that other people are not tempted to do and then you know how fond i am of you lisbeth you are a good pure little soul cried lisbeth her pale face flushing excitedly and the world is a thousand times better for your being in it i am better myself and heaven knows i need something to make me better here let me take hold of your hand and let us go home and as they turned homeward on the beach hand in hand like a couple of children georgie saw that there were tears in the inconsistent creatures eyes again they did not say much upon the subject after this that wise young woman miss esmond felt that it was a subject of far too delicate a nature to be lightly touched upon it had been lisbeths secret so long that even after this confidence she could not help regarding it as lisbeths secret still perhaps she felt in private that there were certain little confidences of her own which she would scarcely be willing even for lisbeth to refer to as if they were her own property for instance that accidental confession made in the bedroom on the first night they had spent in it together how glad she had been that lisbeth had let it pass as if she had not noticed it very particularly but though the subject was not discussed is it to be supposed that it was not brought to mind at all but was buried in oblivion certainly not while that terse young woman miss esmond said little she thought much and deeply she had constantly before her a problem which she was very anxious to work out was it not possible that these two interesting beings might be brought to might be induced to well not to put too fine a point upon it to think better of each other and the unfortunate past and the world generally would it not be dreadful to think that so much poetic material had been lost that these two who might have been so happy should drift entirely apart and leave their romance incomplete as the most unsatisfactory of novels probably having sensibly even if with a little pang given up that bud of a romance of her own the girl felt the need of some loving plot to occupy her mind and if so it was quite natural and very charming that she should turn to her friend hector would make his appearance one of these fine days and then perhaps penyllan and its old familiar scenes would soften his heart as she had an idea they had softened lisbeths surely old memories would touch him tenderly and make him more ready to forgive his injuries in fact miss georgie painted for herself some very pretty mental pictures in which the figures of lisbeth and her ex lover were always the prominent features lisbeth in the trysting place the sea breeze blowing her beautiful hair about and coloring her pale face that queer mist of tears in her mysterious eyes lisbeth in one of her soft moods making those strange restive unexpected speeches which were so fascinating because so unlookedfor and hector anstruthers standing by and listening such interesting little scenes as these she imagined and having imagined them positively drew some consolation from their phantom existence chapter xii a visitor in the meantime however she made herself very agreeable and attractive to her hostesses and enjoyed penyllan very much in a girlish way she explored the tiny village and the rude shore she made friends with fishermen and their wives and sturdy children she won admiration on every side by her pretty interest in everything appertaining to the penyllanites she took long walks on the sands and brought home shells and sea weed and pebbles with such honest delight in any trifling rarity as made lisbeth look on and feel restless and the misses tregarthyn grow young again unitedly i wish my dear said miss clarissa to lisbeth that you enjoyed yourself as much but but i am afraid you do not i am afraid you find penyllan rather dull i never found penyllan so pleasant in my life before but you know i am not like georgie said lisbeth penyllan is all right aunt clarissa and i enjoy myself here more than i should anywhere else i am glad to hear you say that my love miss clarissa faltered sometimes do you know i have really fancied that you were not quite quite happy lisbeth got up from her chair and came to the window her incomprehensible eyes reaching far out to sea happy she echoed absently is anybody happy what a conundrum to answer as for me i give it up she gave up a good many things during these weeks at penyllan she was wont to be fond of a certain cool class of metaphysics but somehow things of that order seemed to slip from her grasp she was not so sure of her self as she had been not so obstinately complacent indeed she had never been so ill satisfied and out of patience with lisbeth crespigny in her life in the course of a week or so hector anstruthers came as he had promised one quiet afternoon miss millicent who was sitting at the window looked out into the garden with a sudden expression of surprise sister clarissa she exclaimed miss esmond there is a gentleman coming up the walk a young gentleman and really a very handsome one do either of you know him dear me his face seems very familiar it cant be georgie ran to the window and the next minute was waving her kind little hand to the individual in question and smiling and nodding her head you ought to know him miss tregarthyn she said it is mr hector anstruthers oh broke forth miss clarissa in some distress and lisbeth is here i do hope sister millicent he saw lisbeth very often when she was at home explained georgie feeling very guilty and extremely fearful of committing herself i know lisbeth did not like him very well at first but he was one of mrs despards favorites and he is a sort of cousin of mine it was a great relief to the misses tregarthyn this piece of news they remembered various unpleasant little episodes of the past too well to have confronted serenely the re responsibility of bringing their dear lisbeth face to face with this young man again indeed miss millicent had turned pale and miss clarissa had lost her breath at the mere thought of it they had hardly recovered themselves when the visitor was handed into the room but of course what miss esmond said must be correct and under such circumstances how delightful it would be to welcome this genius and hero to penyllan once more they had heard wondrous reports of his career from chance visitors even though the beloved lisbeth had been so reticent they had heard of his good fortune his good looks his talent his popularity and remembering the fair haired blue eyed young fellow whom lisbeth had snubbed so persistently they had wondered among themselves if all they heard could possibly be true but here was the admirable crichton to speak for himself and so changed was his appearance so imposing his air so amiable his condescension that each gentle spinster owned in secret that really after all it seemed probable that rumor for once had not exaggerated and it is not to be denied that mr hector anstruthers was shown to an advantage upon this occasion on his way from the small bandbox of a station he had been reminded of many a little incident in that far distant past which had somehow or other warmed his heart toward these good simple souls they had been true and kind at least they had never failed him from first to last they had pitied and tried to comfort him when his fools paradise had been so rudely broken into he remembered how miss clarissa had stolen down into the garden that last bitter night and finding him lying full length face downward upon the dewy grass among the roses had bent over him and put her timid hand upon his shoulder and cried silently as she tried to find words with which she could console him and still be loyal to her faithful affection for that wretched girl he remembered too how fiercely he had answered her like a passionate young cub as he was telling her to leave him alone and let him fight it out with himself and the devil for he had had enough of women she had not been offended good little miss clarissa though she had been dreadfully shocked and troubled she had cried more than ever and patted his sleeve and begged him to think of his dear mother and forgive forgive ending by sobbing into her dainty handkerchief so when he entered the pretty parlor and saw this kind friend standing near georgie a trifle tremulous and agitated at the sudden sight of him everything but his memory of what a true generous little soul she was slipped out of his mind and he actually blushed with pleasure my dear miss clarissa he said and with a sudden frank boyishness such as georgie had never seen him give way to before he put one strong young arm about her and kissed her withered cheek twice my dear boy said miss clarissa a moment before she had been on the verge of making him her best bow and calling him mr anstruthers how pleasant it is to see you how pleasant it is the brightest of sweet smiles dimpled miss georgies mouth how good and honest and unaffected he was after all how kind at heart how she wished that lisbeth could have seen him just then indeed she found it necessary to hold herself very bravely in check for a moment or so for fear she should be tempted to give way to any weak impulse of feeling he seemed so worthy to be admired and loved but lisbeth was not in the house no one knew where she was exactly lately she had indulged in the habit of taking even longer walks than georgies and often lonely ones sometimes in the morning or afternoon they would miss her for an hour or so and she would come back rather fagged and well blown about and at such times it always appeared that she had been for a walk for the good of my health she once said to georgie i find it benefits me physically and morally penyllan is a queer place and is productive of queer effects upon people among other things georgie discovered that she too sometimes talked to the children who played upon the sands and that she had her favorites to whom she had once or twice even condescended to tell certain tales of fairies and mermaids when georgie mentioned this discovery she laughed and colored as if half ashamed of herself and explained the matter in her usual style the fact is she said i do it as a sort of penance when i was a girl and lived here the children were afraid of me and it was no wonder i used to concoct horrible eerie tales about the devil fish to frighten them and i rather enjoyed my reputation as a sort of hobgoblin creature who had an uncanny knowledge of the terrors of the sea some of them used to delight me by screaming and running away when they caught sight of me and now i have arrived at years of discretion i feel as if i ought to do something to retrieve myself with this second generation poor little imps their lives are not too easy she was away indulging in one of these walks this afternoon we could find her somewhere on the shore i know said georgie in answer to miss tregarthyns inquiry she is fond of the shore and always goes there for her strolls if hector is equal to a sea breeze and a mile or so of sand after his journey he might even go in search of her and it having been proved satisfactorily that hector was not only equal to such exertion but anxious to enjoy it after an hours chat with miss millicent and miss clarissa and miss hetty georgie ran up stairs for her hat and returning to the parlor took charge of the expedition it really seemed one of the peculiarities of penyllan to be on its good behavior at opportune times it is bluer than ever to day said georgie nodding at her friend the sea as they strolled toward it and the crests of the little waves are whiter and the sea gulls are in a better temper than they usually are and more satisfied with their lot she had never looked brighter or more attractive herself and this was her companions mental comment the many resplendent young swains who admired miss georgie esmond as she appeared in london ball rooms would surely have become more hopelessly enamored than ever had they seen her with the penyllan roses on her cheeks and the sparkle of the sun lit sea in her eyes where is there another creature like her said hector anstruthers to himself where is there another creature as fresh as good as natural and unspotted chapter xiii a ghost he had thought of her very often of late and indeed had been quite eager to make his visit to penyllan for no other reason he told himself than because he should see her there and hear her sweet young voice again and now he had come and she had welcomed him and they were walking over the sands side by side and yet and yet was it possible that he felt restless and dissatisfied with his own emotions was it possible that the rapture he had tried to imagine in london was not so rapturous here in penyllan could it be that after all he was still only admiring her affectionately in a brotherly way as he had always done admiring and reverencing her gently as the dearest prettiest truest girl he had ever known long ago when at the time of that old folly he remembered a certain tremulous bliss he had experienced when he had been permitted to spend an hour with the beloved object he remembered the absolute pangs of joy with which one glance from certain great cruel dark eyes had filled him he remembered how the sound of a girlish voice had possessed the power to set every drop of blood in his veins beating he was as calm as ever he had been in his life as he strolled on with georgie esmond he could meet her bright eyes without even the poor mockery of a tremor he had felt nothing but calm pleasure even when he grasped her soft hand in greeting would it always be thus was it best that it should be so perhaps and yet in the depths of his heart lay a strange yearning for just one touch of the old delirium just one pang of the old bitter sweet pain there exclaimed georgie ending his reverie for him there she is standing on the rocks dont you see that dark blue ribbon fluttering it was curious enough that his heart should give such a startled bound when his eyes fell upon the place to which georgie directed his attention but then again perhaps it was no wonder considering how familiar the scene before him was years ago he had been wont to come to this very spot and find a slight figure standing in that very nook of rocks a slight girls figure clad in a close fitting suit of sailor blue a cloud of blown about hair falling to the waist and dark blue ribbons fluttering from a rough and ready little sailor hat of straw and there was the very figure and the very accompaniments the dress the abundant tossed about hair the fluttering ribbon the sea the sky the shore he was so silent for a moment that georgie spoke to him again after a quick glance at his changed expression dont you see that it is lisbeth she said laughing she is very quiet but she is alive nevertheless we shall reach her in a minute she is watching the gulls i think i thought we should find her here this is our favorite resting place lisbeth was evidently either watching something or in a very thoughtful mood she did not move or even appear to be conscious of any approaching presence until georgie called to her lisbeth lisbeth and then she looked round with a start what she said is it you two how you startled me you came like ghosts and mr anstruthers glancing at hector looks like one he is so pale i have seen a ghost was his reply i am glad to hear it said lisbeth coolly ghosts make a place interesting she is so like herself so self possessed and wholly lisbeth like that she wakens him completely from the sort of stupor into which he had for a moment fallen she holds out her hand for him to shake and favors him with an unmoved not too enthusiastic smile she is polite and reasonably hospitable in her greeting but she does not seem to be overwhelmed with the power of her emotions sit down she says and let us rest a while we have plenty of time to reach home before dinner and if we hadnt it would not matter much my aunts are used to being kept waiting they are too amiable to be iron hearted about rules so they sit down and then despite the reality of her manner anstruthers finds himself in a dream again as lisbeth talks her voice carries him back to the past unconsciously she has fallen into an attitude which is as familiar as all the rest her hands folded on her knees her face turned seaward the scent of the sea is in the air the sound of its murmurs in his ears the color on the usually clear pale cheek is the color he used to admire with such lover like extravagance a pure pink tint bright and rare she seems to have gone back to her seventeen years and he has gone back with her when at last they rise to return he is wandering in this dream still and he is very silent as they walk home as they enter the garden gate they see miss clarissa standing at the window watching for them just as she had used to do to lisbeths frequent irritation in the olden days and lisbeth pausing at the gate gathered a large red rose the roses are in bloom she says just as they were when i went away with mrs despard i could almost persuade myself that i had never been away at all that velvet leaved red rose was placed carelessly in her hair when she came down stairs after dressing for dinner and its heavy fragrance floated about her she wore one of her prettiest dresses looked her best and was in a good humor and accordingly the misses tregarthyn were restored to perfect peace of mind and rendered happy it was plain they thought that miss esmond had been right and there was no need for fear how the spinster trio enjoyed themselves that evening to be sure you used to sing some very pretty songs for us my love said miss clarissa i wonder if you remember the one hector was so fond of something very sweet about drinking to somebody with your eyes and he would not ask for wine i really forget the rest lisbeth who was turning over a pile of her old music looked up at anstruthers with a civil wicked smile did i sing drink to me only she said and was it a favorite of yours i wonder if it is here how nice that aunt clarissa should remind us of it she drew out the yellow old sheet from under the rest of the music in a minute more her smile not without a touch of venomous amusement how she had loathed it a few years ago i wonder if i could sing it she said and prompted by some daring demon she sat down at the piano and sang it from beginning to end but by the time she had struck the last chord her mood changed she got up with a little frown and she did not look at anstruthers at all bah she said what nonsense it is and she pushed the poor old faded sheet impatiently aside anstruthers moved a step forward and laid his hand upon it will you give it to me he asked with a suppressed force in his manner quite new why she demanded indifferently for a whims sake he answered there is no accounting for tastes perhaps i may fancy that i should like to learn it she raised her eyebrows and gave her shoulders a puzzled little shrug you are welcome to it she commented it is not an article of value thanks rather sardonically and he folded the sheet and slipped it into his pocket their life at penyllan was scarcely exciting but notwithstanding this they found it by no means unenjoyable even now when the first week or so had accustomed them to it they took long stretches of walks they sunned themselves on the sands they sailed and rowed and read and studied each other in secret georgie who studied lisbeth and anstruthers by turns found that she made more progress with the latter than the former lisbeth never easy to read was even more incomprehensible than usual she shared all their amusements and was prolific in plans to add to them but her manner toward her ex adorer was merely reasonably civil and hospitable and certainly did not encourage comment to her friend it was a manner simply inscrutable can she care at all wondered georgie she does not look as if she had ever been sorry in her life and yet she cried that day with anstruthers it was different he could not pursue the even tenor of his way without feeling sometimes a sting at first he controlled himself pretty well and held his own against circumstances even almost calmly then the stings came only at rare intervals but afterward he experienced them more frequently he was not so callous after all and he found it more difficult to conceal his restlessness when some old memory rushed upon him with sudden force such memories began to bring bitter rebellious moods with them and once or twice such moods revealed themselves in bitter speeches sometimes he was silent and half gloomy sometimes recklessly gay but at all times he held to georgie as his safeguard whatever his mood might be he drew comfort from her presence she gave him a sense of security that kind little hand of hers held him back from many an indiscretion surely the day was drawing near when he could open his heart to her and ask her to let the kind young hand be his safeguard forever he was sorely tempted many a day but somehow it always ended in not yet not quite yet but his tender admiration for her showed itself so undisguisedly in every action that the misses tregarthyn looked on delighted i am sure that there is an understanding between them observed miss millicent miss hetty shook her head in a comfortable approving fashion ah yes indeed she said one can easily see that what do you think my dear this was to lisbeth who was sitting reading lisbeth shut her book suddenly and getting up came to the window what is it you are saying she demanded in the manner of one who had just awakened from a sleep or a drowsy reverie i dont think i heard you we were speaking said miss millicent of our young friends in the garden sister hetty thinks with me that hector is very fond of miss esmond chapter xiv it might have been very sweet lisbeth looked out into the garden where the two stood together georgie blushing and smiling as fresh and flower like herself as any of miss clarissas many blossoms hector talking to her eagerly his eyes full of pleasure in her beauty and youth fond of her she said abstractedly who is not fond of her but suggested miss hetty we mean fond of her in in a different way she had laid her hand on lisbeths shoulder and as she spoke she thought she felt a slight start but the girls voice was steady enough when she spoke the next minute oh she said laughing a little you mean that he is in love with her i have no doubt you are right though though i had scarcely thought of that men are always in love with somebody and if he is in love with georgie it does him great credit i did not think he had the good taste but the fact was that the idea was something like a new light dawning upon her actually she had been so blind as not to think of this and it had been before her eyes day after day you have been an idiot was her unceremonious mental comment upon her own stupidity you have thought so much of yourself that you have seen nothing it is hector anstruthers who has touched her heart she doubted either herself or him when she was not so happy and this is the end of it the end of it good perhaps she was relieved and felt more comfortable for she had never been more amusing and full of spirit than she had appeared when she joined the couple in the garden the twilight had been falling when she left the house and when the soft dusk came on they still loitered in the garden the air was warm and balmy miss clarissas flower beds breathed forth perfume the murmur of the waves upon the beach crept up to them the moon rose in the sky solemn watchful and silver clear who would care to go back to earth and parlors said georgie this is arcadia silent odorous and sweet let us stay lisbeth so they sauntered here and there until they were tired and then they found a resting place under a laburnum tree and anstruthers flinging himself upon the grass lay at full length his hands clasped under his head watching lisbeth in newly stirred bitterness and discontent discontent ah what discontent it was what bitterness to night it reached its climax was he a man indeed or had he gone back to boyhood and to that old folly upon which his youth had been wrecked moonlight was very becoming to lisbeth it gave her colorless face the white of a lily leaf and her great eyes a new depth and shadow she looked her best just now as she had a habit of looking her best at all inopportune and dangerous times georgie leaning in a luxury of quiet dreaming against the trunk of the laburnum broke in upon his mental plaints by speaking to her friend sing lisbeth she said you look as if you were in a singing mood lisbeth smiled a faint smile not unlike moonlight she was in a singing mood but she was in a fantastic half melancholy mood too perhaps this was why she chose a rather melancholy song she folded her hands upon her knees in that favorite fashion of hers the fashion anstruthers remembered so well and began all that i had to give i gave good by yet love lies silent in the grave and that i lose which most i crave good by good by good by nay turn your burning eyes away good by it comes to this this bitter day that you and i can only say good by good by good by the rest lies buried with the past good by the golden days that sped so fast the golden days too bright to last good by good by good by the fairest rose blooms but a day good by the fairest spring must end with may and you and i can only say good by good by good by ah lisbeth cried georgie when she stopped what a sad thing i never heard you sing it before no answered lisbeth i dont think anybody ever heard me sing it before it is an imitation of a little german song i have heard or read somewhere i cant remember where indeed i can remember nothing but that the refrain of good by haunted me and the words i have just sung grew out of it anstruthers said nothing he had watched her face as she sung and had almost lost control over himself as he was often on the verge of doing lately what a consummate actress the girl was the mournful little song had fallen from lips as sweetly and sadly as if both words and music welled from a tender tried soft heart an innocent girl of sixteen might have sung just such a song in just such a voice if she had lost her lover once he had been amazed by the fancy that the large mellow dark eyes were full of tears he had been quiet enough before but after the song was ended he did not utter a word but lay silent upon the grass until their return to the house georgie rose first and then lisbeth and himself but georgie going on before them left them a moment together and as they crossed the lawn lisbeth paused and bending over a bed of lilies to gather a closed white bud sang in a low tone as if unconsciously the last verse the fairest rose blooms but a day good by the fairest spring must end with may and you and i can only say good by good by good by when she stood upright she found herself confronting a face so pale and agitated that she drew back a little i wish to god he broke out i wish to god that you were a better woman she looked up at him for a second with a smile cold and strange and bitter i wish to god i was she said and without another word turned from him and walked away flinging her closed lilies upon the dewy grass when the next day at noon they strolled out upon the lawn the lilies were lying there their waxen petals browning and withering in the hot sun georgie stooped and picked one up what a pity she said they would have been so pretty to day i wonder who gathered them lisbeth regarded the poor little brown bud with a queer smile i gathered them she said it does seem a pity too almost cruel doesnt it but that is always the way with people they gather their buds first and sympathize with them afterward then she held out her hand give it to me she said and when georgie handed the wilted thing to her she took it still half smiling in that queer way yes she commented it might have been very sweet to day it was useless cruelty to kill it so early it will never be a flower now you see georgie my dear dryly how i pity my bud afterward draw a moral from me and never gather your flowers too soon they might be very sweet to morrow she had not often talked in this light satirical way of late but georgie observed that she began to fall into the habit again after this she had odd moods and was not quite so frank as her young admirer liked to see her and something else struck georgie as peculiar too she found herself left alone with hector much oftener in their walks and sails and saunterings in the garden lisbeths joining them became the exception instead of the rule as it had been heretofore it seemed always by chance that she failed to accompany them but it came to the same thing in the end georgie pondered over the matter in private with much anxiety she really began to feel as if something strange had happened had there been a new quarrel hector was more fitful and moody than ever sometimes he looked so miserable and pale that she was a little frightened when he talked he was bitter and when he was silent his silence was tragical but he was as fond of her as ever he had been nay he even seemed fonder of her and more anxious to be near her at all times i am not a very amusing companion georgie my dear he would say but you will bear with me i know you are my hope and safeguard georgie if you would not bear with me who would she often wondered at his way of speaking of her as his safeguard indeed he not only called her his safeguard but showed by his manner that he flew to her as a sort of refuge once when they had been sitting together in silence for some time he suddenly seized her hand and kissed it passionately and desperately georgie he said if i were to come to you some day and ask you to save me from a great danger would you try to do as i asked you she did not draw her hand away but let it rest in his as she answered him with a quiet half sad smile i would not refuse to try to help any one in the world who was in danger even a person i was not fond of she said and you know we have been friends all our lives hector but if i were to ask a great gift of you he persisted a great gift of which i was not worthy but which was the only thing that could save me from ruin you must ask me first she said and then though it was done very gently she did take her hand away chapter xv we wont go yet having coolly laid her plans for leaving the two to enjoy themselves lisbeth retired upon her laurels with the intention of finding amusements of her own she had entertained herself before easily enough why not again naturally as they had fallen in love with each other they would not want her even georgie would not want her and it was quite natural that they should have fallen in love they were the sort of people to do it and georgie would make a charming wife and if her husband proved a tyrant would still go down upon her knees and adore him and thank heaven for her princes affection and his perfections to the end of her innocent days as for herself it was no business of hers when she had done her duty toward her friend the best thing she could do would be to leave them alone and she left them alone and gave them every opportunity to be lover like if they had chosen but one day miss clarissa looking up from her sewing started quite nervously at the sudden impression made upon her of something new in her dear lisbeths appearance my dear lisbeth she exclaimed how pale and ill you look i am always pale said lisbeth but my love protested miss clarissa you are pale to day in a different way you must be suffering dear dear how careless in us not to have remarked it before i almost believe nay indeed i am sure that you look thin actually thin i am always thin said lisbeth but miss clarissa was not to be consoled by any such coolness of manner when she looked again more closely she was quite sure that she was right that her dear lisbeth showed unmistakable signs of being in a dreadful state of health she fell into a positive condition of tremor and remorse she had been neglected they had been heartlessly careless not to see before that she was not strong it must be attended to at once and really if lisbeth had not been very decided it is not at all unlikely that she would have been put to bed and dosed and wept over by all three spinsters at once i hope it is not that penyllan does not agree with you faltered miss hetty we always thought the air very fresh and bracing but you certainly do not look like yourself lisbeth and the truth was that she did not look like herself much as she might protest against the assertion she was thinner and paler than usual i am not ill she said whether i look ill or not i never was better in my life i have not slept very well of late that is all and i must beg you to let me have my own way about it aunt clarissa it is all nonsense dont fuss over me i implore you you will spoil georgies love story for her and make mr anstruthers uncomfortable men hate fuss of any kind leave me alone when they are in the house and i will take all the medicine you choose to give me in private though it is all nonsense i assure you but was it nonsense alas i must confess though it is with extreme reluctance that the time came when the invincible was beaten and felt that she was it was not nonsense one afternoon after sitting at her bedroom window for an hour persuading herself that she was reading while georgie and anstruthers enjoyed a tte tte in the garden below she suddenly closed her book and rising from her chair began to dress to go out she was down stairs and out upon the beach in five minutes and once away from the house she began to walk furiously she looked neither to right nor left as she went she was not in the humor to have her attention distracted from her thoughts by any beauty of sea or sky or shore she saw the yellow sand before her and that was all she reached the old trysting place among the rocks before she stopped once there she gave herself time to breathe and standing still looked back at the ground over which she had come there was a worn out expression in her face such as the misses tregarthyn had never yet seen even when they thought her at her worst and yet in a minute more she smiled with actual grimness i am being punished now she said aloud i am being punished now for everything i have ever done in my life now i begin to understand there was humiliation enough in her soul then to have made her grovel in the sand at her feet if she had been prone to heroics or drama yes she was beginning to understand it was her turn now oh to have come to this to have learned this it was characteristic of her nature an unfortunate nature at this time passing through a new experience and battling fiercely against it that when immediately afterward the tears began to fill her eyes and roll down her cheeks they were the bitter bitter tears of passionate mortification and anger she could almost have killed herself for very self contempt and shame what reason is there in it she said none what has brought me to it nothing is he as worthy now as he was then no isnt it sheer madness yes it is she spoke truly too there was no reason in it it was madness he had done nothing to touch her heart had made no effort to reach it and yet he had reached and touched it it would not have been like her to love a man because he was good because he had made love to her indeed because of anything her actions were generally without any cause but her own peremptory fancies and here some strange sudden caprice of emotion had been too much for her how she had suffered since she discovered her weakness no one but herself would ever know she had writhed under it burned under it loathed it and yet been conquered by it almost every blade of penyllan grass reminded her of some wrong she had done to the kindly impetuous young fellow who had loved her in the past almost every grain of penyllan sand taunted her with some wanton selfishness or cruelty which must be remembered by the man who could have nothing but dislike for her in the present i should be grateful now she cried bitterly yes grateful for a tithe of what i once had under foot this is eating dirt with a vengeance she might well frighten miss clarissa with her pallor and wretched looks the intensity of her misery and humiliation was wearing her out and robbing her of sleep and appetite she wanted to leave penyllan but how could she suggest it georgie was so happy she told herself with a vindictive pleasure in her pain that it would be a pity to disturb her she walked up and down the beach for half an hour before she returned home and when she went her way she was so tired as to be fairly exhausted at the side door by which she entered the house she met georgie who held an open letter in her hand whom from asked lisbeth for lack of something to say mamma was the girls answer she wonders when we are going home but i am enjoying penyllan so much she paused and blushed just lately it had occurred to her that it might be possible that lisbeth misunderstood her relation to hector and something in lisbeths face made her stop and blush in this opportune manner the weather is so lovely she ended that i dont think i want to go yet lisbeth smiled but her smile was an abstracted sort of affair no she said we wont go yet penyllan is doing both of us good and it is doing mr anstruthers good too we wont go yet tell mrs esmond so georgie and then she carried her absent smile up stairs chapter xvi yes to lisbeth georgie stood still and looked after her she blushed more deeply than ever a queer distress and discomfort came upon her and filled her mind she had only wondered before if it was possible that lisbeth did not know did not wholly understand but now the truth revealed itself in an uncomfortable flash of recognition oh she exclaimed under her breath she does not see she thinks i am sure she thinks but she did not put the rest into words penyllan and the lovely weather quite lost their charm for the moment as she walked slowly down the hall toward the parlor holding her mothers letter in her hand she would almost have been glad to run away she remembered so many little peculiarities she had noticed in lisbeths manner of late she had managed to leave her alone with hector so often she had taken so many of those long walks by herself she had not looked well she had sometimes been abstracted and restless the girls heart quite fluttered at the thought which all these things forced upon her she was afraid to indulge in such a fancy that day when her confession had been made upon the beach lisbeth had confessed that she was sorry for her past cruelty could it be that her remorse had developed into a stronger feeling could it be that she was more than sorry now that she was beginning to value the love she had thrown away even to long for it as i have said the thought frightened georgie a little she had seen so much to admire in hector anstruthers that she had often wondered innocently how it was possible that lisbeth could have resisted his numerous charms and perfections how indeed could any woman whom he loved be so hard to please as not to appreciate him she herself had appreciated him she told herself blushing even though he had not loved her at all as he had loved lisbeth and yet she felt now as if it would be almost dreadful to think that lisbeth cool self controlled lisbeth had given way in spite of her coolness and self control and then if this was the true state of affairs how much more dreadful it became to feel that she was misunderstood that lisbeth saw in her a rival something must be done it was plain but it was a difficult matter to decide what the something should be ah if it had only been a matter she could have talked over with mamma who knew everything and could always advise her but it was lisbeths secret lisbeths and hectors and so she must be loyal to her trust she was quite sad in the midst of her labyrinth all the afternoon so sad that when anstruthers came in from the village to partake of miss clarissas tea he marked the change in her at once but he was in a gloomy mood himself so it is not to be wondered at that the small party around the table was not nearly so gay as usual lisbeth had a headache her eyes were heavy and she said but little and disappeared as soon as the meal was at an end georgie would have followed her at once but in the hall hector stopped her come into the garden georgie he said i have something to say to you very well said georgie as soon as i have asked lisbeth to come too but he returned i do not want lisbeth what i have to say i must say to you not lisbeth georgie had been standing with one foot on the lowest stair and her hand on the balustrades but a tone in his voice made her turn round and look up questioningly he was pale and haggard she saw in an instant that he was not quite himself a little pain shot through her tender heart how unhappy he looked you are very pale hector she said pityingly he tried to smile but it was a constrained effort i suppose i am nervous he answered be good to me georgie my dear and he held out his hand to her come he said lisbeth does not care for our society much she always avoids us when she can georgies face fell had he seen it too then surely it must be true that lisbeth did avoid them she was so full of her trouble about lisbeth that it scarcely occurred to her mind that he had made a very simple request in an unusual way she did not even ask herself what he could be going to say that he would not say before lisbeth but she became more conscious of the strangeness of his mood every moment he hardly spoke half a dozen more words until they reached their usual seat under the laburnum there when she sat down he flung himself upon the grass at her side in his favorite unceremonious fashion but for a minute or so he did not even look at her she had never thought him boyish before but just then the thought entered her mind that he was very boyish indeed and she began to pity and wonder at him more and more suddenly he turned toward her and spoke georgie my dear he said his voice quite trembling i am going to ask you for that great gift of which i am so unworthy what need that he should say another word she knew quite well then what he meant and why it was that he had not wanted lisbeth and ready as she usually was with her blushes she did not blush at all she even lost all her bright color at once and confronted him with a face quite pale and altered you may go on hector she said i will listen so he broke out hurriedly and desperately and poured forth his appeal i dont know how i dare ask so much he said i dont know how i dare speak at all you do not understand what my life has been god forbid that you should but what is left of it is not worthy of you georgie the sweetest purest woman that god ever made and yet i think it is because i honor you so much that i dare to throw myself on your mercy i want to be a better man my dear and and will you help me you see what i am asking you for georgie and he bent his pale face over her hand kissing it as some sad penitent might kiss a saints a strange love making indeed the girl gave a little sob yes actually a little sob but she let him hold her hand just as she had let him hold it that day before she had put her budding love aside and outlived it bravely but there was a pang in this nevertheless and she could not help but feel it it would be over in a moment but it stung sharply for the instant yes hector i see she answered almost directly you are asking me if i will marry you yes my dear and he kissed her hand again then there was a silence for a little while and he waited wondering and feeling god knows what strange hope or fear at heart at length however another fair small hand was laid softly on his causing him to glance up questioningly is that the answer he ventured with a new throb of the heart but she shook her head smiling a sweet half sad smile it is not that answer she said but it is an answer in its way it means that i am going to speak to you from my heart i think you always do that he said unsteadily yes always but now more than ever i must be very true to you indeed to day because because you have made a mistake hector a mistake then it is not the first but what a craven he felt at soul how hard it was to meet her clear bright eyes you have made a mistake she went on oh if i was not true to you and to myself as well your whole life might be a mistake from this hour and everything might go wrong you fancy that because you can admire and trust me that you could learn to love me too in that best way as you do not now when i was your wife but you could not however hard you might try and however hard i might try too you could not you could only teach yourself a poor imitation of that best way and you would be unsatisfied at heart hector and so should i husbands and wives ought to have that best kind of love and nothing else because nothing else will fill its place the place in their hearts that god made to be filled by it because you are honest and true to me with a warm grasp of the small hand though warm tears were in her eyes you do not say that you have that kind of love to offer me and i know you have not i think that perhaps you could not give it to me even if dont be angry hector because i could not help seeing it you had not given it almost in spite of yourself to some one else to some one else he exclaimed yes she said sorrowfully to lisbeth he drew his hands away and covered his face with them with something like a groan of despair i am answered he said dont say anything more georgie that is enough dont misunderstand me cried the girl you could not help it how could you the old love never died out really and now when you see her so much better and more beautiful how could it be otherwise than that it should spring into new life and be stronger than ever it is lisbeth you love hector and she is worthy of your love of anybodys love if you would only understand her rightly is it pride that holds you back from showing your heart to her or is it because even though you love her you have not forgiven her for your old misery tell me do i love her he asked or hate her you love her answered georgie and yet he said gloomily i have asked you to marry me and you have answered me as gently as an angel might have done it was only that you made a mistake said the girl a mistake he echoed ay it was a mistake and as i said it is not the first i have made my life has been full of blunders oh said georgie how i wish i was wise enough to know how to set them right if you would only trust me and let me try he gave her a mournful smile i thought there was a way he said but you did not agree with me i knew better shaking her head and coloring and perhaps i was too proud and jealous i am not so good as you think me i am very fond of you but not fond enough to take your half loaf let us forget it altogether chapter xvii good by surely so serious a question was never so dismissed in so short a time for these few busy moments the matter was as completely disposed of as if they had spent hours in arguing it he scarcely knew how it was that he felt so sure that he need say no more that the brave simple pretty georgie had set his poor weak plans aside so easily and yet so tenderly much as he admired and reverenced her there was a depth in her girlish nature which he had never sounded it was all over for him with georgie esmond though he need not fear that her friendship would ever waver if i was only wise enough to help you she repeated if you would only trust me and let me try if any one could help me you could he said but there is no help for me he had never once admitted to himself that this miserable passion could ever make him happy it had never occurred to his mind that its termination would be anything but a wretched and humiliating one as georgie had suggested he loved but had not forgiven and he told himself that his love was degraded infatuation what was there to tie to in such a feeling did he trust the woman to whom he was in secret a slave no he trusted her no more to day than he had done before but she had a hold upon his heart strings nevertheless the old witchery was exercising its full power upon him it had been so strong at last that he had been maddened into making this cowards effort to free himself if georgie would stretch out her hand she might save him a fatal weakness and so even while he despised himself for his selfish folly he had resolved to throw himself upon georgies mercy and here was the end of it georgie was wiser than himself clearer of sight truer of soul stronger with a brave simplicity and she had proved to him what a shameful folly it was georgie would have none of him and yet how sweet she was god bless her i shall leave penyllan in the morning he said there is nothing to keep me here now since you do not want me say that you forgive me georgie and we will bid each other good by for the present you must not think that i have anything to forgive she answered but i do not say that you will be wrong in going i believe it will be best you do not quite understand yourself yet go away and give yourself time to find out whether you can conquer your heart or not the time will come when you will know and then somewhat bitterly something will happen i think her simple faith in the kindness of fortune asserting itself i cannot believe that you will always be as unhappy as you are now one of you will be sure to do or say something that will help the other a sudden color leaped to his face her words held a suggestion of which he had never once thought and which set his pulses beating hard and fast what he exclaimed his new feeling giving him no time to check himself you do not think the time will ever come when she when she might feel too i think said the girl in a grave almost reverent voice i think the time has come now when they returned to the house lisbeth seeing them from the parlor window made a mental comment judging from his face she observed i should say that he had asked her to marry him and had been accepted judging from hers i should say her answer had been no you are not easy to read for once georgie what does it mean georgie came into the house with a more composed look than her face had worn for several days she laid her garden hat upon the hall table and walked straight into the parlor to her dear lisbeth she had a very shrewd idea that her dear lisbeth knew nothing of their guests intended departure and she wanted to be the first to break the news to her it would not matter if any little secrets were betrayed to herself so she went to the window and laid her hand on lisbeths shoulder did hector tell you that he was going she asked as if his having done so would have been the most natural thing in the world that he was going repeated lisbeth georgie gazed considerately out into the garden yes back to london you know to morrow i suppose he thinks he has been idle long enough lisbeth shrugged her shoulders rather sudden isnt it she commented i think you have been the first to hear the news gentlemen always do things suddenly remarked georgie astutely she had no need to have been so discreet lisbeth had been very cool under the information an indifferent observer might have easily concluded that she cared very little about it that her interest in hector anstruthers going and coming was an extremely well controlled feeling when he came into the room himself a few minutes later she was quite composed enough to touch upon the subject with polite regrets aunt clarissa will positively mourn she ended with one of her incomprehensible smiles she has been almost radiant during your visit and there her share in the matter seemed to terminate she said nothing when the three old ladies hearing the news poured forth affectionate plaints from the first course at dinner until the last she listened composedly without remark though once or twice she looked at georgie with rather an interested air it was her turn to feel curious now and she was curious enough georgie blushed when she was looked at scrutinizingly but her manner was decidedly not that of a girl who had just accepted a lover and said lisbeth examining her coolly she would not refuse him she must be fond of him and if she is fond of him she is too sweet natured and straightforward to coquet with him and yet well it is decidedly puzzling she found the evening rather a bore upon the whole how was it that it dragged so in spite of her efforts she thought it would never come to an end when with long suffering good nature hector drew out the chess table and challenged the delighted miss clarissa to a game her patience fairly gave way she turned to the piano for refuge and sang song after song until she could sing no more then when georgie took her place she made a furtive exit and slipped out through the hall and a side door into the garden what made her turn her steps toward miss clarissas rose thicket she did not know but she went there there she had bidden her boy lover good by and broken his heart there she had sung her little song to georgie and hector on both occasions it had been warm and balmy and moonlight and now it was warm and balmy and moonlight again she stood and looked through the trees catching silvery glimpses of the sea in a minute or so she moved her hand in an impatient gesture i am sick of it all she cried breaking the silence i am sick of the whole world and of myself more than the rest how i wish i was like aunt clarissa she began to wander about restlessly pulling at the roses with no particular object but because she could not keep still buds and blossoms red and cream and white were torn from their stems ruthlessly until her hands were full and then she stopped again half wondering at herself what am i thinking of she said what do i want them for poor things remembering her parable bitterly they might have been very sweet to morrow she held the cool fresh things close up to her face breathing in their fragrance eagerly and when she took them away their blossoms were bright here and there perhaps with dew certainly with dew if it was dew that wet her fevered cheeks and softened her eyes so strangely scarcely three minutes later she turned with a start and then stood listening some one had left the house and was coming across the lawn toward her she waited a few seconds to make sure that she was not mistaken and then she bent down over a bush and began leisurely to gather more roses though she was overloaded already where is georgie she asked calmly of the intruder when he reached her side georgie returned a rather constrained voice is talking to miss hetty miss clarissa sent me here to remind you that the dew is falling and that you are not strong enough to bear the night air miss clarissa is very good lisbeth answered and so are you but dear miss clarissa has been threatening me with an untimely grave as the result of night air ever since i was six months old so perhaps i am not so grateful as i ought to be i love darkness rather than light upon the whole and dont find that it disagrees with me perhaps because my deeds are evil perhaps dryly for fully two minutes she gathered her flowers in silence while anstruthers waited and looked at her but at last she stood upright and their eyes met it is a beautiful night she remarked sententiously yes we have had a great number of lovely nights lately yes she busied herself with her roses for a little while to the exclusion of everything else and then she gave it up well she said suppose we go into the house i can do nothing with them here the fact is i dont know why i gathered them unless it was from an impulse of destructiveness let us go stop a moment he said nay almost commanded her she paused not seeming in the least disturbed however she would have cut off her right hand almost before she would have exhibited an emotion i had a reason of my own for coming here he went on apart from miss clarissas commands i want to bid you good by you must be going she commented very early in the morning and yet her heart was beating like a trip hammer it is not that was his reply though i am going early i had a whim you remember my whim about the song a fancy that i should like to say my good by here where i said a good by once before it is easily said answered lisbeth and held out one of her hands good by he took it with a pretense at a coolness as masterly as her own but he could not keep it up he gave way to some swift passionate inexplicable prompting and in an instant had covered it with kisses had even fiercely kissed her slender wrist she snatched it from his grasp breathless with anger forgetting her resolve to control herself what do you mean she cried you are mad how dare you he drew back a step confronting her defiantly i do not know what i mean he answered unless as you say i am mad i think i am mad so being a madman i will not ask you to pardon me it was a farewell it is over now however will you let me take your roses and carry them to the house she vouchsafed him no answer but turned away and left him to follow if he chose her helplessness against him drove her fairly wild nothing she could say or do would ever wipe out the memory of those mad kisses he either loved or despised her utterly and remembering his manner toward georgie she could only conclude that he despised her and had offered her a deadly insult the blood shot into her cheeks like a rush of fire and her eyes blazed ominously my dear lisbeth bleated good little miss clarissa the moment she saw her you have caught fresh cold i am convinced you are in a high fever fever indeed she had never been in such a fever in her life but it was a fever of anger and humiliation i think it probable she said seriously that i am going to have measles or scarlatina aunt clarissa which would you prefer georgie came up stairs long after she had shut herself in her room to find her sitting by the open window looking worn out and wretched lisbeth she ventured is it possible that you are going to be ill probably georgie esmond had never been so spoken to in her life as she was when her dear lisbeth turned upon her at this simple remark georgie my dear she said if you ask me such a question again i believe i shall turn you out of the room and lock the door georgie regarded her for a moment in mute amazement but after that she managed to recover herself i i beg pardon lisbeth she faltered and then discreetly turned her attention to the performance of her nightly toilet preparatory to going to bed but in the morning it was lisbeth to whose share the meekness fell her mood had changed altogether and she was so astoundingly humble that georgie was alarmed you have more patience with me than i have with myself georgie she said or i should know it was not worth my while to say a word to you do have pity on me i well i was out of sorts or something and i have such a horrible temper really her demon might have departed from her that night she showed no more temper she became almost as amiable as a more commonplace young woman she made so few caustic speeches that the misses tregarthyn began to fear that her delicate health had affected her usual flow of spirits and accordingly mourned over her in secret not feeling it discreet to do so openly she used to be so spirited sighed miss hetty over her sewing to georgie dont you observe an alteration in her my love sister clarissa and sister millicent and myself really do not know what to think it would be such a comfort to us if she could only be persuaded to see dr puddifoot he is such a dear man and so extremely talented because i have been trying to behave myself decently they think i am ill said lisbeth smiling a little mournfully just think how i must have treated them georgie they are so used to my humors that if i am not making myself actively unpleasant they fancy it is because i have not the strength to do it if i were to snub aunt hetty and snap at aunt clarissa i believe they would shed tears of joy chapter xviii you think i have a secret a week or so after anstruthers departure georgie decided that her visit must come to an end mamma was not so very well and poor papa had a touch of his old enemy the gout and really she had been away from home a long time did not lisbeth think that they had better return to london even though penyllan was still as delightful as ever then they had a surprise indeed lisbeth who had been listening in a rather absent manner aroused herself to astonish them i think she said that if you do not mind making the journey alone georgie i should like to stay in penyllan this winter in penyllan cried georgie all winter lisbeth at penyllan here with us cried miss millicent and miss hetty and miss clarissa in chorus yes answered lisbeth in her most non committal fashion at penyllan aunt hetty here aunt millicent with you aunt clarissa the misses tregarthyn became quite pale they glanced at each other and shook their heads ominously this portended something dreadful indeed my love faltered miss clarissa what interposed lisbeth wont you let me stay are you tired of me i told you that you would be you know before i came oh my dear protested miss clarissa how can you tired of you sister hetty sister millicent tired of her we only thought my love that it would be so dull to one used to to the brilliant vortex of london society ended miss millicent rather grandly but if i think that it will not said lisbeth i am tired of the brilliant vortex of london society she got up from her chair and went and stood by georgie at the window looking out yes she said almost as if speaking to herself i think i should like to stay the end of it was that she did stay she wrote to mrs despard that very day announcing her intention of remaining georgie in packing her trunks actually shed a few silent tears among her ruffs and ribbons to her mind this was a sad termination to her happy visit she knew that it must mean something serious that there must be some powerful motive at the bottom of such a resolution if lisbeth would only not be so reserved if it was only a little easier to understand her we shall miss you very much lisbeth she ventured mournfully not more than i shall miss you answered lisbeth who at the time stood near watching her as she knelt before the box she was packing georgie paused in her task to look up doubtfully then why will you do it she said you you must have a reason yes said lisbeth i have a reason the girls eyes still appealed to her so she went on with a rather melancholy smile i have two reasons perhaps more penyllan agrees with me and i do not want to go back to town yet i am going to take a rest i must need one or aunt clarissa would not find so much fault with my appearance i dont want to go off on my looks before my time and you know they are always telling me i am pale and thin am i pale and thin georgie yes confessed georgie you are and she gave her a troubled look then returned lisbeth there is all the more reason that i should rusticate perhaps by the spring i shall be red and fat like miss rosamond puddifoot with a little laugh and i shall have taken to tracts and soup kitchens and given up the world and wear a yellow bonnet and call london a vortex of sinful pleasure as she does why my dear georgie what is the matter the fact was that a certain incongruity in her beloved lisbeths looks and tone had so frightened georgie and touched her susceptible heart that the tears had rushed to her eyes and she was filled with a dolorous pity you are not you are not happy she cried all at once you are not or you would not speak in that queer satirical way i wish you would be a little a little more kind lisbeth lisbeths look was a positively guilty one kind she exclaimed kind georgie having gone so far georgie could not easily draw back and was fain to go on though she became conscious that she had placed herself in a very trying position it is not kind to keep everything to yourself so closely she said tremulously as if we did not care for you or could not comprehend she stopped because lisbeth frightened her again she became so pale that it was impossible to say anything more her great dark eyes dilated as if with a kind of horror at something you you think i have a secret she interrupted her with a hollow sounding laugh and you are determined to make a heroine out of me instead of allowing me to enjoy my nerves in peace you dont comprehend nerves that is clear you are running at a red rag georgie my dear it is astonishing how prone you good tender hearted people are to run at red rags and toss and worry them it was plain that she would never betray herself she would hold at arms length even the creature who loved her best and was most worthy of her confidence it was useless to try to win her to any revelation of her feelings georgie fell to at her packing again with a very melancholy consciousness of the fact that she had done no good by losing control over her innocent emotions and might have done harm it had pained her inexpressibly to see that quick dread of self betrayal which had announced itself in the sudden loss of color and the odd expression in her friends eyes she does not love me as i love her was her pathetic mental conclusion if she did she would not be so afraid of me when lisbeth bade her good by at the little railway station the girls heart quite failed her what shall i say to mamma and papa she asked tell them that penyllan agrees with me so well that i dont like to leave it for the present was lisbeths answer and tell mrs esmond that i will write to her myself and in timid desperation and hector lisbeth hector rather sharply why hector what has he to do with the matter but stay shrugging her shoulders i suppose it would be only civil tell him tell him that aunt clarissa sends her love and hopes he will take care of his lungs and yet though this irreverent speech was her last and she made it in her most malicious manner the delicate dark face and light small figure had a strangely desolate look to georgie as when the train bore her away she caught her last farewell glimpse of them on the platform of the small station lisbeth stood before her mirror that night slowly brushing up her hair and feeling the silence of the small chamber acutely it would never have done she said to herself it would never have done at all this is the better way better by far but it was hard enough to face and it was fantastic enough to think that she had really determined to face it in a minute or so she sat down with her brush in her hand and her hair loose upon her shoulders to confront the facts once more she was going to spend her winter at penyllan she had given up the flesh pots of egypt she was going to breakfast at eight dine at two when there was no company take five oclock tea and spend the evening with the misses tregarthyn she would stroll in the garden walk on the beach and take miss clarissas medicines meekly at this point a new view of the case presented itself to her and she began to laugh mustard baths and dr puddifoots prescriptions in incongruous connection with her own personal knowledge of things appeared all at once so ludicrous that they got the better of her and she laughed until she found herself crying and then angry as she was at her own weakness the tears got the better of her too for a short time if she had never been emotional before she was emotional enough in these days she could not pride herself upon her immovability now she felt constantly either passionate anger against herself or passionate contempt or a passionate eagerness to retrieve her lost self respect what could she do how could she rescue herself this would not do this would not do she must make some new struggle this sort of thing she was saying feverishly from morning until night secretly she had almost learned to detest penyllan penyllan she told herself had been the cause of all her follies but it was safer at present than london if she stayed at penyllan long enough surely she could wear herself out or rather wear out her fancies a less resolute young woman would in all likelihood have trifled weakly with her danger but it was not so with lisbeth she had not trifled with it from the first she had held herself stubbornly aloof from any little self indulgence and now she was harder upon herself than ever she would have died cheerfully rather than have betrayed herself and if she could die surely she could endure a dull winter her moral condition was so far improved however that she did not visit her small miseries upon her aunts as she would have done in the olden days her behavior was really creditable under the circumstances she played chess with miss clarissa in the evening or read aloud or sung for them and began to take a whimsical pleasure in their delight at her condescension they were so easily delighted that she felt many a sting of shame at her former delinquencies she had an almost morbid longing to be good like georgie and she practiced this being good upon the three spinsters with a persistence at which she herself both laughed and cried when she was alone her first letter to georgie puzzled the girl indescribably and yet touched her somehow she who believed her beloved lisbeth to be perfect among women could not quite understand the psychological crisis through which she was passing and yet could not fail to feel that something unusual was happening i take aunt clarissas medicine with a mild regularity which alarms her the letter announced she thinks i must be going into a consumption and tearfully consults dr puddifoot in private the cook is ordered to prepare particularly nourishing soups for dinner and if my appetite is not something startling everybody turns pale and yet all this does not seem to me as good a joke as it would have done years ago i see another side to it i wonder how it is that they can be so fond of me for my part i am sure i could never have been fond of lisbeth crespigny chapter xix and that was the end of it the roses fell one by one in miss clarissas flower beds and so at last did the palest autumn bloom the leaves dropped from the trees and the winds from the sea began to blow across the sands in chilly gusts but lisbeth stayed bravely on rainy days dragged by wearily enough and cold ones made their appearance but she did not give up even when mrs despard wondered and georgie implored in weekly epistles the winter routine of the tregarthyn household was not exciting but it was a sort of safeguard better dullness than something worse perhaps in time by spring it might be different and yet she could not say that she found her state of mind improving and as to her body well miss clarissa might well sigh over her in secret if she had been pale and thin before she had not gained flesh and color she persisted in her long walks in desperation and came home after them looking haggard and hollow eyed she wandered about the garden in self defense and was no less tired she followed dr puddifoots directions to the letter and to the misses tregarthyns dismay was not improved in fact as that great man dr puddifoot observed something was radically wrong it was an unequal miserable enough struggle but it had its termination and like all such terminations it was an abrupt unexpected almost fantastic one lisbeth had never thought of such an end to her self inflicted penance no such possibility had presented itself to her mind it was not her way to romance and she had confined herself to realities sitting at her bedroom window one chill uncomfortable december day she arrived at a fanciful caprice it was as raw and miserable a day as one would or rather would not wish to see the wind blew over the sea in gusts the gulls flew languidly under the gray sky a few dead leaves swirled about in eddies in the road and yet this caprice took possession of lisbeth as she looked out and appreciated the perfection of desolateness since georgie had left penyllan she had never once been near the old trysting place her walks had always been in the opposite direction and now it suddenly occurred to her that she would like to go and see how things would look in her present mood in five minutes from the time the fancy seized her miss clarissa caught a glimpse of something through the parlor window which made her utter an exclamation lisbeth she said out again and on such a day dear me i do trust she is well wrapped up lisbeth made her way against the damp chill wind with a touch of positively savage pleasure in her own discomfort the sands were wet and unpleasant to walk on and she was not sorry what did it matter she was in the frame of mind to experience a sort of malicious enjoyment of outward miseries the tryst looked melancholy enough when she reached it she made her way to the nook behind the sheltering rocks and stood there looking out to sea she had not expected to find the place wearing its summer aspect but she was scarcely prepared to face such desolateness everything was gray gray tossing sea gray screaming gulls gray lowering sky it would have been better to have stayed at home she said still she could not make up her mind to turn back at once and lingered a little leaning against a rock shivering and feeling dreary and so it was that the man who was approaching first caught sight of her figure lisbeth did not see this man she did not care to see either man or woman at present the gulls suited her better than human beings and she believed herself to be utterly alone until footsteps upon the sand quite near made her turn with an impatient start the man he was not a yard from her side raised his hat and stood still the man was hector anstruthers for a moment neither uttered a word lisbeth thought her heart must have stopped beating she had turned cold as marble when she could control herself sufficiently to think at all she thought of georgie what is the matter she exclaimed is somebody ill georgie georgie is quite well he answered then he came close and held out his hand with a strange melancholy smile i ask pardon for alarming you he said i ask pardon for coming without an excuse but i have no excuse wont you shake hands with me lisbeth she got through the ceremony as quickly as possible and then drew back folding her shawl about her she was shivering with something besides cold if she had only been safe at home if nobody was in danger what on earth had he come for i was a little startled she said penyllan is not very attractive to people as a rule in winter and it seemed the most natural thing that georgie was ill and had sent you to me then after a little pause and a sidelong glance at him you look as if you had been ill yourself he certainly did he was thin and haggard and care worn his eyes were dangerously bright and he had a restless air he was not so sublime a dandy either as he had been there was even a kind of negligence about him aunt clarissa must have been very much alarmed when she saw you lisbeth proceeded trying to get up a creditable smile i have not seen miss clarissa he answered i came here first this was so ominous that lisbeth succumbed she knew when he said this that he did not intend to keep up appearances but she made one more poor effort then perhaps we had better go home she remarked no he returned quickly i have something to say she felt herself losing strength but what did it matter let him say what he would perhaps it was something about georgie she had a dreary feeling that she was ready for anything go on she said oh he cried in bitter impatient resignation of her stoicism arm yourself against me i know you will do that sneer at my folly i am prepared for that too but i shall speak it is fate i am a fool but i must speak was it to say this that you came here interposed lisbeth i came because i could not stay away you are my fate i tell you almost angrily you will not let me rest when i kissed your hands that last night i gave myself up to my madness i had tried to persuade myself that i had no love for you but that cured me and showed me how i had deceived myself i have never ceased to love you from the first and you his words died upon his lips she looked as he had never seen her look before she leaned against the rock as if she needed support suddenly her eyes and lashes were wet and she began to tremble slightly he checked himself full of swift remorse what a rough brute he was dont he said i did not mean to frighten you she lifted her eyes piteously her lips parted as if she was going to speak but she did not speak she was even weaker than she had thought she had never been so helpless and shaken before she shrank from him and drooping her face upon the rock burst into hysterical tears he did not pause to ask himself what it meant he did not understand womens nerves he only comprehended that she had given way that everything was changed that she was unstrung and weeping in a moment he had her in his arms exclaiming passionately lisbeth lisbeth and then the little straw hat with its blue ribbon slipping away from the small pale face that lay upon his breast he bent and covered it this small pale tear wet face with reckless kisses for the moment he did not care what came next nor what doom he brought upon himself he was so mad with long pent up love and misery he found the little hand under the shawl too and fell to kissing that also and would not let it go dont be cruel to me lisbeth he pleaded when she tried to draw it away and she was forced to let it remain dont be cruel to me he said and still held this hand when she released herself at last and stood up miserable and shame faced yet far less miserable than she had been it it is you who are cruel she faltered what am i to say to you you have left me nothing to say she hung back half afraid of
