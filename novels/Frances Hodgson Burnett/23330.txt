one day at arle by frances hodgson burnett copyright one day at arlea tiny scattered fishing hamlet on the northwestern english coastthere stood at the door of one of the cottages near the shore a woman leaning against the lintelpost and looking out a woman who would have been apt to attract a strangers eye tooa woman young and handsome this was what a first glance would have taken in a second would have been apt to teach more and leave a less pleasant impression she was young enough to have been girlish but she was not girlish in the least her tall lithe wellknit figure was braced against the doorpost with a tense sort of strength her handsome face was just at this time as dark and hard in expression as if she had been a woman with years of bitter life behind her her handsome brows were knit her lips were set from head to foot she looked unyielding and stern of purpose and neither form nor face belied her the earliest remembrances of the coast people concerning meg lonas had not been overpleasant ones she had never been a favorite among them the truth was they had half feared her even as the silent dogged neglected child who used to wander up and down among the rocks and on the beach working harder for her scant living than the oldest of them she had never a word for them and never satisfied their curiosity upon the subject of the treatment she received from the illconditioned old grandfather who was her only living relative and this last peculiarity had rendered her more unpopular than anything else would have done if she had answered their questions they might have pitied her but as she chose to meet them with stubborn silence they managed to show their dislike in many ways until at last it became a settled point among them that the girl was an outcast in their midst but even in those days she gave them back wrong for wrong and scorn for scorn and as she grew older she grew stronger of will less prone to forgive her many injuries and slights and more prone to revenge them in an obstinate bitter fashion but as she grew older she grew handsomer too and the fisher boys who had jeered at her in her childhood were anxious enough to gain her goodwill the women flouted her still and she defied them openly the men found it wisest to be humble in their rough style and her defiance of them was more scornful than her defiance of their mothers and sisters she would revenge herself upon them and did until at last she met a wooer who was tender enough it seemed to move her at least so people said at first but suddenly the lover disappeared and two or three months later the whole community was electrified by her sudden marriage with a suitor whom she had been wont to treat worse than all the rest how she treated him after the marriage nobody knew she was more defiant and silent than ever and gossipers gained nothing by asking questions so at last she was left alone it was not the face of a tender wife waiting for a loving husband the face that was turned toward the sea if she had hated the man for whom she watched she could not have seemed more unbending ever since her visitor had left her she had had a visitor during the morning she had stood in the same place even in the same position without moving and when at last the figure of her husband came slouching across the sands homeward she remained motionless still and surely his was not the face of a happy husband not a handsome face at its dull best it was doubly unprepossessing then as pale and breathless he passed the stern form in the doorway his nervous reluctant eyes avoiding hers yoll find yore dinner aw ready on th table she said to him as he passed in everything was neat enough inside the fireplace was clean and bright the table was set tidily and the meal upon it was good enough in its way but when the man entered he cast an unsteady uncomprehending glance around and when he had flung himself into a chair he did not attempt to touch the food but dropped his face upon his arm on the table with a sound like a little groan she must have heard it but she did not notice it even by a turn of her head but stood erect and steadfast until he spoke to her she might have been waiting for his wordsperhaps she was tha canst come in an say what tha has to say an be done wi it he said at last in a sullen wornout fashion she turned round then and faced him harder to be met in her rigid mood than if she had been a tempest tha knows what i ha getten to say she answered her tone strained and husky with repressed fierceness aye tha knows it well enough i ha not much need to tell thee owt he comn here this morning an he towd me aw i want to know about thee seth lonasan more too he comn to me put in the man she advanced towards the table and struck it once with her hand thast towd me a power o lies she said thas lied to me fro first to last to serve thy own eends an thast gained emthast lied me away fro th man as wur aw th world to me but th times comn now when thy days oer an his is comn agen ah thou bitter villain does ta mind how tha comn an towd me dan morgan had gone to th fair at lake wi that lass o barnegats that wur a lie

he wur fur fro here an he browt th truth back to me today an theers th eend fur theehusband or no the man lay with his head upon his arms until she had finished and then he looked up all white and shaken and blind wilt ta listen if i speak to thee he asked aye she answered listen to more lies and she slipped down into a sitting posture on the stone doorstep and sat there her great eyes staring out seaward her hands lying loose upon her knee and trembling there was something more in her mood than resentment in this simple gesture she had broken down as she had never broken down in her life before there was passionate grief in her face a wild sort of despair such as one might see in a suddenlywounded untamed creature hers was not a fair nature i am not telling the story of a gentle truesouled womani am simply relating the incidents of one bitter day whose tragic close was the ending of a rough romance her life had been a long battle against the worlds scorn she had been either on the offensive or the defensive from childhood to womanhood and then she had caught one glimpse of light and warmth clung to it yearningly for one brief hour and lost it only today she had learned that she had lost it through treachery she had not dared to believe in her bliss even during its fairest existence and so when lighthearted handsome dan morgans rival had worked against him with false stories and false proofs her fierce pride had caught at them and her revenge had been swift and sharp but it had fallen back upon her own head now this very morning handsome dan had come back again to arle and earned his revenge too though he had only meant to clear himself when he told her what chance had brought to light he had come backher lover the man who had conquered and sweetened her bitter nature as nothing else on earth had power to dohe had come back and found her what she wasthe wife of a man for whom she had never cared the wife of the man who had played them both false and robbed her of the one poor gleam of joy she had known she had been hard and wild enough at first but just now when she slipped down upon the doorstep with her back turned to the wretched man withinwhen it came upon her that traitor as he was she herself had given him the right to take her brightfaced lovers place and usurp his tender powerwhen the fresh seabreeze blew upon her face and stirred her hair and the warm rare sunshine touched her even breeze and sunshine helped her to the end so that she broke down into a sharp sob as any other woman might have done only that the repressed strength of her poor warped nature made it a sob sharper and deeper than another womans would have been yo mought ha left me that she said yo mought ha left it to me there wur other women as would ha done yo there

minute later she turned on him all at once alls oer betwixt yo an me she said with fierce heat do yo know that if yo wur half a mon yo would he sat up and stared at her humbly and stupidly eh he said at last theers not a mon i arle as isna more to me now than tha art she said some on em be honest an i conna say that o thee tha canst get thee gone or ill go mysen tha knowst me well enow to know ill neer forgie thee for what thas done ayewith the passionate handwringing againbut that wunnot undo it he rose and came to her trembling like a man with the ague yo dunnot mean that theer meg he said slowly you dunnot mean it word fur word think a bit aye but i do she answered him setting her white teeth word fur word think again wench and this time he staggered and caught hold of the doorpost is theer nowt asll go agen th wrong ive lived withee nigh a year an ive loved thee twentyis theer nowt fur me aye lass dunnot be too hard tha was allus harder than most womankind try an be a bit softer like tords th mon as risked his soul because he wur a mon an darena lose thee tha laid thy head on my shoulder last neet aye lasslass think o that fur one minnit perhaps she did think of it for surely she faltered a littlewhat woman would not have faltered at such a momentbut the next the memory of the sunny halfboyish face she had clung to with so strong a love rushed back upon her and struck her to the heart she remembered the days when her life had seemed so full that she had feared her own bliss she remembered the gallant speeches and lighthearted wiles and all at once she cried out in a fierce impassioned voice ill neer forgie thee she saidill neer forgie thee to th last day o my life what fur should i thas broke my heart thou villainthas broke my heart and the next minute she had pushed past him and rushed into the house for a minute or so after she was gone the man stood leaning against the door with a dazed look in his pale face she meant what she said he had known her long enough to understand that she never forgavenever forgot her unbroken will and stubborn strength had held her to enmities all her life and he knew she was not to be won by such things as won other women he knew she was harder than most women but his dull nature could not teach him how bitter must have been the life that rendered her so he had never thought of ithe did not think of it now he was not blaming her and he was scarcely blaming himself he had tried to make her happy and had failed there were two causes for the heavy passion of misery that was ruling him but neither of them was remorse his treachery had betrayed him and he had lost the woman he had loved and worked for soul and body were sluggish alike but each had its dull pang of weight and wretchedness ive come to th eend now surely he said and dropping into her seat he hid his face as he sat there a choking lump rose in his throat with a sudden click and in a minute or so more he was wiping away hot rolling tears with the back of his rough hand im forsook somehow he saidaye im forsook im not th soart o chap to tak up wi th world she wur all th world i cared fur an shell neer forgie me for shes a hard unshe is aye but i wur fond o her i wonder what shell doi do wonder i my soul what shes gettin her mind on it did not occur to him to call to her or go and see what she was doing he had always stood in some dull awe of her even when she had been kindest and now it seemed that they were too far apart for any possibility of approach at reconciliation so he sat and pondered heavily the sea air blowing upon him fresh and sweet the sun shining soft and warm upon the house and the few common flowers in the strip of garden whose narrow shell walks and borders he had laid out for her himself with much clumsy planning and slow labor then he got up and took his rough workingjacket over his arm i mun go down to th mary anne he said an work a bit or well neer get her turned oer afore th tide comes in that boats a moit o trouble and he sighed heavily halfway to the gate he stopped before a cluster of ground honeysuckle and perhaps for the first time in his life was conscious of a sudden curious admiration for them shes powerful fond o such loike bits o thingsposies an such loike he said thems some as i planted to please her on th very day as we were wed ill tak one or two shes main fond on emfur such a hard un and when he went out he held in his hand two or three slender stems hung with the tiny pretty humble bells he had these very bits of simple blossoms in his hand when he went down to where the mary anne lay on the beach for repairs so his fellowworkmen said when they told the story afterwards remembering even this trivial incident he was in a strange frame of mind too they noticed silent and heavy and absent he did not work well but lagged over his labor stopping every now and then to pass the back of his hand over his brow as if to rouse himself yo look as if yo an th missus had had a fallin out an yon getten th worst o th bargain one of his comrades said by way of rough jest they were fond of joking with him about his love for his handsome taciturn wife but he did not laugh this time as he usually did mind thy own tackle lad he said dully an ill mind mine from that time he worked steadily among them until it was nearly time for the tide to rise the boat they were repairing had been a difficult job to manage as they could only work between tides and now being hurried they lingered longer than usual at the last minute they found it must be moved and so were detained better leave her until th tide ebbs said one but the rest were not of the same mind nay they argued itll be all to do oer agen if we do that theers plenty o time if we look sharp enow heave again lads then it was that with the help of straining and tugging there came a little lurch and then it was that as the mary anne slipped over on her side one of the workers slipped with her slipped half underneath her with a cry and lay on the sand held down by the weight that rested on him with his cry there broke out half a dozen others and the men rushed up to him with frightened faces are yo hurt seth lad they cried are yo crushed or owt the poor fellow stirred a little and then looked up at them pale enough bruised a bit he answered them an sick a bit but i dunnot think theers any bones broke look sharp chaps an heave her up shes a moit o weight on me they went to work again one and all so relieved by his words that they were doubly strong but after toiling like giants for a while they were compelled to pause for breath in falling the boat had so buried herself in the sand that she was harder to move than ever it had seemed simple enough at first but it was not so simple after all with all their efforts they had scarcely stirred her an inch and their comrades position interfered with almost every plan suggested then they tried again but this time with less effect than before through their fatigue when they were obliged to pause they looked at each other questioningly and more than one of them turned a trifle paler and at last the wisest of them spoke out lads he said we conna do this oursens run for help jem coulter an run wi thy might fur it wunnot be so long afore th tidell flow up to this time the man on the sands had lain with closed eyes and set teeth but when he heard this his eyes opened and he looked up eh he said in that blind stupid fashion whats that theer thas sayin mester th tide blundered the speaker i wur tellin him to look sharp thats aw the poor fellow moved restlessly aye aye he said look sharphe mun do that i didna think o th tide and he shut his eyes again with a faint groan they strove while the messenger was gone and they strove when he returned with assistance they strove with might and main until not a man among them had the strength of a child and the boldest of them were blanching with a fearful furtive excitement none dared to show a crowd had gathered round by this timemen willing and anxious to help women suggesting new ideas and comforting the wounded man in rough earnest style children clinging to their mothers gowns and looking on terrorstricken suddenly in the midst of one of their mightiest efforts a sharp childish voice piped out from the edge of an anxious group a brief warning that struck terror to every heart that beat among them eh mesters it said th tides creepin up a bit the men looked round with throbbing pulses the women looked also and one of the younger ones broke into a low cry lord ha mercy she said itll sweep around th bend afore long ananand she ended with a terror in her voice which told its own tale without other words the truth forced itself upon them all then women began to shriek and men to pray but strange to say the man whose life was at stake lay silent with ashen lips about which the muscles were tensely drawn his dull eyes searched every group in a dead despair that was yet a passion in all its stillness how long will it be he asked slowly at lastth tide twenty minutes happen so was the answer an lad lad we conna help thee wen tried our best ladwith sobs even from the uncouth fellow who spoke theer is na one on us but ud leave a limb behind to save thee but theer is na timetheer is na one deep groan and he lay still againquite still god knows what weight of mortal agony and desperate terror crushed him in that dead helpless pause then his eyes opened as before ive thowt o deein he said with a catch of his breath ive thowt o deein an ive wondered how it wur an what it felt like i never thowt o deein like this here another pause and then which o yo lads ll tell my missus ay poor chap poor chap wailed the women who on em will howd tha noise wenches he said hoarsely yo daze me theer is na time to bring her here id ha liked to ha said a word to her id ha liked to ha said one word jem coulterraising his voicecanst tha say it fur me aye cried the man choking as he spoke surely surely and he knelt down tell her at if it wur bad enowthis hereit wur not so bad as it mought ha beenfur me i mought ha fun it worser tell her id like to ha said a word if i couldbut i couldna id like to ha heard her say one word as happen she would ha said if shed been here an tell her at if she had ha said it th tide mought ha comn an welcomebut she didna an theer it stands and the sob that burst from his breast was like the sob of a deathstricken child happenhe said nexthappen one o yo womenfoak con say a bit o a prayeryore not so fur fro safe sand but yo can reach ithappen one o yo ha a word or two as yo could saysuch like as yo teach yore babbies among these was one who hadthank god thank god and so amid wails and weeping rough men and little children alike knelt with uncovered heads and hidden eyes while this one woman faltered the prayer that was a prayer for a dying man and when it was ended and all rose glancing fearfully at the white line of creeping foam this dying man for whom they had prayed lay upon his deathbed of sand the quietest of them allquiet with a strange calm bring me my jacket he said an lay it oer my face theers a bit o a posie in th buttonhole i getten it out o th missuss garden when i comn away id like to howld it i my hand if its theer yet and as the long line of white came creeping onward they hurriedly did as he told themlaid the rough garment over his face and gave him the humble dying flowers to hold and aving done this and lingered to the last moment one after the other dropped away with awestricken souls until the last was gone and under the arch of sunny sky the little shining waves ran up the beach chasing each other over the glittering sand catching at shells and seaweed toying with them for a moment and then leaving them rippling and curling and whispering but creepingcreepingcreeping they gave his message to the woman he had loved with all the desperate strength of his dull yet unchanging nature and when the man who gave it to her saw her wild white face and hardset lips he blundered upon some dim guess as to what that single word might have been but the sharpest of them never knew the stubborn anguish that following and growing day by day crushed her fierce will and shook her heart she was as hard as ever they thought but they were none of them the men or women to guess at the long dormant instinct of womanhood and remorse that the tragedy of this one day of her life had awakened she had said she would never forgive him and perhaps her very strength made it long before she did but surely some subtle chord was touched by those heavy last words for when months later her first love came back faithful and tender with his old tale to tell she would not listen nay lad she said i amna a feather to blow wi th wind ive had my share o trouble wi men foak an i ha no mind to try again him as lies i th churchyard loved me i his waymen foaks way is apt to be a poor unan im wore out wi life dunnot come here courtintak a better woman but yet there are those who say that the time will come when he will not plead in vain
