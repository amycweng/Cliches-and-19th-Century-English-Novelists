was not much shade worth mentioning in the immediate vicinity of the crossroads postoffice about which upon the occasion referred to the few human beings within sight and sound were congregated there were trees enough a few hundred yards away but the postoffice stood boldly and unflinchingly in the blazing sun the roads crossing each other stretched themselves as far as the eye could follow them the red clay transformed into red dust which even an ordinarily lively imagination might have fancied was red hot the shrill rattling cry of the grasshoppers hidden in the long yellow sedgegrass and drouthsmitten corn pierced the stillness now and then with a suddenness startling each time it broke forth because the interval between each of the pipings was given by the hearers to drowsiness or heated unconscious naps in such napping and drowsiness the present occupants of the postoffice were indulging upon two empty goods boxes two men in copperascoloured jean garments reclined in easy attitudes their hats tilted over their eyes while several others balanced their splitseated chairs against the house or the postporch and dozed inside the store the postmaster and proprietor tilted his chair against the counter and dozed also though fitfully and with occasional restless changes of position and smothered maledictions against the heat he was scarcely the build of man to sleep comfortably at high noon in midsummer his huge heavy body was rather too much for him at any time but during the hot weather he succumbed beneath the weight of his own flesh hamlin county knew him as big tom dwillerby and indeed rather prided itself upon him as a creditable possession it noted any increase in his weight repeated his jokes and bore itself patiently under his satire his indolence it regarded with leniency not entirely untinged with secret exultation the derndest laziest critter his acquaintances would remark to each other the derndest i do reckon that ever the lord made nigh unto three hundred he weighs and never done a lick o work in his life not one lord no tom dwillerby work i guess not he gits on fine without any o that in hisn work aint his kind its a pleasin sight to see him lyin round thar to the postoffice an the boys awaitin on to him doin his tradin for him an sortin the mail when it comes in theyre ready enough to do it jest to hear him gas and so they were about eight years before the time the present story commences he had appeared upon the scene apparently having no object in view but to make himself as comfortable as possible he took up his quarters at one of the farmhouses among the mountains paid his hostess regularly for the simple accommodations she could afford him and before three months passed had established his reputation and without making the slightest apparent effort had gathered about him a large circle of friends and admirers his names dwillerby mrs pike would drawl when questioned about him an hes kin to them dwillerbys thats sich big bugs down to dlileville i guess they aint much friendly though he dont seem to like to have nothin much to say about em seems like he has money aplenty to carry him along an he talks some o settin up a store somewhars in the course of a month or so he carried out the plan selecting talbots crossroads as the site for the store in question he engaged hands to erect a frame building collected by the assistance of some mysterious agency a heterogeneous stock consisting of calicoes tinware coffee sugar tobacco and various waif and stray commodities and having done so took his seat on the porch one morning and announced the establishment open upon the whole the enterprise was a success barnesville was fifteen miles distant and the farmers their wives and daughters were glad enough to stop at the crossroads for their calico dresses and storecoffee by doing so they were saved a long ride and gained superior conversational advantages dwillerbys mighty easy to trade with it was said there was always a goodly number of critters tied to the fencecorners and consequently to business was added the zest of society and the interchanging of gossip dwillerbys became a centre of interest and attraction and dwillerby himself a county institution big tom however studiously avoided taking a too active part in the duties of the establishment having with great forethought provided himself with a stout chair which could be moved from behind the counter to the door and from the door to the store as the weather demanded he devoted himself almost exclusively to sitting in it and encouraging a friendly and accommodating spirit in his visitors and admirers the more youthful of those admirers he found useful in the extreme boys he would say a man cant do more than a thousand things at once a man cant talk a steady stream and do himself justice and settle the heftiest kind of questions and say the kind of things these ladies ought to have said to em and then measure out molasses and weigh coffee and slash off calico dresses and trade for eggs some of youve got to roust out and do some clerking or ive got to quit ive not got the constitution to stand it jim you tend to mis pike and bill you wait on mis jones lord lord half a dozen of you here and not one doing a thingnot a derned thing do you want me to get up and leave miss mirandy and do things myself weve got to settle about the colour of this gown howd you feel now if it wasnt becoming to her complexion just help yourself to that plug of tobacco hance and lay your ten cents in the cash drawer and then you can weigh out that butter of mis simpsons when there was a prospect of a postoffice at the crossroads there was only one opinion as to who was the man best calculated to adorn the position of postmaster the stores right yere tom said his patrons an youre right yere ye can write and spell off things thout any trouble an i reckon ye wouldnt mind the extry two dollars comin in evry month lord lord groaned tom who was stretched full length on the floor of the porch when the subject was first broached do you want a man to kill himself out an out boys work himself into eternal kingdom come whod do the extra work id like to knowempty out the mailbag and hand out the mail and do the extra cussin that would be worth ten dollars a month and like as not the money would be paid in cheques and whos goin to sign em lord i believe you think a mans immortal soul could be bought for fifty cents a day you dont allow for the wear and tear on a fellows constitution boys but he allowed himself to be placed in receipt of the official salary in question and the matter of extra labour settled itself twice a week a boy on horseback brought the mailbag from barnesville and when this youth drew rein before the porch big tom greeted him from indoors with his habitual cordiality light sonny light he would call out in languidly sonorous tones come in and let these fellows hear the news just throw that mailbag on the counter and lets hear from you plenty of good water down at the spring might as well take that bucket and fill it if you want a drink ive been waiting for just such a man as you to do it these fellows would sit here all day and let a man die i cant get anything out of em ive about half a mind to quit sometimes and leave them to engineer the thing themselves look here now is any fellow going to attend to that mail or is it going to lie there till i have to get up and attend to it myself i reckon thats what you want i reckon thatd just suit you jehoshaphat i guess youd like me to take charge of the eternal universe it was for the mail he waited with his usual complement of friends and assistants on the afternoon referred to at the opening of this chapter the boy was behind time and under the influence of the heat conversation had at first flagged and then subsided big tom himself had taken the initiative of dropping into a doze and his companions had one by one followed his example or at least made an effort at doing so the only one of the number who remained unmistakably awake was a little man who sat on the floor of the end of the porch his small legs encased in large blue jean pantaloons dangling over the side this little man who was gently and continuously ruminating with brief asides of expectoration kept his eyes fixed watchfully upon the barnesville road and he it was who at last roused the dozers thars some un acomin he announced in a meek voice taint him big tom opened his eyes stretched himself and gradually rose in his might proving a very tight fit for the establishment especially the doorway towards which he lounged supporting himself against its side who is it ezra he asked almost extinguishing the latter cognomen with a yawn its thet thar feller all the other men awakened in a body whomsoever the individual might be he had the power to rouse them to a lively exhibition of interest one and all braced themselves to look at the horseman approaching along the barnesville road hes a kinder curislookin feller observed one philosopher well at a distance of half a mile perhaps he is said tom in a cloud of dust and the sun blazin down on him like thunderation i dont know but youre right nath git out replied nath placidly hes a curisactin feller anyway dont go nowhar nor hev nothin to say to nobody jest sets right down in that thar holler with his wife as if bars an painters wus all a man or woman wanted round em shes a doggoned purty critter said the little man in large trousers placidly he had not appeared to listen to the conversation but as this pertinent remark proved it had not been lost on him his observation was greeted with a general laugh which seemed to imply that the speaker had a character which his speech sustained whar did ye see her stamps was asked the little man remained unmoved still dangling his legs over the porch side still ruminating still gazing with pale blinking eyes up the road went over the mountain to tend court to bakersville an took it on my road to go by thar she was settin in the door an i see her afore she seen me when she hearn the sound of my mules feet she got up an went into the house it was a powerful hot mornin n i wus mighty dry n i stopped fur a cool drink she didnt come out when fust i hollered n when she did come she looked kinder skeered n wouldnt talk none kep her sunbonnet over her face like she didnt want to be seen overmuch what does she look like ezry asked one of the younger men mr stamps meditated a few seconds dont look like none o the women folk about yere he replied finally she aint their kind what dye mean by that dunno eggsactly shes mighty white n younglookin n delicatebut that aint all tom made a restless movement look here boys he broke in suddenly heres a nice businessa lot of fellows asking questions about a woman an gossiping as if there wasnt a thing better to do leave em alone if they want to be left aloneleave em alone mr stamps expectorated in an entirely unbiased manner he seemed as willing to leave his story alone as he had been to begin it hes comin yere he said softly after a pause thets whar hes comin the rest of the company straightened themselves in their seats and made an effort to assume the appearance of slightly interested spectators it became evident that mr stamps was right and that the rider was about to dismount he was a man about thirty years of age thin narrowchested and stooping his coarse clothes seemed specially illsuited to his slender figure his black hair was long and his beard neglected his broad hat was pulled low over his eyes and partially concealed his face he dont look none too sociable when hes nigher than half a mile remarked nath in an undertone he glanced neither to the right nor to the left as he strode past the group into the store strange to relate tom had lounged behind the counter and stood ready to attend him he asked for a few necessary household trifles in a low tone and as tom collected and made them into a clumsy package he stood and looked on with his back turned towards the door those gathered upon the porch listened eagerly for the sound of conversation but none reached their ears tom moved heavily to and fro for a few minutes and then the parcel was handed across the counter hot weather said the stranger without raising his eyes yes said tom hot weather sir goodday said the stranger goodday answered tom and his customer took his departure he passed out as he had passed in but while he was indoors little mr stamps had changed his position he now sat near the wooden steps his legs dangling as before his small countenance as noncommittal as ever as the stranger neared him he raised his pale little eyes blinked them indulged in a slight jerk of the head and uttered a single word of greeting howdy the stranger started glanced down at him and walked on he made no answer untied his horse mounted it and rode back over the barnesville road towards the mountain mr stamps remained seated near the steps and blinked after him silently until he was out of sight ye didnt seem to talk none dwillerby said one of the outsiders when tom reappeared tom sank into his chair thrust his hands into his pockets and stretched his limbs out to their fullest capacity let a man rest boys he said let a man rest he was silent for some time afterwards and even on the arrival of the mail was less discursive than usual it was mr stamps who finally aroused him from his reverie having obtained his mailone letter in a legallooking envelopeand made all other preparations to return to the bosom of his family stamps sidled up to the counter and leaning over it spoke in an insinuatingly low tone she was barfoot he said mildly n she hadnt been raised to itthat was one thing her feet wus as soft n tender as a babys n fur another thing her hands wus as white as her face n whiter thet aint the way we raise em in hamlin countythats all and having said it he slipped out of the store mounted his mule and jogged homeward on the barnesville road also chapter ii before the war there were no people better known or more prominent in their portion of the state than the de willoughbys of delisle county tennessee to have been born a de willoughby was in general opinion to have been born with a silver spoon in ones mouth it was indeed to have been born to social dignity fortune courage and more than the usual allowance of good looks and though the fortune was lavishly spent the courage sometimes betrayed into a rather theatrical daredeviltry and the good looks prone to deteriorate in style there was always the social position left and this was a matter of the deepest importance in delisleville the sentiments of delisleville were purely patrician it was the county town and contained six thousand inhabitants two hotels and a courthouse it had also two or three business streets and half a dozen churches all very much at odds with each other and each seriously inclined to disbelieve in the probable salvation of the rest the first families of which there were eight or ten with numerous branches attended the episcopal church the second best the presbyterian while the inferior classes who could scarcely be counted at all since they had not been born in delisleville drifted to the methodists the de willoughbys attended the episcopal church and being generally endowed with voices two or three of them sang in the choir which was composed entirely of members of the attending families and executed most difficult music in a manner which was the cause after each service of much divided opinion opinion was divided because the choir was dividedseparated in fact into several small select cliques each engaged in deadly and bitter feud with the rest when the mooneyed soprano arose with a gentle flutter and opened her charming mouth in solo her friends settled themselves in their pews with a general rustle of satisfaction while the friends of the contralto exchanged civilly significant glances and on the way home the solo in question was disposed of in a manner at once thorough and final the same thing occurred when the contralto was prominent or the tenor or the baritone or the basso each of whom it was confidently asserted by competent delisleville judges might have rendered him or herself and delisleville immortal upon the lyric stage if social position had not placed the following of such a profession entirely out of the question there had indeed been some slight trouble in one or two of the best families occasioned by the musical fervour of youthful scions who were in danger of being led into indiscretions by their enthusiasm the de willoughbys occupied one of the most prominent pews in the sacred edifice referred to judge de willoughby a large commanding figure with a fine sweep of long hair mustache and aquiline profile mrs de willoughby who had been a miss vanuxem of south carolina slender willowy with faded brunette complexion and still handsome brunette eyes and three or four little de willoughbys all more or less pretty and picturesque these nearly filled the pew the grownup misses de willoughby sang with two of their brothers in the choir there were three sons romaine de courcy and thomas but thomas did not sing in the choir thomas alas did not sing at all thomas it was universally conceded by every de willoughby of the clan was a dismal failure even from his earliest boyhood when he had been a huge overgrown fellow whose only redeeming qualities were his imperturbable goodhumor and his ponderous wit his family had regarded him with a sense of despair in the first place he was too big his brothers were tall lithelimbed youths who were graceful darkeyed darkhaired and had a general air of brilliancy they figured well at college and in their world they sang and danced in a manner which combining itself with the name of de willoughby gave them quite an ennobled sort of distinction a touch of patrician bravado added to their picturesqueness in the eyes of the admiring and their little indiscretions were of a nature to be ignored or treated with gentle consideration as the natural result of their youth spirit and southern blood but at nineteen thomas had attained a height of six feet five with a proportionate breadth and ponderousness his hands and feet were a disgrace to a de willoughby and his voice was a roar when he was influenced by anything like emotion displays of emotion however were but rare occurrences with him he was too lazy to be roused to anger or any other violent feeling he spent his leisure hours in lying upon sofas or chairs and getting very much in everybodys way he lounged through school and college without the slightest eclat attending his progress it became the pastime of the household to make rather a butt of him and for the most part he bore himself under the difficulties of his position peaceably enough though there had been times when his weighty retorts had caused some sharp wincing youre an illnatured devil tom his brother de courcy said to him as he stood fingering the ornaments on the mantel after one such encounter youre an illnatured devil tom was stretched on a sofa with his big hands under his head and did not condescend to look around im not such a thundering fool as you take me for thats all he answered ive got my eyes open keep to your side of the street and i will keep to mine it was true that he had his eyes open and had more wit and feeling than they gave him credit for no one understood him not even his mother who had deplored him from the first hour of his overweighted babyhood when she had given him over to the care of his negro nurse in despair in the midst of a large family occupied with all the small gaieties attendant upon popularity and social distinction in a provincial town he lived a lonely life and one not without its pathetic side if it had been so looked upon but even he himself had never regarded the matter from a sentimental point of view he endeavoured to resign himself to his fate and meet it philosophically i wasnt cut out for this sort of thing boys he had said to his friends at college where he had been rather popular i wasnt cut out for it go ahead and leave me behind im not a bad sort of fellow but there is too much of me in one way and too little in another what the lord made such a man as me for after six thousand years experience i havent found out yet a man may as well make up his mind about himself first as last ive made up mine and nobody differs from me so far as ive gone when he left college his brothers had already chosen their vocations delisle county knew them as promising young lawyers each having distinguished himself with much fiery eloquence in an occasional case the cases had not always been gained but the fervour and poetry of the appeals to the rather muddled and startled agriculturists who formed the juries were remembered with admiration and as being worthy of delisleville and were commented upon in the delisleville oriflamme as the fit echoings of an eloquence long known in our midst as the birthright of those bearing one of our proudest names an eloquence spurred to its eagle flights by the warm chivalric blood of a noble race but the warm chivalric blood of the race in question seemed to move but slowly in veins of its most substantial representative the inertness of his youngest son roused that fine old southern gentleman and wellknown legal dignitary judge de willoughby to occasional outbursts of the fiery eloquence before referred to which might well have been productive of remarkable results good god sir he would trumpet forth good god sir have we led the state for generation after generation to be disgraced and degraded and dragged in the dust by one of our own stock at last the de willoughbys have been gentlemen sir distinguished at the bar in politics and in the highest social circles of the south and here we have a de willoughby whose tastes would be no credit toto his overseer a de willoughby who has apparently neither the ambition nor the qualification to shine in the sphere in which he was born blow your damned brains out if you have any blow your damned brains out and lets have an end of the whole disgraceful business this referred specially to toms unwillingness to enter upon the study of medicine which had been chosen for him i should make a better farmer he said bitterly after a prolonged discussion im not the build for womens bedrooms and childrens bedsides de courcy would have suited you better de courcy is a gentlemana gentleman sir he was born one and would shine in any profession a gentleman may adorn as for you this is the only thing left for you and you shall try it by g oh said tom ill try it i can only fail and ive done that before he did try it forthwith applying himself to his studies with a persistence quite creditable he read lying upon sofas and lounging in the piazzas and in course of time was sent to attend lectures in philadelphia whether he could have gained his diploma or not was never decided those of the professors who commented on him at all spoke of him as slow but persevering and regarded him rather as a huge receiving machine of orderly habits the judge began to congratulate himself upon his determination and his mother thought it a good thing poor tom was disposed of but one terrible morning just before the first course of lectures was completed he suddenly returned walking into the judges office without any previous intimation of his intention when he turned in his seat and confronted him the judge lost his breath you he cried you yes said tom ive come back he was rather pale and nervous but there was a dogged resigned look in his eyes ive made up my mind he added that i cannot stand it turn me loose on one of your plantations toto boss niggers you said once i was fit for an overseer perhaps you werent wrong say the word and ill start tomorrow the judges aquiline countenance turned gray with fury his fine mustache seemed to curl itself anew youyou accursed scoundrel he gasped you accursed underbred hound tell me what this means or ill strangle you youll say im a fool said tom and i suppose its true andand with a tremour in his voice ive no need to be particular about the names you call me i ought to be used to them by this time speak out thundered the judge and tell me the whole disgraceful truth it wont take long said tom i told it when i said id made up my mind i couldnt stand it ive been walking the hospitals and attending the clinics for the last three months and ive had a chance to see what my life would be if i went through ive seen things to make a man tremble when they came back to him in the dead of nightagony and horrorwomen and children good lord i cant tell you de courcy could but i cant id rather be in hell than live such a life day after day i tried to stand up against it at first i thought i might get used to it but i havent the nerveor something was wrong it got worse and worse until i used to start up out of my sleep in a cold sweat hearing screams and groans and prayers that was the worst of alltheir prayers to us to help them and not to hurt them four days ago a child was brought ina child four or five years old there was an operation to be performed and i was the man chosen to hold it still its mother was sent out of the room my god how it screamed when it saw her go and knew it was to be left to us they told me to hold it because i was the strongest andand i put my hands on it im a big fellow to look at and i suppose it knew there was no help for it when i came near it turned as white as death and looked up at me with the tears streaming down its face before the operation was half over it hadnt the strength left to scream or struggle and it lay and looked at me and moaned i should have given up the job but somehow i couldnt make up my mind toto leave it when it was all done i gave it back to its mother and went to my rooms i turned sick on the way and had to sit down to rest i swore then id let the thing drop and i bought my ticket and came back im not the man for the work better men may do itperhaps it takes better men im not up to it and his shaken voice broke as he hung his great head a deadly calm settled upon the judge he pointed to the door go home to your mother sir he said ive done with you go and stay with the women thats the place for you hes a coward as well as a fool he said afterwards in the bosom of his family a whitelivered fool who hasnt the nerve to look at a sick child it was a terrible day for the household but at last it was over tom went to his room in an apathy he had been buffeted and scorned and held up to bitter derision until he had ceased to feel anything but a negative helpless misery about a week later delia vanuxem appeared upon the scene delia vanuxem was a young cousin of mrs de willoughbys and had come to pay her relatives a visit it was the hospitable custom of delisleville to cultivate its kinsfolkmore especially its kinswomen there were always in two or three of the principal families young lady guests who were during their stay in the town the sensation of the hour novelty established them as temporary belles they were petted by their hostesses attended by small cohorts of admirers and formed the centre for a round of festivities specially arranged to enliven their visits delia vanuxem bore away the palm from all such visitors past or to come she was a true southern beauty with the largest dark eyes the prettiest yielding manner and the very smallest foot delisleville had ever fallen prostrate before it being well known among her admirers that one of her numerous male cousins had once measured her little slipper with a cigara story in which delisleville delighted and she was not only a pretty but also a lovable and tenderhearted young creature her soft eyes end soft voice did not belie her she was gentle and kindly to all around her mrs de willoughby and the two older girls fell in love with her at once and the judge himself was aroused to an eloquence of compliment and a courtly grandeur of demeanour which rose even beyond his usual efforts in a line in which he had always shone the very negroes adored her and vied with each other to do her service it was quite natural that a nature so sweet and sympathetic should be awakened to pity for the one member of the gay household who seemed cut off from the rest and who certainly at the time existed under a darker cloud than usual from the first she was more considerate of poor tom than anyone who had ever been before and more than once as he sat silent and gloomy at the table he looked up to find her lovely eyes resting upon his big frame with a questioning pitying glance he is so much too big aunt jule she wrote home once and he seems somehow to feel as if he was always in the way and indeed he is a little sometimes poor fellow and everyone appears to think he is only a joke or a mistake but i have made up my mind never to laugh at him at all as the other girls do it seems so unkind and surely he must feel it she never did laugh at him and sometimes even tried to talk to him and once drew him out so far in an artful innocent way that he told her something of his medical failure and the reasons for it manifestly ashamed of the story as he related it and yet telling it so well in a few clumsy rather disconnected sentences that when he had finished her eyelashes were wet and she broke into a little shuddering sigh oh she said i dont think you are to blame really i have often thought that i could never never bear to do such things though of course if there was no one to do them it would be dreadful but yes said tom there it is someone must do it and i know im a confounded coward and ninny butbut i couldnt and he looked overwhelmed with humiliation but after all she said in the soft voice which had always the sound of appeal in it after all im sure it was because you have a kind heart and a kind heart is worth a great deal you will do something else there is nothing else for me to do he said mournfully nothing that wont disgrace the rest they tell me it was small wonder that this was his final undoing though neither was to blame certainly no fault could be attached to the young creature who meant to be kind to him as it was her nature to be to all surrounding her and surely toms great and final blunder arose from no presumption on his part he had never thought of aspiring to the proud position with regard to her which romaine and de courcy seemed to occupy by natural right it was only now and then when they were unavoidably engaged that he had the courage to offer his services as messenger or escort but even those rare pleasures were a little too much for him he was so unused to such privileges that they intoxicated him and set his mind in a whirl which prevented his thinking clearly or indeed ever thinking at all sometimes even when it was all over he scarcely knew how he had been betrayed into the weakness he was guilty of it was not like him to lose sight of his manifold imperfections but for once they were swept out of his mind by a momentary madness it was on the occasion of a ball at the delisle house the delisle house was the principal hotel and all important festivities were held in its long dininghall disguised as a ballroom the ball was given by a gallant delisleville club in honour of miss delia vanuxem and it was a very magnificent affair indeed the disguise of the diningroom was complete it was draped with flags and decorated with wreaths of cedar and paper roses a band of coloured gentlemen whose ardour concealed any slight musical discrepancies assisted the festivities whichto quote the oriflamme of the next morningthe wealth beauty and chivalry of delisleville combined to render unequalled in their gaiety and elegance making the evening one of the most successful of the piquant occasions when youth and pleasure meet to chase the glowing hours with flying feet usually toms part in such festivities was to sit uncomfortably in dull corners taking up as little room as possible or piloting his way carefully through the crowd to the suppertable with an elderly lady or a wallflower clinging timidly to his huge arm but during this one evening he lost his equilibrium delia had been more than usually kind to him perhaps because she saw his unhappy awkwardness as he towered above everyone else and tried to avoid treading upon his neighbours she gave him such a pretty smile across the room that he obeyed the impulse to go to her and stand at her side then when she left him to dance with de courcy she gave him her fan and bouquet and fleecy white wrap to hold and somehow it seemed not unnatural that de courcy should bring her back to him as to a sentinel when the dance was over thus it was as she sat flushed a little and smiling her face uplifted to his while she thanked him for taking care of her possessions that the wild thought which so betrayed him rushed into his brain delia he faltered will you dance once with me it was so startling a request that though she was quick enough to conceal her surprise she hesitated a second before recovering her breath to give him her answer yes tom if you like she said and glanced down at her programme the next is a waltz and i can let you have it because dr ballentine has been called away do you waltz i have learned he answered rather huskily and tremulously i do it badly of course but i know the steps well enough he was so helpless with nervousness that he could scarcely speak and his hands trembled when they stood up together and he laid his arm reverently about her waist she saw his timidity and looked up at him with a kind smile i must be very little she said i never knew before that i was so little he had thought he should recover himself when the music and motion began but he did not he looked down at the delicate head which reached barely to his beating heart and a blur came before his sight the light and the crowd of dancers dazzled and confused him the whirling movement made him dizzy and he had not expected to be dizzy he began suddenly to be conscious of his own immensity the unusualness of his position and of the fact that here and there he saw a meaning smile his heart beat faster still and he knew he had been led into a mistake he swung round and round too quickly for the music missed a step tried to recover himself became entangled in his partners dress trod on her poor little feet and fell headlong on the floor dragging her with him and striking against a passing couple it was his brother de courcy with whom he had come in such violent contact and it was de courcy who sprang to delias rescue assisting her to her feet with all possible grace and covering her innocent confusion with a brilliant speech but not however before he had directed a terrible scowl at the prostrate culprit and sworn furiously at him under his breath but delia was very good to him and did not desert him in the hour of his need giving him only kind looks and managing to arrange that he should lead her to her seat as if he had not been in disgrace at all but the shame and pain of his downfall were sharper pangs than he had ever borne and before the night was half over he slipped away from the dangers and rushed home to his own room where he lay awake through the long hours cursing himself for his folly and tossing in a fever of humiliation and grief in the morning when he came down to the breakfast table the family were already assembled and the judge had heard the story from de courcy who told it all the more forcibly in the absence of miss vanuxem who had spent the night at the house of another relative when tom entered his paternal parent was ready to receive him trod on miss vanuxems dress and tore it off her back in the ballroom did you he burst forth made a fool of yourself and a beargarden of the delisle house ballroom what were you trying to dance for leave that to men who can manage their limbs and dont inflict yourself on women who are too highbred to refuse to dance with a man who ought to be a gentleman stay at home sir stay at home and dont make a disgraceful spectacle of yourself in public particularly when there are lovely women present to witness your humiliation it was the figurative last straw toms mind had been dark and gloomy enough to begin with but when during his fathers harangue he glanced up and saw de courcy bending his aquiline face over his paper with a slightly sardonic smile he could stand no more to the utter dumfounding of his mother and sisters and even the irate judge himself he pushed his chair back and sprang to his feet with an actual roar of rage and pain his great body seemed to swell until its size overwhelmed them his eyes blazed he shook his tremendous fist leave me alone he shouted leave me alone yes i did make a fool of myself yes i did knock a woman down and tear her dress and look like an ass and set the whole room laughing at me women and allthe bestbred and sweetest of them its all true every word of it and more toomore too and thats not enough but my own father serves it up again and you fellows sit there and grin over it to make it worse thats right pitch in all of you and drive me mad and put an end to it he upset his chair and a small negro boy with a plate of waffles and striding over the scattered ruins dashed out of the room with tears of fury in his eyes it was the turningpoint of his existence he made his bitter resolve as he walked out of the house down the street early as it was he went straight to delia and when he found himself alone with her poured forth all the misery of his sore heart if i had been born a clodhopper it would have been better for me he said i have no place here among men with decently shaped bodies and clear heads im a great clumsy fool and theres no help for it if id had more brain i might have managed the rest but im a dullard too they may well sneer at me i think i will go away and bury myself somewhere among the people i ought to have lived among by rights in some simple country place i might find those who know less than i do and forget the rest and perhaps be content enough in time i shall never marry ii suppose you know that delia and he took her little hand and laid it on his own open palm and sat silent a moment looking at it and at last suddenly a great drop fell upon it which made them both start he did not look up at her but took out his big white handkerchief and wiped the drop gently away and then stooped and kissed the spot where it had fallen her own lashes were wet when their eyes met afterwards and she spoke in a subdued voice i have always liked you very much cousin tom she said you mustnt talk of going away we should miss you much more than you think i know i should be very sorry you wont be here to miss me delia he answered sadly the hand on his palm trembled slightly and her eyes faltered under his gaze ithink itis possible i shall live in delisleville she whispered his heart bounded as if it would burst his side he knew what she meant in an instant though he had never suspected it before oh oh he groaned oh delia whichwhich of them is it its de courcy i could swear its de courcy yes she faltered it is de courcy he drew his hand away and covered his face with it i knew it was de courcy he cried he was always the kind of fellow to win i suppose he deserves it the lord knows i hope he does for your sake of course its de courcy who else he did not stay long after this and when he went away he wrung her hand in his in a desperate farewell this is another reason for my going now he said i couldnt stay thisisgoodbye delia he went home and had a prolonged interview with his father it was not an agreeable interview to recur to mentally in after time but in the end tom gained his point and a portion of his future patrimony was handed over to him i shall be no further trouble to you he said you maynt ever hear of me again this is the end of me as far as you are concerned that night with a valise in his hand he took his place in the stage running towards the mountain regions of north carolina and from that day forward the place knew him no more it was as he had known it would be no one was very sorry to be rid of him and even delias sadness was at length toned down by the excitement of preparation for and the festivities attendant upon her triumphant union with the most dashing de willoughby of the flock when this event occurred toms wanderings had ended temporarily in the farmhouse referred to in the first chapter and his appearance in this remote and usually undisturbed portion of his country had created some sensation the news of the arrival of a stranger had spread itself abroad and aroused a slowgrowing excitement they were a kindly simple people who surrounded himhospitable ignorant and curious beyond measure concerning the ways of the outside world of which they knew so little in the course of time as the first keenness of his misery wore away tom began to discover the advantages of the change he had made he no longer need contrast himself unfavourably with his neighbours he knew more than they and they found nothing in him to condemn or jeer at to them he was a mine of worldly knowledge he amused them and won their hearts his natural indolence and lack of active ambition helped the healing of his wounds perhaps and then he began to appreciate the humourous side of his position and his old tendency to ponderous joking came back and assisted him to win a greater popularity than any mere practical quality could have done the novelty of his role was its chief attraction he began to enjoy and give himself up to it and make the most of his few gifts life was no longer without zest his natural indolence increased with the size of his great body as the years passed and his slow whimsical humour became his strongest characteristic he felt it a fine point in the sarcasm of his destiny that he should at last have become a hero and be regarded with admiration for his conversational abilities but he bore his honours discreetly and found both moral and physical comfort in them he insensibly adopted the habits of his neighbours he dressed with their primitive regard for ease he dropped now and then into their slurring speech and adopted one by one their arcadian customs whether the change was the better or the worse for him might easily be a matter of opinion and depend entirely on the standpoint from which it was viewed at least he lived harmlessly and had no enemy and so existence stood with him when the second great change in his life took place chapter iii scarcely a month before the events described in the opening chapter took place the stranger and a young woman who was his companion had appeared in the community there was little that seemed mysterious about them at the outset a long uninhabited cabin a score or so of yards from the mountain road had been roughly patched up and taken possession of by them there was nothing unusual in the circumstance except that they had appeared suddenly and entirely unheralded but this in itself would have awakened no special comment the mystery developed itself from their after reserve and seclusion they guarded themselves from all advances by keeping out of sight when anyone approached their cabin the young woman was rarely if ever seen the man never called at the postoffice for mail and upon the few occasions on which a stray human being crossed his path his manner was such as by no means encouraged the curious mr stamps was the only individual who had seen the woman face to face there was an unmoved pertinacity in the character of mr stamps which stood him in good stead upon all occasions he was not easily abashed or rebuffed the more especially when he held in view some practical object possibly he held some such object in view when he rode up to the tumbled down gateway and asked for the draught of water no woman of the region could refuse without some reasonable excuse taint airs theyre puttin on cindy he said to the partner of his joys and sorrows the evening after his ride over the mountain oh no taint airs its somethin more curis than that and he bent over the fire in a comfortable lounging way rubbing his hands a little and blinked at the back log thoughtfully they were a friendly and sociable people these mountaineers all the more so because the opportunities for meeting sociably were limited the men had their work and the women their always large families to attend to and with a mile or so of rough road between themselves and their neighbours there was not much chance for enjoyable gossip when good fortune threw them together they usually made the best of their time consequently the mystery of two human beings who had shut themselves off with apparent intent from all intercourse with their kind was a difficulty not readily disposed of it was perhaps little to be wondered at that mr stamps thought it over and gathered carefully together all the points presenting themselves to his notice the subject had been frequently discussed at the crossroads postoffice the disposition to seclusion was generally spoken of as curisness and various theories had been advanced with a view to explaining the curisness in question airs had been suggested as a solution of the difficulty but as time progressed the theory of airs had been abandoned fur said uncle jake wooten who was a patriarch and an authority when a mans agwine to put on airs he kinder slicks up more a man thats airy he aint agwine to shut hisself up and not show out more like as not hed wear storeclothes an hang round n kinder blow n this feller dont do nary one n as to the woman lord i should think all youunses knows how womenfolks does thats airy ef this yere one wus that way shed be adressin in starched calikers n sunbonnets n bresspins n mebbe rings n congristgaiters shed be to the meetin every time there was meetin ashowin out n lettin on like she didnt know the rest on em wus seein it dont sound to reason that either on em is airy it had been suggested by a bold spirit capable of more extended flights of the imagination than the rest that they were northerners who for some unworthy object had taken up their abode within the bound of civilisation but this idea was frowned down as being of a wild nature and not to be encouraged finally the general interest in the subject had subsided somewhat though it was ready to revive at any new comment or incident which will explain the bodily awakening of the sleepers on the postoffice porch when mr stamps made his announcement of the approach of thet thar feller up to the moment when the impulse seized him which led him to take his place behind the counter as the stranger entered the store tom de willoughby had taken little or no part in numerous discussions held around him he had listened with impartiality to all sides of the question his portion of the entertainment being to make comments of an inspiriting nature which should express in a marked manner his sarcastic approval of any special weakness in a line of argument among the many agreeable things said of him in his past it had never been said that he was curious he was too indolent to be curious and it may be simply asserted that he had felt little curiosity concerning the popular mystery but when he found himself face to face with his customer a new feeling suddenly took possession of him the change came when for one instant the man as if in momentary forgetfulness looked up and met his eyes in speaking each moved involuntarily and tom turned aside ostensibly to pick up a sheet of wrapping paper the only words exchanged were those relating to the courtesies and the brief remarks heard by the loungers outside after this the stranger rode away and tom lounged back to his chair he made no reply to stampss explanatory aside and no comment upon the remarks of the company whose curiosity had naturally received a new impetus which spurred them on to gossip a little in the usual vague manner he gave himself up to speculation the mere tone of a mans voice had set his mind to work his past life had given him experience in which those about him were lacking and at the instant he heard the stranger speak this experience revealed to him as by a flash of light a thing which had never yet been even remotely guessed at a gentleman by thunder he said to himself thats it a gentleman he knew he could not be mistaken low and purposely muffled as the voice had been he recognised in it that which marked it as the voice of a man trained to modulated speech and even this was not all though it had led him to look again and more closely at the face shadowed by the broad hat it was not a handsome face but it was one not likely to be readily forgotten it was worn and haggard the features strongly aquiline the eyes somewhat sunken it was the face of a man who had lived the life of an ascetic and who with a capacity for sharp suffering had suffered and was suffering still but a gentleman and not a southerner tom persisted to himself a yankee as im a sinner and what is a yankee doing hiding himself here for it was such a startling thing under the circumstances that he could not rid himself of the thought of it it haunted him through the rest of the day and when night came and the store being closed he retired as usual to the back part of the house he was brooding over it still he lived in a simple and primitive style three rooms built on to the store were quite enough for him one was his sitting and bedroom another his diningroom and kitchen the third the private apartment of his household goddess a stout old mulatto woman who kept his house in order and prepared his meals when he opened the door tonight the little boarded rooms were illuminated with two tallow candles and made fragrant with the odour of fried chicken and hoecakes to which aunt mornin was devoting all her energies and for the first time perhaps in his life he failed to greet these attractions with his usual air of good cheer he threw his hat into a chair and stretching himself out upon the bedstead lay there his hands clasped above his head and his eyes fixed upon the glow of the fire in the adjoining room where aunt mornin was at work a gentleman he said half aloud thats it by jupiter a gentleman he remembered it afterwards as a curious coincidence that he should have busied his mind so actively with his subject in a manner so unusual with him his imagination not being sufficiently vivid to help him out of his difficulty to his own satisfaction he laboured with it patiently recurring to it again and again and turning it over until it assumed a greater interest than at first he only relinquished it with an effort when going to bed later than usual he made up his mind to compose himself to sleep good lord he said turning on his side and addressing some unseen presence representing the vexed question dont keep a man awake settle it yourself and finally sank into unconsciousness in the midst of his mental struggle about the middle of the night he awakened he felt that something had startled him from his sleep but could not tell what it was a few seconds he lay without moving listening and as he listened there came to his ear the sound of a horses feet treading the earth restlessly outside the door the animal itself breathing heavily as if it had been ridden hard and almost as soon as he aroused to recognition of this fact there came a sharp tap on the door and a mans voice crying hallo he knew the voice at once and unexpected as the summons was felt he was not altogether unprepared for it though he could not have offered even the weakest explanation for the feeling hes in trouble he said as he sat up quickly in bed somethings gone wrong he rose and in a few seconds opened the door he had guessed rightly it was the stranger the moonlight fell full upon the side of the house and the road and the panting horse stood revealed in a bright light which gave the mans face a ghostly look added to his natural pallor as he leaned forward tom saw that he was as much exhausted as was the animal he had ridden i want to find a doctor or a woman who can give help to another he said there aint a doctor within fifteen miles from here began tom he stopped short what he saw in the mans face checked him look here he said is it your wife the man made a sharp gesture of despair shes dying i think he said hoarsely and theres not a human being near her good lord cried tom good lord the sweat started out on his forehead he remembered what stamps had said of her youth and her pale face and he thought of delia vanuxem and from this thought sprang a sudden recollection of the deserted medical career in which he had been regarded as so ignominious a failure he had never mentioned it since he had cut himself off from the old life and the women for whose children he had prescribed with some success now and then had considered the ends achieved only the natural results of his multitudinous gifts but the thought of the desolate young creature lying there alone struck deep he listened one moment then made his resolve go to the stable he said and throw a saddle over the horse you will find there i know something of such matters myself and i shall be better than nothing with a womans help i have a woman here who will follow us he went into the back room and awakened aunt mornin get up he said and saddle the mule and follow me as soon as you can to the cabin in blairs hollow the wife of a man who lives there needs a woman with her come quickly when he returned to the door his horse stood there saddled the stranger sitting on his own and holding the bridle tom mounted in silence but once finally seated he turned to his companion now strike out he said there were four miles of road before them but they scarcely slackened rein until they were within sight of the hollow and the few words they exchanged were the barest questions and answers the cabin was built away from the road on the side of the hill and leaving their horses tethered at the foot of the slope they climbed it together when they reached the door the stranger stopped and turned to tom there is no sound inside he faltered i dare not go in tom strode by him and pushed the door open in one corner of the room was a roughly made bedstead and upon it lay a girl her deathly pale face turned sideways upon the pillow it was as if she lay prostrated by some wave of agony which had just passed over her her breath was faint and rapid and great drops of sweat stood out upon her young drawn face tom drew a chair forward and sat down beside her he lifted one of her hands touching it gently but save for a slight quiver of the eyelids she did not stir a sense of awe fell upon him its death he said to himself he had experience enough to teach him that he turned to the man you had better go out of the room i will do my best in a little over an hour aunt mornin dismounted from her mule and tethered it to a sapling at the side of the road below she looked up at the light gleaming faintly through the pines on the hillside i cum s fas s i could she said but i reckon id orter been here afore de lord knows dis is a curis casion when she crossed the threshold of the cabin her master pointed to a small faintly moving bundle lying at the foot of the bed over which he was bending take it into the other room and tell the man to come here he said theres no time to lose he still held the weak hand but the girls eyes were no longer closed they were open and fixed on his face the great fellow was trembling like a leaf the past hour had been almost more than he could bear he was entirely unstrung i wasnt cut out for this kind of thing he had groaned more than once and for the first time in his life thanked fate for making him a failure as he looked down at his patient a mist rose before his eyes blurring his sight and he hurriedly brushed it away she was perhaps nineteen years old and had the very young look a simple trusting nature and innocent untried life bring she was small fragile and fair with the pure fairness born of a cold climate her large bluegray eyes had in them the piteous appeal sometimes to be seen in the eyes of a timid child tom had laid his big hand on her forehead and stroked it scarcely knowing what he did dont be frightened he said with a tremor in his voice close your eyes and try to be quiet for a few moments and then he stooped to bend his ear to her lips which were moving faintly hell come directly he answered though he did not hear her directly its all right and then he stroked her hair again because he knew not what else to do seeing as he did that the end was so very near and that no earthly power however far beyond his own poor efforts could ward it off just at that moment the door opened and the man came in that he too read the awful truth at his first glance tom saw all attempts at disguise had dropped away his thin scholarly face was as colourless as the fairer one on the pillow his brows were knit into rigid lines and his lips were working he approached the bed and for a few moments stood looking down as if trying to give himself time to gain selfcontrol tom saw the girls soft eyes fixed in anguished entreaty there was a struggle and from the slowly moving lips came a few faint and broken words deaththeynever know the man flung himself upon his knees and burst into an agony of such weeping that seeing it tom turned away shuddering no he said they will never know they who loved youwho loved youwill never know god forgive me if i have done wrong i have been false that they might be spared god forgive me for the sin the poor child shivered she had become still paler and the breath came in sharp little puffs through her nostrils godgodgod she panted but the man did not seem to hear her he was praying aloud a struggling disjointed prayer o god of sinners he cried thou who forgivest thou who hast died forgiveforgive in this hour of death tom heard no more he could only listen to the soft panting breath sinking lower and lower suddenly the piteous eyes turned towards himthe strangeras if in great dread perhaps they saw in the mere human pity of his face what met some sharp last need he went to his old place as if in answer to the look and took the poor little hand once more closing the warmth of his own over its coldness he was weeping like a child dont be afraid he said not afraid itsits all right and almost as he said it with her eyes still fixed upon his own and with her hand in his she gave a low soband died tom touched the kneeling man upon the shoulder theres no need of that now he said its over chapter iv when a few minutes later he went into the back room he found aunt mornin sitting before the big fireplace in which burned a few logs of wood the light the snapping sticks gave fell full upon her black face and upon the small bundle upon her spacious knee as he entered she turned sharply towards him dont nobody keer nothin for this yere she said aint nobody comin nigh whars he dont he take no intrus in the pore little lonesome child i spect yoll haf to take it yeself mars de willerby while i goes in dar tom stopped short stricken with a pang of remorse he looked down at the small face helplessly yes he said youll have to go in there youre needed the woman looked at him in startled questioning mars de willerby she said does dat ar mean shes clar gone yes answered tom shes gone mornin with the emotional readiness of her race the comfortable creature burst into weeping clasping the child to her broad bosom pore chile she said an poor chile lef behin de lord help em bofe with manifest fear tom stooped and took the little red flannel bundle from her arms never mind crying he said go into the room and do whats to be done when left alone with his charge he sat down and held it balanced carefully in his hands his elbows resting on his knees he was used to carrying his customers children a great part of his popularity being based upon his jovial fondness for them but he had never held so small a creature as this in his arms before he regarded it with a respectful timidity it wasnt thought of he said reflectively even shepoor thing poor thing he ended hurriedly there was no time he was still holding his small burden with awkward kindliness when the door opened and the man he had left in the room beyond came in he approached the hearth and stood for a few seconds staring at the fire in a stupefied abstracted way he did not seem to see the child at last he spoke where shall i lay her he asked where is the nearest churchyard fifteen miles away tom answered most of the people like to have their dead near them and lay them on the hillsides the man turned to him with a touch of horror in his face in unconsecrated ground he said it doesnt trouble them said tom they sleep well enough the man turned to the fire againhe had not looked at the child yetand made a despairing gesture with his hands that she he said that she should lie so far from them and in unconsecrated ground there is the place i told you of said tom i cannot go there with the gesture again there is no time i must go away he made no pretence at concealing that he had a secret to hide he seemed to have given up the effort tom looked up at him what are you going to do with this he asked then for the first time he seemed to become conscious of the childs presence he turned and gave it a startled sidelong glance as if he had suddenly been struck with a new fear ido not know he stammered ino i do not know what have i been doing he sank into a chair and buried his face in his trembling hands gods curse is upon it he cried there is no place for it on earth tom rose with a sudden movement and began to pace the floor with his charge in his arms its a little chap to lay a curse on he said and helpless enough by gad he looked down at the diminutive face and as he did so a wild thought flashed through his mind it had the suddenness and force of a revelation his big body trembled with some feeling it would have gone hard with him to express and his heart warmed within him as he felt the light weight lying against it no place for it he cried by god there is there is a place hereand a man to stand by and see fairplay give her to me he said give her to me and if there is no place for her ill find one what do you mean faltered the man i mean what i say said tom ill take her and stand by her as long as there is breath in me and if the day should ever come in spite of me when wrong befalls her as it befell her mother some man shall die so help me god the warm southern blood which gave to his brothers lovesongs the grace of passion and which made them renowned for their picturesque eloquence of speech fired him to greater fluency than was usual with him when he thought of the helplessness of the tiny being he held i never betrayed a woman yet or did one a wrong he went on im not one of the lucky fellows who win their hearts with a great gulp in his throat perhaps if theres no one to come between us she maymay be fond of me the man gave him a long look as if he was asking himself a question yes he said at last she will be fond of you you will be worthy of it there is no one to lay claim to her her mother lies dead among strangers and her father for a few moments he seemed to be falling into a reverie but suddenly a tremour seized him and he struck one clenched hand against the other if a man vowed to the service of god may make an oath he said i swear that if the day ever dawns when we stand face to face knowing each other i will not spare him the child stirred in toms arms and uttered its first sharp little cry and as if in answer to the summons aunt mornin opened the door its all done she said gib me de chile mars de willerby and go in an look at her when he entered the little square living room tom paused at the foot of the bed all was straight and neat and cold among the few articles in the one small trunk the woman had found a simple white dress and had put it on the dead girl it was such a garment as almost every girl counts among her possessions tom remembered that his sisters had often worn such things she looks very pretty he said i dare say her mother made it and she wore it at home o lord o lord and with this helpless exclamation half sigh half groan he turned away and walked out of the front door into the open air it was early morning by this time and he passed into the dew and sunlight not knowing where he was going but once outside the sight of his horse tethered to a tree at the roadside brought to his mind the necessity of the occasion ill ride in and see steven he said its got to be done and its no work for him when he reached the crossroads there were already two or three early arrivals lounging on the storeporch and wondering why the doors were not opened the first man who saw him opened upon him the usual course of elephantine witticisms look a yere tom he drawled this aint agwine to do you agittin up fore daybreak like the rest of us folks and ridin off goddlemighty knows whar it aint agwine to do now whar air ye from but as he rode up and dismounted at the porch each saw that something unusual had happened he tied his horse and came up the steps in silence boys he said when he stood among them i want steven ive been out to the hollow and theres a job for him there thethe womans dead dead they echoed drawing nearer to him in their excitement when tom last night mornins out there theres a child thunder n molasses ejaculated the only family man of the group reflectively thunder n molasses and then he began to edge away still with a reflective air towards his mule boys he explained thered ought to be some women folks around im gwine for minty and shell start the rest on em women folks is whats needed they kin kinder organize things whar thars trouble well said tom perhaps youre right but dont send too many of em and let your wife tell em to talk as little as possible and leave the man alone hes got enough to stand up under before the day was over there were women enough in the hillside cabin half a dozen faded black calico ridingskirts hung over the saddles of half a dozen horses tethered in the wood round the house while inside half a dozen excellent souls disposed themselves in sympathetic couples about the two rooms three sat in the front room their sunbonnets drawn well down over their faces in the true mourners spirit one at the head of the bed slowly moving a fan to and fro over the handkerchiefcovered face upon the pillow a dead silence pervaded the place except when it was broken by occasional brief remarks made in a whisper she was a mighty purtylookin young critter they said a sight youngerlookin than her man whats the child gal gal thats a pity gals aint much chance of bein raised right whar theyre left haint they any folks neither on em nobody dont know nobody haint heerd nothin about em they wus kinder curis about keepin to themselves if either on em had any folkseven if they wus only sort o kinthey might take the chile mebbe they will seems to reason they must have some kineven if they aint nigh then the silence reigned again and the woman at the beds head gave her undivided attention to the slow regular motion of her palmleaf fan in the room beyond a small fire burned in spite of the warmth of the day and divers small tin cups and pipkins simmered before and upon the cinders of it aunt mornin varying her other duties by moving them a shade nearer to the heat or farther from it and stirring and tasting at intervals upon a low rockingchair before the hearth sat the wife of the family man before referred to she was a tall angular creature the mother of fifteen comprising in their number three sets of twins she held her snuffstick between her teeth and the child on her lap with an easy professional air i haint never had to raise none o mine by hand since martin luther she remarked ive been mighty glad on it for he was a sight o trouble kinder colicky and weakly never done no good till we got him off the bottle hed one cows milk too all the time i was powerful partickerler bout that id never have raised him if i hadnt bin n to this day martin luther haint what poleon and orlando is dis yere chile aint gwine to be no trouble to nobody put in aunt mornin shes a powerful good chile to begin with n shes a chile thats gwine to thrive she haint done no cryin uv no

ready now mis doty ef ye want it its the very bottle i raised martin luther on said mrs doty it brings back ole times to see it she takes it purty well dont she massy sakes how ferce she looks for sich a little thing later in the day there arose the question of how she should be disposed of for the night and it was in the midst of this discussion that tom de willoughby entered thar aint but one room i spose hell sleep in that said mrs doty n the lord knows he dont look the kind o critter to know what to do with a chile we haint none o us seen him since this mornin i guess hes kinder wanderin round does any of you know whar he is we might ax what he lows to do tom bent down over the child as it lay in the womans lap no one could see his face i know what hes going to do he said hes going away tomorrow after the funeral n take the child in a chorus no said tom professing to be deeply interested in the unclosing of the small red fist im going to take the child there were four sharp exclamations and for a second or so all four women gazed at him with open mouths it was mrs doty who first recovered herself sufficiently to speak she gave him a lively dig with her elbow now tom dwillerby she said none of your foolin this yere aint no time for it mars dwillerby said aunt mornin dis chiles mothers alyin dead in the nex room tom stooped a trifle lower he put out both his hands and took the baby in them im not foolin he said rather uncertainly im in earnest ladies the mother is dead and the mans going away theres nobody else to claim her he tells me and so ill claim her theres enough of me to take care of her and i mean to do it it was so extraordinary a sensation that for a few moments there was another silence broken as before by mrs doty waal she remarked removing her snuffstick and expectorating into the fire yeve allus been kinder fond o chillun tom and mebbe she aint as colicky by natur as martin luther was but i mus say its the curisest thing i ever heernhim agwine away an givin her clar up as ef he hadnt no sort o natral feelinsi do say its curis hes a queer fellow said tom a queer fellow theres no denying that that this was true was proven by his conduct during the time in which it was liable to public comment until night he was not seen and then he came in at a late hour and walking in silence through the roomful of watchers shut himself up in an inner chamber and remained there alone hes takin it mighty hard they said seems like its kinder onsettled his mind he haint never looked at the child once he did not appear at all the next day until all was ready and tom de willoughby went to him he found him lying on the bed his haggard face turned towards the window he did not move until tom touched him on the shoulder if you want to see her he said he started and shuddered what so soon he said so soon now tom answered get up and come with me he obeyed following him mechanically but when they reached the door tom stopped him ive told them a story that suits well enough he said ive told them that youre poor and have no friends and cant care for the child and ive a fancy for keeping it the mother is to lie out here on the hillside until you can afford to find a better place for herperhaps at your own home ive told the tale my own way im not much of a hand at that kind of thing but itll do ive asked you no questions no said the man drearily youve asked me no questions then they went together into the other room there were twenty or thirty people in it or standing about the door it was like all mountain funerals but for an air of desolateness even deeper than usual the slender pine coffin was supported upon two chairs in the middle of the room and the women stood or sat about the more easily moved weeping a little under the shadow of their calico sunbonnets the men leaned against the doorposts or sat on the wooden steps bareheaded silent and rather restless when tom led his charge into the apartment there was a slight stir and moving back of chairs to make way for him he made his way straight to the coffin when he reached it and looked down he started perhaps the sight of the white dress with its simple girlish frills and homelike prettiness brought back to him some memory of happier days when he had seen it worn before the pure childlike face had settled into utter calm and across the breast and in the hands were long slender branches of the thickly flowering wild white clematis half an hour before tom had gone into the woods and returned with these branches which he gave to one of the younger women put them on her he said awkwardly there ought to be some flowers about her for a few moments there reigned in the room a dead silence all eyes were fixed upon the man who stood at the coffin side he simply looked down at the fair dead face he bestowed no caresses upon it and shed no tears though now and then there was to be seen a muscular contraction of his throat at length he turned towards those surrounding him and raised his hand speaking in a low voice let us pray it was the manner of a man trained to rigid religious observances and when the words were uttered something like an electric shock passed through his hearers the circuitriders who stopped once or twice a month at the log churches on the roadside were seldom within reach on such an occasion as this and at such times it was their custom to depend on any good soul who was considered to have the gift of prayer perhaps some of them had been wondering who would speak the last words now as there was no such person on the spot but the trained manner and gesture even while it startled them by its unexpectedness set their minds at rest they settled themselves in the conventional posture the women retiring into their bonnets the men hanging their heads and the prayer began it was a strange appealone which only one man among them could grasp the meaning of though all regarded its outpouring words with wonder and admiration it was an outcry full of passion dread and anguish which was like despair it was a prayer for mercymercy for those who suffered for the innocent who might sufferfor loving hearts too tender to bear the bitter blows of life the loving hearts o god he cried the loving hearts who waitwho more than one woman looked up from under her bonnet his body began to tremblehe staggered and fell into a chair hiding his face shaking from head to foot in an agony of weeping tom made his way to him and bent over him come with me he said his great voice broken come with me into the air it will quiet you and we can wait untiluntil they come he put his arm under his and supported him out of the house two or three women began to rock themselves to and fro and weep aloud hysterically it was only the stronger ones who could control themselves he was standing at toms side then when they came out a short time afterwards walking slowly and carrying the light burden which they lowered into its restingplace beneath the pines he was quite calm again and made no sound or movement until all was over then he spoke to tom tell them he said that i thank them i can do no more he walked back to the desolate house and in a little while the people went their ways each of them looking back a little wistfully at the cabin as he or she rode out of sight when the last one was lost to view tom who had loitered about went into the cabin the man was sitting in the empty room his gaze fixed upon the two chairs left standing in the middle of it a few paces from each other tom moved them away and then approached him the child has been taken to my house he said you dont want to see it no is there anything else i can do no nothing else monotonously are you going away yestonight tom glanced around him at the desolation of the poor bare little place at the empty bed and the small trunk at the foot of it you are not going to stay here alone man he said yes he was answered i have something to do i must be alone tom hesitated a moment well he said at length i suppose ive done then goodbye goodbye he was answered the lordthe lord will reward you and then tom crossed the room slowly and reluctantly passed out and closed the door after him when he opened his own door he struck his foot against something and stumbled over it it was a primitive wooden cradlesomewhat like a box on rockersa quilt of patchwork covered it and upon the small pillow rested the round black head of his new possession he stopped short to regard it aunt mornin had left it there while she occupied herself with preparing supper in the kitchen it really looked quite comfortable gradually a smile established itself upon toms countenance by thunder he said here you are youngster aint you youve come to staythats what youve come for and being answered by a slight stirring of the patchwork quilt he put his foot out with much cautiousness touched the rocker and finding to his great astonishment that he had accomplished this much safely he drew up a chair and sitting down devoted himself with laudable enthusiasm to engineering the small ark with a serious and domestic air chapter v in two days time the whole country had heard the news the mystery of blairs hollow was revived and became a greater mystery than ever the woman was dead the man had disappeared the cabin stood deserted save for the few household goods which had been left just as they were on the day of the funeral not an article had been moved though the woman to whom tom de willoughby as the person most concerned handed over the discarded property did not find the little trunk and noticed that articles had been burned in the fireplace in the front room thar wus a big pile o ashes on the hath she said to her friends sorter like as if hed been burnin a heap a little things o one sort or nother it kinder give me cold chills it looked so lonesome when i shut the door arter the truck was gone i left the ashes alyin thar i kinder had a curis feelin about touchin on em nothing wouldnt hire me to live thar dwillerby said he reckoned i could hev moved right in ef i wanted to but lawsy i wouldnt have done it fer nothin but that which roused the greatest excitement in the community was tom de willoughbys course at first mrs dotys story of big toms adoption of the child was scarcely accepted as being a possibility the first man who heard it received it with a grin of disbelief this individual was naturally mr doty himself minty he said dont ye let him fool ye dont ye know tom dwillerby by this time yed orter its jest some o his gas dont ye spose he haint got no more sense whatd he do with it ye can believe it or not replied mrs doty sharply but hes gwine to raise that youngn as shore as your names job mornins got her this minute mr doty indulged in a subdued chuckle a nicelookin feller he is to raise a infant babe he remarked lord a massy if thet thar aint jest like one o his doggoned tales he is the derndest critter with reflective delight the derndest thar aint nothin in hamlin to come up to him but the next day even mr doty was convinced after his customary visit to the crossroads he returned to his family wearing a bewildered expression it became a sheepish expression when his wife confronted him on the doorstep wal job doty she remarked i guess youve found out by this time whether i was right or wrong wal answered mr doty throwing his saddle down on the porch i reckon i hev shes thar shore enough n it seems like hes gwine to keep her but i wouldnt hev believed it ef i hadnt seen it doggoned ef i would but lord its like him arter all and he brightened up and chuckled again i reckon he dont scarcely know what hes tuk in hand said mrs doty him answered mr doty tom lord taint agwine to trouble tom hell get along tom will tomd jus as lief as she wus twins as not mebbe liefer itd be a bigger thing for him to engineer n gas about ef she wus ef youd seen him bring her into the store to the boys n brag on her n spread hisself i reckon ye wouldnt hev minded bout tom why hes set on her minty areddy as set as he kin be the crossroads postoffice had indeed been the scene of a sort of informal levee held by the newcomer who had been thus presented to her fellowcitizens one man after another had dropped in to hear the truth of the story related and each one had been dumfounded at the outset by toms simple statement of fact yes im going to keep her boys he said shes in the back part of the house now according to my calculations shes drunk about three quarts of milk since morning and seems to stand it pretty well so i suppose shes all right there were a great many jokes made at first and a general spirit of hilariousness reigned but it was observed by one of the keener witted ones that despite his jocular tone there was an underlying seriousness in toms air which might argue that he felt the weight of his responsibility when the women began to come in as they did later in the day he received them with much cordiality rising from his chair to shake hands with each matron as she appeared come in to see her have you he said thats right shes in the back room walk right in mis simpson and mis lyle id like some of you ladies to have a look at her ill go with you myself and hear what you have to say he made the journey each time with a slight air of anxiety leading the way to the wooden cradle and standing over it like a herculean guardian angel listening attentively to all the comments made and all the advice given she seems to be getting on pretty well doesnt she he enquired lor yes said one matron jest keep her kivered up n dont let no air strike her n ye wont hev no trouble with her i reckon no air enquired tom in some trepidation none at all wal thets my way was the answer some folks does diffrent but i didnt never expose em none till they was moren amonth old newborn babies is tender things yes said tom good lord yes his visitor started at him perplexedly for a moment wal she said my man allus used to say they kinder skeered him long at the firsthe kinder felt as if theyd mebbe come apart or sumthin they allus sorter minded me o young mice wal you jest tell mornin to giv her es much milk as she calls fer an dont let it bile too long n shell come on fine the next visitor that entered uttered an exclamation of dismay yere gwine ter kill her she said thar aint a breath o air in the room n thar aint nothin a newborn baby wants more n plenty o air theyre tender critters n they caynt stand to be smothered up yell hev her in spasms afore the days over tom flung the doors and windows open in great alarm it is hot he said its hot enough out of doors but mis simpson told me to keep her shut up and i thought shed had experience enough to know jane simpson with illconcealed scorn shed orter shes had six to die in their second summer i reckon she told ye to give her halfbiled milk as often as she wanted it tom reflected in manifest trepidation she did tell me not to boil it too much and to give it to her when she called for it he said slowly wal if ye dont want ter kill her take my advice an bile it a good half hour n dont give it to her oftener than once in three hours shell cry fur it but ye neednt mind yell get used ter it i dont believe in lettin young uns hev nuthin out o their reglar time the next caller found tom somewhat discouraged he preceded her into the receptionchamber with less alacrity than he had shown in his previous visits she was a younger woman than the rest and when she reached the cradles side she bent down and rearranged the cover with a soft touch shes gwine to be a purty little thing she said shell be sorter darkcomplected but shes gwine to hev purty hair n eyes yell be right proud of her tom when shes grown n i guess shell be a heap o company to you lord with a motherly sigh it seems sorter curis her bein left to a man but youll do well by her tom youll do well by her i haint no doubt o that you was always mighty clever with children ill do all i can for her said tom though i suppose that isnt much the young womanshe had left her own baby in the store with her husbandpatted the little pillow lightly into shape yell larn a heap by watchin her she said jest watch her close n shell teach you herself what do you do about her milk anxiously ive been told to do several things said tom ive been told to boil it half an hour and not to boil it at all and to give her all she wanted and not to give her all she wanted im a little mixed about it wal i haint had but five but ive allus let it come to a bile an then kinder used my reason about givin it seems like the mejumer ye air with children the better but lordy i guess mornin knows she raised her young mistresss she kissed the child before she left it and when she reentered the store hurriedly took her own struggling offspring from its fathers arms settled its pink dress and sunbonnet with a nervous caressing motion and carrying it to the door stood with it pressed against her breast while she seemed to be looking out at the distant mountains she did not move until her husband had completed his purchases and came to her and when she followed him out to take her place in the waggon her eyes were bright and moist dont ye take the blairs holler road dave she said as he touched up his horses go round by joness whats yer notion louizy he asked taint nothin but a notion i reckon she answered but i donti dont want to hev to pass by that thar grave jest today take the other road and being an easygoing kindly fellow he humoured her and went the other way in the store itself the spirit of hilariousness increased as the day advanced by mailtime the porch was crowded and tom had some slight difficulty in maintaining order say boys he said theres got to be quiet here if we cant carry on the establishment without disturbing the head of the household at present asleep in the back room this postoffice has to close and you can get a new postmaster thatd suit you i daresay some fellow now that wouldnt halftend to his business not more than half and that hadnt legislative ability enough to carry on a precinct let alone a county you want a man of that kind i suppose thats what youre working for tom said one of the younger ones bring her out n lets see her youve been braggin on her all day but ye haint let us see her half a dozen others joined in the cry yes they said bring her out tom tom did not rise from his seat he tilted his chair back and balanced himself on his heels his hands thrust into his pockets boys he said ill bring her out on one condition and that is that there shall be no shines i wouldnt have her scared or upset for a good deal theres a joke in this sort of thing i daresay but it aint all joke if i bring her out and show her theres to be no crowding and no row it was agreed that there should be none and he left his chair and went to the inner room again when he returned the men who had been lounging in the porch had come in though perhaps not one among them understood his own unusual interest in the affair babies were not rarities in hamlin county every cabin and farmhouse in the region being filled to overflowing with whiteheaded sunburnt youngsters and yet when tom appeared there was a moment of silence the child was asleep its tiny black head resting peacefully against the huge chest of its bearer there was no trace of confusion or awkwardness in his face he seemed well content with his burden and perhaps it was the quiet of his manner as much as anything else which caused the slight hush to fall upon those around him at last a middleaged farmer stepped forward he gave the child a long and rather curious look gal aint it he enquired yes tom answered wal taint a bad thing fer her shes got some un to stan by her gals needs it tom gave her a long look too she was sleeping very quietly it might have been her mothers breast she was lying against well he said heres a man to stand by her and then he raised his head and looked at the rest of them boys he said thats a promise remember it and he carried her back chapter vi the rooms at the back had never seemed so quiet before as when at the close of the day he went into them they seemed all the quieter by contrast with the excitement of the past hours in the kitchen mornin was giving the final touches to the supper and in the room which was at once sittingroom and bedroom the wooden cradle had fitted itself in a corner near the fireplace and wore an air of permanent establishment remarkable to contemplate when one considered how unlookedfor an incident it was on the threshold of this apartment tom paused a moment such silence reigned that he could hear the soft faint breathing of the child as it lay asleep he stopped a second or so to listen to it then he stooped down and began to loosen his shoes gently as he was doing it mornin caught sight of him in passing the open door mars tom she said whats ye agwine fer to do im going to take them off he answered seriously theyll make too much noise the good soul in the kitchen chuckled now she said now mars tom dar ye go right now asettin out to ruinate a good chile stead o ustin it ter thingsasettin out ter ruinate it dont never tip aroun fer no chile dont ye never do it n ye wont never haf ter tippin roun jest spiles em tell ye mornin never tipped roun when she had em ter raise mornin started out right from de fust tom looked at the cradle shell rest easier he said and so shall i i must get a pair of slippers and he slipped out of his shoes and stood ready to spend the evening in his stockingfeet a solitary tallow candle stood upon the table shedding its yellow light upon all surrounding objects to the best of its ability and seeing that its flickering brightness fell upon the small sleepers face he placed it at the farther end of the high mantel shell be more comfortable he said and then sat down feeling at ease with his conscience mornin went back to her supper shaking her head by de time shes a year old dar wont be no managin her she said das allus de way wid de men folks allus too hard or too soft better leav her to mornin n ustn her to things right at de start there seemed little chance that she would be so ustened having finished his supper tom carried his pipe and newspaper into the kitchen ill sit here awhile he said the smoke might be too much for her and the paper rustles so wed better let her have her sleep out but when the pipe was out and the last page of the paper read he went back to his own room the small ark stranded in his chimney corner was attractive enough to draw him there it was a stronger attraction than it would have been to most men he had always been fond of children and curious concerning them there was not a child in the surrounding region who had not some remembrance of his rather too lavish goodnature a visit to the crossroads was often held out as a reward for circumspect behaviour and the being denied the treat was considered punishment heavy enough for most juvenile crimes ef yed had young uns of yer own tom yed hev ruined them shore the secretly delighted matrons frequently remarked youd let em run right over ye i reckon ye keep that candy thar right apurpose to feed em on now dont yer his numerous admirers whose affection for him was founded on their enjoyment of his ponderous witticisms and the humour which was the little leavening of their unexciting lives had once or twice during the past few days found themselves unprepared for and so somewhat bewildered by the new mood which had now and then revealed itself its kinder outer toms way to take things like he takes this it looks onnatral they said if they had seen him as he drew up to the cradles side they would have discovered that they were confronting a side of the man of which they knew nothing it was the man whose youth had been sorehearted and desolate while he had been too humble to realise that it was so and with reason if he had known lonely hours in the past eight years only the four walls of the little back room had seen them he had always enacted his role well outside but it was only natural that the three silent rooms must have seemed too empty now and again as he bent over the cradle he remembered such times and somehow felt as if they were altogether things of the past and not to trouble him again shell be life in the place he said when she sleeps less and is old enough to make more noise it will be quite cheerful he spoke with the selfcongratulating innocence of inexperience a speculative smile settled upon his countenance when she begins to crawl around andand needs looking after it will be lively enough he reflected shell keep us busy i daresay it was a circumstance perhaps worthy of mention that he never spoke of the little creature as it shell need a good deal of looking after he went on it wont do to let her tumble around and take care of herself as a boy might we must be tender of her he bent forward and drew the cover cautiously over the red flannel sleeve they think it a good joke those fellows he said but it isnt a joke with us is it young woman weve a pretty big job to engineer between us but i daresay we shall come out all right we shall be good friends in the end and thats a pretty nice thing for a lonely fellow to look forward to then he arose stealthily and returned to the kitchen i want you to tell me he said to mornin what she needs i suppose she needs something or other she needs mos evrything mars tom was the answer seems like she haint bin pervided fer t all no more n ef she was agwine ter be a youn tukky dat de lord hisself hed fitted out at de start well said tom ill go to barnesville tomorrow and talk to judge rutherfords wife about it shell know what she ought to have and after a few moments given to apparently agreeable reflection he went back to the room he had left he had barely seated himself however when he was disturbed by a lowsounding tap on the side door which stood so far open as to allow of any stray evening breeze entering without reaching the corner of the chimney come in said tom not in a friendly roar as usual but in a discreetly guarded voice the door was pushed gently open and the visitor stood revealed blinking with an impartial air at the light within dont push it wide open said tom come in if you are going to and leave it as it was mr stamps obeyed without making any noise whatever it was one of his amiable peculiarities that he never made any noise but appeared and disappeared without giving any warning making himself very agreeable thereby at inopportune moments he slipped in without a sound deftly left the door in its previous position and at once slipped into a chair or rather took possession of one by balancing himself on the extreme edge of it arranging his legs on the lower bar with some dexterity howdy he said meekly having accomplished this toms manner was not cordial he stretched himself put his hands in his pockets and made no response to the greeting which was upon the whole a rather unnecessary one as mr stamps had been hanging about the postoffice through the whole day and had only wended his way homeward a few hours before want anything he enquired mr stamps turned his hat around in his hands hurriedly no i dont want nothin tom he said then after a pause he added very softly i jest thought id step in where are you going asked tom the hat was turned round again whar wus i agwine deprecatingly whar oh ii was agwinei was agwine to marthys i guess youre pretty late remarked tom better lose no time its a pretty bad road between here and there so tis replied mr stamps apparently struck with the originality of the suggestion so tis he appeared to reflect deeply for a few seconds but suddenly his eyes began to wander across the room and rested finally upon the corner in which the cradle stood he jerked his head towards it its thar is it he enquired yes shes thar tom answered rather crustily what of it oh nothin nothin tom only its kinder curiskinder curis well said tom ive not begun to look at it in that light yet myself haint ye now softly haint ye tom then a faint little chuckle broke from himnot an intrusive chuckle quite the contrary a deprecatory and inadvertent sort of chuckle that aint me he ventured inoffensively ive been athinkin it was curis all along that aint going to hurt anybody responded tom lord no quite in a hurry lord no taint likely but it kinder intrusted meintrusted me findin out what i did and he ended with a gently suggestive cough tom thrust his hands deeper into his pockets and covered as large an area of floor with his legs as was possible without upsetting mr stampss chair and at the same time that stealthy little man himself oh found out he replied found out h he checked himself with much suddenness glancing at the cradle as he did so what did you find out he demanded unceremoniously and with manifest contempt lets hear mr stamps coughed again twant much mebbe he replied cautiously n then again mebbe twas it was kinder intrusting though thatthat thar was a good prayer o hisn warnt it yes admitted tom rather blusteringly i daresay it was i suppose you are a better judge of prayers than i am im a purty good judge on em modestly id orter be bein a classleader n uster kinder critykisin i dont never do it much in public myself but ive allus critikised them as did thet sounded more professionaller then they air mostlyunless comin frum them as has bin raised to it did it said tom yes it was more professionaller then he turned his hat again setting it more carefully on his knee he also fixed his eyes on tom with a harmless smile they wus northners tom started but managed to recover himself you might have mentioned that before he remarked with sarcasm i did said mr stamps along at the start tom but ye wouldnt none on ye believe me tom remembered that this was true it having been mr stamps who suggested the northern theory which had been so unitedly scouted by his hearers at the time of its propounding i haint stayed as stiddy in north carlina as the rest on em repeated mr stamps when i was younger i kinder launched out wunct i thought i could make money faster ef i wus in a more moneymakiner place n i launched out i went north a spell n was thar a right smart while i sorter stedded the folks ways n i got to knowin em when i seed em n heerd em talk i knowd her for one the minit i set eyes on her n heern her speak i didnt say nuthin much to the rest on ye cause i knows yed make light on it but i knowd it wus jest that ar way with the northerners well said tom its valuable information i suppose mr stamps coughed he turned his hat over and looked into its greasy and battered crown modestly it mout be he replied n then again it moughtent it moughtent be if thar wus nuthin else to go long with it they wus hidin sumthin ye know n they sot a heap on keepin it hid ef a body knowd the whole thing from the start thetd be intrustin n it ud be vallyable too valuable be d tom began but he checked himself once more on glancing at the cradle but mr stamps was so far interested that he did not read the warning he might have read in the suddenly repressed outbreak as he neared his goal he became a little excited and incautious he leaned forward blinking rapidly they wasnt no man n wife he said lord no n ef the two as knowed most on em n was kinder quickest at readin signs d kinder go partners n heve confydence in one another n sorter lay to n work it out n foller it up it ud be vallybler than stores or postoffices or farms to both on em and he leaned so far forward and blinked so fast that he lost his balance and almost fell off his chair it was tom who saved him from his fall but not from that tender consideration for his physical security which such an act would argue tom gathered up his legs and strode across to him almost before he had finished speaking for the time being he had apparently forgotten the cradle and its occupant he seized the little man by the back of his collar and lifted him bodily out of his chair and shook him as a huge mastiff might have shaken a rat agitating the little legs in the large trousers with a force which gave them for a few seconds the most active employment you confounded sneaking underhanded little thief he thundered you damned little scoundrel youyou and he bore him out of doors set him struggling astride his mule which was cropping the grass and struck that sagacious animal a blow upon her quarters which sent her galloping along the barnesville road at a pace which caused her rider to cling to her neck and body with arms and legs in which inconvenient posture he remained unable to recover himself for a distance of at least half a mile tom returned to the back room in some excitement as he crossed the threshold he was greeted by a shrill cry from the cradle he ruefully regarded the patchwork quilt which seemed to be struggling violently with some unseen agency doggone him he said innocently hes wakened herwakened her by thunder and he sat down breathing heavily from his bodily exertion and began to rock the cradle with a vigour and gravity which might have been expected to achieve great results if mornin had not appeared and taken his charge into her own hands chapter vii the next day tom went to barnesville he left the crossroads on horseback early in the morning and reached his journeys end at noon he found on arriving at the town that the story of his undertaking had preceded him when he drew rein before judge rutherfords house and having dismounted and tied his horse to the fence entered the gate the judges wife came out upon the porch to meet him with her baby in her arms she greeted him with a smile well she said i must say i am glad to see you the judge brought us a nice story from the country yesterday what have you been doing at the crossroads i told the judge i didnt believe a word of it there sit down in this chair and tell me right away well answered tom in a businesslike manner its true or i shouldnt be here today ive come to ask your advice aboutwell about things in general mrs rutherford uttered a little cry of delighted curiosity and surprise gracious she exclaimed i never heard such a thing mother turning her head to call to someone in the room beyond its all true about the baby do come and hear mr de willoughby tell about it she sat down on the steps of the porch laughing and yet regarding tom with a half sympathetic half curious look it was not the first time she had found him unexpectedly mysterious wheres the father she said didnt he care for the poor little thing at all the judge heard that he was so poor that he couldnt take care of it hadnt he any friends it has a kind of heartless sound to mehis going away that way he was poor said tom quietly and he had no relatives who could take the child he didnt know what to do with it ii think he had a chance of making a living out west andthe blow seemed to have stunned him and you took the baby put in mrs rutherford yes tom answered i took the baby is it a pretty baby yes said tom i think it is just then the judges mother came out and he was called upon to tell the story again when it was received with interest even more excited and wondering than before the older mrs rutherford exclaimed and looked dubious alternately are you sure you know what to do with it she asked well no said tom im not i suppose i shall have to educate myself up to it gradually therell be a good deal to learn i suppose but he did not appear at all discouraged and presently broached the object of his visit displaying such modest readiness to accept advice and avail himself of all opportunities for acquiring valuable information that his young hostess was aroused to the deepest admiration and when he proceeded to produce quite a large memorandum book with a view to taking an immediate list of all required articles and established rules she could scarcely contain her delight i want to do it all up in the proper way he said thereupon he was borne into the house and a consultation of the most serious practical nature was held piles of the last babys pretty garments being produced to illustrate any obscure point the sight of those garments with their embroidery and many frills fired tom with new enthusiasm he could not resist the temptation to pick up one after another of the prettiest and most elaborate and hold them out at arms length his fingers stuck through the sleeves the better to survey and display them to advantage yes he kept saying thats the kind of thing she wantspretty and with plenty of frills he seemed to set his heart especially upon this abundance of frills and kept it in view throughout the entire arrangements little mrs rutherford was to take charge of the matter purchasing all necessaries and superintending the work of placing it in competent hands why she said laughing at him delightedly shell be the best dressed baby in the county id like her to be among the best said tom with a grave face among the best whereupon mrs rutherford laughed a little again and then quite suddenly stopped and regarded him for a moment with some thoughtfulness he has some curious notions about that baby mother she said afterwards i can see it in all he says everyone mightnt understand it im not sure i do myself but he has a big kind heart that tom de willoughby a big kind heart she understood more clearly the workings of the big kind heart before he left them the next morning at night after she had put her child to sleep she joined him on the front porch where he sat in the moonlight and there he spoke more fully to her he had seated himself upon the steps of the porch and wore a deeper reflective air as he played with a spray of honeysuckle he had broken from its vine she drew up her rockingchair and sat down near him i actually believe you are thinking of that baby now she said with a laugh you really look as if you were well he admitted the fact is thats just what i was doingthinking of her well and what were you thinking i was thinking holding his spray of honeysuckle between his thumb and forefinger and looking at it in an interested way i was thinking about what name i should give her oh she said she hasnt any name no tom answered without removing his eyes from his honeysuckle she hasnt any name yet well she exclaimed they were queer people there was a moments silence which she spent in looking curiously both at him and his honeysuckle what was her mothers name she asked at last i dont know mrs rutherford sat up in her chair you dont know she was dying when i saw her first and i never thought of asking but her father i didnt think of asking that either and nobody knew anything of them i suppose he was not in the frame of mind to think of such things himself it was all over and done with so soon he went away as soon as she was buried mrs rutherford sank back into her chair its the strangest story i ever heard of in my life she commented with a sigh of amazement the man must have been crazed with grief i suppose he was very fond of his wife i suppose so said tom there was another pause of a few moments and from the thoughts with which they occupied it mrs rutherford roused herself with a visible effort well she said cheerily let it be a pretty name yes answered tom it must be a pretty one he turned the bit of honeysuckle so that the moonlight fell on its faintly tinted flower it really seemed as if he felt he should get on better for having it to look at and refer to i want it to be a pretty name he went on and ive thought of a good many that sounded well enough but none of them seemed exactly to hit my fancy in the right way until i thought of one that came into my mind a few moments ago as i sat here it has a pleasant meaningi dont know that theres anything in that of course but ive got a sort of whim about it i suppose its a whim what do you think looking very hard at the honeysuckle of felicia i think said his companion that it is likely to be the best name you could give her for if she isnt a happy creature it wont be your fault well said tom ive set out to do my best and id like to give her a fair start in every way even in her name though there maynt be anything in it but id like to do it i suppose its time i should be having some object in life ive never had one before and ive been a useless fellow well ive got one now by chance and im bound to hold on to it and do what i can i want her to have what chances i can give her on her side and it came into my mind that felicia he stopped to consult the honeysuckle as it were and jenny rutherford broke in yes she said felicia is the name for her and its a beautiful thought oh interrupted tom bestirring himself uneasily its a natural thought she needs all she can get to balance the trouble she began life with most other little chaps begin it in a livelier wayin a way thats more natural born into a home and all that its a desolate business that she should have no one but a clumsy fellow like me to pick her up and that there should be a shadow ofof trouble and pain and death over her from the first good lord with a sudden movement of his big arm lets sweep it away if we can the thought so stirred him that he turned quite around as he sat look here he said thats what i was aiming at when i set my mind on having her things frilled up and ornamented i want them to be what they might have been if she had been born of a woman who was happy and well cared for andand lovedas if she had been thought of and looked forward to and provided for in ain a tender wayas they say young mothers do such things you know how that is i dont perhaps ive only thought of it sometimes his voice suddenly dropping but he had thought of it often in his lonely back room one winter a few years ago when it had drifted to him that his brother de courcy was the father of a son mrs rutherford leaned forward in her seat tears rose in her eyes and she put her hand impulsively on his shoulder oh she cried you are a good man youre a good man and if she lives she will tell you so and love you with all her heart i will see to the little clothes just as if they were nellies own nellie being the baby or more properly speaking the last baby as there were others in the household and if there is anything i can ever do for the little thing let me do it for her poor young mothers sake tom thanked her gratefully i shall be glad to come to you often enough i reckon he said i guess shell have her little sick spells as they all do and itll help wonderfully to have someone to call on theres her teeth now anxiously theyll be coming through in a few months and then therell be the deuce to pay he was so overweighted by this reflection that he was silent for some minutes afterwards and was only roused by a question requiring a reply later the judge came in and engaged him in political conversation all the judges conversation being of a political nature and generally tending to vigorous denunciations of some candidate for election who belonged to the opposite party in barnesville political feeling ran high never running low even when there was no one to be elected or defeated which was very seldom the case for between such elections and defeat there was always what had been done or what ought to have been done at washington to discuss it being strongly felt that without the assistance of barnesville washington would be in a sorry plight indeed today the judge had been engaged in a livelier discussion than usual as he rode homeward with a select party of legal brethren from court at brownsboro and consequently made his appearance blustering and joyous he bestowed upon his wife a sounding kiss and with one arm around her waist shook hands with tom in a gust of hospitality speaking to both at once howdy jenny howdy tom its a coons age since weve seen you tom time you showed yourself how are the children jennyand whats tom scott been doing whats this we hear about that stray young one nice tale that is to tell on a fellow fowler heard it at brownsboro and like to have killed himself lord how hot its been im ready for supper jenny sit down tom as soon as i get through supper well have a real oldfashioned talk ive been suffering for one for three months jenny tell sophronia to spread herself on her waffles for ive been getting some mighty poor stuff for the last few days what do you think of thatcher running for the legislature lord lord what a fool that fellow is most unpopular man in the county and about the meanest too mean lord mean aint the name for it hell be beat so that any other man wouldnt want to show his head and it wont make a mark on him nellies asleep aint she jenny ive got to go and look at her and the rest of them dont you want to come along tom youre a family man yourself now and you ought to take an interest he led the way into the familyroom at the back and taking the candle from the high mantel moved it triumphantly over the beds in which the children slept heres tom scott he announced tom scotts got to have a crib to himself look at him now what do you think of that for a boy hes five years old next month and he about runs barnesville the boys round here are just ruining him with making much of him and setting him up to tricks he just lives round at the stores and the postoffice and what tom scott dont know aint worth knowing came home with six jackknives in his pockets the first day jenny turned him out in pantaloons the boys tried themselves to see who could do best by him you could hear them shouting and laughing all over the town at the things they got him to say i tell you hes a case tom is last election he was as stirred up as any of us hollered rah for collins until he was hoarse and his mother brought him home and gave him syrup of squills because she thought he had the croup what do you think he did now went into bartons store and ordered a bushel of chestnuts to be sent down to my account and brought em out and set on the horseblock and gave a treat for collins i was coming up home and saw the crowd and heard the hollering and laughing and there was tom in the middle baling out his chestnuts and hollering at the top of his voice come on boys all you collins men heres a treat for collins i thought collins would have died when he heard it he laughed until he choked and the next day he came to see tom and gave him a gold eagle and a colt he says he is going to give him a little nigger to look after it and hell do it oh tom scotts the boy hell be in the white house forty years from now hes making a beeline for it right now and he bent and kissed the little fellows sunburnt rosy cheek his mother and his grandmother cant do a thing with him he said rapturously and its as much as i can do to manage him oh hes a case is tom scott and with this tribute to his character he left him to his slumbers with his sturdy little legs occupying an extensive area of crib and his face resting on his small brown arm after this the judge went to his supper and consumed a large quantity of fried chicken waffles and coffee afterwards joining tom on the porch smoking his pipe and stigmatising thatcher in a loud and jovial voice as the meanest man in hamlin but for this resonant jovialness of voice his denunciation of the democratic party which was not his party might have appeared rather startling there isnt an honest man among them he announced not a durned one theyre all the same cut each others throats for a dime the whole caboodle oh damn a democrat anyhow tom taint in the nature of things that they should be anything but thieves and rascals just look at the whole thing its founded on lies and corruption and scoundrelism thats their foundation they start out on it and it aint reasonable to expect anything better of them good lord if i thought tom scott would join the democrats i believe id blow his brains out in his crib this minute toms part in this discussion was that of a largeminded and strictly impartial listener this was the position he invariably assumed when surrounded by political argument he was not a politician his comments upon political subjects being usually of a sarcastic nature and likely to prove embarrassing to both parties yes he said in reply to the judges outpourings youre right there aint a chance for them not an eternal chance you cant expect it and it aint all their fault either where are they to get their decent men from unless some of you fellows go over here you are without a liar or a fool among younot a durned onemade a clean sweep of all the intellect and honesty and incorruptible worth in the country and hold on to it too and then let out on these fellows because there isnt any left for em im a lazy man myself and not much on argument but i must say thats a weak place in your logic you dont give em a show at the startthats their misfortune oh go to thunder roared the judge amiably you dont know the first thing about it and never did thats where you failin politics the country would be in a mighty poor fix if we had many fellows like youin a mighty poor fix youre a good citizen tom but you aint a politician thats so said tom i aint good enough for your party or bad enough for the other when a mans got to be either a seraphim or a democrat there isnt much chance for an ordinary fellow to spread himself whereupon the judge in an altogether friendly manner consigned him to thunder again and evidently enjoying himself immensely proceeded to the most frightful denunciations of thatcher and his party the mere list of whose crimes and mental incapacities should have condemned them to perdition and the lunatic asylum upon the spot without further delay while he was in the midst of this genial loudvoiced harangue his wife who had been in the back room with the baby came out and on seeing her he seemed suddenly to forget his animosities and the depraved political condition of the country altogether becoming a placable easily pleased domesticated creature at once got nellie to sleep again have you he said putting his hand on her shoulder well lets go in and have some music come and sing the last rose of summer thats my favourite it beats all the newfangled opera things all to pieces he led the way into the parlour which was a large square room regarded by barnesville as the most sumptuous of reception chambers inasmuch as its floor was covered by a brussels carpet adorned with exotics of multifarious colours its walls ornamented with massively framed photographs and its corners fitted up with whatnots and shining haircloth seats known in hamlin county as tatertates and in that impressive character admired beyond expression its crowning glory however was the piano which had belonged to jenny rutherford in her boardingschool days and was the delight of the judges heart it furnished him with his most cherished recreation in his hours of repose from political conflict and argument inasmuch as he regarded his wifes performance seldom to be equalled and never surpassed and the soft pleasant voice with which she sang the last rose of summer and other simple and sentimental melodies as that of a cantatrice whose renown might have been worldwide if she had chosen to turn her attention to its development lord he said throwing himself into one of the shining armchairs theres nothing like music nothing under the shining sun music hath charms to soothe the savage breast this in his most sonorous quotation tones let a man get tired or out of sorts or infernal mad at a pack of cursed fools and musics the thing thatll set him straight every time if hes any sort of a fellow a man that aint fond of music aint of any account on gods green earth i wouldnt trust him beyond a broomstraw theres a mean streak in a man that dont care for music sure why the time the democrats elected peyton the only thing that saved me from bursting a bloodvessel was jennys playing my lodgings on the cold ground with variations i guess she played it for two hours handrunning because when i found it was sort of soothing me i didnt want her to break in on the effect by beginning another play it for tom jenny after youve sung awhile theres one thing ive made up my mind toif i had fifty girls id have em all learn music if they didnt know anythingnot the operatic kind you know but enough to teach them to sing to a man like jenny does go on jenny the sustaining and cheering effects of sophronias fried chicken and waffles probably added to his comfortable enjoyment which was without limit he leaned back in his armchair as far as the stiffly ornamented back would admit of his so doing and kept time with his head or his feet occasionally joining in on a chorus with startling suddenness in an evidently subdued roar which though subdued was still roaring enough and despite the excellence of its intention quite out of tune enough to cause the wax flowers in their wax basket on the table both done by jenny at boardingschool to shake under the glass shade until they tapped against its side with a delicate tinkle it was while this was going on that tom sitting near a side table picked up a book and almost unconsciously opened it and read its title having read its title an expression of interest showed itself on his countenance and he turned over a leaf or so and as he turned them over dipped into them here and there he had the book in his hand when jenny rutherford ended her last chorus and came towards him do you go much by this he asked she took it from him and glanced at it i brought tom scott up on it she said mother wasnt with me then and i was such a child i did not know what to do with him seems to be a good sort of book said tom and he turned over the leaves again it is she answered smiling at him there are lots of things in it every doctor dont know it was written by a woman thats the reason i reckon said tom he laid the book down and seemed to forget it but about an hour after when his bedroom candle was brought and he was on the point of retiring for the night he turned upon the threshold of the sittingroom and spoke to his hostess in the tone of one suddenly recollecting himself where did you say you got that book he inquired snuffing his candle with his thumb and forefinger i didnt say at all answered jenny i got it from brough bros baltimore oh there he remarked goodnight when he reached his room and shut himself in he set his candlestick on a table and proceeded to draw from his pocket the memorandumbook also producing the stump of a lead pencil then he made as he stood up before the lookingglass and in the flickering light of the candle an entry which was as follows advice to young mothers brough bros he made it with a grave countenance and a businesslike manner and somehow owing it may be to the small size of the room its low ceilings and many shadows or the flickering of the candle his colossal height and breadth of body and tremendous look of strength had never seemed so marked nor appeared so to overpower the objects surrounding him having completed the entry he shut up the book and returned it to his pocket with a relieved air if a man aint a young mother he remarked i guess he can get the good of it if he gives himself time and what she wantsrather hurriedlyis to get as good a start as if she had a young mother and he sat down and pulled off his right boot in so absorbed a frame of mind that he aroused presently with a start to find that he was holding it as if it had been made of much less tough material and required handling tenderly chapter viii he was on his way homeward early the next morning and by noon his horse had climbed the rising ground from which he could look down on the crossroads and the postoffice baking itself brown in the sun catching sight of the latter edifice he smiled a little and shook the bridle against his steeds warm neck get along jake he said im in a little more of a hurry to get home than usualseems that way anyhow the eagerness he felt was a new experience with him and stirred his sense of humour even while it warmed his always easily moved heart it had been his wont during the last eight years to return from any absence readily but never eagerly or with any touch of excited pleasure even at their brightest aspect with the added glow of fire and warmth and good cheer and contrast to winters cold and appetite sharpened by it the back rooms had always suffered from the disadvantage of offering no prospect of companionship or human interest to him after the supper had been disposed of and the newspapers read and the pipe smoked there had only been the fire to watch and it was quite natural to brood as its blaze died down and its logs changed to a bed of glowing cinders under such circumstances it was easy to fall into a habit of brooding too much and thinking of things which had better been forgotten when there was no fire it had been lonelier still and he had found the time hang heavily on his hands but now he said shaking his bridle again there she is and its quite queer by thunder how much she seems to give a man to think of and what will it be when she begins to talk and his smile ended in a jovial laugh which rather startled jake who was not expecting it and caused him to shy promptly she was not asleep when he entered her presence which was so unusual a state of affairs that he found it a little alarming hello he exclaimed theres nothing wrong i hope wid dat chile chuckled mornin delightedly i shd think not mars dwillerby dat ar chiles athrivin an acomin long jes like shed orter dar aint agwine to be nothin wrong wid dat chile thats a good thing said tom he sat down by the cradles side and regarded its occupant with an interest as fresh as if she had just appeared for the first time upon his horizon she had been imbibing a large quantity of milk and the effect of this nourishment had been to at once compose her spirits and slightly enliven them so she employed the passing moments by looking at tom with steadfast and solemn eyesnot perhaps very intelligently but still with a vacant air of interest in him in his character of an object why he said shes grown shes grown in thirtysix hours and shes improved too oh yes shes coming along nicely he touched her very carefully with his large forefinger a liberty which she did not resent or even notice unless the fact that she winked both eyes might be regarded as a token of recognition well have a box full of things here for her in a couple of weeks he said and then she can start out in lifestart out in life the last four words seemed to please him as he repeated them he touched her cheek again carefully as before and start out fair too he added fair and squareas fair and square as any of them he remained a little longer in his seat by the cradle talking to mornin asking her questions and delivering messages laden with advice from little mrs rutherford which instructions aunt mornin plainly regarded as superfluous now mars dwillerby she giggled in amiable scorn didnt i raise fo o my young mistess mornin aint no spring chicken dar aint nuffin bout chillun mornin haint heerd leeve dis yere chile to mornin she aint going to be left to anyone said tom cheerfully not to the best woman in hamlin county weve got to make up to her for two or three things and were going to do it having relieved himself of which sentiment he went to his place at the table and ate a mighty dinner during his enjoyment of which meal he did not lose interest in his small silent partner at all but cast proud glances and jocular sallies at her every few mouthfuls partaking of her as it were with his mountain trout and finding her add flavour and zest to his hot cornbread and fried ham when he had ended his repast with an astonishing draught of buttermilk and was ready to go into the store she had dozed off cosily again and was making the best of her opportunities so he only paused for a moment to give her a farewell glance yes he said feliciathatll do when you come to the meaning of it i dont know of anything else thatd seem to start her out as fairfelicia and though he said the word in a whisper it seemed to reach her ear in some mysterious way for she stirred slightly though not as through any sense of disturbance opened her eyes upon his big figure and closing them the next instant sank into soft sleep again with the faintest dawn or ghost of a baby smile upon her face so nestling under the patchwork quilt and sleeping the hours away in the small ark stranded in the chimney corner she began life felicia was received by talbots crossroads with some difference of opinion id rather had mirandy or lucretia said mrs doty flishyer aint nigh as showy as a heap o other names n like as not folksll be callin her flish now thars vangerline n clementine n everlyne thatd ha bin showier then flishyer tom put in mr doty with his usual enjoyment of his friends weakness and strength tom hed a notion bout it he said it meant somn bout her abein happy n he lowed itd kinder give her a start in the right direction its jes like tom hes full o notions when he gits started ill back him agin any man in hamlin fur notions when he gits started lord its jes tom all over through a disposition to take even names easily and avoid in all cases any unnecessary exertion mrs dotys pronunciation was adopted at once which was perhaps the principal reason for a fanciful change being made not long afterwards against flishyer tom rebelled loudly and without ceasing but without effect the fanciful change came about and was adopted in this wise in the course of a couple of weeks the box of little garments arrived from barnesville accompanied by a warmhearted note from jenny rutherford the unpacking of the boxwhich was not a large one though it seemed to contain an astonishing number of things most of them of great length and elaboratenesswas to tom a singularly exciting event so exciting that he found himself wondering and not at all sure that he understood it when he opened the boxmornin standing at his side her charge in her armshe did it with tremulous fingers and when having laid one article after another in a snowy drift upon the bed he drew back to look at them he found it necessary after a few moments inspection to turn about and pace the floor not uneasily but to work off steam as it were while mornin uttered her ejaculations of rapture i never seen nuthin like em afore mars dwillerby she said with many excitable giggles dis yer chiles agwine to take the flo shore as yo bawn sich a settin out as dat is shell git ter puttin on airs afore shes a year ole well hev ter give her a settin down wunce n a while to keep her straight mis rutherford she wus boun to do it up in style she wus tom took one hand out of his pocket and ruffled his hair with it and then put it back again your young mistresses now he suggested i suppose they are about such things as their mothers made for them lordy deys a heap finer mars dwillerbya heap finer dey wus rich folks chillun but dey never hed sich a settin out as dis yerenot one on em they didnt said tom with secretly repressed exultation well if they didnt i guess shell do they are rather nice i reckonand i meant they should be say mornin suppose you dress her up and let me show her to the boys he himself picked out the sumptuous longskirted garments she was to wear and watched with the deepest interest the rather slow process of her attiring he was particularly pleased with a wonderfully embroidered white cloak and lace cap which latter article he abstractedly tied on his great fist and found much too small for it his triumph when she was given to his arms he did not attempt to conceal but carried her into the store with the manner of a large victor bearing his spoils now look here boys he announced being greeted with the usual laughter and jocular remarks this aint the style of thing we want hand a man a chair his customary support being produced he seated himself in it keeping his charge balanced with a dexterity and ease quite wonderful to behold what we want he proceeded is a more respectful tone something in the elaborate chivalric style and were going to have it what we want is to come into this establishment feeling that theres no risk of our being scared or upset by any durned fool startling us and setting our delicate machinery wrong weve come here to stay and we expect to be more familiar with things as we grow older and the thing for us is to start out right without any disagreeable impressions we dont want to say when were brought in herewhy heres the place where that fool gave me such a start last week i wonder if hes here again what we want is to feel that heres a place thats home and a place that a persons likely to look forward to coming to with the view to ahi should say to a high old time of an agreeable description shes agoin to be a doggoned purty critter said a lounger who sat on a barrel near by she aint nuthin like her mother said another though she wus a purty critter when i seed her he had only seen her in her coffin she aint like her father put in another tom moved in his chair uneasily she wont be like either of them he said let that go there was a tone in his voice which more than one among them had now and again noticed with some slow bewilderment during the last few weeksa tone new to them but which in time they grew used to though they never understood its meaning kinder they used to say as ef he wus mad orruffed up though it warnt that exactly either black eyes haint she inquired the man on the barrel yes an har thats my kind er women black eyes an har and kinder spirity theyve more devil to em n is better able to take care of emselves shes got some one to take care of her answered tom thats my business youve got her mightily fixed up tom remarked mr doty who had just entered youll hev all the women in the country flocking up she sorter makes me think o the queen o sheby sheby she wus great on fixin every man who entered seeing her as she lay in state in toms lap was drawn towards her to stand and wonder at her vaguely there developed a tendency to form small and rather silent groups about her infancy was no novelty in this region of numerous progenies but the fine softness of raiment and delicate sumptuousness of infancy were more than one man having looked at her and wandered away was unable to resist the temptation to wander back again and finally to settle in some seat or box upon a barrel that he might the better indulge his curiosity and interest ye must hev spent a heap on her tom was said respectfully again and again the fact that a heap had been spent on her inspired the audience with a sense of her importance which amounted to reverence that she represented an apparently unaccountable expenditure was considered to reflect credit upon her however vaguely and to give her a value not to be lightly regarded to mr doty the idea of the queen of sheby appeared to recur persistently all his imaginings of the poetic the dramatic and luxurious being drawn from scriptural sources i cant think o nuthin else but sheby when i look at her he remarked several times she minds me more o sheby then anything else n scripter mintyll jest hev to come ter see her this boldness of imagery struck a chord in the breast of his hearers which responded at once it was discovered that more than one of them had been reminded in some indefinite manner of the same distinguished personage when she was considerble younger then in solomons time said one gentleman with much solemnity tom himself was caught by the fancy and when his charge was referred to occasionally in a most friendly spirit as sheby thar he made no protest against it its a thunderation sight better than flishyer he said and if it comes easier to you fellows ive no objection sheba aint bad theres a kind of swing to it and you cant get it very far wrong the others a good name spoiled and its a name ive a fancy for saving for her i gave it to herill save it for her and it shall be a thing between us two call her sheba if you like so it fell out that mr dotys oriental imaginings sealed her fate and gradually by a natural process felicia was abandoned for sheba even tom using it upon all ordinary occasions having in this manner begun life a day rarely passed in which she did not spend an hour or so in the postoffice each afternoon during the first few months of her existence tom brought her forth attired in all her broidery and it was not long before the day came when he began to cherish the fancy that she knew when the time for her visit was near and enjoyed it when it came she looks as if she did he said to mornin she wouldnt go to sleep yesterday after i came into the room and ill swear i saw her eyes following me as i walked about and when i carried her in after she was dressed she turned her head over her shoulder to look round her and smiled when she had done it and found nothing was missing oh she knows well enough when she gets in there the fancy was a wonderfully pleasant one to him and when as time went on she developed a bright baby habit of noticing all about her and expressing her pleasure in divers soft little sounds he was a happier man than he had ever thought to be his greatest pleasure was the certain knowledge that she had first noticed himselfthat her first greeting had been given to him that her first conscious caress had been his she was a loving little creature showing her affection earlier than most children do before she could sit upright she recognised his incomings and outgoings and when he took her in his arms to walk to and fro with her as was his habit at night she dropped her tiny head upon his shoulders with a soft yielding to his tenderness which never failed to quicken the beatings of his heart theres something in her face he used to say to himself something thats not in every childs face its a look about her eyes and mouth that seems to tell a man that she understands himwhether his spirits are up or down but his spirits were not often down in those days the rooms at the back no longer wore an air of loneliness and the evenings never hung heavily on his hands in the course of a few months he sent to brownsboro for a high chair and tried the experiment of propping his small companion up in it at his side when he ate his supper it was an experiment which succeeded very well and filled him with triumph from her place in the kitchen mornin could hear during every meal the sound of conversation of the most animated description toms big kind voice rambling cheerily and replied to by the soft and unformed murmuring of the child he was never tired of her never willing to give her up what i might have given to others if theyd cared for it was his thought i give to her and she knows it it seemed too that she did know it that from her first gleaming of consciousness she had turned to him as her friend her protector and her best beloved when she heard his footsteps she turned in mornins arms or in her cradle to look for him and when she saw his face her whole little body yearned towards him one afternoon when she was about eight months old he left her at the usual time mornin who was working had spread a big red shawl upon the floor and seated her upon it and when tom went out of the room she sat still playing in the quiet way peculiar to her with the gay fringe she gave him a long earnest look as he crossed the threshold a look which he remembered afterwards as having been more thoughtful than usual and which must have represented a large amount of serious speculation mingled with desire tom went into the store and proceeded to the performance of his usual duty of entertaining his customers he was in a jovial mood and having a larger number of visitors than ordinarily was kept actively employed in settling the political problems of the day and disposing of all public difficulties whats most wanted at the head of things he proclaimed is a man thats capable of exerting himself mis doty if you choose that calico job can cut it off for you a man who aint afraid of work help yourself jim lord whered this postoffice be if some men had to engineer ita man who would stand at things and loaf instead of taking right hold for heavens sake bill dont hurry jakell give you the tea as soon as hes cut off his wifes dress thats the kind of men we want in office nowin every kind of officein every kind of office if theres one thing ive no use for on gods green earth its a man with no energy nicholson just kick that box over here so i can get my feet on it he was sitting near the door which connected the back part of the establishment with the front and it was just at this juncture that there fell upon his ear a familiar sound as of something being dragged over the floor the next moment he felt his foot touched and then pressed upon by some soft unsteady weight he looked down with a start and saw first a small round face upturned its dark eyes tired but rejoicing and faithful and then a short white dress much soiled and dusted by being dragged over the bare boards of the two storerooms his heart gave a leap and all the laughter died out of his face my god boys he said as he bent down shes followed me shes followed me it was quite true she had never crawled far beyond the limits of the shawl before but this morning her longing had given her courage and strength and she had set out upon her journey in search of him those about him burst into loud admiring laughter but tom did not laugh at all he lifted the child to his knee and held her encircled by one arm she was weary with her exertion and settled at once into an easy sitting posture her head resting against him while she gazed quietly from under her upcurled lashes at the faces grouped about her their laughter did not disturb her now that she had reached her haven of safety to think of her afollowin him said mis doty n her never sot off nowhars afore the purty little critter lord tom shes agwine ter be a sight when shes grownwith them eyes and har an ter think of her aslippin off from mornin an makin up her little mind to follow ye ive never had a young un to try it that early in all ive raised lordy said mr doty shes as sot on tom s hes on her n ef ever a man wus a doggoned fool about a young un he is about thatn n fur bein a doggoned fooltriumphantlywhen he sets out ter be ill back tom agin any man in hamlin tom said but little he made no more jokes he kept the child with him through the rest of the day holding her upon his knee or carrying her out upon the porch when at suppertime he carried her back to the room she was asleep and he laid her in her cradle himself he moved about very quietly afterwards and ate his supper alone with frequent glances at the sleeper dont take her away he said to mornin when she came in leave her here n hev her awakin n disturbin uv ye mars tom she responded leave her here he said laying his hand on the head of the cradle shell not disturb me we shall get along finely together she was left mornin taking her departure with manifest disbelief in the practicability of the plan and then having drawn the cradle to his bedside tom put out the light and retired himself but he did not sleep for some time having flung his mighty body upon the couch he lay with his arms thrown above his head gazing at the darkness and listening to the soft breathing at his side he was thinking over the one event of the day what might have seemed a slight thing to many men had struck deep into his great heart my god he said a touch of reverential tone in his whisper to think of her following me and he stretched out his hand in the darkness and laid it upon the side of the cradle lightly and afterwards fell asleep chapter ix just at this time which was the year before the civil war that fashionable summer resort the white briar springs was at its gayest rarely before had the hotel been filled with so brilliant a company a few extra cases of yellow fever had been the cause of an unusual exodus from the fever districts and in consequence the various summer resorts flourished and grew strong the white briar especially exerted and arrayed itself in its most festive garments the great diningroom was filled to overflowing the waiters were driven to desperation by the demands made upon them as they flew from table to table and endeavoured with laudable zeal to commit to memory fifty orders at once and at the same time to answer comin sah to the same number of snapped fingers there were belles from louisiana beauties from mississippi and enslavers from virginia accompanied by their mothers their fathers their troops of younger brothers and sisters and their black servants there were nurses and valets and maids of all shades from ebony to creamcolour and of all varieties of picturesqueness all day the immense piazzas were crowded with promenaders sitters talkers fancyworkers servants attired in rainbow hues and apparently enjoying their idleness or their pretence at work to the utmost every morning parties played tenpins rode strolled gossipped every afternoon the daring few who did not doze away the heated hours in the shaded rooms flirted in couples under trees on the lawn or in the woods or by the creek every evening there was to be found ardent youth to dance in the ballroom and twice a week at least did this same youth arrayed in robes suited to honour the occasion disport itself joyfully and with transcendent delight in the presence of its elders assembled in rooms around the walls of the same glittering apartment with the intention of bestowing distinction upon what was known as the hop sometimes in dull seasons there was a scarcity of partners upon such occasions but this year such was not the case aside from the brothers of the belles and beauties before referred to who mustered in full force there was a reserved corps of cavaliers who though past the early and crude bloom of their first youth were still malleable material who could desire a more gallant attendant than the agile though elderly major beaufort who with a large party of nieces daughters and granddaughters made the tour of the wateringplaces each succeeding year pervading the atmosphere of each with the subtle essence of his gallantry and hilariousness i should be a miserable man sir proclaimed the major chivalrously upon each succeeding thursdayi should be a miserable man in seeing before me such grace and youth and beauty feeling that i am no longer young if i did not possess a heart which will throb for woman as long as it beats with life having distinguished himself by which poetic remark he usually called up a waiter with champagne and glasses in which beverage he gallantly drank the health of the admiring circle which partook of it with him attached to the beaufort party were various lesser luminaries each of whom it must be confessed might well under ordinary circumstances have formed the centre of a circle himself legal luminaries social luminaries political luminaries each playing tenpins and whist each riding each showing in all small gallantries and adding by their presence to the exhilaration of the hour there was one gentleman however who though he was not of the beaufort party could still not be considered among the lesser luminaries he was a planet with an orbit of his own this gentleman had ridden up to the hotel one afternoon on a fine horse accompanied by a handsome gloomy boy on another animal as fine and followed by a welldressed young negro carrying various necessary trappings and himself mounted in a manner which did no discredit to his owner the air of the party was such as to occasion some sensation on the front gallery where the greater number of the guests were congregated oh cried one of the beauforts what a distinguishedlooking man oh what a handsome boy and what splendid horses at that moment one of the other ladiesa dark quiet clever matron from south carolinauttered an exclamation is it possible she said there is colonel de willoughby the new arrival recognised her at once and made his way towards her with the most graceful air of ease and pleasure notwithstanding that it was necessary that he should wind his way dexterously round numerous groups in and out among a dozen chairs he was a strikingly handsome man dark aquiline tall and lithe of figure his clothes fitted him marvellously well at the waist his slender arched foot was incased in a marvel of a boot his black hair was rather long and his superb eyes gained a mysterious depth and mellowness from the length and darkness of their lashes altogether it was quite natural that for the moment the beauforts and their satellites should pale somewhat by comparison when he bowed over mrs marvins hand a thrill of pleasure made itself manifest in those surrounding them he spoke in the most melodious of voices the greatest of pleasures he was heard to say i did not expect this and then in response to some question my health sincesince my loss has been very poor i hope to recover strength and spirits with an air of delicate and gentle melancholy may i present my boyrupert in response to the summons the boy came forwardnot awkwardly or with any embarrassment but with a bearing not at all likely to create a pleasant impression the guests could see that he was even a handsomer boy than he had seemed at a greater distance he was very like his father in the matter of aquiline features clear paleolive skin and superb dark eyes his face had even a fineness the older mans lacked but the straight marks of a fixed frown were upon his forehead and his mouth wore a look which accorded well with the lines he approached and bared his head making his boyish bow in a manner which did credit to his training but though he blushed slightly on being addressed his manner was by no means a responsive one and he moved away as soon as an opportunity presented itself leaving his father making himself very fascinating in a gently chivalric way and establishing himself as a planet by the mere manner of his address towards a woman who was neither pretty young nor enthusiastic there was no woman in the hotel so little prone to enthusiasm as this one she was old enough and clever enough to have few illusions it was thought singular that though she admitted she had known the colonel from his youth she showed very little partiality for his society and indeed treated him with marked reserve she never joined in the choruses of praise which were chanted daily around her i know the de willoughbys very well she said oh yes very well indeedin a way we hear a good deal of them de courcys wife was a friend of mine this one is de courcy the other is romaine and there was one who was considered a sort of black sheep and broke with the family altogether they dont know where he is and dont care to know i suppose they have their own views of the matter oh yes i know them very well in a way when questioned by enthusiasts she was obliged to confess that the hero of the hour was bountifully supplied with all outward gifts of nature was to be envied his charm of manner and the air of romance surrounding him though in admitting this she added a little comment not generally approved of its a little of the troubadour order she said but i dare say no woman would deny that it is rather taking i dont deny it it is takingif you dont go below the surface never was a man so popular as the colonel and never a man so missed as he on the days of his indisposition he had such days when he did not leave his room and his negro was kept busy attending to his wants the nature of his attacks was not definitely understood but after them he always appeared wearing an interesting air of languor and melancholy and was more admired than ever the boy seems to feel it very much the lady remarked he always looks so uneasy and anxious and never goes away from the house at all i suppose they are very fond of each other i dare say he does feel it very much said mrs marvin with her reserved little smile he is de willoughby enough for that it was not agreed to that he inherited his fathers grace of manner however he was a definitely unamiable boy if one might judge from appearances he always wore a dark little scowl as if he were either on the point of falling into a secret rage or making his way out of one instead of allowing himself to be admired and made a pet of he showed an unnatural preference for prowling around the grounds and galleries alone sometimes sitting in corners and professing to read but generally appearing to be meditating resentfully upon his wrongs in a manner which in a less handsome boy would have been decidedly unpleasant even mrs marvins advances did not meet with any show of cordiality though it was allowed that he appeared less averse to her society than to that of any other woman including the half dozen belles and beauties who would have enjoyed his boyish admiration greatly i knew your mother said mrs marvin to him one day as he sat near her upon the gallery did you he answered in a rather encouraging way when did you know her when she was young we were girls together she was a beauty and i wasnt but we were very fond of each other he gave his closed book a sullen look what makes women break so he asked i dont see why they break so she had pretty eyes when she died but he drew his handsome black brows down and scowled and seeing that he was angry at himself for having spoken mrs marvin made another remark you miss her very much she said gravely he turned his face away shes better off where she is i suppose he said thats what they always say of dead people and then still frowning he got up and walked away the negro servants about the hotel were all fond of him though his manner towards them was that of a fiery and enthusiastic young potentate brooking no delay or interference his beauty and his highhanded way impressed them as being the belongings of one favoured by fortune and worthy of admiration and respect hes a dwilloughby out and out said his fathers negro tip aint no mistake bout dat hes a young devil when his spirits up n its easy raised but hes a powerful genlman sort o boypowerful throws you a quarter soons look at ye n hes got the right kind o high waysdough der aint no sayin he aint a young devil de kurnel hisself caynt outcuss him when his spirits up the colonel and his son had been at the springs a month when the fancydress ball took place which was the occasion of a very unpleasant episode in the annals of this summer for several days before the greatest excitement had prevailed at the hotel a pleasant air of mystery had prevailed over the preparations that were being made the rural proprietors of the two stores in which the neighbourhood rejoiced were driven to distraction by constant demands made upon them for articles and materials of which they had never before heard and which were not procurable within a hundred miles of the place bedrooms were overflowing with dresses in process of alteration from ordinary social aspects to marvellous combinations of imagination and ingenuity while an amiable borrowing and exchanging went on through all the corridors on the day before the ball the colonels popularity reached its height as it was the time of a certain local election there was held upon the grounds a political meeting giving such individuals as chose to avail themselves of it the opportunity of expressing their opinions to the assembled guests and the thirty or forty mountaineers who had suddenly and without any warning of previous existence appeared upon the scene the colonel had been one of the first called upon and to the delight of his admirers he responded at once with the utmost grace to the call when he ascended the little platform with the slow light step which was numbered among his chief attractions and stood before his audience for a moment looking down at them gently and reflectively from under his beautiful lashes a throb of expectation was felt in every tender bosom his speech fell short of no desire being decided to be simple perfection his soft voice his quiet ease of movement his eloquence were all that could be hoped for from mortal man he mentioned with highbred depreciation the fact that he could not fairly call himself a politician unless as any son of the fair south must be one at least at heart however devoid of the gifts which have made her greatest heard from continent to continent he was only one of the many who had at stake their cherished institutions the homes they loved the beloved who brightened those homes and their own happiness as it was centred in those homes and irrevocably bound in that of the fairest land upon which the fair sun shone the applause at this juncture was so great as to oblige him to pause for a few moments but it was to be regretted that nine out of ten of the mountaineers remained entirely unresponsive crossing their jeancovered legs and rubbing their lean and grizzled jaws in a soulless manner they displayed this apathetic indifference to the most graceful flight of rhetoric to the most musical appeals to the hearts of all men loving freedom to the announcement that matters had reached a sad and significant crisis that the peculiar institutions left as a legacy by their forefathers were threatened by the northern fanatics and that in the near future the blood of patriots might be poured forth as a libation upon the soil they loved to eloquent denunciations of the hirelings and wouldbe violators of our rights under the constitution to all these they listened evidently devoting all their slow energies to the comprehension of it but they were less moved than might have been expected of men little used to oratory but it was the termination of the speech that stirred all hearts with a dexterity only to be compared to its easy grace the orator left the sterner side of the question for a tenderer one to which he had already referred in passing and which was the side of all political questions which presented themselves to such men as he every man it was to be hoped knew the meaning of home and love and tenderness in some form however poor and humble and unpatriotic to every man was given a mans privilege of defending the rights and sacredness of this home this love with his strength with his might with the blood of his beating heart if need be to a southern man as to all men his right to be first in his own land in ruling in choosing rulers in carrying out the laws meant his right to defend this home and that which was precious to him within it there were a few before him upon this summers day alas alas that fate should will it so who had not somewhere a grave whose grass moved in the softness of the wind over dead loves and hopes cherished even in this hour as naught else was cherished and these graves he faltered and paused glancing towards the doorway with a singular expression for a few seconds he could not go on he was obliged to raise to his lips the glass of water which had been provided for him oh was sighed softly through the room his emotion has overpowered him poor fellow how sad he looks mrs marvin simply followed the direction his eyes had taken she was a practical person the object her eye met was the figure of the boy who had come in a few minutes before he was leaning against the doorpost attired in a cool suit of white linen his hands in his pockets the expression of his handsome darkling young face a most curious one he was staring at his father steadily his fine eyes wide open holding a spark of inward rage his nostrils dilated and quivering he seemed bent upon making the orator meet his glance but the orator showed no desire to do so he gave his sole attention to his glass of water to this clever elderly southern matron it was an interesting scene if he sprang up in two minutes and threw something deadly and murderous at him she said to herself i should not be in the least surprised and i should not be the first to blame him but the rest of the audience was intent upon the colonel who recovering himself finished his harangue with an appeal that the land made sacred by those loves those homes those graves might be left solely in the hands of the men who loved it best who knew its needs who yearned for its highest development and who when the needful hour arrived would lay down their lives to save its honour when he concluded and was on the point of seating himself very quietly without any appearance of being conscious of the great sensation he had created and still wearing an admirable touch of melancholy upon his fine countenance major beaufort rushed towards him almost upsetting a chair in his eagerness and grasped his hand and shook it with a congratulatory ardour so impressive and enthusiastic as to be a sensation in itself there were other speeches afterwards fired by the example of his friend major beaufort distinguished himself by an harangue overflowing with gallantry and adorned throughout with amiable allusions to the greatest power of all the power of youth beauty and womanhood the political perspicuity of the address was perhaps somewhat obscured by its being chivalrously pointed towards those fair beings who brighten our existence and lengthen our griefs without the ladies the speaker found we may be politicians but we cannot be gentlemen he discovered upon the spot and with a delicate suggestion of pathos that by a curious coincidence the ladies were the mens mothers their wives their sisters their daughters this being greatly applauded he added that over these husbands these fathers these brothersand might be added these loversthe ladies wielded a mighty influence the position of woman even in the darkest ages had been the position of one whose delicate hand worked the lever of the world but today in these more enlightened times in the age of advancement and discovery before what great and sublime power did the nobleman the inventor the literary man the warrior bow as he bowed before the shrine of the ladies but it was the colonel who bore away the palm and was the hero of the hour when the audience rose he was surrounded at once by groups of enthusiasts who shook hands with him who poured forth libations of praise who hung upon his every word with rapture how proud of you he must be said one of the fairest in the group of worshippers boys of his age feel things so strongly i wonder why he doesnt come forward and say something to you he is too shy i suppose i dare say said the colonel with his most fascinating gentle smile one must not expect enthusiasm of boys i have no doubt he thought it a great bore and wondered what i was aiming at impossible exclaimed the fair enslaver dont do him an injustice colonel de willoughby but as she glanced towards the doorway her voice died down and the expression of her face changed somewhat the boystill with his hands in his pocketswas looking on with an air which was as insolent as it was remarkable an air of youthful scorn and malignant derision which staggered even the enthusiast she turned uneasily to the colonel who faintly smiled he is a handsome fellow he said and i must own to being a vain parent but he has a demon of a temper and he has been spoiled hell get over it when he is older it was a great blow to his admirers when it became known the next morning that the colonel was suffering from one of his attacks and even a worse one than usual neb was shut up in his room with him all day and it was rumoured that the boy would not come down but wandered up and down the corridors restlessly looking miserable enough to have touched the stoniest heart during the morning quite a gloom pervaded the atmosphere only the excitement of preparations for the evening could have proved an antidote to the general depression it was to be a brilliant occasion the county had been scoured for guests some of whom were to travel in their carriages from other wateringplaces for twenty or thirty miles the ballroom had been decorated by a committee of ladies the costumes it was anticipated would be dazzling beyond measure no disappointment was felt when the festal hour arrived but the very keen emotion attendant upon the absence of the interesting invalid if he had only been well enough to be here it was said how he would have enjoyed it major beaufort attired as a sultan and appropriately surrounded by his harem in sarsenet trousers and spangled veils gave universal satisfaction minnehaha in feathers and moccasins and hiawatha in moccasins and feathers gave a touch of mild poetry to the evening sisters of charity in white cambric caps told their beads through the mazes of the lancers night and morning attired respectively in black and white tarletan and both profusely adorned with silver paper stars combined their forces to add romance and vividness to the festive scene there had been dancing and flirtation upon which those of the guests who did not join gazed for an hour or so as they sat in the chairs arranged around the walls doubtless enjoying themselves intensely and the gaiety was at its height when some commotion became manifest at one of the doors those grouped about it appeared to be startled at finding something or somebody behind them and almost immediately it was seen that this something or somebody was bent upon crowding past them a loud insanesounding laugh was heard the dancers stopped and turned towards it with one accord their alarm and astonishment depicted on their faces the spectators bent forward in their seats what is it was the general exclamation oh oh this last interjection took the form of a chorus as two of the group at the doorway were pushed headlong into the room and a tall unsteady halfdressed figure made its violent entrance at the first glance it was not easy to recognize it it was simply the figure of a very tall man in an ungirt costume composed of shirt and pantaloons he was crushed and dishevelled his hair hung over his forehead he strode into the middle of the quadrille and stood with his hands in his pockets swaying to and fro with a stare at once malicious and vacant oh he remarked sardonically as he took in his surroundings and then everyone recognized at once that it was colonel de willoughby and that colonel de willoughby was mad drunk he caught sight of major beaufort and staggered towards him with another frantic laugh good god major he cried how becomin tis how damned becomin harem an all only trouble is youre too fattoo fat if you werent so fat wouldnt look such a damned fool it was to be regretted there was no longer an air of refinement about his intoxication no suggestion of melancholy grace no ghost of his usual highbred suavity with his laugh and stare and unsteady legs he was simply a more drunken lunatic than one generally sees there was a rush at him from all sidesmajor beaufort in his turkish trousers being the first to fall upon him and have his turban stamped upon in the encounter he was borne across the room shouting and struggling and indulging in profanity of the most frightful kind just as they got him to the door his black boy neb appeared looking ashen with fright de lord o massey he cried i aint lef him moren a minit he sent me down hisself one o his cunnin ways to get rid o me when hes at de wust opium n whiskey dats what gets him dis way bof togedder agwine ter kill him some dese days n de opium am de wustest for de lords sake some o you genmen cum n hep me till i git him quieted down it was all over in a few moments but the effort made to return to hilariousness was a failure the shock to the majority of the gay throng had been great mrs marvin sitting in her special corner was besieged with questions and at length was prevailed upon through the force of circumstances to speak the truth as she knew it has he ever done it before she said yes he has done it beforehe has done it a dozen times since he has been here only tonight he was madder than usual and got away from his servant what is it it is opium when it isnt whiskey and whiskey when it isnt opium and oftenest it is both together he is the worst of a bad lot and if you havent understood that miserable angry boy before you may understand him now his mother died of a broken heart when he was twelve years old and he watched her die of it and knew what killed her and is proud enough to feel the shame that rests upon him thats as much as i care to say and yet it isnt the half when those bearing the colonel to his room turned into the corridor leading to it they encountered his son who met them with a whitelipped rage startling to every man of them in its incongruous contrast to the boyish face and figure what he said panting youve got him have you yes responded the colonel hilariously ve got me safe nuff pick me up ad car me if man wont go out tote m out they carried him into his rooms and laid him down and more than one among them turned curiously to the boy as he stood near the bed looking down at the dishevelled incoherent gibbering object upon it damn him he said in a sudden outburst damn him hello youngster said one of the party thats not the thing exactly go to the devil roared the lad livid with wrath and shame do you think ill not say what i please a nice one he is for a fellow to have for a fatherto be tied to and dragged about bydrinking himself mad and disgracing himself after his palaver and sentiment and playing the gentleman he ought to be a gentlemanhes got a gentlemans name andchoking a littleall the rest of it i hate him he makes me sick i wish he was dead hes a liar and a bully and a fool id kill him if he wasnt my father i should like to kill him for being my father suddenly his voice faltered and his face turned white he walked to the other side of the room turning his back to them all and flinging himself into a chair dropped his curly head on his arm on the windowsill and sobbed aloud with a weakness and brokendown fury pitiful to see the colonel burst into a frantic shriek of laughter queer little devil he said prou litl devil likes mothdon like it moth used er cry she didnt like it chapter x as the crossroads had regarded tom as a piece of personal property to be proud of so it fell into the habit of regarding his protegee the romance of her history was considered to confer distinction upon the vicinity and toms affection for her was approved of as a sentiment worthy of the largeness of the crossroads nature they kinder set one anuther off it was frequently remarked her abein so little and him so big an both of em stickin to each other so clost lordy taint no use atryin to part em sheby she aint agoin nowhar thout tom an tom he haint agoin nowhars thout sheby when the child was five years old the changes which had taken place in the store were followed by still greater changes in the house up to her fifth birthday the experiences had balanced themselves between the store and the three back rooms with their bare floors and rough walls she had had her corner her small chair behind the counter or near the stove and there she had amused herself with her playthings through long or short days and in the evening tom had taken her upon his shoulder and carried her back to the house as it was called leaving his careless roystering gaiety behind him locked up in the store ready to be resumed for the edification of his customers the next morning he dont hev no pore folkses ways wid dat chile said mornin once to mrs doty he dont never speak to her no other then genleman way hes araisin her to be fitten fur de highes hes mighty keerful ob her way ob speakin an settin to

keerful is mars dwillerby waal said mrs doty ef twarnt tom dwillerby i shed say it was a puttin on airs but thar aint no airs bout tom dwillerby from the first mr stampss interest in toms protegee had been unfailing though quiet when he came into the store which he did some three times a week it was his habit to fix his small pale eyes upon her and follow her movements stealthily but with unflagging watchfulness occasionally this occupation so absorbed him that when she moved to her small corner behind the counter vaguely oppressed by his surveillance he sauntered across the room and took his seat upon the counter itself persisting in his mild furtive gaze until it became too much for her and she sought refuge at toms knee he looks at me she burst out distressedly on one such day dont let him look at me tom gave a start and turned round and mr stamps gave a start also at once mildly recovering himself leave her alone said tom what are you lookin at her for mr stamps smiled thars no law agin it tom he replied an shes wuth a lookin at shes that kind an itll grow on her ten year from now thar aint no law es ed keep em from lookin at her thout it was made an passed in congrist shell hev to git reckonciled to abein looked at leave her alone repeated tom quite fiercely ill not have her troubled i didnt go to trouble her tom said mr stamps softly and he slipped down from the counter and sidled out of the store and went home with mr stamps sheba always connected her first knowledge of the fact that her protectors temper could be disturbed she had never seen him angry until she saw mr stamps rouse him to wrath on the eventful fifth birthday from which the first exciting events of her life dated themselves up to that time she had seen only in his great strength and broad build a power to protect and shield her own fragility and smallness from harm or fear when he took her in his huge arms and held her at what seemed to be an incredible height from the ordinary platform of existence she had only felt the cautious tenderness of his touch and recognised her own safety and it had never occurred to her that his tremendous voice which was so strong and deep by nature that it might have been a terrible one if he had chosen to make it so could express any other feeling than kindliness in its cheery roar but on this fifth birthday tom presented himself to her childish mind in a new light she had awakened early to find him standing at her small bedside and a new doll lying in her arms it was a bigger doll than she had ever owned before and so gaily dressed that in her first rapture her breath quite forsook her when she recovered it she scrambled up holding her new possession in one arm and clung with the other around toms neck oh the lovely lovely doll she cried and then hid her face on his shoulder hallo said tom hugging her what is she hiding her eyes for she nestled closer to him with a little sob of loving delight becausebecause of the doll she answered bewildered by her own little demonstration and yet perfect in her confidence that he would understand her well said tom cheerfully thats a queer thing aint it look here did you know it was your birthday five years old todaythink of that he sat down and settled her in her usual place on his knee her doll in her arms to think he said of her setting up a birthday on purpose to be five years old and have a doll given her thats a nice business aint it after they had breakfasted together in state the doll was carried into the store to be played with there it was a wet day and the air being chilled by a heavy mountain rain a small fire was burning in the stove and by this fire the two settled themselves to enjoy the morning together the weather precluding the possibility of their being disturbed by many customers but in the height of their quiet enjoyment they were broken in upon by the sound of horses hoofs splashing in the mud outside and mr stampss hat appeared above the windowsill it was sheba who saw it first and in the strength of her desire to avoid the wearer she formed a desperate plan she rose so quietly that tom who was reading a paper did not hear her and having risen drew her small chair behind the counter in the hope that finding her place vacant the visitor would not suspect her presence in this she was not disappointed having brushed the mud from his feet on the porch mr stamps appeared at the doorway and after his usual precautionary glance about him made his way to the stove his manner was at once propitiatory and friendly he drew up a chair and put his wet feet on the stove where they kept up a comfortable hissing sound as they dried howdy tom he said howdy and from her hidingplace sheba saw him rubbing his legs from the knee downwards as he said it with an air of solid enjoyment which suggested that he was congratulating himself upon something he had in his mind morning responded tom mr stamps rubbed his legs again quite luxuriously youre a lookin well tom he remarked lord yes yere a lookin powerful well tom laid his paper down and folded it on his knee lookin well am i he answered well im a delicate weakly sort of fellow in general i am and its encouraging to hear that im looking well mr stamps laughed rather spasmodically i wouldnt be agin bein the same kind o weakly myself he said nor the same kind o delycate youre a powerfle hansum man tom yes replied tom drily im a handsome man thats what carried me along this far its what ive always had to rely onthat and a knockdown intellect mr stamps rubbed his legs with his air of luxury again folks is fond o sayin beauty aint but skin deep he said but i wouldnt hev it no deeper myselfbein so that it kivers an talkin o beauty shes onelord yes shes one look here said tom leave her alone taint a gwine to harm her tom replied mr stamps taint a gwine to harm her none what made me think of it was it a bein jest five years since she was borna makin it her birthday an her jest five years old what cried tom youve been counting it up have you no replied mr stamps with true modesty of demeanour i aint ben a countin of it up tom and he drew a dirty memorandum book softly from his pocket i set it down at the time es it happened he laid the dirty book on his knee and turned over its pages carefully as if looking for some note i aint much on readin an writin he said an rithmetick it goes kinder hard with me now an agin but a mans got to know suthin on em if he lows to keep anyways even i low to keep even sorter an ive give a good deal o time to steddyin of em i never went to no school but ive sot things down es i want to remember an i kin count out money i never was imposed on none i rekin an i never lost nothin yeres whar i sot it down about her abein born an the woman adyin an him agwine away ye caynt read it mebbe he bent forward pointing to the open page and looking up at tom as if he expected him to be interested thar it is he added in his thin piping little voice even to the time o day mornin she told me that bout three oclock in the mornin in thet thar little front room ef anyone shed ever want to know particular thar it is the look in toms face was far from being a calm one he fidgetted in his chair and finally rolled his paper into a hard wad and threw it at the counter as if it had been a missile see here he exclaimed take my advice and let that alone mr stamps regarded his dirty book affectionately taint agwine to hurt nothin to hev it down he replied with an air of simplicity he shut it up returned it to his pocket and clasped his hands about his knees while he fixed his eyes on the glimmer of red showing itself through a crack in a stoveplate its kinder curis i should hev happened along by thar this mornin he remarked reflectively by where demanded tom mr stamps hugged his knees as if he enjoyed their companionship by thar he responded cheerfully the holler tom an it peared to me it ed be kinder intrestin to take a look through bein as this was the day as the thing kinder started so i hitched my mule an went in he paused a moment as if to enjoy his knees again well said tom mr stamps looked up at him harmlessly eh he enquired i said well answered tom thats what i said oh replied mr stamps waal thar wasnt nothin thar tom for the moment toms expression was one of relief but he said nothing thar wasnt nothin thar mr stamps continued then occurred another pause nothin he added after it nothin particular the tenderness with which he embraced his knees at this juncture had something like fascination in it tom found himself fixing a serious gaze upon his clasping arms i kinder looked round he proceeded an if thered ben anythin thar i low id hev seed it but thar wasnt nothin nothin but the empty rooms an a dead leaf or so es hed blowed in through a broken winder an the pile o ashes in the fireplace beat down with the rain as hed fell down the chimney mighty lonesome an still them ashes looked an thar wasnt nothin but them an the leavesan a bit of a envelope tom moved his chair back sheba thought he was going to get up suddenly but he remained seated perhaps because mr stamps began again thar wasnt nothin but them an the bit of a envelope he remarked it was asticken in a crack o the house low down like it hed ben swep or blowed thar an overlooked i shouldnt hev seed itmodestlyef i hednt ben agoin round on my hands an knees then tom rose very suddenly indeed so suddenly that he knocked his chair over and amazed sheba by kicking it violently across the store for the moment he so far forgot himself as to be possessed with some idea of falling upon mr stamps with the intent to do him bodily injury he seized him by the shoulders and turned him about so that he had an excellent view of his unprepossessing back what mr stamps thought it would have been difficult to discover sheba fancied that when he opened his mouth he was going to utter a cry of terror but he did not he turned his neck about as well as he could under the circumstances and looking up into toms face meekly smiled tom he said ye aint agwine ter do a thing to me not a dern thing yes i am cried tom furiously im goin to kick ef ye was jest haaf to let drive at me yed break my neck said mr stamps an ye aint agwine ter do it ef ye was tom yed be a bigger fool than i took ye fer lemme go he looked so diminutive and weakeyed as he made these remarks that it was no wonder tom released him helplessly though he was obliged to thrust his hands deep into his pockets and keep them under control i thought id given you one lesson he burst forth i thought mr stamps interrupted him continuing to argue his side of the question evidently feeling it well worth his while to dispose of it on the spot ye weigh three hundred tom he said ef ye weigh a pound an i dont weigh but ninety n ye couldnt handle me keerful enuf not to leave me in a fix as wouldnt be no credit to ye when ye was done n it ed look kinder bad for ye to meddle with me anyhow an the madder ye get the more particular yell be not to thars whar ye are tom an i aint sich a fool as not to know it his perfect confidence in the strength of his position and in toms helplessness against it was a thing to be remembered tom remembered it long afterwards though at the moment it only roused him to greater heat now then he demanded lets hear what youre driving at what i want to know is what youre driving at lets hear mr stampss pale eyes fixed themselves with interest on his angry face he had seated himself in his chair again and he watched tom closely as he rambled on in his simple uncomplaining way yere fond o laughin at me round yere at the store tom he remarked an i aint agin it a man dont make nothin much by bein laughed at i rekin but he dont lose nothin nuther an thats what i am agin i rekin ye laugh cos i kinder look like a foolan i haint nothin agin thet nuther lord not by a

all what demanded tom gals suggested mr stamps is plenty an ef ye take to raisin em as this uns ben raised ye aint makin much an ef thar aint nothin to be made tom whats yer aim he put it as if it was a conundrum without an answer whats yer aim tom he repeated pleasantly ef thar aint nothin to be made toms honest face flamed into red which was almost purple the veins swelled on his forehead his indignation almost deprived him of his breath he fell into a chair with a concussion which shook the building goodgood lord he exclaimed how i wish you weighed five hundred pounds it is quite certain that if stamps had he would have demolished him utterly upon the spot leaving him in such a condition that his remains would hardly have been a source of consolation to his friends he pointed to the door if you want to get out he said start this is getting the better of meand if it does mr stamps rose ye wouldnt do a dern thing tom he said peaceably not a dern thing he sidled towards the door and reaching it paused to reflect shaking his head ef thar aint nothin to be made he said yev got ter hev a aim an what is it observing that tom made a move in his chair he slipped through the doorway rather hurriedly sheba thought he was gone but a moment later the door reopened and he thrust his head in and spoke not intrusivelysimply as if offering a suggestion which might prove of interest it begun with a l he said thar was a name on it and it begun with a l chapter xi it was upon the evening after this interview with mr stamps that tom broached to his young companion a plan which had lain half developed in his mind for some time they had gone into the back room and eaten together the supper mornin had prepared with some extra elaboration to do honour to the day and then sheba had played with her doll lucinda while tom looked on somewhat neglecting his newspaper and pipe in his interest in her small pretence of maternity at last when she had put lucinda to sleep in the wooden cradle which had been her own he called her to him come here he said i want to ask you a question she came readily and stood at his knee laying her hands upon it and looking up at him as she had had a habit of doing ever since she first stood alone how would you like some new rooms he said suggestively like these she answered a pretty wonder in her eyes no said tom not like thesebigger and brighter and prettier with flowers on the walls and flowers on the carpets and all the rest to match he had mentioned this bold idea to molly hollister the day before and she had shown such pleasure in it that he had been quite elated its not that i need anything different he had said but the roughness and bareness dont seem to suit her ive thought it often when ive seen her running about seems like thar aint nothin you dont think of tom said molly admiringly well he admitted i think about her a good deal thats a fact she seems to have given me a kind of imagination i used to think i hadnt any he had imagination enough to recognise at the present moment in the childs uplifted face some wistful thought she did not know how to express and he responded to it by speaking again theyll be prettier rooms than these he said what do you say her glance wandered across the hearth to where the cradle stood in the corner with lucinda in it then she looked up at him again prettier than this she repeated with flowers but dont take this away the feeling which stirred her flushed her childish cheek and made her breath come and go faster she drew still nearer to him dont take this away she repeated and laid her hand on his why asked tom giving her a curious look she met the look helplessly she could not have put her vague thought into words dontdont take it away she said again and suddenly laid her face upon his great open palm for a minute or two there was silence tom sat very still and looked at the fire no he said at length we wont take it away in a few days however it was well known for at least fifteen miles around the crossroads that tom dwillerby was going to build a new house and that it was going to be fitted up with great splendour with furniture purchased at brownsboro store carpetin on every floor an paper on every wall said dave hollister to molly when he went home after hearing the news an shebys agoin with him to choose em he says hell bet fifty dollars she has her notions about things an hes agoin to hev em carried out fer its all fer her an shes the one to be pleased it was not many weeks before the rooms were so near completion that the journey to brownsboro was made and it was upon this day of her first journeying out into the world that sheba met with her first adventure she remembered long afterwards the fresh brightness of the early morning when she was lifted into the buggy which stood before the door while mornin ran to and fro in the agreeable bustle attendant upon forgetting important articles and being reminded of them by shocks when tom climbed into his seat and they drove away the storeporch seemed quite crowded with those who watched their triumphant departure sheba looked back and saw mornin showing her teeth and panting for breath while molly hollister waved the last babys sunbonnet holding its denuded owner in her arms the drive was a long one but the travellers enjoyed it from first to last tom found his companions conversation quite sufficient entertainment to while away the time and when at intervals she refreshed herself from mornins basket and fell asleep he enjoyed driving along quietly while he held her small peacefully relaxed body on his knee quite as much as another man might have enjoyed a much more exciting occupation theres an amount of comfort in it he said reflectively as the horse plodded along on the shady side of the road an amount of comfort thats astonishing i dont know but id like to have her come to a standstill just about now and never grow any older or bigger but i thought the same thing three years ago thats a fact and when she gets to blooming out and enjoying her bits of girl finery therell be pleasure in that too plenty of it she awakened from one of these light sleeps just as they were entering brownsboro and her delight and awe at the dimensions and business aspect of the place pleased tom greatly and was the cause of his appearing a perfect mine of reliable information on the subject of large towns and the habits of persons residing in them brownsboro contained at least six or seven hundred inhabitants and as court was being held there were a good many horses to be seen tied to the hitchingposts groups of men were sitting before the stores and on the sidewalks while something which might almost have been called a crowd was gathered before the courthouse itself sheba turned her attention to the tavern they were approaching with a view to spending the night and her first glance alighted upon an object of interest theres a big boy she said he looks tired he was not such a very big boy though he was perhaps fourteen years old and tall of his age he stood upon the plankwalk which ran at the front of the house and leaned against the porch with his hands in his pockets he was a slender lithe boy well dressed in a suit of fine white linen he had a dark spirited face and longlashed dark eyes but notwithstanding these advantages he looked far from amiable as he stood lounging discontentedly and knitting his brows in the sun but sheba admired him greatly and bent forward that she might see him better regarding him with deep interest hes a pretty boy she said softly ii like him tom scarcely heard her he was looking at the boy himself and his face wore a troubled and bewildered expression his gaze was so steady that at length the object of it felt its magnetic influence and lifted his eyes that his general air of discontent did not belie him and that he was by no means an amiable boy was at once proved he did not bear the scrutiny patiently his face darkened still more and he scowled without any pretence of concealing the fact tom turned away uneasily hed be a handsome fellow if he hadnt such an evil look he said i must have seen him before i wonder who he is there were many strangers in the house principally attenders upon the court being held court week was a busy time for brownsboro which upon such occasions assumed a bustling and festive air securing its friends from less important quarters engaging in animated discussions of the cases in hand and exhibiting an astonishing amount of legal knowledge using the most mystical terms in ordinary conversation and secretly feeling its importance a good deal sparkses was the name of the establishment at which the travellers put up and being the better of the two taverns in which the town rejoiced sparkses presented indeed an enlivening spectacle it was a large frame house with the usual long verandah at the front upon which verandah there were always to be seen customers in rockingchairs their boots upon the balustrade their hands clasped easily on the tops of their heads during court week these customers with their rockingchairs and boots seemed to multiply themselves indefinitely and becoming exhilarated by the legal business transacted around them bestirred themselves to jocularity and argument thus adding to the liveliness of the occasion at such periods mr sparkes was a prominent feature attired in an easy costume seemingly composed principally of suspenders and bearing a pipe in his hand he permeated the atmosphere with a businesslike air which had long stamped him in the minds of his rural guests as a person of administrative abilities rarely equalled and not at all to be surpassed hes everywhar on the place is sparkes had been said of him hes at dinner n supper n breakfast n out on the porch n in the bar an kinder sashiatin through the whole thing thet thar tavern wouldnt be nothin ef he wasnt thar it was not to be disputed that he appeared at dinner and breakfast and supper and that on each appearance he disposed of a meal of such proportions as caused his countenance to deepen in colour and assume a swelled aspect which was no doubt extremely desirable under the circumstances and very good for the business though it could scarcely be said to lighten the labour of mrs sparkes and her daughters who apparently existed without any more substantial sustenance than the pleasure of pouring out cups of coffee and tea and glasses of milk and cutting slices of pie of which they possibly partook through some process of absorption to the care of mrs sparkes tom confided his charge when a short time after their arrival he made his first pilgrimage for business purposes shes been on the road all day he said and i wont take her out till tomorrow so if you dont mind ill leave her with you until i come back shell be all right and happy wont you sheba secretly sheba felt some slight doubt of this but in her desire to do him credit she summed up all her courage and heroically answered that she would and so was borne off to the diningroom where two girls were cutting bread and slicing ham for supper they were mrs sparkess daughters and when they saw the child dropped their knives and made a goodnatured rush at her for which she was not at all prepared now mother they cried whars she from n who does she blong to mrs sparkes cast a glance at her charge which sheba caught and was puzzled by it was a mysterious glance with something of cautious pity in it set her up in a cheer luce she said n give her a piece of cake dont ye want some honey sheba regarded her with uplifted eyes as she replied the glance had suggested to her mind that mrs sparkes was sorry for her and she was anxious to know why no she answered no thank you i dont want any she sat quite still when they put her into a chair but she did not remove her eyes from mrs sparkes who does she blong to anyhow asked luce mrs sparkes lowered her voice as she answered she dont blong to nobody gals she said its thet little critter big tom dwillerby from talbots crossroads took to raise ye dont say pore little thing exclaimed the girls and while one of them stooped to kiss her cheek the other hurriedly produced a large red apple which she laid on the long table before her but sheba did not touch it to hear that she belonged to nobody was a mysterious shock to her there had never seemed any doubt before that she belonged to her uncle tom but mrs sparkes had quite separated her from him in her statement suddenly she began to feel a little tired and not quite so happy as she had been but she sat still and listened rendered rather tremulous by the fact that the speakers seemed so sure they had reason to pity her ef ever thar was a mystery mrs sparkes proceeded thet thar was one though molly hollister says dwillerby dont like it talked over nobody knowed em not even their names an nobody knowed whar they come from she died n he went awaynobody knowed whar n the child wasnt two days old when he done it ye caynt tell me thar aint a heap at the back o that they say dwillerbys jest give himself up to her ever since an taint no wonder nuther for shes a out n out beauty aint she now just look at her eyes why dont ye eat yer apple honey sheba turned towards the window and looked out on the porch a bewildering sense of desolation had fallen upon her i dont want it she said and her small voice had a strange sound even in her own ears i want uncle tom let me go out on the porch and see if hes coming she saw them exchange rapid glances and was troubled afresh by it dye reckin she understands the younger daughter said cautiously lordy no answered the mother we aint said nothin ye kin go ef ye want to sheba she added cheerfully thars a little rockingcheer that ye kin set in help her down luce but she had already slipped down and found her way to the door opening out on to the street the porch was deserted for a wonder the reason being that an unusually interesting case was being argued in the courthouse across the street where groups of men were hanging about the doors the rockingchair stood in a corner but sheba did not sit down in it she went to the steps and stood there looking out with a sense of pain and loneliness still hanging over her and at last without knowing why only feeling that they had a dreary sound and contained a mystery which somehow troubled her she began to say over softly the words the woman had used she died and he went away nobody knows where she died and he went away nobody knows where why those words should have clung to her and made her feel for the moment desolate and helpless it would be difficult to say but as she repeated them half unconsciously the figures of the woman who had died and the man who had wandered so far away alone that he seemed to have wandered out of life itself cast heavy shadows on her childish heart i am glad she whispered that it was not uncle tom that went away and she looked up the street with an anxious sigh just at this moment she became conscious that she was not alone in bending forward that she might see the better she caught sight of someone leaning against the balustrades which had before concealed himthe boy in short who was standing just as he had stood when they drove up and who looked as handsome in a darkling way as human boy could look for a few seconds the child regarded him with bated breath the boys she had been accustomed to seeing were not of this type and were more remarkable for gifts less ornamental than beauty this boy with his graceful limbs and haughtily carried head filled her with awe and admiration she admired him so much that though her first impulse was to run away she did not obey it and almost immediately he glanced up and saw her when this occurred she was greatly relieved to find that his gloom did not lead him to treat her unkindly indeed he was amiable enough to address her with an air of one relenting and condescending somewhat to her youth didnt you know i was here he asked no sheba answered timidly whom are you looking for for my uncle tom he glanced across the street still keeping his hands in his pockets and preserving his easy attitude perhaps he is over there he suggested perhaps he is she replied and added shyly are you waiting for anyone he frowned so darkly at first that she was quite alarmed and wished that she had run away as she had at first intended but he answered after a pause noyes he said yesim waiting for my father he did not even speak as the boys at the crossroads spoke his voice had a clear soft ring and his mode of pronunciation was one tom had spent much time in endeavouring to impress upon herself as being more desirable than that she had heard most commonly used around her up to this time she had frequently wondered why she must speak differently from mornin and molly hollister but now she suddenly began to appreciate the wisdom of his course it was very much nicer to speak as the boy spoke i havent any father she ventured or any mother thats queer isnt it and as she said it mrs sparkess words rushed into her mind again and she looked up the street towards the sunset and fell into a momentary reverie whispering them to herself whats that you are saying asked the boy she looked at him with a rather uncertain and troubled expression it was only what they said in there she replied pointing towards the diningroom what did they say she repeated the words slowly regarding him fixedly because she wondered if they would have any effect upon him she died and he went away nobody knows where what does it mean i dont know he admitted staring at her with his handsome longlashed eyes lots of people die and go away then after a pause in which he dropped his eyes he added my mother died two years ago did she answered sheba wondering why he looked so gloomy again all at once i dont think i ever had any mother but i have uncle tom he stared at her again and there was silence for a few minutes this he broke by asking a question what is your name he demanded de willoughby she replied but im called sheba why thats my name he said surprisedly my name is de willoughby ihallo neb this last in a tone of proprietorship to a negro servant who was advancing towards them from a sidedoor and who hurried up with rather a frightened manner yed best get ready ter start right away mars ralph he said hes wake at las an ders de debbil to pay acussin an roarin an wantin opium an he wants to know whar ye bin an what ye mean an ses de hosses mus be at de do in ten minits oh de cunnel hes in de wustest kin o humour dars no doin nuffin right fer him tell him to go to h burst forth the lad flying into a rage and looking so wickedly passionate in a boyish way that sheba was frightened again tell him i wont go until im ready ive been dragged round till im sick of it and in the midst of his tempest he checked himself turned about and walked suddenly into the house the negro following him in evident trepidation his departure was so sudden that sheba fancied he would return and say something more to her angry as he looked she wished very much that he would and so stood waiting wistfully but she was doomed to disappointment in a few minutes the negro brought to the front three horses and almost immediately there appeared at the door a tall handsome man who made his way to the finest horse and mounted it with a dashing vault into the saddle he had a dark aquiline face like the boys and wore a great sweeping mustache which hid his mouth the boy followed looking wonderfully like him as he sprang into his own saddle with the same daredevil vault no one spoke a word and he did not even look at sheba though she watched him with admiring and longing eyes as soon as they were fairly in their seats the horses which were fine creatures needing neither whip nor spur sprang forward with a light easy movement and so cantered down the street towards the high road which stretched itself over a low hill about a quarter of a mile away sheba laid her cheek against the wooden pillar and looked after them with a return of the sense of loneliness she had felt before he went away she whispered nobody knows wherenobody knows where she felt toms hand laid on her shoulder as she said the words and turned her face upward with a consciousness of relief knowing she would not be lonely any longer have i been gone long he asked wheres mrs sparkes shes in there sheba answered eagerly and ive been talking to the boy to the boy he repeated what boy to the one we saw she replied holding his hand and feeling her cheeks flush with the excitement of relating her adventure the nice boy his name is like mineand his mother died he said it was de willoughby and it is like mine he has gone away with his father see them riding he dropped her hand and taking a step forward stood watching the receding travellers he watched them until they reached the rising ground the boy had fallen a few yards behind presently the others passed the top of the hill and as they did so he turned in his saddle as if he had suddenly remembered something and glanced back at the tavern porch he is looking for me cried sheba and ran out into the brightness of the setting sun happy because he had not quite forgotten her he saw her waved his hand with a careless boyish gesture and disappeared over the brow of the hill tom sat down suddenly on the porchstep when sheba turned to him he was pale and his forehead was damp with sweat he spoke aloud but to himself not to her good lord he said its de courcy andand the boy that was why i knew his face when they went in to supper later on there was a great deal of laughing and talking going on down the long table mr sparkes was finishing a story as they entered and he was finishing it in a loud voice theyre pretty well known he said an the colonels the worst o the lot the nigger told me thard been a reglar flareup at the springs thar was a ball an he got on a tear an got away from em an bust right into the ballroom an played hail columby hes a poplar man among the ladies is the colonel but a mixtry of whiskey an opium is apt to spile his manners nigger says hes the drunkest man when he is drunk that the lord ever let live ye caynt do nothin with him

now its in the blood whos that youre talking of asked tom from his end of the table he had not recovered his colour yet and looked pale as he put the question colonel de willoughby of delisleville answered mr sparkes any kin o yourn names sorter like he jest left here this evenin with his boy an nigger theyve ben to whitebriar an theyre on their way home i saw them ride over the hill said tom i thought i wasnt mistaken in the man ive seen him before but he made a very poor supper and a shadow seemed to have fallen upon his cheery mood of the morning sheba recognised this and knew too that her new friend and his father were in some vague way responsible for it and the knowledge oppressed her so that when they sat out upon the porch together after the meal was over she in her accustomed place on his knee she grew sad under it herself and instead of talking as usual leaned her small head against his coat and watched the few stars whose brightness the moon had not shut out she went to bed early but did not sleep well dreaming dreary dreams of watching the travellers riding away towards the sunset and of hearing the woman talk again one of the talkers seemed at last to waken her with her voice and she sat up in bed suddenly and found that it was tom who had roused her by speaking to himself in a low tone as he stood in a flood of moonlight before the window she died he was saying she died sheba burst into a little sob stretching out her hands to him without comprehending her own emotion and he went away she cried nobody knows wherenobody knows where and even when he came to her hurriedly and sat down on the bedside soothing her and taking her in his arms to sink back into slumber she sobbed drearily two or three times though once in his clasp she felt as she had always done the full sense of comfort safety and rest chapter xii the new england town of willowfield was a place of great importance its importancereligious intellectual and socialwas its strong point it took the liberty of asserting this with unflinching dignity other towns might endeavour to struggle to the front and indeed did so endeavour but willowfield calmly held its place and remained unmoved its place always had been at the front from the first and there it took its stand it had perhaps been hinted that its sole title to this position lay in its own stately assumption but this it may be argued was sheer envy and entirely unworthy of notice willowfield is not very large or very rich its leading old lady said but it is important and has always been considered so there was society in willowfield society which had taken up its abidingplace in three or four streets and confined itself to developing its importance in half a dozen familiesold families they were always spoken of as the old families and to be a member of one of them even a second or third cousin of weak mind and feeble understanding was to be enclosed within the magic circle outside of which was darkness wailing and gnashing of teeth there were the stornaways who had owned the button factory for nearly a generation and a halfwhich was a long time the downings who had kept the feedstore for quite thirty years and the burtons who had been doctors for almost as long not to mention the larkins who had actually founded the willowfield times and kept it going which had scarcely been expected of them at the outset their moral mental and social gifts notwithstanding there was nothing connected with the stornaways the downings the burtons and the larkins of such importance as their antiquity the uninformed outsider on hearing it descanted upon might naturally have been betrayed into the momentary weakness of expecting to see mr downing moulder away and little old doctor burton crumble into dust they belong it was said with the temperateness of true dignity to our old families and that is something you know even in america it has struck me an observing male visitor once remarked that there are a good many women in willowfield and that altogether it has a feminine tone it was certainly true that among the stornaways the downings the burtons and the larkins the prevailing tone was feminine and as the stornaways the downings the burtons and the larkins comprised willowfield society and without its society willowfield lost its significance the observing male visitor may not have been far wrong if mistakes were made in willowfield society they were always made by the masculine members of it it was mr stornaway who had at one time been betrayed into the blunder of inviting to a dinnerparty at his house a rather clever young bookkeeper in his employ and it was doctor burton who had wandered still more glaringly from the path of rectitude by taking a weak if amiable interest in a little music teacher with a sweet tender voice even going so far as to request his family to call upon her and ask her to take tea with them it was mr downing who when this last incident occurred and created some sensation had had the temerity to intimate that he thought the doctor was entirely in the right though to be sure he had afterwards been led to falter in this opinion and subside into craven silence being a little gentleman of timorous and yielding nature and rather overborne by a large and powerful feminine majority in his own household mr larkin was it is to be regretted the worst of the recreant party being younger and more unmanageable having not only introduced to public notice certain insignificant though somewhat talented persons in the shape of young men and women who talked well or sang well or wielded lively pens but had gone to the length of standing by them unflinchingly demanding civility for them at the hands of his own family of women in such a manner as struck a deadly blow at the very foundations of the social structure but mr larkinhe was known as jack larkin to an astonishing number of peoplewas a bold man by nature and given to deeds of daring from the fatal consequences of which nothing but the fact that he was a member of one of the old families could have saved him as he was a partand quite a large partof one of these venerable households and moreover knew not the fear of manor womanhis failings could be referred to as eccentricities mr larkin mrs stornaway frequently observed with longsuffering patience is talented but eccentric you are never quite sure what he will do next mrs stornaway was the head and front of all willowfields social efforts and represented the button factory with a lofty grace and unbending dignity of demeanour which were the admiration and envy of all aspirants to social fame it was said that mrs stornaway had been a beauty in her youth and there were those who placed confidence in the rumour mrs stornaway did so herself and it had been intimated that it was this excellent lady who had vouched for the truth of the statement in the first instance but this report having been traced to a pert young relative who detested and derided her might have had its origin in youthful disrespect and malice at present mrs stornaway was a large blonde woman whose blondness was not fairness and whose size was not roundness she was the leader of all religious and charitable movements presiding with great vigour over church matters fairs concerts and sewing societies the minister of her church submitted himself to her advice and guidance all the modest members of the choir quailed and quavered before her while even the bold ones meeting her eye when engaged in worldly conversation between their musical efforts momentarily lost their interest and involuntarily straightened themselves towards her family mrs stornaway performed her duty with unflinching virtue she had married her six daughters in a manner at once creditable to herself themselves and willowfield five of them had been rather ordinary depressedlooking girls who perhaps were not sorry to obtain their freedom the sixth had narrowly escaped being dowered with all the charms said to have adorned mrs stornaways own youth agnes is very like what i was at her age said her mother with dignity and perhaps she was though no one had been able to trace any resemblance which had defied the ravages of time agnes had made a marriage which in some points was better than those of her sisters she had married a brilliant man while the other five had been obliged to make the best of things as far as brilliancy was concerned people always said of john baird that he was a brilliant man and that a great career lay before him he was rather remarkable for a curious subtle distinction of physical good looks he was not of the common straightfeatured personable type it had been said by the artistic analyst of form and line that his aspect did not belong to his period that indeed his emotional spirited face with its look of sensitiveness and race was of the type once connected with fine old steel engravings of young poets not quite beyond the days of powdered hair and frilled shirtbosoms it is absurd that he should have been born in america and in these days a brilliant person had declared he always brings to my mind the portraits in delightful old annuals soandsoat twentyfive his supple ease of movement and graceful length of limb gave him an air of youth he was one of the creatures to whom the passage of years would mean but little but added charm and adaptability his eyes were singularly living thingsthe eyes that almost unconsciously entreat and whose entreaty touches one the fine irregular outline of his profile was the absolute expression of the emotional at war with itself the passionate the tender the sensitive and complex the effect of these things was almost the effect of peculiar physical beauty and with this he combined the allurements of a compelling voice and an enviable sense of the fitness of things he never lost a thought through the inability to utter it when he had left college he had left burdened with honours and had borne with him the enthusiastic admiration of his fellowstudents he had earned and worn his laurels with an ease and grace which would be remembered through years to come its something it was once said to have known a fellow to whom things came so easily when he had entered the ministry there had been some wonder expressed among the men who had known him best but when he preached his first sermon at willowfield where there was a very desirable church indeed with whose minister mrs stornaway had become dissatisfied and who in consequence was to be civilly removed the golden apple fell at once into his hand before he had arrived he had been spoken of rather slightingly as the young man but when he rose in the pulpit on the eventful sunday morning such a thrill ran through the congregation as had not stirred it at its devotions for many a summer day mrs stornaway mentally decided for him upon the spot he is of one of our oldest families she said this is what willowfield wants he dined with the stornaways that day and when he entered the parlour the first figure his eyes fell upon was that of agnes stornaway dressed in white muslin with white roses in her belt she was a tall girl with a willowy figure and a colourless fairness of skin but when her mother called her to her side and baird touched her hand she blushed in such a manner that mrs stornaway was a little astonished scarcely a year afterward she became mrs baird and people said she was a very fortunate girl which was possibly true her husband did not share the fate of most ministers who had presided over mrs stornaways church his power over his congregation increased every year his name began to be known in the world of literature he was called upon to deliver in important places the lectures he had delivered to his willowfield audiences and the result was one startling triumph after another there was every indication of the fact that a career was already marked out for him willowfield looked forward with trepidation to the time when the great world which stood ready to give him fame would absorb him altogether but in the meantime it exerted all its power of fascination and was so far successful that the reverend john baird felt that his lines had indeed fallen in pleasant places but after the birth of her little daughter his wife was not strong and was so long in regaining vitality that in the childs second year she was ordered abroad by the physician at this time bairds engagements were such that he could not accompany her and accordingly he remained in america the career was just opening up its charmed vistas to him his literary efforts were winning laurels he was called upon to lecture in boston and new york and he never rose before an audience without at once awakening an enthusiasm mrs baird went to the south of france with her child and nurse and a party of friends and remained there for a year at the termination of that time just as she thought of returning home she was taken seriously ill her husband was sent for and went at once to join her in a few months she had died of rapid decline she had been a delicate girl and a faroff taint of consumption in her family blood had reasserted itself but though mrs stornaway bewailed her with diffuse and loud pathos and for a year swathed her opulence of form in deepest folds and draperies of crape the quiet fairness and slightness which for some five and twenty years had been known as agnes stornaway had been a personality not likely to be a marked and longlingering memory the child was placed with a motherly friend in paris for a month after his wifes death baird had been feverishly miserably eager to return to america those about him felt that the blow which had fallen upon him might affect his health seriously he seemed possessed by a desperate morbid desire to leave the scene of the calamity behind him he was restless and feverish in his anxiety and scarcely able to endure the delay which the arrangement of his affairs made necessary he had not been well when he had left willowfield and during his watching by his wifes bedside he had grown thin and restlesseyed i want to get home i must get home he would exclaim as if involuntarily his entire physical and mental condition were strained and unnatural his wifes doctor who had become his own doctor as his health deteriorated was not surprised on arriving one day to find him prostrated with nervous fever he was ill for months and he rose from his sickbed a depressed shadow of his former self and quite unable to think of returning to his charge even if his old desire had not utterly left him with his fever he was absent from willowfield for two years and when at length he turned his face homeward it was with no eagerness he had passed through one of those phases which change a mans life and being if he had been a rich man he would have remained away and would have lived in london seeing much of the chief continental cities as it was he must at least temporarily return to willowfield and take with him his little girl on the day distinguished by his return to his people much subdued excitement prevailed in willowfield during the whole of the previous week mrs stornaways carriage had paid daily visits to the downtown stores there was a flourishing new england thrift among the stornaways the larkins the downings and the burtons which did not allow of their delegating the ordering of their households to assistants most of them were rigorous housewives keen at a bargain and sharp of tongue when need be and there was rarely any danger of their getting less than their moneys worth to celebrate his arrival mrs stornaway was to give an evening party which was to combine congratulatory welcome with a touch of condolence for the past and assurance for the future we must let him see said mrs stornaway that willowfield has its attractions its attractions did not present themselves as vividly to john baird as might have been hoped when he descended from the train at the depot he had spent two or three days in boston with a view to taking his change gradually but he found himself not as fully prepared for willowfield as he could have wished he was not entirely prepared for mrs stornaway who hurried towards them with exultation on her large stupid face and after effusive embraces bustled with them towards an elderly woman who had evidently accompanied her see heres miss amory starkweather she exclaimed she came with me to meet you just see how annies grown miss amory miss amory was a thin woman with a strongfeatured countenance and deepset observing eyes they were eyes whose expression suggested that they had made many painful discoveries in the course of their owners life john baird rather lighted up for a moment when he caught sight of her i am glad to see you miss amory he said thank you she answered i hope you are as well as you look were so delighted mrs stornaway announced as if to the bystanders everybody in willowfield is so delighted to have you back again the church has not seemed the same place the man who took your placemr jeramy you knowyou havent any idea how unpopular excuse me said baird i must speak to latimer where is latimer annie who is latimer asked mrs stornaway excuse me said baird again and turning back towards the platform he disappeared among the crowd with annie who had clung to his hand why hes gone proclaimed mrs stornaway but wheres he gone why didnt he stay whos latimer latimer miss amory echoed you ought to know him his family lives in willowfield he is the man who was coming home to take charge of the little church at janways mills he has evidently crossed the atlantic with them well now i declare proclaimed mrs stornaway it must be the man who took his sister to europe it was a kind of absurd thing she died awaythe girl did and people wondered why he did not come back and how he lived why yes that must be the man and she turned to look about for him miss amory starkweather made a slight movement dont look she said he might not like to be stared at theyre quite common people commented mrs stornaway still staring they live in a little house in a side street they had very silly ideas about the girl they thought she was a genius and sent her to the school of art in boston but it wasnt long before her health failed her ah i guess that must be the man talking to mr baird and annie he looks as if he would go off in a consumption he was a tall hollowchested man with a dark sallow face and an ungainly figure there were suggestions of both illhealth and wretchedness in his appearance and his manner was awkward and embarrassed two human beings more utterly unlike each other than himself and the man who held his hand could not possibly have been found it was baird who held his hand not he bairds and it was baird who seemed to speak while he listened while with his free hand he touched the hair of the child annie well remarked mrs stornaway mr baird seems to have taken a fancy to him i dont think hes attractive myself are they going to talk to him all day no said miss amory he is going now he was going baird had released his hand and he was looking in a gloomy awkward way at annie as if he did not know how to make his adieux but annie who was a simple child creature solved the difficulty for him with happy readiness she flung both her small arms about his ungainly body and held up her face kiss me three times she said three times latimer started and flushed he looked down at her and then glanced rather timidly at baird kiss her said baird it will please herand it will please me latimer bent himself to the childs height and kissed her the act was without grace and when he stood upright he was more awkward and embarrassed than ever but the caress was not a cold or rough one and when he turned and strode away the flush was still on his sallow cheek chapter xiii the stornaway parlours were very brilliant that evening in a willowfield sense not a burton a larkin or a downing was missing even miss amory starkweather being present miss amory starkweather was greatly respected by the stornaways the downings the larkins and the burtons the starkweathers having landed upon plymouth rock so early and with such a distinguished sense of their own importance as to lead to the impression in weak minds that they had not only founded that monumental cornerstone of ancestry but were personally responsible for the mayflower this gentlewoman represented to the humorous something more of the element of comedy than she represented to herself she had been born into a world too narrow and provincial for the development of the powers born with her she had been an ugly girl and an ugly woman marked by the hopeless ugliness of a long illproportioned face small eyes and a nose too large and highthat ugliness which even loves eyes can scarcely ameliorate into good drawing the temperament attached to these painful disabilities had been warm and strongly womanly born a century or so earlier in a french court or any great world vivid with picturesque living she would in all probability have been a remarkable personage her ugliness a sort of distinction but she had been born in willowfield and had lived its life and been bound by its limits she had been comfortably well offshe had a large square house with a garden an income sufficient to provide for extremely respectable existence in willowfield but not large enough to allow of experiments with the outside world she had never met a man whom she could have loved who would have loved her and she was essentiallythough willowfield would never have dreamed ita woman who should have loved and mated a lifetime of narrow unstimulating years and thwarted instincts had made age treat her ill she was a thin woman with burning eyes and a personality people were afraid of she had always found an interest in john baird when he had come to willowfield she had seen in him that element which her whole long life had lacked his emotional potentialities had wakened her imagination if she had been a young woman she knew that she might have fallen tragically and hopelessly in love with him as an old woman she found it well worth her while to watch him and speculate upon him when he had become engaged to agnes stornaway she had watched him and secretly wondered how the engagement would end when it had ended in marriage she had not wondered but she had seen many things other people did not see he is not in love with her had been her mental decision but he is emotional and he is in love with her being in love with him there is no foretelling what will come of it baird had found himself attracted by miss amory he did not know that if she had been young she would despite her ugliness have had a powerful feminine effect on him he used to go and talk to her and he was not conscious that he went when he was made restless by a lack of something in the mental atmosphere about him he could talk to her as he could not talk to the rest of willowfield she read and thought and argued with herself and as a product of a provincial dogmatic new england town was a curious development were you once a brilliant wicked feminine mover of things in some old french court he said to her once they had been plunging deep into the solving of unsolvable problems and she turned her burning old eyes on him as she answered god knows what i was she said but it was nothing like thisnothing like thisand i was not wicked no baird replied you were not wicked but you broke laws yes i broke laws she agreed but they were hideous lawsbetter broken than kept she had been puzzled by the fact that after his wife left him he had had a restless period and had seemed to pass through a miserable phase such as a man suffering from love and longing might endure has he fallen in love with her because she has gone away she wondered men are capable of it at times but later she decided mentally that this was not his special case she saw however that he was passing through some mental crisis which was a dangerous struggle he was restless and often away from willowfield for two or three days at a time to provide the place with orthodox doctrine once a week is more than he can bear and to be bored to extinction into the bargain makes him feel morbid she said to herself i hope he wont begin to be lured by things which might produce catastrophe once he came and spent a long hot summer evening with her and when he went away she had arrived at another decision and it made her wretched he is lured she thought i cannot help him and god knows willowfield could not after thisperhaps the deluge she saw but little of him for two months and then he was called across the atlantic by his wifes illness and left the place write to me now and then he said when he came to bid her goodbye what can i write about from willowfield to a man in paris she asked about willowfield he answered holding her hand and laughing a little gruesomely there will be a thrill in it when one is three thousand miles away tell me about the churchabout the peoplewho comes who goesyour own points of view will make it all worth while will you almost as if a shade anxiously she felt the implied flattery just enough to be vaguely pleased by it yes i will she answered she kept her word and the letters were worth reading it was as he had said her points of view which gave interest to the facts that unexciting people had died married or been born her sketch of the trying position of the unpopular man who filled his pulpit and was unfavourably compared with him every sunday morning was full of astute analysis and wit her little picture of the gloomy young theological student latimer his efforts for his sister and her innocent pathetic death in a foreign land had a wonderful realism of touch she had by pure accident made the childs acquaintance and had been strongly touched and moved she did not write often but he read her letters many times over upon this evening of his homecoming she thought he had sometimes the look of a man who felt that he walked in a dream more than once she saw him involuntarily pass his hand with a swift movement over his eyes as if his own touch might waken him it was true he did not greatly enjoy the festivities his occasional views of mrs stornaway as she rambled among her guests talking to them about him in audible tones were trying she dispensed him with her hospitalities as it were and was diffuse upon the extent of his travels and the attention paid him to each member of the company in turn he knew when she was speaking of himself and when of her daughter and the alternate decorous sentiment and triumphant pleasure marked on her broad face rasped him to the extent of making him fear lest he might lose his temper she is a stupid woman he found himself saying half aloud once the most stupid woman i think i ever met towards the end of the evening as he entered the room he found himself obliged to pass her she stood near the door engaged in animated conversation with mrs downing she had hit upon a new and absorbing topic which had the additional charge of savouring of local gossip why he heard her say i mean to ask him he can tell us i guess i havent a doubt but he heard the whole story you know he has a way of drawing people out hes so much tact and sympathy i used to tell agnes he was all tact and sympathy feeling quite sure that it was himself who was all tact and sympathy baird endeavoured to move by unobserved but she caught sight of him and checked his progress mr baird she said were just talking about you dont talk about me he said lightly i am not half so culpable as i look he often found small change of this order could be made useful with mrs stornaway and he bestowed this upon her with an easy air which she felt to be very delightful hes so ready she observed enraptured i often used to say to agnes but mrs downing was not to be defrauded we were talking about those people on bank street she said the latimers mrs stornaway says you crossed the atlantic with the son who has just come back do tell us something about him i am afraid i cannot make him as interesting to you as he was to me answered baird with his light air again he does not look very interesting said mrs stornaway i never saw anyone so sallow i cant understand annie liking him he is interesting responded baird annie took one of her fancies to him and i took something more than a fancy we shall be good friends i think well im sure its very kind of you to take such an interest proclaimed mrs stornaway you are always finding something good in people i wish people were always finding something good in me said john baird it was not difficult to find good in this man he is of the stuff they made saints and martyrs of in the olden times what did the girl die of asked mrs downing what repeated baird the girl i dont know and where did she die added mrs downing i was just saying put in mrs stornaway that you had such a sympathetic way of drawing people out that i was sure he had told you the whole story there was not much story baird answered and it was too sad to talk over the poor child went abroad and died in some little place in italyof consumption i think i suppose she was sick when they went commented mrs downing i heard so it was a queer thing for them to go to europe as inexperienced as they were and everything but the father and mother were more inexperienced still i guess they were perfectly foolish about the girland so was the brother she went to some studio in boston to study art and they had an idea her bits of pictures were wonderful i never saw her myself said mrs stornaway no one seems to have seen anything of her but miss amory starkweather miss starkweather exclaimed baird oh yesin her letters she mentioned having met her well it was a queer thing said mrs downing but it was like miss amory they say the girl fainted in the street as miss amory was driving by and she stopped her carriage and took her in and carried her home she took quite a fancy to her and saw her every day or so until she went away it was not unnatural that at this juncture john bairds eyes should wander across the room to where miss amory starkweather sat but it was a coincidence that as his eye fell upon her she should meet it with a gesture which called him to her side it seems that miss amory wishes to speak to me he said to his companions hell make himself just as interesting to her as he has made himself to us said mrs stornaway with heavy sprightliness as he left them he never spares himself trouble he went across the room to miss amory can you sit down by me she said i want to talk to you about lucien latimer what is there in the atmosphere which suggests latimer he inquired we have been talking about him at the other side of the room do you know him i never saw him she replied but i knew her her he repeated the little sister she leaned forward a little what were the details of her death she asked i want to knowi want to know somehow the words sounded nervously eager i did not ask him he answered i thought he preferred to be silent he is a silent man she sat upright again and for a moment seemed to forget herself she said something two or three times softly to herself baird thought it was poor child poor child she was young to die he said in a low voice poor child indeed miss amory came back to him as it were the younger the better she said look at me her burning eyes were troubling and suggestive baird found himself trying to gather himself together he assumed the natural air of kindly remonstrance oh come he said dont take that tone it is unfair to all of us her reply was certainly rather a startling one very well then she responded look at yourself if you had died as young as she did he looked at her conscious of a little coldness creeping over his body she was usually lighter when they were not entirely alone just now in the midst of this commonplace exceedingly middleclass evening party with the larkins the downings and the burtons chattering warm diffuse and elate about him she stirred him with a little horrornot horror of herself but of something in her mood do you think i am such a bad fellow he said no she answered worse poor thing it is not the bad fellows who produce the crudest results but i did not call you here to tell you that you were bad or good i called you to speak about lucien latimer when you go to himyou are going to him tomorrow then tell him to come and see me i will tell him anything you wish said baird is there anything else tell him i knew her she answered margerymargery margery baird said slowly as if the sound touched him what a pretty simple name she was a pretty simple creature said miss amory tell me he said tell me something more about her there is nothing more to tell she replied she was dying when i met her i saw itin her eyes she could not have lived she went away and died shei john baird heard a slight sharp choking sound in her throat there she said presently i dont like to talk about it i am too emotional for my years go to mrs stornaway she is looking for you he got up and turned and left her without speaking and a few minutes later when mrs stornaway wanted him to give an account of his interview with the pope she was surprised to see him approaching her from the door as if he had been out of the room his story of the interview with the pope was very interesting and he was more brilliant than ever during the remainder of the evening but when the last guest had departed followed by mrs stornaway to the threshold that lady on her return to the parlour found him standing by the mantel looking at the fire with so profoundly wearied an air that she uttered an exclamation why she said you look tired i must say but everything went off splendidly and i never saw you so brilliant thank you he answered ive just been saying with renewed spirit of admiration that your crossing with that latimer has quite brought him into notice it will be a good thing for him i heard several people speak of him tonight and say how kind it was of you to take him up baird stirred uneasily i should not like to have that tone taken he said why should i patronise him we shall be friendsif he will allow it he spoke with so much heat and impatience that mrs stornaway listened with a discomfited stare but nobody knows anything about them she said theyre quite ordinary people they live in bank street that may settle the matter for willowfield said baird but it does not settle it for me we are to be friends and willowfield must understand that and such was the decision of his tone that mrs stornaway did not recover herself and was still staring after him in a bewildered fashion when he went upstairs but its just like him she remarked rather weakly to the rooms emptiness thats always the way with people of genius andandmind theyre always humble chapter xiv she had renewed opportunity for remarking upon the generous humility the next morning when he left the house with the intention of paying his visit to bank street hes actually going she said well i must say again its just like him there are very few men in his position who would think it worth while but he treats everybody with just as much consideration as ifas if he was nobody the house on bank street was just what he had expected to find itsmall unornamental painted white and modestly putting forth a few vines as if with a desire to clothe itself which had not been encouraged by nature the vines had not flourished and they as well as the few flowers in the yard were dropping their scant foliage which turned brown and rustled in the autumn wind before ringing the bell baird stood for a few moments upon the threshold as he looked up and down the street he was pale and felt chilly so chilly that he buttoned his light overcoat over his breast and his hands even shook slightly as he did it then he turned and rang the bell it was answered by a little woman with a girlish figure and gray hair for a moment john baird paused before speaking to her as he had paused before ringing the bell and in the pause during which he found himself looking into her soft childishly blue eyes he felt even chillier than at first mrs latimer i think he said baring his head yes she answered and you are mr baird and have come to see lucien im sure she gave him her small hand with a smile i am very glad to see you she said and lucien will be glad too come in please she led the way into the little parlour talking in a voice as soft and kindly as her eyes lucien had been out but had just come in she fancied and was probably upstairs she would go and tell him so having taken him into the room she went leaving him alone when she was gone baird stood for a moment listening to her footsteps upon the stairs then he crossed the room and stood before the hearth looking up at a picture which hung over the mantel he was still standing before it when she returned with her son he turned slowly to confront them holding out his hand to latimer with something less of alert and sympathetic readiness than was usual with him there was in his manner an element which corresponded with the lack of colour and warmth in his face ive been looking at this portrait of yourof he began of margery put in the little mother everyone looks at margery when they come in it seems as if the child somehow filled the room and though her soft voice had a sigh in it she did not speak in entire sadness john baird looked at the picture again it was the portrait of a slight small girl with wistful eyes and an innocent face i felt sure that it was she he said in a lowered voice and you are quite right in saying that she seems to fill the room the mother put her hand upon her sons arm he had turned his face towards the window it seemed to baird that her light touch was at once an appeal and a consolation she filled the whole house when she was here she said and yet she was only a quiet little thing she had a bright way with her quietness and was so happy and busy it is my comfort now to remember that she was always happyhappy to the last lucien tells me she looked up at her sons averted face as if expecting him to speak and he responded at once though in his usual mechanical way to the last he said she had no fear and suffered no pain the little woman watched him with tender wistful eyes two large tears welled up and slipped down her cheeks but she smiled softly as they fell she had so wanted to go to italy she said and was so happy to be there and at the last it was such a lovely day and she enjoyed it so and was propped up on a sofa near the window and looked out at the blue sky and the mountains and made a little sketch tell him lucien and she touched his arm again i shall be glad to hear said baird but you must not tire yourself by standing and he took her hand gently and led her to a chair and sat down beside her still holding her hand but latimer remained standing resting his elbow upon the mantel and looking down at the floor as he spoke she was not well in england the little mother put in but in italy he thought she was better even to the very last she was weak latimer went on without raising his eyes but she was always bright andand happy she used to lie on the sofa by the window and look out and try to make sketches she could see the apennines and it was the chestnut harvest and the peasants used to pass along the road on their way to the forests and she liked to watch them she used to try to sketch them too but she was too weak and when i wrote home for her she made me describe them in her bright way said his mother i read the letters over and over again and they seemed like pictureslike her little pictures it scarcely seems as if lucien could have written them at all the last day said latimer i had written home to say that she was better she was so well in the morning that she talked of trying to take a drive but in the afternoon she was a little tired but only a little interrupted the mother eagerly and quite happy only a littleand quite happy said latimer there was a beautiful sunset and i drew her sofa to the windows and she lay and looked at itand talked and just as the sun went down all in a lovely golden glory as if the gates of heaven were open the gentle voice added latimer paused for an instant his sallow face had become paler he drew out his handkerchief and touched his forehead with it and his lips all in a glow of gold he went on a little more hoarsely just as it went down she turned on her pillow and began to speak to me she said how beautiful it all is and how glad and her voice died away i thought she was looking at the sky again she had lifted her eyes to it and was smiling the smile was on her face when ibent over hera few moments afterand found that all was over it was not like death at all said his mother with a soft breathlessness she never even knew and though tears streamed down her cheeks she smiled baird rose suddenly and went to latimers side he wore the pale and bewildered face of a man walking in a dream he laid his hand on his shoulder no it was not like death he said try and remember that i do remember it was the answer she escaped both death and life said john baird both death and life the little mother sat wiping her eyes gently it was all so bright to her she said i can scarcely think of it as a grief that we have lost herfor a little while her little room upstairs never seems empty i could fancy that she might come in at any moment smiling as she used to if she had ever suffered or been sad in it i might feel as if the pain and sadness were left there but when i open the door it seems as if her pretty smile met me or the sound of her voice singing as she used to when she painted she rose and went to her sons side again laying her hand on his arm with a world of tenderness in her touch try to think of that lucien dear she said try to think that her face was never any sadder or older than we see it in her pretty picture there she might have lived to be tired of living and she was saved from it try to help him she said turning to baird perhaps you can he has not learned to bear it yet they were very near to each other and perhaps he is too young to think of it as we do grief is always heavier to young people i think try to help him she went out of the room quietly leaving them together when she was gone john baird found himself trying with a helpless feeling of desperation to spur himself up to saying something but neither words nor thoughts would come for the moment his mind seemed a perfect blank and the silence of the room was terrible it was latimer who spoke first stiffly and as if with difficulty i should be more resigned he said i should be resigned but it has been a heavy blow baird moistened his dry lips but found no words she had a bright nature the lagging voice went on a bright natureand giftswhich i had not god gave me no gifts and it is natural to me to see that life is dark and that i can only do poorly the work which falls to me i was a gloomy unhappy boy when she was born i had learned to know the lack in myself early and i saw in her what i longed for i know the feeling is a sin against god and that his judgment will fall upon mebut i have no power against it it is a very natural feeling said baird hoarsely we cannot resign ourselves at once under a great sorrow a just god who punishes rebellion demands it of his servants dont say that baird interrupted with a shudder we need a god of mercy not a god who condemns need the dark face almost livid in its pallor we need it is not he who was made for our needs but we for his for his servants there is only submission to the anguish chosen for us that is a harsh creed said baird and a dark one try a brighter one man there is no brighter one for me was the answer she had a brighter one poor childand mine was a heavy trouble to her why should we deceive ourselves what are we in his sightin the sight of immutable eternal god we can only do his will and await the end we have reason which we may not use we can only believe and suffer there is agony on every side of us which if it were his will he might relieve but does not it is his will and what is the impotent rebellion of nature against that what help have we against him his harsh voice had risen until it was almost a cry the lank locks which fell over his sallow forehead were damp with sweat he put them back with a desperate gesture such words of themselves are sin he said and it is my curse and punishment that i should bear in my breast every hour the crime of such rebellion what is there left for me is there any labour or any pang borne for others that will wipe out the stain from my soul john baird looked at him as he had looked before his usual ready flow of speech his rapidity of thought his knowledge of men and their necessities seemed all to have deserted him i he stammered i am notfitnot fit he had not known what he was going to say when he began and he did not know how he intended to end he heard with a passionate sense of relief that the door behind them opened and turned to find that mrs latimer stood upon the threshold as if in hesitancy lucien she said it is that poor girl from janways mills the one margery was so sorry forsusan chapman she wants to see you i think the poor child wants to ask about margery latimer made a movement forward but checked himself tell her to come in he said mrs latimer went to the front door and in a few seconds returned the girl was with her and entered the room slowly she was very pale and her eyes were dilated and she breathed fast as if frightened she glanced at john baird and stopped i didnt know anyone else was here she said i will go away if you wish it said baird the sympathetic tone returning to his voice no said latimer you can do her more good than i can this gentleman he added to the girl is my friend and a minister of god as well as myself he is the rev john baird there was in his eyes as he addressed her a look which was like an expression of dreadas if he saw in her young yet faded face and figure something which repelled him almost beyond selfcontrol perhaps the girl saw while she did not comprehend it she regarded him helplessly ii dont knowhardlywhy i came she faltered twisting the corner of her shawl she had been rather pretty but the colour and freshness were gone from her face and there were premature lines of pain and misery marking it here and there baird moved a chair near her sit down he said have you walked all the way from janways mills she started a little and gave him a look half wonder half relief and then fell to twisting the fringe of her poor shawl again yes i walked she answered but i cant set down i haint but a minute to stay her clothes which had been shabby at their best were at their worst now and altogether she was a figure neither attractive nor picturesque but baird saw pathos in her it was said that one of his most charming qualities was his readiness to discover the pathetic under any guise you came to ask mr latimer some questions perhaps he said she suddenly burst into tears yes she answered ii couldnt help it she checked herself and wiped her tears away with the shawl corner almost immediately i wanted to know something about her she said nobody seemed to know nothin only that she was dead when they said youd come home it seemed like i couldnt rest until id heard something what do you want to hear said latimer it struck baird that the girls manner was a curious one it was a manner which seemed to conceal beneath its shamefaced awkwardness some secret fear or anxiety she gave latimer a hurried stealthy look and then her eyes fell it was as if she would have read in his gloomy face what she did not dare to ask id be afraid to die myself she stammered i cant bear to think of it im afraid was she no latimer answered the girl gave him another dull stealthy look im glad of that she said she cant have minded so much if she wasnt afraid id like to think she didnt mind it so muchor suffer she did not suffer said latimer i never saw nothin of her after the last day she came to janways mills the girl began latimer lifted his eyes suddenly she went to the mills he exclaimed yes she answered her voice shaking i guess she never told after that first night she stood by me no one else did seemed like other folks thought id poison em shed come an see me anhelp me she was sick the last day she came and when she was going home she fainted in the street i heard folks say i never saw her after that she brushed a tear from her face with the shawl again so as she didnt mind much or suffer she said taint so bad to think of she wasnt one to be able to stand up against things shed have died if shed been me id be glad enough to die myself if i wasnt afraid shed cry over me when i wasnt crying over myself ive been beat about till i dont mind like i used theyre a hard lot down at the mills and you said latimer what sort of a life have you been leading his voice was harsh and his manner repellant only because nature had served him the cruel turn of making them so he was bitterly conscious as he spoke of having chosen the wrong words and uttered them with an appearance of relentless rigour which he would have made any effort to soften baird made a quick movement towards the girl have you any work he asked do you need help dont mind telling us my friend is to take charge of your church at the mills the girl interrupted him she had turned miserably pale under latimers question taint no church of mine she said passionately i haint nothin to do with it i never belonged to no church anyhow an im leadin the kind o life any girld lead that hadnt nothin nor nobody i dont mean with a strangled sob to even myself with her but whatud she ha done if shed ha slipped like i didan then had nothin nornor nobody dont speak of her cried latimer almost fiercely twont hurt her said the girl struggling with a sob again shes past bein hurt even by such as mean im glad of it shes well out of it all she turned as if she would have gone away but baird checked her wait a moment he said perhaps i can be of some service to you you cant do nothin she interrupted nobody cant let me try he said take a note to miss starkweather from me and wait at the house for a few minutes come that isnt much is it youll do that much im sure she looked down at the floor a few seconds and then up at him it had always been considered one of his recommendations that he was so unprofessional in his appearance yes she said slowly i can do that i suppose he drew a notebook from his breastpocket and having written a few words on a leaf of it tore it out and handed it to her take that to miss starkweathers house and say i sent you with it when she was gone he turned to latimer again before i go he said i want to say a few words to youto ask you to make me a promise what is the promise said latimer it is that we shall be friendsfriends baird laid his hand on the mans gaunt shoulder with a nervous grasp as he spoke and his voice was unsteady i have never had a friend answered latimer monotonously i should scarcely know what to do with one then it is time you had one baird replied and i may have something to offer you there may be something inin my feeling which may be worth your having he held out his hand latimer looked at it for a second then at him his sallow face flushing darkly you are offering me a good deal he said i scarcely know whymyself but you dont take my hand latimer baird said and the words were spoken with a faint loss of colour latimer took it flushing more darkly still what have i to offer in return he said i have nothing you had better think again i should only be a kind of shadow on your life i want nothing in returnnothing baird said i dont even ask feeling from you be a shadow on my life if you will why should i have no shadows why should all go smoothly with me while others he paused checking his vehemence as if he had suddenly recognised it let us be friends he said chapter xv the respectable portion of the population of janways mills believed in churchgoing and on sundayschool attendancein fact the most entirely respectable believed that such persons as neglected these duties were preparing themselves for damnation they were a quiet simple and unintellectual people such of them as occasionally read books knew nothing of any literature which was not religious the stories they had followed through certain inexpensive periodicals were of the order which describes the gradual elevation of the worldlyminded or depraved to the plane of churchgoing and sundayschool their few novels made it their motif to prove that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven any hero or heroine of wealth who found peace of mind and married happily only attained these objects through the assistance of some noble though humble unsecular person whose example and instruction led them to adopt unsecular views the point of view of janways mills was narrow and far from charitable when it was respectable its point of view when it was not respectable was desperate even sinners at janways mills were primitive and limited in outlook they did not excuse themselves with specious argument for their crimes of neglecting churchgoing using bad language hanging about barrooms and loose living they were not brilliant wrongdoers and made no attempt at defending themselves or pretending that they did not know they were going to perdition the new england mind is not broad or versatile and having begun life in a puritan atmosphere it is not quick to escape its influence society at the mills recognised no social distinction which was not founded upon the respectability of churchgoing and the observance of social laws made by churchgoers it recognised none because it absolutely knew of none the great world was not far from janways mills but they did not touch each other willowfield was near boston and new york themselves were not far distant but the curious fact being that millions of human minds may work and grow and struggle as if they were the minds of dwellers upon another planet though less than a hundred miles may separate them the actual lives principles and significances of the larger places did not seem to touch the smaller one the smaller one was a village of a few streets of small houses which had grown up about the mills themselves the mills gave employment to a village full of hands so the village gradually evolved itself it was populated by the uneducated labouring class some were respectable some were dissolute and lived low and gross lives but all were uneducated in any sense which implies more than the power to read write and make a few necessary calculations most of them took some newspaper they read of the multimillionaires who lived in new york and chicago and california they read of the politicians in washington they found described to them the great entertainments given by millionaires wives and daughters the marvellous dresses they wore the multifarious ways in which they amused themselves but what they read seemed so totally unlike anything they had ever seen so far apart from their own lives that though they were not aware of the fact the truth was that they believed in them with about the same degree of realisation with which they believed in what they heard in the pulpit of the glories of the new jerusalem no human being exists without an ambition and the ambition of janways millers of the highclass was to possess a neat framehouse with clean nottingham lace curtains at the windows fresh oilcloth on the floor of the front hall furniture covered with green or red reps in the parlour a tapestry brussels carpet and a few lithographs upon the walls it was also the desire of the owners of such possessions that everyone should know that they attended one of the churches that their housecleaning was done regularly that no member of the family frequented barrooms and that they were respectable people it was an ambition which was according to their lights and could be despised by no honest human being however dull it might appear to him it resulted oftener than not in the making of excellent narrow lives which brought harm to no one the lives which went wrong on the streetcorners and in the barrooms often did harm they produced discomfort unhappiness and disorder but as it is also quite certain that no human being produces these things without working out his own punishment for himself while he lives on earth the ends of justice were doubtless attained if a female creature at the mills broke the great social law there was no leaning towards the weakness of pity for her janways was not sufficiently developed mentally to deal with gradations or analysis of causes and impelling powers the girl who brought forth a child without the pale of orthodox marriage was an outcast and a disgraced creature and nobody flinched from pronouncing her both its disgustin thats what i call it it was the custom for respectable wives and mothers to say its disgustin a nice thing shes done for herself i haint no patience with girls like her with no fear o god or religion in them an no modesty and decency she deserves whatever comes to her usually every tragedy befell her which could befall a woman if her child lived it lived the life of wretchedness and was an outcast also the outcome of its existence was determined by the order of woman its mother chanced to be if the maternal instinct was warm and strong within her and she loved it there were a few chances that it might fight through its early years of struggle and expand into a human being who counted as one at least among the worlds millions usually the mother died in the gutter or the hospital but there had been women who survived and when they did so it was often because they made a battle for their children sometimes it was because they were made of the material which is not easily beaten and then they learned as the years went by that the human soul and will may be even stronger than that which may seem at the outset overwhelming fate when the girl susan chapman fell into misfortune and disgrace her path was not made easy for her there were a few months when the young mill hand who brought disaster upon her made love to her and hung about her small home sometimes leaning upon the rickety gate to talk and laugh with her sometimes loitering with her in the streets or taking her to cheap picnics or on rather rowdy excursions she wore the excited and highly pleased air seen in young women of her class when the masculine creature is paying court she spent her wages in personal decoration she bought cheap feathers and artificial flowers and remnants on bargain days and decked herself with them her cheap good looks reached their highest point because she felt the glow of a promotive triumph and her spirits were exhilarated she was nearer happiness than she had ever been before the other girls who were mill hands like herself were full of the usual rather envious jokes about her possible marriage to be married was to achieve a desirable distinction and to work at home instead of at the mills the young man was not an absolute villain he was merely an ignorant foolish young animal at first he had had inchoate beliefs in a domestic future with the girl but the time came when equally inchoate ideas of his own manhood led him to grow cool the new england atmosphere which had not influenced him in all points influenced him in the matter of feeling that the woman a man married must have kept herself respectable the fact that he himself had caused her fall from the plane of decency was of comparatively small moment a man who married a woman who had not managed to keep straight put himself into a sort of ridiculous position he lost masculine distinction this one ceased to lean on the gate and talk at night and went to fewer picnics he was in less high spirits and so was the girl she often looked pale and as if she had been crying then jack williams gave up his place at the mill and left the village he did not tell his sweetheart the morning after he left susan came to her work and found the girls about her wearing a mysterious and interested air what are you whispering about she asked whats the secret taint no secret was the answer most everybodys heard it and i guess it aint no secret to you i guess he told you when he made up his mind to go who she asked jack williams hes gone out to chicago to work somewhere there he kept it pretty dark from us but when he went off on the late train last night joe evans saw him and he said hed had the offer of a firstrate job and was going to it how you stare sue your eyes look as if theyd pop out o yer head she was staring and her skin had turned bluewhite she broke into a short hysteric laugh and fell down then she was very sick and fainted and had to be taken home trembling so that she could scarcely crawl as she walked with great tears dropping down her cold face janways mills knew well enough after this that jack williams had deserted her and had no hesitation in suggesting a reason for his defection the months which followed were filled with the torments of a squalid inferno girls who had regarded her with envy began to refuse to speak to her or to be seen in her company jack williamss companions were either impudent or disdainful the married women stared at her and commented on her as she passed there were no more picnics or excursions for her her feathers became draggled and hung broken in her hat she had no relatives in the village having come from a country place she was thankful that she had not a family of aunts on the spot because she knew they would have despised her and talked her over more than the rest she lived in a bare little room which she rented from a poor couple and she used to sit alone in it huddled up in a heap by the window crying for hours in the evening as she watched the other girls go by laughing and joking with their sweethearts one night when there was a sociable in the little frame methodist church opposite and she saw it lighted up and the people going in dressed in their best clothes and excited at meeting each other the girls giggling at the sight of their favourite young menjust as she had giggled six months beforeher slow tears began to drip faster and the sobs came one upon another until she was choked by them and she began to make a noise she sobbed and cried more convulsively until she began to scream and went into something like hysterics she dropped down on her face and rolled over and over clutching at her breast and her sides and throwing out her arms the people of the house had gone to the sociable and she was alone so no one heard or came near her she shrieked and sobbed and rolled over and over clutching at her flesh trying to gasp out words that choked her o lord she gasped wild with the insensate agony of a poor hysteria torn untaught uncontrolled thing i dont know what ive done i dont taint fair i didnt go to i cant bear it he haint got nothin to bear he aint o lord god look down on me she was the poor helpless outcome of the commonest phase of life but her garret saw a ghastly tragedy as she choked through her hysterics who is to blame for and who to prevent such tragedies let deep thinkers strive to tell the day after this was the one on which little margery latimer came into her life it was in the early spring just before the child had gone to boston to begin her art lessons she had come to janways mills to see a poor woman who had worked for her mother the woman lived in the house in which susan had her bare room she began to talk about the girl half fretfully half contemptuously shes the one jack williams got into trouble and then left to get out of it by herself as well as she could she said she might ha known it gals is fools she cant work at the mills any more an last night when we was all at the sosherble she seems tove had a spasm o some kind she cant get out o bed this mornin and lies there lookin like death an moanin i cant tend to her ive got work o my own to do lansy how she was moanin when i passed her door seemed like shed kill herself oh poor thing cried margery let me go up to her she was a sensitive creature and the colour had ebbed out of her pretty face lor no the woman cried she aint the kind o gal youd oughter be doing things for she was allus right down common an shes sunk down bout as low as a gal can but margery went up to the room where the moaning was going on she stood outside the door on the landing for a few moments her heart trembling in her side before she went in her life had been a simple happy bright one up to this time she had not seen the monster life close at hand she had large childish eyes which were the colour of harebells and exquisitely sympathetic and sweet there were tears in them when she gently opened the door and stood timidly on the threshold let me please let me come in she said dont say i maynt the moaning and low choking sobs went on and in a very few moments they so wrought upon her that she pushed the door farther open and entered the room what she saw was a barren common little place and on the bed a girl lying utterly prostrated by an hysteric tempest which had lasted hours her face was white and swollen and covered with red marks as if she had clutched and torn it with her fingers her dress was torn open at the bosom and her hair tumbled torn and loose about the pillow there was a discoloured place upon her forehead which was settling into a bruise her eyes were puffed with crying until they were almost closed her breast rose with short exhausted but still convulsive sobs margery felt as if she was drawn into a vortex of agony she could not resist it she went to the bed stood still a second trembling and then sank upon her knees and put her face down upon the wretched hand nearest and kissed it with piteous impulsive sympathy oh dont cry like that she said crying herself oh dont oh dont im so sorry for youim so sorry for you she did not know the girl at all she had never even heard of her before but she kissed her hand and cried over it and fondled it against her breast she was one of those human things created by nature to suffer with others and for them and through them she did not know how long it was before the girl became sufficiently articulate to speak to her she herself was scarcely articulate for some time she could only try to find words to meet a need so far beyond her ken she had never come in contact with a woman in this strait before but at last susan was lying in the bed instead of on its tossed and tumbled outside margery had done the nearest simple things for her she had helped her to bathe her face with cold water to undress and put on her nightgown she had prepared her narrow bed for her decently and smoothed and wound up her hair then she had gone downstairs got her a cup of tea and sat by her and made her drink it then she set the room in order and opened the window to air it there is a bruise on your forehead she had said as she was arranging the torn hair you must have struck it against something when you were ill last night i struck it against the wall susan answered in a monotonous voice i did it on purpose i banged my head against the wall until i fell down and was sick margerys face quivered again dont think about it she said you ought not to have been alone somesome friend ought to have been with you i havent got any friends susan answered i dont know why you came up to me i dont guess you know whats the matter with me yes i do said margery you are in great trouble its the worst kind o trouble a woman can get into said susan the muscles of her face beginning to be drawn again i dont see whywhy jack williams can skip off to chicago to a new big job thats a stroke o luckan me left lie here to bear everythingan be picked at an made fun of an druv mad with the way im kicked in the gutter i dont see no right in it there aint no right in it i dont believe theres no god anyhow i wont never believe it again no one cant make me if ive done what gives folks a right to cast me off sos jack williams you havent pretended to love a person and then run away and left them toto suffer said little margery on the verge of sobs again no i havent said the girl her tears beginning to stream anew im not your kind im not educated im only a common mill hand but i did love jack williams all i knew how he had such a nice way with himkind of affectionate anan he was real goodlookin too when he was fixed up if id been married to him no one would have said nothin anan taint nothin but a minister readin somethin anyhowmarryin aint chapter xvi this was before margery went to boston to try to develop her gift for making pretty sketches her father and mother and her brother strained every nerve to earn and save the money to cover her expenses she went away full of innocent joyous hope in the month of may she boarded in a plain quiet house and had two rooms one was her workroom and studio she worked under a goodnatured artist who thought her a rather gifted little creature and used to take her to look at any pictures that were on exhibition taking into consideration her youth and limited advantages she made such progress as led him to say that she had a future before her she had never deserted sue chapman after that first morning in which she had gone to her rescue janways mills was bewildered when it found that the reverend lucien latimers sister went to see jack williams deserted sweetheart and did not disdain to befriend her in her disgrace the churchgoing element with the nottingham lace curtains in its parlour windows would have been shocked but that it was admitted that the latimers has always been a wellthoughtof family an all of em is members in good standin theyre greatly respected in willowfield even the old famlies speak to em when they meet em in the street or at church not that id be willin for my elma ann to sociate with a girl thats gone wrong maybe its sorter different with a ministers sister ministers families has to sociate out o charity an religion go to pray with em an that an read the scripture to make em sense their sinfulness an the danger theyre in but margery did not pray with susan chapman or read the bible to her the girl held obstinately to her statement of unbelief in a god and margery did not feel that her mood was one to which reading the gospel would appeal if she could have explained to her the justice of the difference between jack williams lot and her own she felt they might have advanced perhaps but she could not she used to go to see her and try to alleviate her physical discomfort and miserable poverty she saved her from hunger and cold when she could no longer work at all and she taught her to feel that she was not utterly without a friend what id have done without you god knowsor what ought to be god sue said he didnt care but you did if there is one hes got a lot to learn from some of the people hes made himself after his own image created he themthats what the bible says but i dont believe it if he was as good and kindhearted as the best of us he wouldnt sit upon his throne with angels singing round an playin on harps an him too much interested to see how everything sufferin down below what did he make us for if he couldnt look after us i wouldnt make a thing i wouldnt do my best byan i aint nothin but a factory girl thisthis poor thing thats goin to be born an haint no right to ill do my level best by iti will it shant suffer if i can help ither lips jerking sometimes margery would talk to her a little about jack williamsor rather she would listen while susan talked then susan would cry large slowrolling tears slipping down her cheeks i dont know howhow it happened like this she would say it seems like a kind o awful dream i dont know nothin he was commonjust like i aman he didnt know much but it didnt seem like he was a bad felleran i do blieve he liked me seemed like he did anyways they say hes got a splendid job in chicago he wont never know nothin about what happens margery did not leave her unprovided for when she went to boston it cost very little to keep her for a few months in her small room the people of the house promised to be decently kind to her margery had only been away from home two weeks when the child was born the hysterical paroxysms and violent outbreaks of grief its mother had passed through her convulsive writhings and clutchings and beating of her head against the walls had distorted and exhausted the little creature the women who were with her said its body looked as if it were bruised in spots all over and there was a purple mark on its temple it breathed a few times and died good thing too said the women theres too many in the world thats got a right here itd hev had to go to ruin good thing for it said susan weakly but sullenly from her bed but if its god as makes em how did he come to go to the trouble of making this one an sendin it out if it hadnt no right to come he does make em all doesnt he you wouldnt darst to say he didntyou mrs hopp thats a church member and her white face actually drew itself into a ghastly dreary grin lawsy hes kept pretty busy when she was able to stand on her feet she went back to the mill she was a good worker and hands were needed the girls and women fought shy of her and she had no chance of enjoying any young pleasures or comforts even if she had not been too much broken on the rack of the misery of the last year to have energy to desire them no young man wanted to be seen talking to her no young woman cared to walk with her in the streets she always went home to her room alone and sat alone and thought of what had happened to her trying to explain to herself how it had happened and why it had turned out that she was worse than any other girl she had never felt like a bad girl no one had ever called her one before this last year three months after the child was born and died margery came back to willowfield to spend a week at home she came to see susan and they sat together in the tragic little bare room and talked though the girl had been so delicately pretty before she left home susan saw that she had become much prettier she was dressed in light softly tinted summer stuffs and there was something about her which was curiously flowerlike her longlashed harebell blue eyes seemed to have widened and grown lovelier in their innocent look a more subtle mind than susan chapmans might have said that she seemed to be looking farther into lifes spaces and that she was trembling upon the verge of something unknown and beautiful she talked about boston and the happiness of her life there and of her work and her guileless girlish hopes and ambitions i am doing my very best she said a spot of pink flickering on her cheek i work as hard as i can but you see i am so ignorant i could not have learned anything about art in willowfield but people are so good to mepeople who know a great deal there is one gentleman who comes sometimes to see mr barnard at the studio he is so wonderful it seems to me he has travelled and knows all about the great galleries and the pictures in them he talks so beautifully that everyone listens when he comes in nobody can bear to go on with work for fear of missing something you would think he would not notice a plain little willowfield girl but he has been lovely to me susan he has even looked at my work and criticised it for me and talked to me he nearly always talks to me a little when he comes in and once i met him in the gardens and he stopped and talked there and walked about looking at the flowers with me they had been planting out the spring things and it was like being in fairyland to walk about among them and hear the things he said about pictures it taught me so much she referred to this friend two or three times and once mentioned his name but susan forgot it she was such a beautiful happy little thing and seemed so exquisite an expression of springlike radiant youth and its innocent joy in living that the desolate and stranded creature she had befriended could think of nothing but her own awkward worship and the fascination of the flowerlike charm she used to sit and stare at her seems so queer to see anyone as happy an pretty as you she broke out once oh lawsy i hope nothing wont ever come to spoil it it hadnt ought to be spoiled a month or so later margery paid a visit to her home again she stayed a longer time but susan only saw her once she had come home from boston with a cold and had been put to bed for a day or two one morning susan was in willowfield and met her walking in a quiet street she was walking slowly and looking down as she went as if some thought was abstracting her when susan stopped before her she looked up with a start it was a start which revealed that she had been brought back suddenly from a distance as it were a great distance oh susan she said oh susan she held out her hand in her pretty affectionate way but she was actually a little out of breath im sorry i came on you so sudden susan said i startled you yes she answered i wasi was thinking of things that seem so far off when im in willowfield it seems as ifas if they cant be true does anything ever seem like that to you susan yes said susan one of her hopeless looks leaped into her eyes she did not say what the things were but she stared at margery in a helpless vacant way for a moment are you well susan and have you got work asked margery i am coming to see you tomorrow they spoke of common things for a few minutes and then went their separate ways why it was that when she paid the promised visit the next day and they sat together in their old way and talked susan felt a kind of misery creeping slowly upon her she could not in the least have explained she was not sufficiently developed mentally to have been capable of saying to herself that there was a difference between this visit and the last between this margery and the one who had sat with her before her dull thoughts were too slow to travel to a point so definite in so short a length of time as one afternoon afforded your cold was a pretty bad one wasnt it she asked vaguely once yes was the answer it made me feel weak but it has gone now i am quite well again after that susan saw her but once again as time went on she heard a vague rumour that the latimers were anxious about margerys health just at that time the mill hands gossiped a good deal about willowfield because the reverend john baird was said to be going to europe that led to talk on the subject of other willowfield people and the latimers among them in the rare brief letters margery wrote to her protegee she did not say she was ill once she said her brother lucien had quite suddenly come to boston to see how she was because her mother imagined she must have taken cold she had been in boston about a year then one afternoon susan was in her room standing by her bed forlornly and in a vacant reasonless mood turning over the few coarse little garments she had been able to prepare for her childa few common little shirts and nightgowns and gray flannelsno more she heard someone at the door the handle turned and the door opened as if the person who came in had forgotten the ceremony of knocking susan laid down on the bed the ugly little nightdress she had been looking at it lay there stiff with its coarseness its short arms stretched out she turned about and faced margery latimer who had crossed the threshold and stood before her susan uttered a low frightened cry before she could speak a word the girl looked like a ghost it was a ghost susan thought of this time and not a flower the pure little face was white and drawn the features were sharpened the harebellcoloured eyes had almost a look of wildness it was as if they had been looking at something frightening for a long time until they could not lose the habit of expressing fear susan she said in a strange uncertain voice you didnt expect to see me susan ran to her no no she said i didnt know you was here i thought you was in boston whats the matter oh lawsy margery whats happened to make you look like this nobody knows answered margery they say its the cold they are frightened about me im come to say goodbye to you susan she sank into a chair and sat there panting a little luciens going to take me to europe she said her voice all at once seeming to sound monotonous as if she was reciting a lesson mechanically i always wanted to go thereto visit the picture galleries and study they think the climate will be good for me ive been coughing in the morningsand i cant eat do they think you might be going intoa consumption susan faltered mothers frightened said margery she and the doctor dont know what to think luciens going to take me to europe its expensive butbut he has managed to get the money he sold a little farm he owned hes a good brother said susan suddenly margery began to cry as if she could not help it oh she exclaimed no one knows what a good brother he isnobody but myself he is willing to give up everything toto save meand to save poor mother from awful trouble sometimes i think he is something like christeven like christ he is willing to suffer for other peoplefor their painand weaknessand sin it was so evident that the change which had taken place in her was a woeful one her bright loveliness was goneher simple lovable happiness her nerves seemed all unstrung but it was the piteous strained look in her childlike eyes which stirred poor susans breast to tumult margery she said almost trembling ififif you was to go in a consumption and dieyoure not like meyou neednt be afraid the next moment she was sorry she had said the crude thing margery burst into a passion of weeping susan flew to her and caught her in her arms kneeling down by her i oughtnt to have said it she cried youre too ill to be made to think of such things i was a fool not to seemargery margery dont but margery was too weak to be able to control her sobbing they say thatthat god forgives people she wept ive prayed and prayed to be forgiven forfor my sins ive never meant to be wicked i dont knowi dont know how hush said susan soothing and patting her trembling shoulder hush hush if there is a god margery hes a heap sight better than we give him credit for he dont make people a purpose so they cant help things somehowan dont knowan then send em to burning hell for bein the way he made em we wouldnt do it an he wont you haint no reason to be afraid of dyin margery stayed with her about half an hour there was a curious element in their conversation they spoke as if their interview was a final one neither of them actually expressed the thought in words but a listener would have felt vaguely that they never expected to meet each other again on earth they made no references to the future it was as if no future could be counted upon afterwards when she was alone susan realised that she had never once said when you come back from europe as she was leaving the room margery passed the bed on which the small coarse garments lay the little nightgown with its short sleeves stiffly outstretched seemed to arrest her attention specially she caught at susans dress as if she was unaware that she made the movement or of the sharp shudder which followed it thoseare its things arent they susan she said yes susan answered her sullen look of pain coming back to her face idont knowhow people bear it exclaimed margery it was an exclamation and her hand went quickly up to her mouth almost as if to press it back they dont bear it said susan stonily they have to go through itthats all if you was standin on the gallows with the rope round your neck and the trapdoor under your feet you wouldnt be bearin it but the trapdoor would drop all the same an down youd plungeinto the blackness it was on this morning on her way through the streets that margery dropped in a dead faint upon the pavement and miss amory starkweather passing in her carriage picked her up and carried her home susan chapman never saw her again some months afterwards came the rumour that she had died of consumption in italy chapter xvii when in accordance with bairds instructions susan chapman took the note to miss starkweather she walked through the treeshaded streets feeling as if she had suddenly found herself in a foreign country to the inhabitants of janways mills certain parts of willowfield stood for wealth luxury and decorous splendour the mills which lived within itself was easily impressed itsoccasionally resentfulrespect for willowfield was enormous it did not behold it as a simple provincial town whose business establishments were primitive and whose frame houses even when surrounded by square gardens with flowerbeds adorning them were merely comfortable middleclass abodes of domesticity it was awed by the willowfield times it revered the button factory and bitterly envied the carriages driven and the occasional festivities held by the families of the representatives of these monopolies the carriages were sober and middleaged and so were the parties but to janways mills they illustrated wealth and gaiety people drove about in the vehicles and wore fine clothes and ate cakes and icecream at the partiesneither of which things had ever been possible or ever would become possible to janways and susan who had been a pariah and an outcast at the mills was walking through the best streets carrying a note from the popular minister to the rich miss starkweather who had an entire square white frame house and garden which were her own property the girl felt a little sullen and a little frightened she did not know what would happen to her she did not know how she would be expected to carry herself in a house so representative of wealth and accustomedness to the good things of life perhaps if she had not been desperate and also if she had not known that miss starkweather had been fond of margery she would have evaded going to her i wonder what shell say to me she thought they say shes queer she still felt uncertain and resentful when she stood upon the threshold and rang the bell she presented a stolid countenance to the maid servant who opened the door and received her message when she was at last taken to miss amory she went with an unresponding bearing and being led into a cheerful room where the old woman sat stood before her waiting as if she had really nothing to do with the situation miss amory looked rather like some alert old hawk less predatory by instinct than those of his species usually are you are susan chapman and come from mr baird she said susan nodded he says he met you at mr latimers yes i went there to ask something i couldnt bear not to knowno more than i did about asked miss amory about margery her voice lowering unconsciously how much did you know miss amory asked again nothin rather sullenly but that she was illan went away an died in italy they say put in miss amorylying on a sofa before an open windowon a lovely day when the sun was setting susan chapman started a little and her face changed the unresponsiveness melted away there was something like a glow of relief in her look she became human and lost sight of miss amorys supposed grandeur was it like that she exclaimed was it im thankful to you for telling me somehow i couldnt ask properly when i was face to face with her brother you cant talk to him i never knew whereor howit was i wanted to find out ifif it was all right with her i wanted to know she hadnt suffered so did i miss amory answered and that was what they told me she passed her withered hand across her face i was fond of her she said id reason to be returned susan she was only a delicate little young thingbut she came an stayed by me when i was in hell an no one else would give me a drop of water to cool my tongue i know something about that said miss amory i have heard it talked of wheres your child susan did not redden but the hard look came back to her face for a moment it didnt live but a few minutes she answered what are you doing for your living a faint red showed itself on the girls haggard cheeks and she stared at her with indifferent blankness i worked in the mill till my health broke down for a spell an i had to give up im better now but ive not got a cent to live on an my place was filled up right away wheres the man miss amory demanded i dont know ive never heard a word of him since he slid off to chicago humph said miss amory for a moment or so she sat silent thinking she held her chin in her hand and pinched it presently she looked up could you come and live with me for a month she enquired i believe we might try the experiment i daresay you would rub me when i want rubbing and go errands and help me up and down stairs and carry things for me it just happens that my old jane has been obliged to leave me because shes beginning to be as rheumatic as i am myself and her daughter offers her a good home would you like to try i dont promise to do more than make the experiment the girl flushed hot this time as she looked down on the floor you may guess whether im likely to say yes or not she said i aint had a crust today i believe i could learn to suit you but i never expected anything as good as this to happen to me thank you maam may iwhen must i come take off your bonnet and go and have your dinner and stay now answered miss amory when john baird called later in the day miss amory was walking in the sun in her garden and susan was with her supporting her stiff steps she had been fed her dress had been changed for a neat print and the dragged lines of her face seemed already to have relaxed she no longer wore the look of a creature who is hungry and does not know how long her hunger may last and how much worse it may become i am much obliged to you miss amory baird said when he joined her and he said it almost impetuously today he was in the state of mind when even vicarious good deeds are a support and a consolation to have been a means of doing a good turn even to this stray creature was a comfort miss amory removed her hand from susans arm and allowed baird to place it on his own the girl went away in obedience to a gesture she will do said miss amory and it is a home for her shes not stupid if she fulfils the promise of her first day i may end by interesting myself in developing her brains she has brains the gray matter is there but it has never moved much so far it will be interesting to set it astir but it was not that i thought of when i took her you took her out of the kindness of your heart said baird i took her for that poor dead childs sake returned miss amory for baird began for margerys sake put in miss amory margery latimer when susan was in trouble the child was a tender little angel to her lord what a pure little heart it was as pure as young eves in the garden of edenas pure as young eves murmured baird just that said miss amory rather sharply how do you know it and she turned and looked at him you have heard her brother say a good deal of her yes yes baird answered she seems to have been the life of him well well with emotional abruptness i took this girl for her sake her short life was not wasted if anothers is built upon it thats one of my fantastic fancies i suppose stop a minute the old woman paused a few moments on the garden walk and turned her face upward to look at the blue height and expanse of sky there was a shade of desperate appeal or question on her uplifted rugged countenance when the world gets too much for me she said and i lose my patience with the senselessness of the tragedy of it i get a sort of courage from looking up like thisinto the height and the still clear blueness it sends no answer back to methat my human brain can understandbut it makes me feel that perhaps there is no earth at all i get out of it and away i knowi knowthough i am not like you baird said slowly miss amory came back to earth with a curious look in her eyes yes she answered i should think that perhaps you are one of those who know but one has to have been desperate before one turns to it as a resource its a last oneand the unmerciful powers only know why we should feel it a resource at all as i said it does not answer back and we want answersanswers then they went on walking that poor thing has been a woman at least said miss amory i have been a sort of feminine automaton i have been respectable and she has not all good women are not respectable and all respectable women are not good thats a truism so absolute that it is a platitude and yet there still exist people to whom it would appear a novel statement that poor creature has loved and had her heart broken she has suffered the whole gamut of things she has been a wife without a name a mother without a child she is full of crude tragedy and i have found out already that she is goodgood what is goodness asked baird miss amory gave him another of her sharp looks you are drawing me out she said im not really worth it goodness is quite different from respectability respectability is a strict keeping of the laws men have made to oblige other men to do or not to do the things they want done or left undone the large meaning of the law is punishment no law no punishment no punishment no law and man made both for man if you keep mans law you will be respectable but you may not be good jesus christ was not respectableno one will deny that goodness after all means doing all kindness to all creatures and above all doing no wrong to any thats all are you good no he answered i am not you would probably find it more difficult to be so than i should she responded and i find it hard enoughwithout being handicapped by beauty and the pleasureloving temperament you were started well on the road to the devil when you were born your very charms and virtues were ready to turn out vices in disguise but when such things happen and she shrugged her lean shoulders as we have no one else to dare to blame we can only blame ourselves in a scheme so vague every man must be his own brake baird drew a sharp breath if one only knew that early enough he exclaimed miss amory laughed harshly yes she said part of the vagueness of the schemeif it is a schemeis that it takes half a lifetime to find it out before that we are always either telling ourselves that we are not going to do any harm or that we are under the guidance of a merciful providence that we are not going to do any harm baird repeated that we are not going to do any harm and suddenly its done and cant be undone miss amory added thats it the girl susan chapman was watching them from a window as they walked and talked she bit her lips anxiously as she stood behind the curtain she was trying to imagine what they might be saying to each other suppose it was something which told against her and why should it not be so what good could be said janways mills had borne in upon her the complete sense of her outcast state while professing a republican independence of new england spirit the place figuratively touched its forehead to the earth before miss starkweather she lived on an income inherited from people who had owned mills instead of working them who employedand dischargedhands she would have been regarded as an authority on any subject social or moral and yet it was she who had spoken the first lenient word to a transgressor of the unpardonable type susan had been dumfounded at first and then she had begun to be afraid that the leniency arose from some mistake miss amory would presently discover perhaps hes heard and hes telling her now she said breathlessly as she looked into the garden maybe shell come in and order me out she looked down at her clean dress and a sob rose in her throat at the realisation of the mere physical comfort she had felt during the last hour or twothe comfort of being fed and clothed and enclosed within four walls if she was to be cast back into outer darkness again it would be better to know at once when baird had gone away and miss amory was sitting by her window susan appeared before her again with an ashen complexion and a set look she stood a moment hesitating her hands clasping her elbows behind her back you want to say something to me said miss amory yes the girl answered yes i doan i dont know how are you sure maam are you sure you know quite how bad i have been no said miss amory sit down and tell me susan she said it with an impartiality so serenely free from condemnation that susans obedient sitting down was almost entirely the result of not being able to stand up she so to speak fell into a chair and leaned forward covering her face with her hands i dont believe you know she whispered by experience i know next to nothing miss amory answered but my imagination and my reason tell me a great deal you were not married and you had a child you lost your health and your work i would have worked said the girl from behind her hands sobbingly but without tears oh i would have worked till i droppedi did work till i dropped i kept faintingoh i would have been glad and thankful and grateful yes said miss amory life got worse and worsethey all treated you as if you were a dog those common virtuous people are like the torturers of the inquisition you were hungry and coldcold and hungry you dont know what its like susan moaned you dont know when you get sick and hollow and cramped and stagger about in your bare roomand call out to yourself to ask what made you and where is it and the winds like iceand you huddle in a heap and there are lights in the streets said miss amory and it seems as if there must be something there to be given to you by somebodysomebody and you go out susan got up panting and stared at her you do know she cried almost with passion somehow youve found out what its like i wanted you to know i dont want younot to understand and then of a sudden to send me away im so afraid of you sending me away i shall not send you away for anything you have done in the past said miss amory i dont know what i should have done in the future if you hadnt taken me in susan said perhaps i should have thrown myself under a train but oh with starting dampness in her skin which she wiped off with a sick gesture i did hate to let myself think of it it wasnt the being killedthats nothingbut feeling yourself crushed and torn and twistedi used to stand and shake all over thinking of it and i couldnt have gone on i hated myselfi hated everythingmost of all i hated the thing that made me what right had it i hadnt done nothing to it before i was born seemed like it had made me just for the fun of pushing me under them wheels and seeing them tear and grind me oh how i hated it so have i said miss amory her steady eyes looking more like a hawks than ever susan stared more than before i suppose i ought to have hated jack williams she went on her throat evidently filling but i never did i loved him seemed like i was just his wife that it did i believe it always will thats the way girls get into trouble some man thats got an affectionate way makes em believe theyre as good as married an then they find out its all a lie perhaps some day you may see jack williams again said miss amory he wouldnt look at me answered susan perhaps you wouldnt look at him miss amory remarked with speculative slowness yes i would said susan yes i would i couldnt trust him same as i did beforecause hes proved he aint to be trusted but if he wanted me to marry him i couldnt hold out miss starkweather couldnt you miss amory said still speculative noperhaps you couldnt the girl wiped her eyes and added slowly almost as if she was thinking aloud im not one of the strong onesim not one of the strong onesno more than little margery was she said the last words with a kind of unconscious consciousness while she uttered them her mind had evidently turned back to other timesnot her own but little margerys miss amory drew a deep breath she took up her knitting she asked a question you knew her very wellmargery susan drew her chair closer and looked in the old face with uncertain eyes miss starkweather she said do you think that a girls beinglike mewould make her evilminded would it make her suspicion things and be afraid of themwhen there wasnt nothin i should think that it would quite wistfully it might answered miss amory her knittingneedles flying but for gods sake dont call yourself evilminded youd be evilminded if you were glad to suspectnot if you were sorry and afraid glad with a groan oh lord i guess not but i might be all wrong all the same mightnt i yes you might i loved heroh lord i did love her id reason to the girl went on and her manner had the effect of frightened haste ive suffered awful sometimesthinkin in the night and prayin there wasnt nothin she was such a delicate innocent little thing it would have killed her what were you afraid of oh i dont know susan answered hysterically i dont i only knew she couldnt bear nothin likelike lyin awake nights gaspin an fightin with awful fear she couldntshe couldnt but there are girlswomen who have to bear it said miss amory good god who have to yesyesyes cried susan she drew her hand across her brow as if suddenly it felt damp and for a moment her eyes looked wild with a memory of some awful thing i told her so she said miss amory starkweather turned in her chair with something like a start you told her so she exclaimed susan stared out of the window and her voice fell i didnt go to she answered it was like this that last time she came to see meto tell me how ill she was and how lucien was going to take her awayid been lookin at the little clothes id got ready forit the tears began to roll fast down her cheeks oh miss starkweather they was lyin on the bedan she saw em an turned as white as a sheet ugh the sound broke from miss amory like a short involuntary groan she said she didnt know how people could bear it susan hurried on an i saidjust like you didthat they had to bear it she suddenly hid her face in her arms you were thinking of yourself said miss amory she felt and looked a little sick yes said susan i was thinkin of how it is when a girls goin to have a child an cant get away from itcantcant shes got to go through with itan no one cant save her but i suppose it made her think of her death that was cominher death that i blieve she knowed she was struck for when id said it she looked like some little hunted animal dogs was afterthat had run till its breath was gone an its eyes was startin from its head her little chest went up an down with pantin i didnt wonder when i heard after that shed dropped in the street in a dead faint was that the day i picked her up as she lay on the pavement miss amory asked susan nodded her face still hidden old miss starkweather put out her hand and laid it on the girls shoulder she has had time to forget she said rather as if she was out of breathforget and grow quiet she is dust by nowpeaceful dust let usmy good girllet us remember that happy story of how she died yes answered susan in italylying before the open windowwith the sunset all rosy in the sky but her head rested on her folded arms upon her knee and she sobbed a low deep sob chapter xviii just before the breaking out of the civil war delisleville had been provided with a sensation in a piece of singularly unexpected good fortune which befell one of its most prominent citizens it was indeed good fortune wearing somewhat the proportions of a fairy tale and that such things could happen in delisleville and to a citizen who possessed its entire approval was considered vaguely to the credit of the town one of the facts which had always been counted as an added dignity to the de willoughbys had been their wellknown possession of property in land land was always felt to be dignified and somehow it seemed additionally so when it gained a luxuriously superfluous character by merely lying in huge uncultivated tracts and representing nothing but wide areas and taxes them big dwillerbys of dlisleville owns thousands of acres as never brings em a cent mr stamps had said to his friends at the crossroads at the time big tom had first appeared among them it was mr stamps who had astutely suggested that the stranger was possibly kin to the delisleville family and in his discreet pursuit of knowledge he had made divers discoveries twarnt jedge dwillerby bought the land he went on to explain n it seems like he would hev bin a fool to hev done it bein as taint worked an brings in nothin but ye never know how things may turn out twas the jedges granfather old isham dwillerby bought it fer a kinder joke some said he was blind drunk when he done it but he warnt so drunk but what he got a clar title an he got it mighty cheap too folks ses as he use ter laugh an say he war goin to find gold on it but he never dug fer nonenor fer crops nuther an thar it lies today in the mountains an no one goin nigh it in truth judge de willoughby merely paid his taxes upon it from a sense of patriarchal pride my ancestor bought it he would say i will hand it to my sons in england it would be an estate for an earldom here it means merely taxpaying still i shall not sell it nobody in fact would have been inclined to buy it in those days but there came a time when its value increased hour by hour in the public mind until it was almost beyond computation a chance visitor from the outside world made an interesting discovery on this wild tract of hill and forest was a vein of coal so valuable that to the practical mind of the discoverer the judges unconsciousness of its existence was amazing he himself was a practical driving business schemer from new york he knew the value of what he saw and the availability of the material in consequence of a certain position in which the mines lay before he left delisleville he had explained this with such a presenting of facts that the judge had awakened to an enthusiasm as southern as his previous indifference had been he had no knowledge of business methods he had practised his profession in a magnificent dilettante sort of way which had worn an imposing air and impressed his clients and as he was by inheritance a comparatively rich man he had not been driven by necessity to alter his methods the sudden prospect of becoming a multimillionaire excited him he made napoleonic plans and was dignified and eloquent why should i form a company he said if i am willing to make the first ventures myself the inevitable returns of profit will do the rest and there will be no complications the de willoughby mine will be the de willoughby mine alone i prefer that it should be so the idea of being sole ruler in the scheme made him feel rather like a king and he privately enjoyed the sensation he turned into money all the property he could avail himself of his library table was loaded with books on mining he invested in tons of machinery which were continually arriving from the north or stopping on the way when it should have been arriving he sent for engineers from various parts of the country and amazed them with the unprofessional boldness of his methods he really indulged in a few months of dignified riot of what he imagined to be a splendidly executive nature the plans were completed the machinery placed the engineers and cohorts of workmen engaged in tremendous efforts the judge was beginning to reflect on the management of his future millions whenthe first gun was fired on fort sumter that was the beginning and apparently the end suddenly the storm of war broke forth and its tempest surging through the land swept all before it the country was inundated with catastrophes capitalists foundered schemes were swamped the armies surged to and fro the de willoughby land was marched and fought over scores of hasty shallow graves were dug in it and filled buildings and machinery were destroyed as if a tornado had passed by the judge was a ruined man his realisable property he had allowed to pass from his hands his coal remained in the bowels of the earth the huge income he was to have drawn from it had melted into nothingness nothing could have altered the aspect of this tragedy but there was a singular fact which added to its intensity and bitterness in such a hotbed of secession as was delisleville the fact in question was indeed not easily explainable except upon the grounds either of a quixotic patriotism or upon those of a general disposition to contradictoriness a southern man the head of a southern family the judge opposed the rebellion and openly sided with the government that he had been a man given to argument and contradiction and always priding himself upon refusing to be led by the majority was not to be denied he is fancying himself a spartan hero and looking forward to laurels and history one of his neighbours remarked it is like de willoughby after all he would have been a secessionist if he had lived in boston the union general george washington fought for and handed down to us i will protect the judge said loftily himself but there was no modifying the outburst of wonder and condemnation which overwhelmed him to side with the unionin an aristocratic southern townwas to lose social caste and friends to be held a renegade and an open degraded traitor to home and country at that period to the southerner the only country was the southin the north reigned outer darkness had the judge been a poor white there would have been talk of tar and feathers as a man who had been a leader among the aristocratic classes he was ostracized in the midst of his financial disasters he was treated as an outlaw he had been left a widower a few years before during the war his son de courcy died of fever romaine fell in battle and his sole surviving daughter lost her life through diphtheria contracted in a soldiers hospital the family had sunk into actual poverty the shock of sorrows and disappointment broke the old mans spirit on the day that peace was finally declared he died in his room in the old house which had once been so full of young life and laughter and spirit the only creature with him at the time was his grandson young rupert de willoughby who was de courcys son the sun was rising and its first beams shone in at the open window rosily the old judge lay rubbing his hands slowly together perhaps because they were cold only you left rupert he said and there were so many of us if tomif tom had not been such a failuredont know whether hes aliveor dead if tom his hands slowly ceased moving and his voice trailed off into silence ten minutes later all was over and rupert stood in the world entirely alone for the next two years the life the last de willoughby lived in the old house though distinctly unique was not favourable to the development of youth having been prepared for the practice of the law after the timehonoured de willoughby custom and having also for some months occupied a corner in the small unbusinesslike treeshaded brick building known as the judges office rupert sat now at his grandfathers desk and earned a scant living by endeavouring to hold together the old mans longdiminished practice the profession at the time offered nothing in such places as delisleville even to older and more experienced men no one had any money to go to law with few had any property worth going to law about both armies having swept through it delisleville wore in those days an aspect differing greatly from its old air of hospitable wellbeing and inconsequent good spirits and good cheer its broad verandahed houses had seen hard usage its pavements were worn and broken and in many streets tufted with weeds its fences were dilapidated its rich families had lost their possessions and those who had not been driven away by their necessities were gazing aghast at a future to which it seemed impossible to adjust their easeloving slaveattended luxurious habits of the past houses built of wood after the southern fashion do not well withstand neglect and illfortune porticos and pillars and trelliswork which had been picturesque and imposing when they had been well cared for and gleamed white among creepers and trees lost their charm drearily when paint peeled off trees were cut down and vines were dragged away and died over the whole of the once gay little place there had fallen an air of discouragement desolation and decay financial disaster had crippled the boldest even in centres much more energetic than small unbusinesslike southern towns the country lay as it were prostrate to recover strength and all was at a standstill finding himself penniless rupert de willoughby lived in a corner of the house he had been brought up in such furniture as had survived the havoc of war and the entire dilapidation of old age he had gathered together in three or four rooms which he occupied with the one servant good fortune brought to his door at a time when the forlornness of his changed position was continually accentuated by the untidy irregularity of his life and surroundings he was only able to afford to engage the shiftless services of a slatternly negro girl rendered insubordinate by her newly acquired freedom and he had begun to feel that he should never again find himself encompassed by the decorous system of a wellmanaged household it was at this juncture that uncle matthew arrived and presented his curious petition which was that he should be accepted as general servant with wages or without them he had not belonged to judge de willoughby but to a distant relative and as he was an obstinate and conservative old person he actually felt that to be a free nigger was rather to drop in the social scale whars a man stand sah if he aint got no fambly he said to rupert when he came to offer his services to him he stan nowhar thats war he stan ive got to own up to it marse rupert ise a ristycrat bawn an bred an i low to stay one longs my heads hot ef my old marss fambly hadnt er gone foth en bin scattered to de fo wins of de university id a helt on but when de las of um

keep house like it orter be kep will you try me a mont marse de willoughbywill you try me a week rupert tried him and never regretted the venture in fact uncle matts accomplishments were varied for practical reasons he had been in his time first house servant then coachman he had married at twenty a woman of forty who had been a sort of female mulatto vatel when she had died having overheated herself and caught cold on the occasion of a series of great dinners given at a triumphant political crisis he had taken for his second wife the woman whose ambition it had been to rival her in her culinary arts his third marriage had been even more distinguished his wife had been owned by some extravagantly rich creoles in new orleans and had even lived with them during a year spent in france thereby gaining unheardof culinary accomplishments matthew had always declared that he loved her the best of the three those matrimonial ventures had been a liberal education to him he had learned to cook almost as well as his first and from his second and third he had inherited methods and recipes which were invaluable he seemed to have learned to do everything he dismissed the slatternly negro girl and took upon himself the duties of both man and woman servant the house gradually wore a new aspectdust disappeared windows were bright the scant furniture was arranged to the best possible advantage the scant meals were marvels of perfect cookery and neat serving having prepared a repast uncle matt donned an ancient but respectable coat and stood behind his young masters chair with dignity the dramatic nature of his race was strongly appealed to by the situation in which he found himself a negro of his kind is perfectly capable of building a romance out of much smaller materials the amiable vanity which gave such exalted value to all the belongings of their masters in their days of slavery and which so delighted in all picturesqueness of surrounding is the best of foundations for romances from generation to generation certain circumstances and qualities had conferred a sort of distinction upon their humbleness to be owned by an aristocrat to live in a great house to wait upon young masters who were handsome and accomplished and young mistresses who were beautiful and surrounded by worshippers to be indispensable to de jedge or de cunl or to travel as attendant because some brilliant young son or lovely young daughter could find no one who would wait on them as uncle matt or aunt prissy couldthese things made life to be desired and filled it with excitement and importance to the halcyon days in which such delights were possible uncle matt belonged he was too old to look forward he wanted his past again and to find himself the sole faithful retainer in a once brilliant household with the chance of making himself indispensable to the one remaining scion of an old name assisted him to feel that he was a relic of departed grandeur his contrivances were numberless in a corner of what he called the back gyarden he constructed an enclosure for chickens he bought two or three young fowls and by marvels of management founded a family with them the family once founded he made exchanges with friendly coloured matrons of the vicinity with such results in breeding that uncle matts chickens became celebrated fowls he displayed the same gifts in the management of the garden in a few months after his arrival rupert began to find himself sitting down before the kind of meal he had not expected to contemplate again uncle matt he said where do i get fried chicken and vegetables like theseand honey and fresh butter and cream i dont pay for them yes you do sah yo property pays for em dat ar gyarden sah is black with richnessjest black its a forchen for a pusson what kin contrive an make frens an trade an kin flourish a spade dars fruittrees an grapevines daran room enuf to plant anythingan richness enuf to make peas an taters an beets an

folks for what i aint got de ladies likes tradin an deys mighty neighbourly about yeah memberin yo fambly sah rupert leaned back in his chair and broke into a hearty boyish laugh which it was very good both to see and hear he very seldom laughed i wish i was a genius like you matt he said what luck im in to have you raising chickens and vegetables and negotiating with your lady friends for me i feel like a caliph with a grand vizier i never tasted such chicken or such waffles in my life im settin some tukkeyeggs nowunder de yaller hen said matt with a slyly exultant grin shes a good mother the yaller hen an de way dem fruittrees is gwine ter be loaded is a sight aunt mary field shes tradin with me aready agin fruit puttinup time rupert got up from his chair he caught old matts dusky yellowpalmed paw in his hand and shook it hard his gloomy young face had changed its aspect his eyes suddenly looked like his mothersand delia vanuxem had been said to have the loveliest soft eyes in all the south matt he said i couldnt do without you it isnt only that with a gesture towards the table youits almost as if you had come to save me ole nigger man like me marse rupert said uncle matt savin of a fine young gentleman like what you is hows i gwine ter do it but his wrinkled face looked tremulous with emotion times is gwine ter change for you they is an matts gwine ter stay by yer till dat come to pass marse rupert looking at him curiously i clar to gawd you look like yo young mammy did yo aint always but jes dish yer minnit yo doesan yer did jes now when yer laf do i look like her said rupert im glad of it i want to be like her say uncle matt whenever i look or speak or act like her you tell me when in the course of neighbourly conversation matt mentioned this to his friend aunt mary fields she put a new colour upon it he worshipped his maw an she jest dored down on him she said but taint only he want look like her he doan want look like his paw evone know what cunl de courcy wasan dat chile jest spise him he was allus a monsous proud chile and when de cunl broke loose an went on one o his tars it mos stroyed dat boy wid de disgracefulness dars chilen as doan keer or noticebut dat boy it most stroyed him the big emptysounding house was kept orderly and spotless the back garden exhibited such vegetables as no one else owned the fruittrees and grapevines throve in time the flowerbeds began to bloom brilliantly the rosebushes and shrubs were trimmed the paths swept and people began to apply to uncle matt for slips and seeds he himself became quite young again so inspired was he by his importance and popularity when he went into the town upon errands people stopped to talk to him the young business or professional men called him into their offices to have a chat with him he was such a respectable relic of the times which had been better days to all of them that there were those who were almost confidential with him uncle matt would always understand their sentiments and doctrines and he was always to be relied on for any small service such a cocktail or julep no one else could prepare and there were numerous subtle accomplishments in the matter of mixing liquid refreshments which would have earned a reputation for any man there was no more familiar figure than his in the market or business streets of the hot sunshineflooded little town which the passing armies had left so battered and deserted uncle matt knew all the stories in delisleville he knew how one house was falling to pieces for lack of repairs he heard of the horses that had been sold or had died of old age and left their owners without a beast to draw their rickety buggies or carriages he was deeply interested in the failing fortunes of what had once been the most important store in the town and whose owner had been an aristocratic magnate having no more undignified connection with the place than that of provider of capital as he walked up main street on his way to market with his basket on his arm he saw who had been able to lay in new stock and who had not he saw the new signboards hung outside small houses which had been turned into offices he knew what young scion of a respectable family had begun doctoring or set up as a lawyer sometimes he even dropped in and made brief visits of respectful congratulation but he said privately to his young master de air ob de atmosphere its jest full of dem young lawyers an doctors dar dont seem to be nothin else for a genlemans sons to do but to kyore people or go to law for em of cose dey oughtnt ter hab ter work genlemen oughtnter dey didnt usen to heb ter but now dey is gotter lawdy marse rupert youll hatter scuse me but de young lawyers an de young doctors dey is scattered about dish yer dlisleville there were certain new signboards which excited him to great interest there was one he never passed without pausing to examine and reflect upon it when he came within range of it on his way up the street his pace would slacken and when he reached it he would stop at the edge of the pavement and stand with his basket on his arm gazing at the lettering with an absorbed air of interest and curiosity it read milton january claim agent he could not read but he had heard comments made upon the profession of the owner of this signboard which had filled him with speculative thought he shared the jealousy of strangers who came from the north to delisleville and set up offices which much more intelligent persons than himself burned with he resented them as intruders and felt that their welldressed air and alert businesslike manner was an insult to departed fortunes what they come fer he used to grumble takin away trade an business when they aint none left for de proper people nohow hows we gwine ter live if all new york city an bosn an philadelphy pours in they are not pouring in very fast uncle matt rupert answered him once perhaps it would be better for us if they did they bring some money at any rate there are only one or two of them and one is a claim agent dats jest what i wants ter know said matt whats dey layin claim to what right dey got ter claim anythin gawd knows dar aint much ter claim rupert laughed and gave him a friendly boyish slap on the back they are not claiming things from people but for them they look up claims against the government and try to get indemnity for them they prove claims to back pay and for damages and losses and try to make the government refund uncle matt rubbed his head a minute then he looked up eagerly cunl de willoughby now he said doan you spose dars some back pay owin to him for de damage dat yaller fever done him wot he done cotch from de army rupert laughed a little bitterly no he said im afraid not what dey gwine to refun den said matt dats what id like ter fin out dis hyer idee of refunin please me mightily id be powfle glad to come bang up agin some refunin myself from that time his interest in milton january claim agent increased week by week he used to loiter about talking groups if he caught the sound of his name in the hope of gathering information he was quite shrewd enough to realise his own entire ignorance of many subjects and he had the pride which prevented his being willing to commit himself i aint nothin but a ole nigger he used to say i aint had no eddication like some er dese yere smarties what kin read an cipher an do de double shuffle in de copybook matt aint never rub his back gin no college wall bes thing he knows is dat he doan know nothin dats a powfle useful piece o larnin to help a man black or white from makin a fool er hesself bigger dan what de good lawd tended him fer ter be matt he gradyuated in dat ar knowledge an got he stiffikit when de good lawd turn a man out a fool he got ter be a fool but he needn ter be a bigger fool den what he gotter so he listened in the market where he went every morning to bargain for his bit of beefsteak or fish or butter and where the men and women who kept the stalls knew him as well as they knew each other they all liked him and welcomed him as he approached in his clean old clothes his market basket on his arm his hat set rather knowingly upon his grizzled wool he was in fact rather a flirtatious old party and was counted a great wit and was full of a shrewd humour as well as of grandiloquent compliment i has a jocalder way er talkin i aint gwine ter deny he would say when complimented upon his popularity with the fair sex an dey aint nothin de ladies likes mo dan a man whats jocalder dey loves jokin an dey loves to laff its de way er de sect a man what caynt be jocalder with em he haint no show what dis hyer claim agentin is hearin so much talk about he enquired of a

a claim fer the vally of it an mebbe get government to give ye indemnity mebbe ye kin an mebbe ye caynt they aint keen to do it but mebbe ye could work it through a smart agent like january they say hes as smart as they make em it was a broiling july morning only the people who were obliged to leave their houses for some special reason were to be seen in the streets the market waggons which had come in from the country laden with vegetables and chickens and butter were drawn up under the shadow of the market house that their forlorn horses or mules might escape the glaring hot sun the liveliest business hour had passed and about the waggons a group of market men and women and two or three loiterers were idling in the shade waiting for chancebelated customers there was a general drawing near when uncle matt began his conversation they always wanted to hear what he had to say and always responded with loud sympathetic guffaws to his jocalder remarks hes sech a case uncle matt is the women would say i never seen sich a case when the countryman spoke uncle matt put on an expression of dignified thoughtfulness it was an expression his audience were entirely familiar with and invariably greeted with delight endurin of de war he said i los severial things fust thing i memberize of losin was a par of boots dar was a riggiment passin at de time an de membiers of dat riggiment

direction of government claims and in the course of his marketings and droppings into various stores and young lawyers offices he gathered a good deal of information claims upon the government had not been so far exploited in those days as they were a little later and knowledge of such business and its processes was not as easily obtainable by unbusinesslike persons one morning as he stood at the street corner nearest the claim agents office a little man came out of the place and by chance stopped to cool himself for a few moments under the shade of the very maple tree uncle matt had chosen he was a very small man wearing very large pantaloons and he had a little countenance whose expression was a curious combination of rustic vacancy and incongruous slyness he was evidently from the country and uncle matts respectable in fact rather aristocratic air apparently attracted his attention scuse me sah said matt scuse me addressin of you but dem ar claim agents hev ye got a claim said

his father was a jedgedoggoned ef i didnt chapter xix rupert de willoughby was lying upon the grass in the garden under the shade of a tree the office had been stifling hot and there had been even less to suggest any hope of possible professional business than the blankness of most days held there never was any business but at rare intervals someone dropped in and asked him a question or so his answers to which by the exercise of imagination might be regarded as coming under the head of advice his clients had no money howevernobody had any money and his affairs were assuming a rather desperate aspect he had come home through the hot streets with his straw hat pushed back the moist rings of his black hair lying on a forehead lined with a rather dark frown he went into the garden and threw himself on the grass in the shade he could be physically at ease there at least the old garden had always been a pleasure to him and on a hot summer day it was full of sweet scents and sounds he was fond of at this time there were tangles of honeysuckle and bushes heavy with mockorange an arbour near him was covered by a multiflora rose weighted with masses of its small delicate blossoms within a few feet of it a bed of mignonette grew and the sunwarmed breathing of all these fragrant things was a luxurious accompaniment to the booming of the bees blundering and buzzing in and out of their flowers and the summer languid notes of the stray birds which lit on the branches and called to each other among the thick leaves at twentythree a man may be very young rupert was both young and old his silent resentment of the shadow which he felt had always rested upon him had become a morbid thing it had led him to seclude himself from the gay little delisleville world and cut himself off from young friendships after his motherwho had understood his temperament and his resentmenthad died nobody cared very much for him the youth of delisleville was picturesque pleasureloving and inconsequent it had little parties at which it danced it had little clubs which were vaguely musical or literary and it had an ingenuous belief in the talents and graces displayed at these gatherings the feminine members of these societies were sometimes wonderfully lovely they were very young and had soft eyes and soft southern voices and were the owners of the tiniest arched feet and the slenderest little supple waists in the world until they were marriedwhich usually happened very earlythey were always being made love to and knew that this was what god had made them forthat they should dance a great deal that they should have many flowers and bonbons laid at their small feet that beautiful youths with sentimental tenor voices should serenade them with guitars on moonlight nights which last charming thing led them to congratulate themselves on having been born in the south as such romantic incidents were not a feature of life in new york and boston the masculine members were usually lithe and slim and often of graceful height they frequently possessed their share of good looks danced and rode well and could sing love songs as it was the portion of their fair companions to be made love to it was theirs to make love they often wrote verses and they also were given to arched insteps and eyes with very perceptible fringes for some singular reason it seems that southern blood tends to express itself in fine eyes and lashes but with this simply emotional and happy youth young de willoughby had not amalgamated once he had gone to a dance and his father the colonel had appeared upon the scene as a spectator in a state of exaggeratedly graceful intoxication he was in the condition when he was extremely gallant and paid flowery compliments to each pair of bright eyes he chanced to find himself near when he first caught sight of him rupert was waltzing with a lovely little creature who was a vanuxem and was not unlike the delia tom de willoughby had fallen hopelessly in love with when he saw his father a flash of scarlet shot over the boys face and passing left him looking very black and white his brow drew down into its frown and he began to dance with less spirit when the waltz was at an end he led his partner to her seat and stood a moment silently before her glancing under his black lashes at the colonel who had begun to quote thomas moore and was declaiming the young may moon to a pretty creature with a rather alarmed look in her uplifted eyes it was the first dance at which she had appeared since she had left school suddenly rupert turned to his partner he made her a bow he was a graceful young fellow thank you miss vanuxem thank you for the dance goodnight i am going home are you exclaimed little miss vanuxem but it is so early mr de willoughby i have stayed just ten minutes too long now said rupert thank you again miss vanuxem goodnight he walked across the room to colonel de willoughby i am going home he said in a low fierce voice you had better come with me no sush thing answered the colonel gaily ony just come dont go to roosh with shickens just quoting tom moore to miss baxter bes of all ways to lengthen our days is to steal a few hours from the night my dear the little beauty who had turned with relieved delight to take the arm of a new partner looked at her poetic admirer apologetically mr gaines has come for me colonel de willoughby she said i am engaged to him for this dance and she slipped away clinging almost tenderly to the arm of her enraptured escort who felt himself suddenly transformed into something like a hero colonel de willoughby is so flattering she said and he has such a queer way of paying compliments im almost frightened of him i will see that he does not speak to you again said her partner with an air of magnificent courage he should not have been allowed to come in you of course could not understand butthe men who are here will protect the ladies who are their guests rupert gave his father a long look and turned on his heel he went home and the next time the terpsichorean society invited him to a dance he declined to go nice fellow i am to go to such places he said to himself liable to bring a drunken lunatic down upon them at any minute no the devil take it all im going to stay at home he stayed at home and gradually dropped out of the young glowing innocently frivolous and happy world altogether and it carried on its festivities perfectly well without him the selfishness of lovely youth is a guileless joyous thing and pathetic inasmuch as maturity realises the undue retribution which befalls it as it learns of life when poverty and loneliness fell upon him the boy had no youthful ameliorations even though he was so touchingly young occasionally some old friend of his grandfathers encountered him somewhere and gave him rather florid good advice some kindly matron perhaps asked him to come and see her but there was no one in the place who could do anything practical delisleville had never been a practical place and now its day seemed utterly over its gentlemanly pretence at business had received blows too heavy to recover from until times had lapsed in some of the streets tiny tufts of grass began to show themselves between the stones as he had walked back in the heat rupert had observed these tiny tufts of green with a new sense of their meaning he was thinking of them as he lay upon the grass the warm scent of the mockorange blossoms and roses mingled with honeysuckle in the air the booming of the bees among the multiflora blooms was in his ears what can i do he said to himself there is nothing to be done here there never was much and now there is nothing i cant loaf about and starve i wont beg from people and if i would i havent a relation left who isnt a beggar himselfand there are few enough of them left he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a wellworn greenback he straightened out its creases cautiously and looked at it ive got two dollars he said and no prospect of getting any more even matt cant make two dollars last long the latch of the side gate clicked and the gate opened presently uncle matt appeared round the rosebushes he had his market basket on his arm and wore a thoughtful countenance uncle matt rupert called out to him i wish you would come here notwithstanding his darkling moods he was in a subtle way singularly like delia vanuxem he needed love and tenderness and he was boy enough yet to be unhappy and desolate through lack of them though without quite knowing why he knew uncle matt loved him and the affectionate care the old man surrounded him with was like a warm robe wrapped about a creature suffering from chill he had not analyzed his feeling himself he only knew that he liked to hear his footsteps as he pottered about the house and when he was at his dreariest he was glad to see him come in and to talk a little to him uncle matt came towards him briskly he set his basket down and took off his hat marse rupert he said dis hyers a powfle scorcher of a mawnin dem young lawyers as shets up dey office an comes home to lie in de grass in de shade

of everything else said rupert matt ive just made two dollars this month he looked at the old man with a restless appeal in his big deerlike eyes im very sorry matt he said im terribly sorry but you knowwe cant go on uncle matthew looked down at the grass with a reflective air marse rupert did you never heah nothin bout your uncle marse thomas de willoughby rupert was silent a moment before he answered but it was not because he required time to search his memory yes he said and then was silent again he had heard of poor tom of the big heart from his mother and there had been that in her soft speech of him which had made the great tender creature very real even in his childhood his mother had been his passion as he had been hers neither of them had had others to share their affection and they were by nature creatures born to love his first memory had been of looking up into the soft darkness of the tender eyes which were always brooding over him he had been little more than a baby when he had somehow known that they were very sorrowful and had realised that he loved them more because of their sorrow he had been little older when he found out the reason of their sadness and from that time he had fallen into the habit of watching them and knowing their every look he always remembered the look they wore when she spoke of tom de willoughby and it had been a very touching one yes he said to uncle matt i have heard of him dar was a time a long way back marse rupertfore you was bornedwhen i seemed to year a good deal bout marse thomas dat was when he went away in dat curis

like to see him rupert reflected aloud i should like to see him chapter xx the years had passed for the child sheba so sweetly and had been so full of simple joys and pleasures that they seemed a panorama of lovely changing seasons each a thing of delight there was the spring when she trotted by toms side into the garden and he showed her the little palegreen points of the crocuses hyacinths and tulips pushing their way up through the moist brown earth and when he carried her in his big arms into the woods on the hillsides and they saw the dogwood covered with big white flowers and the wild plumtrees snowed over with delicate blooms and found the blue violets thick among the wet grass and leaves and the frail white windflowers quivering on their stems as they went about in this new fairyland which came every year and which still seemed always a surprise it was their habit to talk to each other a great deal the confidences they had exchanged when the child had not been able to speak and which tom had nevertheless understood were enchanting things when she became older and they strayed about together or sat by the fire her child thoughts and fancies might have been those of some little faun or dryad she grew up among green things with leaves waving above and around her the sun shining upon her and the mountains seeming to stand on guard looking down at her from day to day from year to year from behind one mountain the sun rose every morning and she always saw it and behind another it sank at night after the spring came the summer when the days were golden and drowsy and hot and there were roses and other flowers everywhere wild roses in the woods and by the waysides heavyheaded beauties in their own garden and all the beds and vines a fine riot of colour after these there were blackberries thick on their long brambles and wild grapes in the woods and presently a delicious snap of cold in the clear air night and morning and the trees were dropping golden amber and scarlet leaves while under the pale yellow ones which rustled beneath the chestnuttrees there were brown glossy nuts which fell one by one with a delightful suddenness of sound at irregular intervals there were big chestnuttrees in the woods near their house and tom and sheba used to go before breakfast to look for the nuts which had fallen in the night hamlin county always rose at sunrise or before it and to go out in the heavenly fresh morning air and walk through the rustling thickly fallen yellow leaves under the trees making little darts of joy at the brown glossy things bursting through their big burrs was a delicious exciting thing mornins hot breakfast held keen delights when they returned to it when the big woodfires were lighted and there was snow and rain outside and yams and chestnuts to roast in the ashes and stories to be told and talked over in the glow of the red birchlog and snapping flaming hickory sticks the child used to feel as if she and uncle tom were even nearer together and more comfortable than at any other time uncle tom she said to him as she was standing in the circle of his arm on one such night when she was about ten years old uncle tom we do love each other in the winter dont we yes we do sheba answered tom and were pretty partial to each other even in the summer we love each other at all the times she said and every morning that i get up i love you more than i did when i went to bedevery morning uncle tom tom kissed her he remembered what he had said one morning in the cabin in blairs hollow ten years before perhaps if theres no one to come between us she may be fond of me she was fond of him he was her very little life itself no one had ever come betweennothing ever could she had by that time shot up into a tall slender slip of a girlchild she was passing even with a kind of distinction through the stage of being all long slim legs and big eyes the slim legs were delicately modelled and the big eyes were like pools of goldbrown water fringed with rushes i never seen a young un at thet thar young colty age es was es hansome es thet child o big toms mis doty often remarked by the frequenters of the crossroads postoffice she was considered as was her protector a county institution when she had reached three years old she had been measured against the wall and each year her increase of inches was recorded amid lively demonstrations of interest the smallness of her feet had also been registered and the thickness and growth of her curling hair ranked as a subject of discussion only second in interest to the development of crops but this affection notwithstanding a curious respect for her existed she had played among them in the store in her little dusty pinafore one and all of them had given her rustic offerings bringing her special gifts of yellow popcorn ears or abnormal yams unexpectedly developed in their own gardens or bags of hickory nuts but somehow they did not think or speak of her as they did of each others children tom had built a comfortable white house over whose verandah honeysuckles and roses soon clambered and hung in time the ground enclosed about it had a curious likeness to the bowery unrestraint of the garden he had played in during his childhood it was a pleasure to him to lay it out on the old plan and to plant japonicas flowering almonds and syringa bushes as they had grown in the days when he had played under them as a child or lounged on the grass near them as a boy he and sheba planted everything themselvesor rather sheba walked about with him or stood by his side and talked while he worked in time she knew almost as well as he did the faraway garden he took as his model she learned to know the place by heart were you a little boy then uncle tom she would say when there was a mockorange and a crape myrtle next to the big yellow rosebush there were even times when he found her memory was better than his own and she could correct him ah no uncle tom she would say the pansies were not in the little heartshaped bed they were all round the one with the pink harpflower in the middle when she was six years old he sent for some books and began seriously to work with a view to refreshing his memory on subjects almost forgotten im preparing myself for a nursery governess sheba he said what we want is a nursery governess and i dont know where to find one i shouldnt know how to manage her if i did find her so ive got to post up for the position myself the child was so happy with him in all circumstances that it was easy to teach her anything she had learned to read and write before she discovered that the process she went through to acquire these accomplishments was not an agreeable pastime specially invented by tom for her amusement at eleven years old she had become so interested in her work that she was quite an excited little student by the time she was twelve tom began to shake his head at her if you go on like this he said i shant be able to keep up with you and what ive got to do is to keep ahead if i cant i shall have to send you to the academy at ralston and how should we stand that she came and sat upon his big kneea slim little thing as light as a bird we couldnt stand it uncle tom she said we have to be together we always have been havent we and she rubbed her ruffled head against his huge breast yes we always have been answered tom and it would go pretty hard with us to make a change sheba she was not sent to ralston the war broke out and altered the aspect of things even at the crossroads the bank in which toms modest savings were deposited was swept away by misfortune the primitive resources of hamlin county were depleted as the resources of all the land were but for the existence of the white vineembowered house and the garden full of scents and bloom toms position at the close of the rebellion was far less fortunate than it had been at the time the mystery of blairs hollow had occurred in those old happygolucky days the three rooms behind the store and the three meals mornin cooked for him had been quite sufficient for free and easy peace he had been able to ensure himself these primitive comforts with so little expenditure that money had scarcely seemed an object he had taken eggs in exchange for sugar bacon in exchange for tea and butter in exchange for everything now he had no means of resource but the store and the people were poorer than they had been farms had gone to temporary ruin through unavoidable neglect during the absence of their masters more than one honest fellow had marched away and never returned and their widows were left to struggle with the land and their children the crossroads store which had thriven so wonderfully for a year or two before the breaking out of the war began to wear a less cheerful aspect as far as he himself was concerned tom knew that life was a simple enough thing but by his side there was growing up a young goddess she was not aware that she was a young goddess there was no one in the vicinity of the crossroads who could have informed her that she presented somewhat of that aspect and that she was youth and happiness and natures self at once tom continually indulged in deep reflection on his charge after she was twelve years old she shot up into the tall suppleness of a lovely young birch and she was a sweetly glowing thing a baby had been a different matter the baby had not been so difficult to manage but when he found himself day by day confronting the sweetness of childwomanhood in the eyes that were goldbrown pools and the softening grace of the fair young body he began to be conscious of something like alarm he was not at all sure what he ought to do at this crisis and whether life confining its experiences entirely to talbots crossroads was all that was required i dont know whether its right by thunder he said i dont know whether its right and thats what a man whos taken the place of a young mother ought to know there came a sunday when one of the occasional preachings was to be held at the logcabin church a few miles distant and they were going together as they always did it was a heavenly warm spring morning and sheba having made herself ready wandered into the garden to wait among the flowers the rapturous first scents of the year were there drawn by the sun and blown by vagrant puffs of wind from hyacinths and jonquils white narcissus and blue violets sheba walked among the beds every few minutes kneeling down upon the grass to bury her face in pink and yellow and white clusters inhaling the breath of flowers and the pungent freshness of the sweet brown earth at the same time she had lived among leaves and growing things until she felt herself in some unexplainable way a part of the world they belonged to the world beyond the mountains she knew nothing of but this world which was the brown earth springing forth into green blades and leaves and little streaked buds warming into bloom and sundrenched fragrance setting the birds singing and nestbuilding giving fruits and grain and yellow and scarlet leaves and folding itself later in snow and winter sleepthis world she knew as well as she knew herself the birds were singing and nestbuilding this morning and as she hung over a bed of purple and white hyacinths kneeling on the grass and getting as close to them as she could their perfume mounted to her brain and she began to kiss them i love you she said dwelling on their sweet coolness with her lips i love and love you and suddenly she made a little swoop and kissed the brown earth itself and oh i love you too she said i love you too she looked like young springs self when she stood up as tom came towards her her smile was so radiant a thing that he felt his heart quake with no other reason than this sight of her happy youth what are you thinking of sheba he asked i am thinking she said as she glanced all about her the smile growing more entrancing i am thinking how happy i am and how happy the world is and how i love you and with a pretty laugh the flowers and the sun and the earthand everything in the world yes said tom looking at her tenderly its the spring sheba she caught his arm and clung to it laughing again yes she answered and when it isnt the spring it is the summer and when it isnt the summer it is the autumn and when it isnt the autumn it is the winter and we sit by the fire and know the spring is making its way back every day everything is beautifuleverything is happy uncle tom good lord exclaimed tom why do you say that sheba asked why do you look soso puzzled uncle tom well said tom holding her out at arms length before him the truth is ive suddenly realised something id like to know what im to do with this this laughed sheba am i this you look at me as if i was this you are tom answered ruefully here you suddenly change to a young woman on a mans hands now what am i to do with a grownup young woman im used to babies and teething and swallowing kangaroos out of noahs arksand i know something of measles and letting tucks out of frocks but when it comes to a beautiful young woman there you have me he shook his head as he ended and though his face wore the affectionate humorous smile which had never failed her there was a new element in its kindness which it must be confessed bordered on bewilderment a beautiful grownup young woman he said glancing reflectively over her soft swaying slimness her white frock with its purple ribbon and golden jonquils and up to her tender cheek sheba blushed with sweet delight am i beautiful uncle tom she inquired with a lovely anxiousness in her eyes yes you are admitted tom and it isnt a drawback to you sheba but its likely to make trouble for me but why she said in novels and poetry and sometimes in real life beautiful young women are fallen in love with and then trouble is liable to begin explained tom with amiable gravity there is no one to fall in love with me at the crossroads said sheba sweetly i wish there was good lord exclaimed tom devoutly come along to church sheba and lets go in for fasting and prayer he took her to the preaching in the log cabin and noticed the effect of her entry on the congregation as they went in there were a number of more or less awkward and rawboned young male creatures whose lives were spent chiefly in cornfields and potato patches they were uncomely hewers of wood and drawers of water but they turned their heads to look at her and their eyes followed her as she went to her seat when she had sat down those who could catch glimpses of her involuntarily craned their necks and sat in discomfort until the sermon was over tom recognised this fact and in secret reflected upon it in all its bearings yes he found himself saying mentally id like to know how im going to do my duty by this i dont believe theres a derned thing about it in advice to young mothers the day wore on to its lovely end and lost itself in one of the sunsets which seem to flood the sky with a tide of ripples of melted gold here and there tipped with flame when this was over a clear fair moon hung lighted in the heavens and flooding with silver what had been flooded with gold changed the flametips to pearl sheba strayed in the garden among the flowers tom sitting under the vines of the porch watched her white figure straying in and out among the shrubbery at last he saw her standing on the grass in the full radiance of the moonlight her hands hanging clasped behind her and her face turned upward to the sky as she had wandered about she had done a fanciful thing she had made a wreath of white narcissus and laid it on her hair and she had twisted together a sort of long garland of the same blossoms and cast it loosely round her waist she never did that before tom said as he watched her good lord what a picture she is standing there with her face lifted i wonder what shes thinking of uncle tom she said when she sauntered back to him does the moonlight make you feel sad without being unhappy at all that is what it does to me its the spring sheba he said as he had said it in the morning its the spring she saw that he was looking at her flower garlands and she broke into a shy little laugh you see what you have done to me uncle tom she said now you have told me i am a beautiful young woman i shall always be doing things toto make myself look prettier she came on to the verandah to him and he held out his hand to her thats the spring too sheba he said she yielded as happily and naturally to the enfolding of his big arm in these days as she had done when she was a baby no one but themselves knew what they were to each other they had always talked things over togethertheir affection their pleasures their simple anxieties and responsibilities they had discussed her playthings in the first years of their friendship and her lessons when she had been a little girl tonight the subject which began to occupy them had some seriousness of aspect the changes time and the tide of war had made were bringing tom face to face with a difficulty his hopeful easygoing nature had never contemplated with any realising sensethe want of money even the moderate amount the requirements of their simple lives made necessary its the taxes that a man cant stand up against tom said you may cut off all you like and wear your old clothes but theres a liveliness about taxes that takes the sand out of you talk about the green baytree flourishing and increasing all a tax wants is to be let alone a few years itll come to its full growth without any sunning or watering mine have had to be left alone for a while andwell here we areanother year and will the house be taken sheba asked if i cant pay up itll all gohouse and store and all tom answered then we shall have to go too he turned and looked ruefully at the face beneath the wreath of white narcissus i wish it hadnt come on us just now he said theres no particular season that trouble adds a charm to but it seems to me that its not entitled to the spring when she went upstairs she did not go to bed the moonlight lured her out into the night again outside her window there was a little balcony it was only of painted wood as the rest of the house was but a multiflora rose had climbed over it and hung it with a wonderful drapery and as she stood upon it she unconsciously made herself part of a picture almost strange in its dramatic quality she looked out over the sleeping land to the mountains standing guard where should we go she said the world is on the other side she was not in the mood to observe sound or she would have heard the clear stroke of a horses hoofs on the road she did not even hear the opening of the garden gate she was lost in the silver beauty of the night and a vague dreaming which had fallen upon her on the other side of the purple of the mountains was the world it had always been there and she had always been here presently she found herself sighing aloud though she could not have told why ah she said as softly as young juliet ah me as she could not have told why she sighed so there was no explanation of the fact that having done so she looked downward to the garden path as if something had drawn her eyes there it is possible that some attraction had so drawn them for she found herself looking into a young upturned facethe dark rather beautiful face of a youth who stood and looked upward as if he had stopped involuntarily at sight of her she drew back with a little start and then bent her narcissuscrowned head forward whowho is it she exclaimed he started himself at the sound of her voice she had indeed looked scarcely a real creature a few moments ago he took off his hat and answered i am rupert de willoughby he said i beg pardon for disturbing you it startled me to see you standing there i came to see mr thomas de willoughby it was a singular situation perhaps the moonlight had something to do with it perhaps the spring they stood and looked at each other quite simply as if they did not know that they were strangers a young dryad and faun meeting on a hilltop or in a forests depths by moonlight might have looked at each other with just such clear unstartled eyes and with just such pleasure in each others beauty for of a truth each one was thinking the same thing innocently and with a sudden gladness as he had come up the gardenpath rupert had seen a vision and had stopped unconsciously that instant and sheba looking down had seen a vision tooa beautiful face as young as her own and with eyes that glowed you dont know what you looked like standing there said rupert as simply as the young faun might have spoken it was as if you were a spirit the flowers in your hair looked like great white stars did they she said and stood and softly gazed at him how the boy looked up at her young loveliness he had never so looked at any woman before and then a thought detached itself from the mists of memory and he seemed to remember are you sheba he asked yes i am sheba she answered rather slowly and i remember you too you are the boy he drew nearer to the balcony laying his hand upon the multiflora rose creeper yes yes he said almost tremulous with eagerness you bring it all back you were a little child and i you rode away she said over the hill will you come down to me he said yes she answered and that moment disappeared he stood in the moonlight his head bared his straw hat in his hand he felt as if he was in a dream his face had lost its gloom and yearning and his eyes looked like his mothers when he heard a light foot nearing him he went forward and they met with strange young smiles and took each others hands nearer than the balcony she was even a sweeter thing and the scent of her white flowers floated about her as they stood so smiling tom came and joined them sheba had called him as she passed his door rupert turned round and spoke vaguely conscious as he did so that his words sounded somewhat like words uttered in a dream and were not such as he had planned uncle tom he said idelia vanuxem was my mother chapter xxi the moment ceased to be so fanciful and curiously exalted when his hand was grasped and a big kind palm laid on his shoulder though toms face was full of emotion i think i should have known it he said welcome to you yes looking at him with an affection touched with something like reverence yes indeeddelia vanuxem ive come to you the young fellow said with fine simplicity because i am the only de willoughby left except yourself i am young and im lonelyand my mother always said you had the kindest heart she ever knew i want you to advise me come in to the porch said tom and let us sit down and talk it over he put his arm about sheba and kept his hand on ruperts shoulder and walked so with one on either side to the house between their youthful slimness he moved like a protecting giant where did you come from he asked when they sat down from delisleville rupert answered i did not think of coming here so late tonight but it seems i must have missed my road i was going to ask for lodgings at a place called willets farm i suppose i took the wrong turning and when i saw this house before me i knew it must be yours from what i had heard of it it seemed as if fate had brought me here and when i came up the path i saw sheba she was standing on the little verandah in the moonlight with the roses all around her and she looked so white that i stopped to look up at her uncle tom said sheba wewe knew each other did you said tom thats right his middleaged heart surprised him by giving one quick soft beat he smiled to himself after he had felt it the first moment or so i only stood and looked rupert said i was startled and so was i said sheba but when she leaned forward and looked down on me he went on i remembered something so did i said sheba i leaned forward like that and looked down at you from the porch at the tavernall those years ago when i was a little child and i looked up at youand afterwards i asked about you said rupert it all came back when you spoke tonight and i knew you must be sheba you knew my name but i did not know yours said sheba but after all rather as if consoling herself sheba is not my real name i have another one what is it asked the young fellow quite eagerly his eyes had scarcely left her face an instant she was standing by toms chair and her hands were on his shoulders it is felicia she said uncle tom gave it to mebecause he wanted me to be happy and she curved a slim arm round toms neck and kissed him it was the simplest prettiest thing a man could have seen her life had left her nature as pure and translucent as the clearest brook she had had no one to compare herself with or to be made ashamed or timid by she knew only her own heart and toms love and she smiled as radiantly into the lighting face before her as she would have smiled at a rose or at a young deer she had met in the woods no one had ever looked at her in this way before but being herself a thing which had grown like a flower she felt no shyness and was only glad eve might have smiled at adam so in their first hours big tom sitting between them saw it all a man cannot live a score of years and more utterly cut off from the life of the world without having many a long hour for thought in which he will inevitably find himself turning over the problems which fill the life he has missed tom de willoughby had had many of them he had had no one to talk to whose mind could have worked with his own on winter nights when sheba had been asleep he had found himself gazing into the red embers of his wood fire and pondering on the existence he might have led if fate had been good to him there must be happiness on the earth somewhere he would say somewhere there ought to have been a woman i belonged to and who belonged to me it ought all to have been as much nature as the rain falling and the corn ripening in the sun if we had met when we were young thingson the very brink of it alland smiled into each others eyes and taken each others hands and kissed each others lips we might have ripened together like the corn what is it thats gone wrong all the warm normal affections of manhood which might have remained undeveloped and been cast away had been lavished on the child sheba she had represented his domestic circle you maynt know it sheba he had said once to her but youre a pretty numerous young person youre a mans wife and family and mother and sisters and at least half a dozen boys and girls all his thoughts had concentrated themselves upon herall his psychological problems had held her as their centre all his ethical reasonings had applied themselves to her shes got to be happy he said to himself and shes got to be strong enough to stand up under unhappiness ifif i should be taken away from her when the great thing thatsthats the meaning of it alland the reason of itcomes into her life it ought to come as naturally as summer does if her poor child of a mothergood lord good lord and here he sat in the moonlight and delia vanuxems son was looking at her with ardent awakened young eyes how she listened as rupert told his story and how sweetly she was moved by the pathos of it once or twice she made an involuntary movement forward as if she was drawn towards him and uttered a lovely low exclamation which was a little like the broken coo of a dove rupert did not know that there was pathos in his relation he made only a simple picture of things but as he went on tom saw all the effect of the hot little town left ruined and apathetic after the struggle of war the desolateness of the big house empty but for its three rooms its bare floors echoing to the sound of the lonely pair of feet the garden grown into a neglected jungle the slatternly negro girl in the kitchen singing wild campmeeting hymns as she went about her careless work it sounds so lonely sheba said with tender mournfulness that was what it waslonely rupert answered its been a different place since matt came but it has always been lonely uncle tom putting his hand on the big knee near him as impulsively as a child i love that old matti love him ah so do i burst forth sheba dont you uncle tom and she put her hand on the other knee rupert looked down at the hand it was so fair and soft and full of the expression of sympathysuch an adorably womanly little hand that ones first impulse was to lay ones own upon it he made a movement and then remembered and looked up and their eyes met and rested on each other gently when the subject of the claim was broached sheba thought it like a fairy tale she listened almost with bated breath as rupert had not realised that he was pathetic in the relation of the first part of his story so he did not know that he was picturesque in this but his material had strong colour the old man on the brink of splendid fortune the strange unforeseen national disaster sweeping all before it and leaving only poverty and ruin the untouched wealth of the mines lying beneath the earth on which battles had been foughtall the possibilities the future might hold for one penniless boythese things were full of suggestion and excitement you would be rich said sheba so would uncle tom rupert answered smiling and you too tom had been listening with a reflective look on his face he tilted his chair back and ran his hand through his hair at all events we couldnt lose money if we didnt gain any he said thats where were safe when a mans got to the place where he hasnt anything to lose he can afford to take chances perhaps its worth thinking over lets go to bed children its midnight when they said goodnight to each other the two young hands clung together kindly and sheba looked up with sympathetic eyes would you like to be very rich she asked tonight i am rich he answered that is because you and uncle tom have made me feel as if i belonged to someone it is so long since i have seemed to belong to anyone but now you belong to us said sheba he stood silently looking down at her a moment your eyes look just as they did when you were a little child he said he lifted her hand and pressed his warm young lips to it chapter xxii he awoke the next morning with a glow in his heart which should not be new to youth but was new to him he remembered feeling something rather like it years before when he had been a little boy and had wakened on the morning of his birthday and found his mother kissing him and his bed strewn with gifts he went downstairs and strolling on to the porch saw sheba in the garden as he went to join her he found himself in the midst of familiar paths and growths why he exclaimed stopping before her it is the old garden yes sheba answered uncle tom made it like this because he loved the other one you and i have played in the same garden goodmorning laughing goodmorning he said it is a goodmorning isomehow i have been thinking that when i woke i felt as i used to do when i was a child and woke on my birthday that morning she showed him her domain to the imaginative boy she led with her she seemed like a strange young princess to whom all the land belonged she loved it so and knew so well all it yielded she showed him the cool woods where she always found the first spring flowers the chestnut and walnut trees where she and tom gathered their winter supply of nuts the places where the wild grapes grew thickest and those where the ground was purplecarpeted with violets they wandered on together until they reached a hollow in the road on one side of which a pine wood sloped up a hillside looking dark and cool i come here very often she said quite simply my mother is here then he saw that a little distance above the road a deserted log cabin stood and not far from it two or three pine trees had been cut down so that the sun could shine on a mound over and about which flowers grew it was like a little garden in the midst of the silent wildness he followed her to the pretty spot and she knelt down by it and removed a leaf or a dead flower here and there the little mound was a snowy mass of white blossoms standing thick together and for a yard or so about the earth was starred with the same flowers you see she said uncle tom and i plant new flowers for every month everything is always white sometimes it is all lilies of the valley or white hyacinths and then it is white roses and in the autumn white chrysanthemums uncle tom thought of it when i was a little child and we have done it together ever since we think she knows she stopped and still kneeling looked at him as if suddenly remembering something you have not heard she said she died when i was born and we do not even know her name not her name rupert said but the truth was that he had heard more of the story than she had my father was so stunned with grief that uncle tom said he seemed to think of nothing but that he could not bear to stay he went away the very night they laid her here i suppose she said slowly and looking at the mass of white narcissus instead of at him i suppose when people love each other and one dies the other cannotcannot rupert saw that she was unconsciously trying to explain something to herself and he interposed between her and her thoughts with a hurried effort yes yes he said it must be so when they love each other and one is taken how can the other bear it then she lifted her eyes from the flowers to his again and they looked very large and bright you see she said in an unsteady little voice i had only been alive a few hours when he went away suddenly the brightness in her eyes welled up and fell in two large crystal drops though a smile quivered on her lips dont tell uncle tom she said i never let him know that itit hurts my feelings when i think i had only been alive such a few hoursand there was nobody to care i must have been so little ifif there had been no uncle tom he knelt down by her side and took her hand in his but there was he said there was yes she answered her sweet face trembling with emotion and oh i love him so i love him so she put her free hand on the earth among the white flowers on the mound and i love her too she said somehow i know she would not have forgotten me no no she would not rupert cried and they knelt together hand in hand looking into each others eyes as tenderly as children i have been lonelier than you he said i have had nobody your mother died too when you were very young yes sheba hesitating a moment i will tell you something yes uncle tom loved her he left his home partly because he could not stay and see her marry a man whodid not deserve her did she marry someone like that she asked his forehead flushed she married my father he said and he was a drunken maniac and broke her heart i saw it break when i first remember her she was a lovely young girl with eyes like a gazellesand she cried all their beauty away and grew tired and old and haggard before i was twelve he is dead but i hate him oh she said you have been lonely i have been something worse than that he answered and the gloom came back to his face i have been afraid afraid said sheba of what that i might end like him how do i know it is in my blood oh no she cried we have nearly all been like that he said he was the maddest of them all but he was only like many of the others we grow tall we de willoughbys we have black eyes we drink and we make ourselves insane with morphine its a ghastly thing to think of he shuddered when i am lonely i think of it night and day you must not she said ii will help you to forget it i have often wondered if there was anyone who could he answered i think perhaps you might when they returned to the crossroads there were several customers loitering on the postoffice porch awaiting their arrival and endeavouring to wear an air of concealing no object whatever the uneventful lives they led year after year made men and women alike avid for anything of the nature of news or incident in some mysterious way the air itself seemed to communicate to them anything of interest which might be impending big tom had not felt inclined to be diffuse on the subject of the arrival of his nephew but each customer who brought in a pail of butter or eggs a roll of jeans or a pair of chickens seemed to become enlightened at once as to the position of affairs ye see tom heard doty confiding to a friend as they sat together outside a window of the store ye see its this waythe dwillerbys was born ristycrats i dunno as yed think it to look at tom thars a heap to tom but he aint my idee of a ristycrat my idee is thet mebbe he let out from dlisleville kase he warnt ristycratic enough fur em thar wus a heap of property in the family pears like an now the hull lot of ems dead cept this yere boy that come last night stamps hes seen him in dlisleville an he says hes astavin lookin young feller an thet thars somethin about a claim on the guvment thet ef tom an him dont foller up theyre blamed fools now tom he aint no blamed fool fur not bein a blamed fool ill back tom agin any man in hamlin so when the two young figures were seen sauntering along the road towards the store there were lookerson enough to regard them with interest now hes my idee of a ristycrat remarked mr doty with the manner of a connoisseur kinder tall an slim an highsperrity lookin shebys a gal but shes got it toothet thar sorter racehorse look now haint she i want you to see the store and the people in it sheba was saying its my home you know uncle tom took me there the day after i was born i used to play on the floor behind the counter and near the stove and all those men are my friends rupert had never before liked anything so much as he liked the simple lovingness of this life of hers as she knew the mountains the flowers and the trees she knew and seemed known by the very cows and horses and people she saw thats john huttons old gray horse she had said as she caught sight of one rider in the distance that is billy neils yoke of oxen at another time goodmorning mrs stebbins she called out with the prettiest possible cheer to a woman in an orange cotton skirt as she passed on the road it seems to me sometimes she said to rupert as if i belonged to a family that was scattered over miles and lived in scores of houses they all used to tell uncle tom what would disagree with me when i was cutting my teeth they mounted the steps of the porch laughing the light easy laugh of youth and the loiterers regarded them with undisguised interest and admiration in her pink cotton frock and blooming like a rose in the shade of her frilled pink sunbonnet sheba was fair to see rupert presented an aspect which was admirably contrasting his cool pallor and dense darkness of eyes and hair seemed a delightful background to her young tints of bloom thet thar white linen suit o hisn mr doty said might hev been put on apurpose to kinder set off her looks as well as hisn it was to mr doty sheba went first jake she said this is my cousin mr rupert de willoughby from delisleville mighty glad to be made quainted sir said jake toms mightily sot up at yer comin they all crowded about him and went through the same ceremony it could scarcely be called a ceremony it was such a simple and actually affectionate performance it was so plain that his young good looks and friendly grace of manner reached their hearts at once and that they were glad that he had come they are glad you have come sheba said afterwards you are from the world over there you know waving her hand towards the blue of the mountains we are all glad when we see anything from the outside would you like to go there rupert asked yes she answered with a little nod of her head if uncle tom will goand you they spent almost an hour in the store holding a sort of levee every newcomer bade the young fellow welcome and seemed to accept him as a sort of boon hes a mighty goodlookin young feller they all said and the women added them black eyes o hisn an the way his hair kinks is mighty purty their feelings will be hurt if you dont stay a little said sheba they want to look at you you dont mind it do you no he answered laughing it delights me no one ever wanted to look at me before but i should hardly think they would want to look at me when they might look at you instead they have looked at me for eighteen years she answered they looked at me when i had the measles and saw me turn purple when i had the whoopingcough as they were going away they passed a little man who had just arrived and was hitching to the horserail a rawboned claybank mare he looked up as they neared him and smiled peacefully howdy he said to rupert ye haint seen me afore but i seen you when i was to delisleville it wuz me as told yer nigger yed be a fool if ye didnt get tom ter help yer to look up thet thar claim ye showed horse sense by comin wish ye luck uncle tom said sheba as they sat at their dinner and mornin walked backwards and forwards from the kitchen stove to the diningroom with chicken fried in cream hot biscuits and baked yams we saw mr stamps and he wished us luck he has a claim himself hasnt he said rupert he told matt it was for a yoke of oxen tom broke into a melodious roar of laughter well he said if we can do as well by ours as stamps will do by his we shall be in luck that yoke of oxen has grown from a small beginning if it thrives as it goes on the governments in for a big thing it has grown from a calf said sheba and it wasnt six weeks old a government mule kicked it and broke its leg said tom stamps made veal of it and in two months it was thet heifer o minein six months it was a young steer now its a yoke of oxen said rupert and they were the pride of the county lord lord said tom the united states has got something to engineer chapter xxiii it was doubtless stamps who explained the value of the de willoughby claim to the crossroads excited interest in it mounted to fever heat in a few days the hitching rail was put to such active use that the horses shouldered each other and occasionally bit and kicked and enlivened the air with squeals no one who had an opportunity neglected to appear at the postoffice that he or she might hear the news judge de willoughbys wealth and possessions increased each time they were mentioned the old de willoughby place became a sort of princely domain the good looks of the judges sons and daughters and the splendour of their gifts were spoken of almost with bated breath the coal mines became gold mines the money invested in them something scarcely to be calculated the government at washington it was even inferred had not money enough in its treasury to refund what had been lost and indemnify for the injury done and to think o tom settin gassin yere with us fellers they said admiringly jest same es if he warnt nothin asettin in his shirt sleeves an tradin fer eggs an butter why ef he puts thet thar claim through he kin buy up hamlin id like ter see the way hed fix up sheby said mis doty hed hev her dressed in silks an satinsan diamond earrings soon as look yell hev to go ter washinton city sure enough tom was the remark made oftenest when do ye low to start but tom was not as intoxicated by the prospect as the rest of them his demeanour was thoughtful and unexhilarated whar do ye low to build yer house when ye come into yer money tom he was asked gravely shall ye hev a cupoly wharll ye buy yer land the instinct of hamlin county tended towards expressing any sense of opulence by increasing the size of the house it lived in or by building a new one and invariably by purchasing land nobody had ever become rich in the neighbourhood but no imagination would have found it possible to extend its efforts beyond a certain distance from the crossroads the point of view was wholly primitive and patriarchal big tom was conscious that he had become primitive and patriarchal also though the truth was that he had always been primitive as he sat on the embowered porch of his house in the evening and thought things over while the two young voices murmured near him his reflections were not greatly joyful the years he had spent closed in by the mountains and surrounded by his simple neighbours had been full of peace since sheba had belonged to him they had even held more than peace the end had been that the lonely unhappiness of his youth had seemed a thing so far away that it was rather like a dream only delia vanuxem was not quite like a dream her pitying girlish face and the liquid darkness of her uplifted eyes always came back to him clearly when he called them up in thought he called them up often during these days in which he was pondering as to what it was best to decide to do its the boy who brings her back so he told himself good lord how near she seems the grass has been growing over her for many a year and im an old fellow but she looks just as she did then the world beyond the mountains did not allure him it was easier to sit and see the sun rise and set within the purple boundary than to face life where it was less simple and perhaps less kindly it was from a much less advanced and concentrated civilisation he had fled in his youth and the years which had passed had not made him more fitted to combat with what was more complex trading for butter and eggs over the counter of a country store and discussing dotys corn crop and hayworths pigs hasnt done anything particular towards fitting me to shine in society he said it suits me well enough but its not whats wanted at a ball or a cabinet ministers reception and he shook his head id rather stay where i ama darned sight but the murmuring voices went on near him and little bursts of laughter rang out or two figures wandered about the garden and his thoughts always came back to one pointa point where the sun seemed to shine on things and surround them with a dazzling radiance yes its all very well for me he concluded more than once its well enough for me to sit down and spend the rest of my life looking at the mountains and watching summer change into winter but they are only beginning it alljust beginning so one night he left his chair and went out and walked between them in the moonlight a hand resting on a shoulder of each see he said i want you two to help me to make up my mind about going away asked rupert looking round at him quickly yes do you know we may have a pretty hard time weve no money we should have to live scant enough and unless we had luck we might come back here worse off than we left but we should have tried and we should have been on the other side of the mountains said sheba so we should said tom reflectively and theres a good deal in seeing the other side of the mountains when people are young sheba put her hand on his and looked at him with a glowing face uncle tom she said oh let us go uncle tom said rupert i must go the line showed itself between his black brows again though it was not a frown he put his hand in his pocket and held it out open with a solitary twentydollar bill lying in it thats all ive got he said and thats borrowed if the claim is worth nothing i must earn enough to pay it back all right well all three go said tom the next day he began to develop the plans he had been allowing to form vaguely as a background to his thoughts they were not easy to carry out in the existing condition of general poverty but at lucasville some forty miles distant he was able to raise a mortgage on his land if the worst comes to the worst he said to sheba after we have seen the other side of the mountains do you think you could stand it to come back and live with me in the rooms behind the store sheba sat down upon his knee and put her arms round his neck as she had done when she was ten years old i could live with you anywhere she said the only thing i couldnt stand would be to have to live away from you tom laughed and kissed her he laughed that he might smother a sigh rupert was standing near and looking at her with the eyes that were so like delia vanuxems chapter xxiv for an imaginative or an untravelled person to approach the city of washington at sunrise on a radiant morning is a thing far from unlikely to be remembered since a white and majestic dome rising about a white structure set high and supported by stately colonnades the whole gleaming fair against a background of blue sky forms a picture which does not easily melt away those who reared this great temple of white stone and set it on a hilltop to rule and watch over the land builded better than they knew to the simple and ardent idealist its white stateliness must always suggest something symbolic and after all it is the ardent and simple idealist whose dreams and symbols paint to prosaic human minds the beautiful impossibilities whose unattainable loveliness so allures as to force even the unexalted world into the endeavour to create such reproductions of their forms as crude living will allow tom leaned against the side of the car window and watched the great dome with an air of curious reflection sheba and rupert leaned forward and gazed at it with dreaming eyes it looks as the capitol of a great republic ought to look rupert said spotless and majestic and as if it dominated all it looks down upon with pure laws and dignity and justice just so said tom in the various crises of political excitement in hamlin county he had taken the part of an unbiassed but humorous observer and in that character had gained much experience of a primitive kind what he had been led chiefly to remark in connection with the great republic was that the majesty and spotlessness of its intentions were not invariably realised by mere human units well he said as he took down his valise from the rack were coming in here pretty well fixed for leaving the place millionaires if we had only fifteen cents in our pockets it would be a dead sure thing according to all the biographers i ever read the only thing against us is that we have a little morebut its not enough to spoil our luck that ill swear he was not without reason in the statement few voyagers on the ocean of chance could have dared the journey with less than they had in their possession what weve got to do he had said to rupert is to take care of sheba we two can rough it they walked through the awakening city finding it strange and bare with its broad avenues and streets illpaved bearing traces everywhere of the tragedy of war through which it had passed the public buildings alone had dignity for the rest it wore a singularly provincial and uncompleted aspect its plan was simple and splendid in its vistas and noble spaces but the houses were irregular and without beauty of form negro shanties huddled against some of the most respectable and there were few whose windows or doors did not announce that board and lodging might be obtained within there was no look of wellbeing or wealth anywhere the few equipages in the streets had seen hard service the people who walked were either plainly dressed or shabby genteel about the doors of the principal hotels there were groups of men who wore most of them dispirited or anxious faces ten years later the whole aspect of the place was changing but at this time it was passing through a period of natural fatigue and poverty and was not an inspiring spectacle to penniless newcomers it reminds me a little of delisleville after all said rupert beyond the more frequented quarters of the town they found broad unkempt and as yet unlevelled avenues and streets where modest houses straggled perched on high banks with an air of having found themselves there quite by accident the banks were usually grasscovered and the white picket fences enclosed bits of ground where scant fruittrees and disorderly bushes grew almost every house possessed a porch and almost every porch was scrambled over by an untidy honeysuckle or climbing rose which did its best to clothe with some grace the dilapidated woodwork and the peeled and blistered paint before one of these houses tom stopped to look at a lopsided sign in the little garden which announced that rooms were to be rented within perhaps we can find something here he said that may suit the first ventures of millionaires its the sort of thing that will appeal to the newspaper man who writes the thing up first home of the de willoughbys when they arrived in washington to look up their claim itll make a good woodcut to contrast with the great de willoughby mansion in fifth avenue cost five hundred thousand they mounted the wooden steps built into the bank and knocked at the door rupert and sheba exchanged glances with a little thrill they were young enough to feel a sort of excitement even in taking this first modest step a lady with a gentle sallow face and a faded black cotton gown opened the door her hair hung in depressed but genteel ringlets on each side of her countenance at the back it formed a scant coil upheld by a comb tom thought he observed a gleam of hope in her eye when she saw them she spoke with the accent of virginia yes suh we have rooms disengaged wont you come in she said she led them into a neat but rather painful little parlour the walls were decorated with photographs of deceased relatives in oval frames and encased in glass there was a floral wreath made of hair of different shades and one of white waxenlooking flowers with a vaguely mortuary suggestion in their arrangement there was a basket of wax fruit under a shade on the centre table a silver icewater pitcher on a salver and two photograph albums whose binding had become loosened by much handling there was also a book with a red and gold cover bearing in ornate letters the title life of general robert lee the rooms are not lawge the lady said but they are furnished with the things i brought from my fawthers house in virginia my fawther was judge burford of the burford family of england theres a lord burford in england we always heard it is a very old family she looked as if she found a vague comfort in the statement and tom did not begrudge it to her she looked very worn and anxious and he felt it almost possible that during the last few months she might not always have had quite enough to eat i never thawt in the days when i was judge burfords dawtah of burfordsville she explained that i should come to washington to take boarders there was a time when it was thawt in virginia that judge burford might reach the white house if he would allow himself to be nominated its a great change of circumstances did you want board with the rooms well began tom she interrupted him in some little hurry im afraid it wouldnt be convenient for me to board anyone she said ive not been accustomed to providing for boarders and im not conveniently situated ifif you preferred to economize we do said tom we have come to look up a claim and people on that business are pretty safe to have to economize ive been told ah a claim she ejaculated with combined interest and reverence indeed you are quite right about its being necessary to economize might i enquah if it is a large one i believe it is tom answered and its not likely to be put through in a month and we have not money enough to keep us in luxury for much more probably we shall be able to make it last longer if we take rooms and buy our own food im sure you would suh she answered with a little eager flush on her cheek when people provide for themselves they can sometimes do withoutthings she added the last word hurriedly and gave a little cough which sounded nervous it was finally agreed that they should take three little rooms she showed them in one of which there was a tiny stove upon which they could prepare such simple food as they could provide themselves with the arrangement was not a luxurious one but it proved to be peculiarly suitable to the owners of the great de willoughby claim as they had not broken fast tom went out to explore the neighbourhood in search of food he thought he remembered having seen in a side street a little store when he returned after some wanderings a wood fire was crackling in the stove and sheba had taken off her hat and put on a white apron hello exclaimed tom i borrowed it from miss burford she said i went down to see her she let us have the wood too rupert made the fire she took the paper bags from toms hands and stood on tiptoe to kiss him smiling sweetly at his rather troubled face all my life you have been doing things for me now it is my turn she said i have watched mornin ever since i was born i am going to be your servant in an hour from the time they had taken possession of their quarters they were sitting at a little table before an open window making a breakfast of coffee and eggs sheba was presiding and both men were looking at her flushed cheeks adoringly is the coffee good uncle tom she said just tell me it is good well said tom for the first effort of a millionairess i should say it was chapter xxv the year before this judge rutherford had been sent to congress by the republican party of hamlin county his election had been a wildly exciting and triumphant one such fiery eloquence as his supporters displayed had rarely if ever been poured forth before it was proved by each orator that the return of the democratic candidate would plunge the whole country into the renewal of bloodshed and war this catastrophe having been avoided by the judges election the nationas represented by hamlin countyhad settled down with prospects of peace prosperity and the righting of all old grievances the judge bought a new and shining valise a new and shining suit of broadcloth and a silk hat equally shining and new and went triumphantly to washington the sole drawback to his exultation being that he was obliged to leave jenny behind him with the piano the parlour furniture and the children but hell hev ye thar in the white house ef ye give him time said an ardent constituent who called to congratulate there seemed no end to a political career begun under such auspices but the executive mansion itself the confidence of the rural communities in their representatives was great and respectful it was believed that upon their arrival at the capital business in both houses was temporarily postponed until it had been supported by their expression of opinion and approval it was believed also that the luxury and splendour of a congressmans life was such as ancient rome itself might have paled before and envied a man in washinton city with a congristmans wages has got to be a purty levelheaded feller not to get into highfalutin ways of livin an throwin money about hes got to keep in his mind that this yeres a republic an not a ristycratic despotic monarchy this was a sentiment often expressed and tom de willoughby himself had had vaguely respectful views of the circumstances and possible surroundings of a representative of his country but when he made his first visit to judge rutherford he did not find him installed in a palatial hotel and surrounded by pampered menials he was sitting in a back room in a boardinghousea room which contained a folding bedstead and a stove he sat in a chair which was tilted on its hind legs and his feet rested on the stoves ornamental iron top he had just finished reading a newspaper which lay on the floor beside him and his hands were thrust into his pockets he looked somewhat depressed in spirits when tom was ushered into the room the judge looked round at him uttered a shout of joy and sprang to his feet tom he cried out falling upon him and shaking his hand rather as if he would not object to shaking it off and retaining it as an agreeable object forever tom old tom jupiter tom i dont know how you got here or where you came from butjupiter im glad to see you he went on shaking his hand as he dragged him across the room and pushed him into a dingy armchair by the window and when he had got him there he stood over him grasping his shoulder shaking his hand still tom saw that his chin was actually twitching in a curious way which made his goatee move unsteadily the legislation of your country hasnt made you forget home folks has it said tom forget em exclaimed the judge throwing himself into a seat opposite and leaning forward excitedly with his hands on his knees i never remembered anything in my life as i remember them theyre never out of my mind night or day ive got into a way of dreaming im back to barnesville talking to the boys at the postoffice or listening to jenny playing home sweet home or the maidens prayer i was a bit down yesterday and couldnt eat and in the night there i was in the little diningroom putting away fried chicken and hot biscuits as fast as the nigger girl could bring the dishes on the table good lord how good they were theres nothing like them in washington city he added and he heaved a big sigh why man said tom youre homesick the judge heaved another sigh thrusting his hands deeper into his pockets and looking out of the window yes by jingo he said thats what i am he withdrew his gaze from the world outside the window and returned to tom you see he said ive lived different when a man has been born and brought up among the mountains and lived a country life among folks that are all neighbours and have neighbourly ways city life strikes him hard politics look different here they are different theyre not of the neighbourly kind politicians aint joking each other and having a good time they dont know anything about the other man and they dont care a damn whats hamlin county to them why they dont know anything about hamlin county and as far as ive got they dont want to theyve got their own precincts to attend to and theyre going to do it when a new man comes in if he aint a pretty big fellow that knows how to engineer things and say things to make them listen to him hes only another greenhorn now im not a big fellow tom ive found that out and the first two months after i came blamed if i wasnt so homesick and discouraged that if it hadnt been for seeming to go back on the boys durned if i dont believe i should have gone home big tom sat and regarded his honest face thoughtfully perhaps youre a bigger man than you know he said perhaps youll find that out in time and perhaps other people will the judge shook his head ive not got education enough he said and im not an orator all there is to me is that im not going back on the boys and hamlin i came here to do the square thing by them and the united states and blamed if i aint going to do it as well as i know how now look here said big tom thats pretty good politics to start with if every man that came here came to stand by his partyand the united statesand do the square thing by them the republic would be pretty safe if they couldnt do another durned thing the judge rubbed his already rather rough head and seemed to cheer up a little do you think so he said big tom stood up and gave him a slap on his shoulder think so he exclaimed in his great cheerful voice im a greenhorn myself but good lord i know it making laws for a few million people is a pretty big scheme and its the fellows who intend to do the square thing who are going to put it through this isnt ancient greece or sparta but its my impression that the men who planned and wrote the constitution and did the thinking and orating in those days had a sort of idea of building up a thing just as ornamental and good to write history about as either one and whats more they counted on just such fellows as you to go on carrying the stones and laying them plumb long after they were gone jupiter tom the judge said with something actually like elation in his voice its good to hear you it brings old hamlin back and gives a man sand youre an orator yourself am i said tom no one ever called my attention to it before if its true perhaps itll come in useful now just think of me sitting here gassing exclaimed the judge and never asking what you are here for whats your errand tom perhaps im here to defraud the government tom answered sitting down again or perhaps ive got a fair claim against it thats what ive come to washington to find outwith the other claimant a claim cried the judge and youve left the crossroadsand sheba sheba and the other claimant are in some little rooms weve taken out near dupont circle the other claimant is the only de willoughby left beside myself and he is a youngster of twentythree hes my brother de courcys son the judge glowed with interest he heard the whole story and his excitement grew as he listened the elements of the picturesque in the situation appealed to him greatly the curiously composite mind of the american contains a strong element of the romantic in its most mercantile forms it is attracted by the dramatic when it hails from the wilds it is drawn by it as a child is drawn by colour and light its a big thing the judge ejaculated at intervals when i see you sitting there tom just as you used to sit in your chair on the storeporch it seems as if it could hardly be you thats talking why man itll mean a million if i get money enough to set the mines at work said tom it may mean more millions than one the dingy square room with its worn carpet its turnedup bedstead shabby chairs and iron stove temporarily assumed a new aspect that its walls should contain this fairy tale of possible wealth and power and magnificence made it seem quite soberly respectable and that big tom sitting in the secondhand looking armchair which creaked beneath his weight should in matteroffact tones be relating such a story made judge rutherford regard him with a kind of reverent trouble sheba now he said sheba may be one of the biggest heiresses in the states lord what luck it was for her that fellow left her behind it was luck for me said tom and a faint contemplative grin showed itself on his countenance he was thinking as he often did of the afternoon when he returned from blairs hollow and opened the door of the room behind the store to find the wooden cradle stranded like a small ark in the corner chapter xxvi naturally judge rutherford gravitated towards the little house near dupont circle the first night he mounted the stairs and found himself in the small room confronting the primitive supper he had been invited to share with big tom and his family his honest countenance assumed a cheerfulness long a stranger to it the room looked such a simple homely place with its virginia made carpet its neat scant furnishing and its table set with the plain little meal the judges homesick heart expanded within him he shook hands with tom with fervour rupert he greeted with friendly affection shebaon her entering the room with a plate of hot biscuits which she had been baking in miss burfords stovehe almost kissed now this is something like he said i didnt know there was anything so like barnesville in all washington city and there wasnt till you people brought it i dont know what it is but by thunder it does a mans heart good he sat down with the unconventional air of ease he wore in barnesville when he established himself in one of jennys parlour chairs for the evening lord lord he said youre home folks and youve got home ways thats what it is a month in one of these fashionable hotels would just about kill me having to order things written out on a card and eat em with a hundred folks looking ontheres no comfort in it give me a place where you can all sit up together round the table and smell the good hot coffee and biscuit cooking and the ham and chicken being fried in the kitchen sheba had cooked the supper in miss burfords kitchen her hot biscuits and coffee were made after mornins most respected recipes and her housewifely air was tenderly anxious if it is not very good judge rutherford she said standing shyly at the head of the table before she took her place it is because i am only learning you have learned sheba said the judge looking at the plate of light golden brown and cream white biscuit with the sensitive eye of a connoisseur that plate of biscuit is barnesville and sophrony all over sheba blushed with joy oh uncle tom she said do you think it is i should so like to remind him of barnesville good lord said the judge fact is youve made me feel already as if tom scott might break out yelling in the back yard any minute after the supper was over and the table clear the party of four sat down to talk business and make plans the entire inexperience of the claimants was an obstacle in their path but judge rutherford though not greatly wiser than themselves had means of gaining information which would be of value as he looked over the papers and learned the details of the story the good fellows interest mounted to excitement he rubbed his head and grew flushed and bright of eye by jupiter tom he exclaimed i believe i can be of some use to youi swear i believe i can i havent had much experience but ive seen something of this claim business and if i set my wits to work i can find out from other fellows who know more ill after a moments reflection ill have a talk with farquhar tomorrow thats what ill do great scott in a beaming outburst if i could push it through for you how pleased jenny would be when he went away tom accompanied him downstairs sheba and rupert followed them and all three found themselves lured out into the moonlit night to saunter with him a few yards down the light avenue talking still about their fairy story the judge himself was as fascinated by it as if he had been a child why its such a good story to tell he expatiated and there must be a great deal in that i never heard a better story for gaining sympathythat fine old southern aristocrat standing by the union in a redhot secessionist townactually persecuted on account of it he was persecuted wasnt he he enquired of rupert well rupert answered everybody was furious at him of courseall his friends people who had known him all his life passed him in the street without speaking hed been very popular and he felt it terribly he never was the same man after it began he was old and his spirit gave way just so exclaimed the judge stopping upon the pavement elated even to oratory by the picture presented fine old southern aristocraton the brink of magnificent fortuneproperty turned into money that he may realise itwar breaks out ruins himspartan patriotismone patriot in a town of rebels hated and condemned by everybodybut faithful to his country friendsold friendsrefuse to recognise him fortune gonefriends lostheart broken he snatched toms big hand and shook it enthusiastically tom he said id like to make a speech to the house about it myself i believe they would listen to me how set up jenny would behow set up shed be he left them all in a glow of enthusiasm they could see him gesticulating a little to himself as he walked down the avenue in the moonlight thats just like him said tom hed rather please jenny than set the house of representatives on fire and hed undertake the whole thingwork to give a man a fortune for mere neighbourliness we were a neighbourly lot in hamlin after all the judge went home to his boardinghouse and sat late in his shabby armchair his legs stretched out his hands clasped on the top of his rough head he was thinking the thing out and as he thought it out his excitement grew sometimes he unclasped his hands and rubbed his hair with restless sigh more than once he unconsciously sprang to his feet walked across the floor two or three times and then sat down again he was not a sharp schemer he had not even reached the stage of sophistication which would have suggested to him that sharp scheming might be a necessary adjunct in the engineering of such matters as government claims from any power or tendency to diplomatise he was as free as the illustrative bull in a china shop his bucolic trust in the simple justice and honest disinterestedness of the political representatives of his native land it being granted they were of the republican party might have appeared a touching thing to a more astute and experienced person who had realised it to its limits when he rubbed his hair excitedly or sprang up to walk about these manifestations were indications not of doubt or distrust but of elated motion it was the emotional aspect of the situation which delighted and disturbed him the dramatic picturesqueness of it here was tomgood old tomall hamlin knew tom and his virtues and witticismslord there wasnt a man in the county who didnt love himyes love him and here was sheba that tom had been a father to and what a handsome little creature shed grown intoand but for tom the lord knew what would have become of her and there was that story of the de willoughbys of delislevillehandsome aristocratic lot among the biggest bugs in the statethe fine old judge with his thousands of acres lying uncultivated and he paying his taxes on them through sheer patriarchal pleasure in being a big landowner for years the government had benefited by his taxpaying while he had gained nothing and then there was the accidental discovery of the splendid wealth hidden in the bowels of the earthand the old aristocrats energy and enterprise why if the war had not brought ruin to him and he had carried out his plans the whole state would have been the richer for his mines capital would have been drawn in labour would have been in demandthings would have developedoutsiders would have bought landnew discoveries would have been madethe wealth of the countrys resources would have opened upthe government itself would have benefited by the thing and then the war had ruined all and yet the old judge overwhelmed with disaster as he was had stood by the government and had been scorned and deserted and had died brokenhearted at the end and here were his sole descendantsgood old tom and his little beauty of a protegeeno sheba wasnt a descendant but somehow she counted and this fine young de willoughbyall of them penniless why the justice of the thing stared a man in the face a claim like that must go through at this juncture of his thought judge rutherford was standing upright in the middle of his room his hair was in high disorder and his countenance flushed he struck his right fist hard against the palm of his left hand why the whole things as straight as a string he said its got to go through ill go and see farquhar tomorrow farquhar was a cleverer man than the representative from hamlin county he had been returned several times by his constituents and his life had been spent in localities more allied to effete civilization than was barnesville he knew his washington and had an astute interest in the methods and characteristics of new members of congress particularly perhaps such as the rural districts loomed up behind as a background judge rutherford he had observed at the outset of his brief career in the days when he had first appeared in the house of representatives in his new broadcloth with its new creases and with the uneasy but conscientious expression in his eye theres a good fellow i should say he had remarked to the member at the desk next to him doesnt know what to do exactlyisnt quite sure what he has come forbut means to accomplish it whatsoever it may turn out to be to the best of his ability hed be glad to make friends hes used to neighbours and unceremonious intimacies he made friends with him himself and found the acquaintance of interest at times the faithfully reproduced atmosphere of barnesville had almost a literary colour occasionally though not frequently he encouraged delineation of jenny and tom scott and thacker and the boys he had even inhaled at a distance vague whiffs of sophronias waffles on the morning after the evening spent at dupont circle judge rutherford frankly buttonholed him in the lobby farquhar he said im chock full of a story it kept me awake half the night i want to ask your advice about it its about a claim you shouldnt have let it keep you awake replied farquhar claims are not novel enough its my opinion that washington is more than half populated just now with people who have come to present claims judge rutherfords countenance fell a little as the countenance of an enthusiast readily falls beneath the breath of nonenthusiasm well he said i guess there are plenty of thembut there are not many like this you never heard such a story it would be worth listening to even if you were in the humour to walk ten miles to kick a claim farquhar laughed i have been in them guvnor he said the atmosphere is heavy with carpetbaggers who all have a reason for being paid for something by the government theres one of them nowthat little hoosier hanging about the doorway hes from north carolina and wants pay for a herd of cattle in the hall outside the lobby a little man stood gazing with pale small eyes intent upon the enchanted space within he wore a suit of blue jeans evidently made in the domestic circle he scanned each member of congress who went in or out and his expression was a combination of furtive eagerness and tentative appeal i believe ive seen him before remarked judge rutherford but i dont know him hes been hanging about the place for weeks said farquhar hes always in the strangers gallery when claims come up for discussion he looks as if hed be likely to get what he has come for hoosier as he is i want to talk to you about the de willoughbys said rutherford i cant rest until ive told someone about it i want you to advise me what to do farquhar allowed himself to be led away into a more secluded spot he was not it must be confessed greatly interested but he was well disposed towards the member from hamlin and would listen they sat down together in one of the rooms where such talk might be carried on and the judge forthwith plunged into his story it was as his own instincts had told him a good story he was at once simple and ornate in the tellingsimple in his broad directness and ornate in his dramatic and emotional touches he began with the picture of the de willoughbys of delislevillethe autocratic and aristocratic judge the two picturesque sons and the big unpicturesque one who disappeared from his native town to reappear in the mountains of north carolina and live his primitive life there as the object of general adulation he unconsciously made big tom the most picturesque figure of the lot long before he had finished sketching him farquharwho had been looking out of the windowturned his face towards him he began to feel himself repaid for his amiable if somewhat casual attention he did not look out of the window again the history of big tom de willoughby alone was worth hearing farquhar did not find it necessary to call judge rutherfords attention to the fact that sheba and the mystery of blairs hollow were not to be regarded as evidence he realised that they adorned the situation and seemed to prove things whether it was strictly true that they did so or not the discovery of the coal the fortunes and disasters of judge de willoughby the obstinate loyalty abhorred and condemned of his neighbours his loneliness and poverty and deathhis wasted estates the big bare empty house in which his sole known heir lived alone were material to hold any mans attention and enlarged upon by the member from hamlin were effective indeed now said the judge wiping his forehead when he had finished what do you think of that dont you think these people have a pretty strong claim that story sounds as if they had answered farquhar but the government isnt eager to settle claimsand you never know what will be unearthed if judge de willoughby had not been such a blatantly open old opposer of his neighbours political opinions these people wouldnt have a shadow of a chance by jupiter exclaimed rutherford delightedly he was persecuted persecuted it was a good thing for his relatives said farquhar did you say the people had come to washington all three of them answered the judge and this time his tone was exultant tom and sheba and rupert theyve rented some little rooms out near dupont circle i should like to be taken to see them said farquhar reflectively i should like to have a look at big tom de willoughby would you cried the judge why nothing would suit me betteror them either for that matter ill take you any day you sayany day it aint the easiest thing in the world to put a claim through said farquhar it means plenty of hard knocks and hard work and anxiety do you know that i dont know anything about it answered the judge but im going to get this one through if theres a way of doing it youll be misunderstood and called names and slandered said farquhar regarding his rugged ingenuous face with some curiosity there may be peopleeven in hamlin countywho wont believe you are not up to some big deal what are you doing it for why for tom and sheba and rupert said the judge in an outburst of neighbourliness thats folks enough to do it for aint it theres three of emand id do it for ary oneas we say in barnesville in discreet correction of the colloquialism farquhar laughed a little and put a hand on his shoulder as they moved away together i believe you would he said perhaps that sort of thing is commoner in barnesville than in washington i believe you would take me to see the claimants tomorrow chapter xxvii when judge rutherford piloted him up the broad unpaved avenue towards the small house near dupont circle the first objects which caught farquhars gaze were two young people standing among the unkempt rose and syringa bushes in the little front garden the slim grace and bloom of their youth would have caught any eye they were laughing happily and the girl held a branch of rosy blossoms in her hand are they the claimants farquhar enquired one of them is answered rutherford but shebasheba counts somehow sheba looked at the stranger with the soft gaze of deerlike eyes when he was presented to her there was no shyness in her woodland smile judge rutherford she said uncle matt has comeruperts matt you know we cant help laughing about it but we cant help being happy the boyish southern face at her side laughed and glowed matt represented to rupert the lares and penates his emotional nature required and had been denied if he were not such a practical creature he said i might not know what to do with him but he worked his way here by engaging himself for the journey as a sort of nurse to an invalid young man who wanted to join his family in washington and was too weak to travel alone the further from romance the world drifts the fairer it becomes in its fagged eyes so few stories unfold themselves sweetly from beginning to end that a first chapter is always more or less alluring and as he marked the youth and beauty of those two and saw how their young eyes and smiles met in question and response at every thought to farquhar who still retained the fragments of an imagination not wholly blighted by the house of representatives it seemed rather as if he had wandered into a world where young cupid and psyche still moved and breathed in human guise as central figures of a government claim the pair were exquisitely incongruous their youth was so radiant and untried their bright good looks so bloomed that the man looking at them feltwith a realising sense of humour as well as fanciful sentimentas if a spring wind wafted through a wood close grown with wild daffodils had swept into a heated manufactory where machinery whirred and illclad workers bent over their toil uncle tom will be very glad to see you said sheba as they went into the house judge rutherford says you will tell us what to do an interesting feature of the situation to farquhar was the entire frankness and simplicity of those concerned in it it was so clear that they knew nothing of the complications they might be called upon to face that their ignorance was of the order of charm if he had been some sharper claimant come to fleece them their visitor knew this young dryads eyes would have smiled at him just as gratefully as they mounted the stairs a huge laugh broke forth above and when they entered the small sittingroom uncle matt stood before big tom holding forth gravely his gray wool bared his decently shabby hat in his hand id er come as ladys maid marse thomas de willoughby he was saying ef i couldnt er got here no other way seemed like i jest got to honin atter marse rupert an i couldnt er stayed nohow i gotter be whar dat boy isi jest gotter big tom rising to his full height to shake hands with his visitor appeared physically to cast such disparagement on the size of the room as was almost embarrassing farquhar saw all his values as he met his honest humourous eye ive been talking to my nephews bodyguard he said all right uncle matt you just go to miss burford and ask her to find you a shakedown theres always a place to be found for a fellow like you marse thomas de willoughby said matt dish yer niggah mans not gwine to be in no ones way i come yere to workdats what i come yere for an works a thing dat kin be hunted downen a man aint needin no gun to hunt it nederan he neednt be no mighty nimrod and he made his best bow to both men and shuffled out of the room to farquhar his visit was an interesting experience and a novel one for months he had been feeling that he lived in the whirl of a maelstrom of schemes and jobberies the inevitable result of the policy of a government which had promised to recoup those it had involuntarily wronged during a national convulsion upon every side there had sprung up claimantsmany an honest one and hordes of those not honest there were obvious thieves and specious ones brilliant tricksters and dull ones newspaper literature had been incited by the number and variety of claims and claimsto a jocularity which spread over all the land farquhar had seen most of the typesthe greenhorn the astute planner the man who had a wrong burning in his breast the man who knew how to approach his subject and the man who did not the man who buttonholed everybody and was diffuse and hopeful and the man who was helpless before the task he had undertaken he had never however seen anything like the de willoughby claimantsbig tom telling his straightforward story with his unsanguine air the attractive youngster adding detail with simple directness and the girl sheba her roes eyes dilated with eager interest hanging upon their every word it is one of the best stories ive heard he said to rutherford on their way back but its a big claimits a huge claim and the government is beginning to get restive but dont you think theyll get it through exclaimed judge rutherford aint they bound to get it its the lords truthevery word they speakthe lords truth yes answered farquhar thats how it struck me but as a rule it isnt the lords truth that carries a big claim through he broke into a short laugh as if at an inward realisation of the aspect of the situation they are as straightforward as a lot of children he said they have nothing to hide and they wouldnt know how to hide it if they had it would be rather a joke if and he laughed again if what asked rutherford ah well if that very fact was the thing which carried them through his laugh ending in a shrewd smile this carried the ingenuous mind of his companion beyond its depth i dont see where the joke would come in he said rather ruefully i should have thought nothing else would do it for them farquhar slapped him on the shoulder so you would he said thats why you are the best advocate they could have you are all woven out of the same cloth you stand by themand so will i judge rutherford seized his hand and shook it with affectionately ardent pumpings thats what i wanted to make sure of he said im going to work at this thing and i want a man to help me who knows the ropes lord how i should like to go back to hamlin and tell jenny and the boys that id put tom through and as they walked up the enclosed road to the capitol he devoted himself to describing anew big toms virtue popularity and witticisms for weeks talbots crossroads found itself provided with a conversational topic of absorbing interest ethan cronan who had temporarily taken on the postoffice and store had no cause to fear that the old headquarters was in danger of losing popularity the truth was that big tom had so long presided over the daily gatherings that the new occupant of the premises was regarded merely as a sort of friendly representative being an amiable and unambitious soul ethan in fact regarded himself in the same light and felt supported and indeed elevated by the fact that he stood in the shoes of a public character so universally popular and admired i aint tom an i caynt never come anigh him he said but i kin do my best not to cast no disgrace on his place an allus tradin as fair as i know how its a kinder honor to set in his chairs an weigh sugar out in the scales he usedan it drors trade too during the passage of the first few weeks horses waggons and oxteams crowded about the hitchingposts while excitement ran high at mailtime the general opinion was that any post might bring the news that congress was sitting on the great de willoughby claim and that washington waited breathless for its decision that all other national business should be suspended seemed inevitable that any mail should come and go without bringing some news was not contemplated the riders of the horses and owners of the waggons sat upon the stone porch and discussed probabilities they told each other stories they had gathered of the bygone glories of the de willoughbys of the obstinate loyalty of the old judge and the bitter indignation of his neighbours and enlarged upon the strength of the claim this gave him to the consideration of the government tom wont have no trouble with his claim was the general opinion hell just waltz it through thar wont be a hitch but after the first letter in which he announced his safe arrival in the capital city tom wrote no more for a week or so which caused a disappointment only ameliorated by the belief that he was engaged in waltzing the claim through each man felt it necessary to visit the crossroads every day to talk over the possible methods employed and to make valuable suggestions interest never flagged but it was greatly added to when it was known that judge rutherford had ranged himself on toms side hes the poplarest man in hamlin county it was said an hes bound to be a poplar man in congress an have a pull but when the summer had passed and a touch of frost in the night air loosened the chestnuts in their burrs and a stray morning breeze shook them in showers down upon the carpet of rustling yellowed leaves toms letters had become few and far between and none of them had contained any account of the intentions of the legislative body with regard to the claim theres nothing to tell boys he wrote as far as ive gone it seems a man gets a claim through congress by waiting about washington and telling his story to different people until he wears them outor they wear him out for some time after this they did not hear from him at all the winter set in and the habitues of the crossroads postoffice gathered about the glowing stove under the influence of cold gray skies biting air leafless trees and bare land the claim seemed somehow to have receded into the distance the sanguine confidence of the community had not subsided into doubt so much as into helpless mystification months had passed and nothing whatsoever had happened seems somehow said jabe doty one night as he tilted his chair forward and stared at the fire in the stove seems somehow as if tom was a right smart ways offes ef he got furder as the winter closed inamost like washinton city hed moved a thousand miles or so out west somewhars an took him with it chapter xxviii to tom himself it seemed that it was the old easygoing mountain life which had receded the days when he had sat upon the stone porch and watched the sun rise from behind one mountain and set behind another seemed to belong to a life lived centuries ago but that he knew little of occult beliefs and mysteries he would have said to himself that all these things must have happened in a long past incarnation the matter of the de willoughby claim was brought before the house judge rutherford opened the subject one day with a good deal of nervous excitement he had supplied himself with many notes and found some little difficulty in managing them being new to the work and he grew hot and uncertain because he could not secure an audience claims had already become old and tiresome stories and members who were unoccupied pursued their conversation unmovedly giving the speaker only an occasional detached glance the two representatives of their country sitting nearest to him were not at all furtively eating apples and casting their cores and parings into their particular wastepaper baskets this was discouraging and baffling to quote the judge himself no one knew anything about hamlin county and certainly no one was disturbed by any desire to be told about it that night rutherford went to the house near dupont circle big tom was sitting in the porch with rupert and sheba uncle matt was digging about the roots of a rosebush and the judge caught a glimpse of miss burford looking out from behind the parlour curtains the judge wore a wearied and vaguely bewildered look as he sat down and wiped his forehead with a large clean white handkerchief its all different from what i thoughtits all different he said things often are remarked tom oftener than not rupert and sheba glanced at each other questioningly and listened with anxious eyes and its different in a different way from what i expected the judge went on they might have said and done a dozen things i should have been sort of ready for but they didnt somehow it seemed as ifas if the whole thing didnt matter tom got up and began to walk about thats not the way things begin that are going to rush through he said sheba followed him and slipped her hand through his arm do you think she faltered that perhaps we shall not get the money at all uncle tom tom folded her hand in hiswhich was easily done im afraid that if we do get it he answered it will not come to us before we want it pretty badlythe lord knows how badly for every day counts in the expenditure of a limited sum and on days of discouragement toms calculation of their resources left him a troubled man when judge rutherford had gone rupert sat with sheba in the scented summer darkness he drew his chair opposite to hers and took one of her hands in both of his own suppose i have done a wrong thing he said suppose i have dragged you and uncle tom into trouble i am glad you came in a quick soft voice i am glad you came and the slight warm fingers closed round his he lifted them to his lips and kissed them over and over again are you glad i came he murmured oh sheba sheba why do you say oh sheba she asked because i love you soand i am so youngand i dont know what to do you know i love you dont you she leaned forward so that he saw her lovely gazelle eyes lifted and most innocently tender i want you to love me she said i could not bear you not to love me he hesitated a second and then suddenly pressed his glowing face upon her palm but i dont love you as uncle tom loves you sheba he said i love youyoung as i ami love youdifferently her swaying nearer to him was a sweetly unconscious and involuntary thing their young eyes drowned themselves in each other i want you she said the note of a young ringdove answering her mate murmuring in her voice i want you to love meas you love me i love your way of loving me darling broke from him his boys heart beating fast and high and their soft young lips were through some mystery of power drawn so near to each other that they met like flowers moved to touching by the summer wind later rupert went to tom who sat by an open window in his room and looked out on the moonlit stretch of avenue the boys heart was still beating fast and as the white light struck his face it showed his eyes more like delia vanuxems than they had ever been their darkness held just the look tom remembered but could never have described or explained to himself uncle tom he began in an unsteady voice i couldnt go to bed without telling you tom glanced up at him and learned a great deal he put a big hand on his shoulder sit down boy he said his kind eyes warming rupert sat down perhaps i ought not to have done it he broke forth i did not know i was going to do it i suppose i am too young i did not mean tobut i could not help it sheba tom inquired simply her eyes were so lovely poured forth the boy she looked at me so like an angel whenever she is near me it seems as if something were drawing us together yes was toms quiet answer i want to tell you all about it impetuously i have been so lonely uncle tom since my mother died you dont know how i loved herhow close we were to each other she was so sweet and wonderfuland i had nothing else tom nodded gently i remember he said i never forgot he put the big hand on the boys knee this time i loved her too he said and i had nothing else then you knowyou know cried rupert you remember what it was to sit quite near her and see her look at you in that innocent wayhow you longed to cry out and take her in your arms tom stirred in his seat time rolled back twentyfive years oh my god yesi remember he answered it was like that tonight the young lover went on and i could not stop myself i told her i loved herand she said she wanted me to love herand we kissed each other big tom got up and stood before the open window his hands were thrust deep into his pockets and he stared out at the beauty of the night good lord he said thats what ought to come to every man that livesbut it doesnt rupert poured forth his confession restrained no more from that first night when i rode through the mountains over the white road and stopped at your gatesince i looked up and saw her standing on the balcony with the narcissus in her hair it has always been the same thing it began that very momentit was there when she leaned forward and spoke to me i had never thought of a woman beforei was too poor and sad and lonely and young and there she wasall whiteand it seemed as if she was mine tom nodded his head as if to a white rosebush in the small garden i am as poor as ever i was said rupert i am a beggar if we lose our claim but i am not sad and i am not lonelyi cant bei cant be i am happyeverythings happybecause she knowsand i have kissed her what did you think i would say when you told me tom asked i dont know impetuously but i knew i must come to you it seems a million years ago since that hot morning in the old garden at delislevillewhen i had never seen her one of the things i have thought about a good deal said tom with quite a practical manner has been love i had lots of time to think over things at the crossroads and i used to work them out as far as my mind would carry me loves as much an element as the rest of them theres earth air fire waterand love it has to be calculated for what ive reasoned out is that it has not been calculated for enough its going to come to all of usand it will either come and stay and make the old earth bloom with flowersor it will come and go and leave it like a plain swept by fire its not a trivial thing that only boys and girls play with its betterand worse it ought to be prepared for and treated well its not often treated well people have got into the way of expecting trouble and tragedy to come out of it we are always hearing of its unhappiness in books poets write about it that way i suppose it is often unhappy said rupert but just now it seems as if it could not be what ive been wanting to see said tom is young love come up like a flower and be given its dew and sun and rainand bloom and bloom its best he drew a big sigh that poor child who lies on the hillside under the pines he went on shebas motherhers was young loveand it brought tragedy and death delia his voice was unsteady your mothers was young love and her heart was broken no its not often well treated and when you and sheba came to me that night with your boy and girl eyes shining with gladness just because you had met each other i said to myself by the lord here is what it springs from perhaps it may come to them i wonder if it will you thought it might even then rupert cried yes i did was toms answer you were youngyou were drawn togetherit seemed natural i used to watch you and think it over making a kind of picture to myself of how it would be if two young things could meet each other and join hands and wander on among roses until they reached the gate of lifeand it swung open for them and they passed through and found another paradise he stopped a second and turned to look at ruperts dreamy face with a smile not all humorous im a sentimental chap for my size he added thats what i wanted for sheba and youthats what i want that sort of thing was left out of my life but i should like to see it before im done with good god why cant people be happy i want people to be happy the boy was trembling uncle tom he said sheba and i are happy tonight then god have mercy on the soul of the man who would spoil it for you said big tom with actual solemnity im not that man you two just go on being happy try and make up for what your two mothers had to bear rupert got up from his chair and caught the big hand in his it was a boys action and he looked particularly like a boy as he did it it is just like you he broke forth i did not know what you would say when i told youbut i ought to have known you would say something like this itsits as big as you are uncle tom ingenuously that was his goodnight when he went away big tom settled into his chair again and looked out for some time longer at the bright night he was going back to two other nights which lay in the years behind one was the night he turned his back on delisleville and rode towards the mountain with a weight on his kindly heart which he had grimly told himself seemed to weigh a ton the other was the night he had been wakened from his sleep by the knock on the door of the bedroom behind the crossroads postoffice and had ridden out under the whiteness of the moon to find in the bare cabin at blairs hollow the little fair girl who had sobbed and died as she clung to his warm hand chapter xxix the world had heard and talked much of the reverend john baird in the years which followed his return to willowfield during the first few months after his reappearance among them his flock had passed through a phase of restless uncertainty with regard to him certain elder members of his congregation had privately discussed questions of doctrine with anxiousness had not nature already arraigned herself upon the mans side by bestowing upon him a powerful individuality heads might have been shaken and the matter discussed openly instead of in considerately confidential conclave it was however less easy to enter into argument with such a man than with one slow and uncertain of tongue and one whose fortunes rested in the hands of the questioners besides it was not to be denied that even the elderly and argumentative found themselves listening to his discourses the young and emotional often thrilled and quaked before them in his hour he was the pioneer of what today we call the modern and seemed to speak his message not to a heterogeneous mental mass but to each individual man and woman who sat before him with upturned face he was daringly human for the time in which he lived it being the hour when humanity was overpowered by deity and to be human was to be iconoclastic his was not the doctrine of the futureof future repentance for the wrongs done today of future reward for the good today achieves all deeds being balanced on a mercantile account of profit and loss his was a cry almost fierce demanding in the name of human woe that today shall hold no cruelty no evil done even to the smallest and most unregarded thing by some chancethough he alone realised the truth of the factthe subjects of his most realistic and intense appeals to his hearers had the habit of developing themselves in his close talks with latimer among the friends of the man on whom all things seemed to smile the man on whom the sun had never shone and who faithfully worshipped him was known as his shadow it was not an unfitting figure of speech dark gloomy and inarticulate he was a strange contrast to the man he loved but from the hour he had stood by latimers side leaning against the rail of the returning steamer listening to the monotonously related story of the mans bereavement john baird had felt that fate herself had knit their lives together he had walked the deck alone long hours that night and when the light of the moon had broken fitfully through the stormily drifting clouds it had struck upon a pallid face poor fellow he had said between his teeth poor darkling tragic fellow i must trytryoh my god i must try then their lives had joined currents at willowfield and the friendship baird had asked for had built itself on a foundation of stone there was nothing requiring explanation in the fact that to the less fortunate man bairds every gift of wit and ease was a pleasure and comfort his mere physical attractions were a sort of joy when latimer caught sight of his own lank illcarried figure and his harshly rugged sallow face he never failed to shrink from them and avert his eyes to be the companion of a man whose every movement suggested strength and grace whose skin was clear and healthful his features well balanced and admirable in lineto be the friend of a human being built by nature as all human beings should be built if justice were done to them was nourishment to his own starved needs when he assumed his charge at the squalid little town of janways mills his flock looked askance at him he was not harsh of soul but he was gloomy and had not the power to convey encouragement or comfort though he laboured with strenuous conscientiousness among the sordid commonness of the everyday life of the mill hands and their families he lived and moved as savonarola had moved and lived in the midst of the picturesque wickedness and splendidly coloured fanaticism of italy in dim rich centuries past but his was the asceticism and stern selfdenial of savonarola without the uplifting power of passionate eloquence and fire which through their tempest awakened and shook human souls he had no gifts of compelling fervor he could not arouse or warm his hearers he never touched them he preached to them he visited them at their homes he prayed beside their dying and their dead he gave such aid in their necessities as the narrowness of his means would allow but none of them loved him or did more than stoically accept him and his services look at us as we stand together he said to baird on an evening when they stood side by side within range of an oldfashioned mirror those things your reflection represents show me the things i was born without i might make my life a daily crucifixion of selfdenial and duty done at all costs but i could not wear your smile or speak with your voice i am a man too with smothered passion i am a man too and yetwhat woman looks smilingly at mewhat child draws near unafraid you are of the severe monastic temperament answered baird it is all a matter of temperament mine is facile and a slave to its emotions saints and martyrs are made of men like younever of men such as i am are you sure of the value to the world of saints and martyrs said latimer i am not that is the worst of it ah the world baird reflected if we dare to come back to the worldto count it as a factor it is only the world we know latimer said his harsh voice unsteady the worlds sorrowthe worlds painthe worlds power to hurt and degrade itself that is what seems to concern usif we dare to say sowe who were thrust into it against our wills and forced to suffer and see others suffer the man who was burned at the stake or torn in the arena by wild beasts believed he won a crown for himselfbut it was for himself what doth it profit a man quoted baird vaguely but as if following a thought of his own if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul latimer flung back his shock of uneven black locks his hollow eyes flashed daringly what doth it profit a man he cried if he save his own soul and lose the whole world caring nothing for its agony making no struggle to help it in its woe and grieving a man once gave his life for the world has any man ever given his soul you go faryou go far exclaimed baird drawing a short sharp breath latimers deep eyes dwelt upon him woefully have you known what it was to bear a heavy sin on your soul he asked my dear fellow said john baird a little bitterly it is such men as i whose temperamentsthe combination of forces you say you lacklead them to the deeds the world calls heavy sinsand into the torment of regret which follows you can bear no such burdenyou have no such regret latimer whose elbow rested on the mantel leaned a haggard forehead on his hand i have sinned he said it was that others might be spared but i have put my soul in peril perhaps it is lostlost baird laid a hand on his shoulder and shook him it was a singular movement with passion in it no no he cried rouse man and let your reason speak in peril lostfor some poor rigid law broken to spare others great god no reason said latimer what you and i must preach each week of our lives is that it is not reason a man must be ruled by but blind wilful faith i do not preach it baird interposed there are things i dare to leave unsaid i have spoken falsely latimer went on heavily i have lived a liea liebut it was to save pure hearts from breaking they would have broken beneath the weight of what i have borne for them if i must bear punishment for that ilet me bear it the rigid submission of generations of the calvinistic conscience which presumed to ask no justice from its god and gave praise as for mercy shown for all things which were not damnation and which against damnations self dared not lift its voice in rebellion had so far influenced the very building of his being that the revolt of reason in his brain filled him with gloomy terror there was the appeal of despair on his face as he looked at baird your life your temperament have given you a wider horizon than mine he said i have never been in touch with human beings i have only read religious booksstern pitiless things since my boyhood i have lived in terror of the just godthe just godwho visits the sins of the fathers upon the children even to the third and fourth generation ibaird his voice dropping his face pallid i have hated him i keep his laws it is my fate to preach his wordand i cower before him as a slave before a tyrant with hatred in my heart good god baird broke forth involuntarily the force of the mans desperate feeling his horror of himself his tragic truthfulness were strange things to stand face to face with he had never confronted such a thing before and it shook him latimers face relaxed into a singular rather pathetic smile good god he repeated we all say thati say it myself it seems the natural human cry i wonder what it means it surely means somethingsomething john baird looked at him desperately you are a more exalted creature than i could ever be he said i am a poor thing by comparison but life struck the wrong note for you it was too harsh you have lived among the hideous cruelties of old doctrines until they have wrought evil in your brain he stood up and threw out his arms with an involuntary gesture as if he were flinging off chains ah they are not true they are not true he exclaimed they belong to the dark ages they are relics of the days when the upholders of one religion believed that they saved souls by the stake and the rack and thumbscrew there were men and women who did believe it with rigid honesty there were men and women who believing in other forms died in torture for their belief there is no god who would ask such demoniac sacrifice we have come to clearer days somewheresomewhere there is light you were born with the temperament to see its faroff glimmer even in your darkest hour latimer said it is for such as you to point it out to such as i am show it to meshow it to me every moment if you can baird put his hand on the mans shoulder again the world is surging away from itthe chained mind the cruelty the groping in the dark he said as it surged away from the revengeful israelitish creed of eye for eye and tooth for tooth when christ came it has taken centuries to reach even thus far but as each century passed each human creature who yearned over and suffered with his fellow has been creeping on dragging bleeding knees towards the light but the century will never come which will surge away from the man who died in mans agony for men in thought of him one may use reason and needs no faith the germ of one of the most moving and frequently quoted of bairds muchdiscussed discourses spranghe told his friends afterwardsfrom one such conversation and was the outcome of speech of the dead girl margery on a black and wet december day he came into his study on his return from some parish visits to find latimer sitting before the fire staring miserably at something he held in his hand it was a little daguerrotype of margery at fifteen i found it in an old desk of mine he said holding it out to baird who took it and slightly turned away to lean against the mantel as he examined it the childs large eyes seemed to light up the ugly shadows of the oldfashioned mushroom hat she wore the soft bow of her mouth was like a little loves she bloomed with an angelic innocence and in her straight sweet look was the unconscious question of a childwoman creature at the dawn of life john baird stood looking down at the heavenly tender little face there was a rather long silence during its passing he was far away he was still far away when at length an exclamation left his lips he did not hear his words himselfhe did not remember latimer or notice his quick movement of surprise how sweet she was he broke forth how sweet she was how sweet he put his hand up and touched his forehead with the action of a man in a dream sometimes he said low and passionately sometimes i am sick with longing for hersick you latimer exclaimed you are heartsick for her baird came back the startled sound in the voice awoke him he felt himself as it were dragged back from another world breathless as by a giants hand he looked up dazed the hand holding the daguerrotype dropping helplessly by his side it is not so strange that it should come to that he said i seem to know her so well i think there was a look of sharp pain on his facei think i know the pitiful childlike suffering her dying eyes held and the man actually shuddered a little i know iti know it latimer cried and he let his forehead drop upon his hands and sat staring at the carpet i have heard and thought of her until she has become a living creature john baird said i hear of her from others than yourself miss starkweatherthat poor girl from the mills susan chapmanyou yourselfkeep her before me alive i seem to know the very deeps of her lovingnessand understand her oh that she should have died he turned his face away and spoke his next words slowly and in a lowered voice if i had found her when i came back freeif i had found her here livingwe two might have been brothers no no latimer cried rising youit could not he drew his hand across his forehead and eyes what are we saying he exclaimed stammeringly what are we thinking of for a moment it seemed as if she were alive again poor little margery with her eyes like blue flowers she has been dead years and years and years it was not long after this that the reverend john baird startled a boston audience one night by his lecture repentance in it he unfolded a new passionate creed which produced the effect of an electric shock newspapers reported it editorials discussed it articles were written upon it in monthly magazines repentance is too late was the note his deepest fervour struck with virile almost terrible intensity repent before your wrong is done repentance comes too late he cried we say a man saves his soul by ithis soul we are a base cowardly lot our own souls are savedyes and we hug ourselves and are comforted but what of the thing we have hurtfor no man ever lost his soul unless he lost it by the wound he gave anotherby inflicting in some other an agony what of the one who has sufferedwho has wept blood i repent and save myself but repentance cannot undo the torture has been enduredthe tears of blood shed it is not to god i must kneel and pray for pardon but to that one whose helplessness i slew and though he grant it me he still has been slain the people who sat before him stirred in their seats some leaned forward breathing quickly there were those who turned pale here and there a man bent his head and a woman choked back a sob or sat motionless with streaming eyes repentance is too lateexcept for him who buys hope and peace with it a lifetime of it cannot undo the old comfortable convention seemed to cease to be supporting it seemed to cease to be true that one may wound and crush and kill and then be admirable in escaping by smug repentance it seemed to cease to be true that humanity need count only with an abstract faroff deity who can easily afford to pardonthat one of his poor myriads has been done to death it was all newstrangedirectand each word fell like a blow from a hammer because a strong dramatic reasoning creature spoke from the depths of his own life and soul in him humanity rose up an awful reality which must itself be counted withnot because it could punish and revenge but because the laws of nature cried aloud as a murdered mans blood cries from the ground as baird crossed the pavement to reach his cab the first night he delivered this lecture a man he knew but slightly stepped to his side and spoke to him mr baird he said will you drive me to the station baird turned and looked at him in some surprise there were cabs enough within hailing distance the man was well known as a journalist rather celebrated for his good looks and masculine charm he was of the squareshouldered easymoving richcoloured type just now his handsome eye looked perturbed i am going away suddenly he said in answer to bairds questioning expression i want to catch the next train i want you to see me offyou let us get in was bairds brief reply he had an instant revelation that the circumstance was not trivial or accidental as the door closed and the cab rolled away his companion leaned back folding his arms i had an hour to pass before keeping an appointment he said and i dropped in to hear you you put things before a man in a new way you are appallingly vivid i am not going to keep my appointment it is not easy not to keep it i shall take the train to new york and catch tomorrows steamer to liverpool dont leave me until you have seen me off i want to put the atlantic ocean and a year of time between myself and temptation said baird though he scarcely realised that he spoke oh the devil exclaimed the other man savagely call her that if you likecall me thatcall the whole thing that she does not realise where we are drifting shes a lovely dreamer and has not realised that we are human i did not allow myself to realise it until the passion of your words brought me face to face with myself i am repenting in time dont leave me i cant carry it through tonight alone john baird leaned back in the corner of the carriage and folded his arms also his heart was leaping beneath them great god he said out of the darkness i wish someone had said such words to meyears agoand not left me afterwards years ago i thought so his companion answered briefly you could not have painted it with such flaming powerotherwise they did not speak again during the drive they scarcely exchanged a dozen words before they parted the train was in the station when they entered it five minutes later john baird stood upon the platform looking after the carriages as they rolled out noisily behind trailing puffs of smoke and steam he had asked no questions and so far as his own knowledge was concerned this was the beginning the middle and the end of the story but he knew that there had been a story and there might have been a tragedy it seemed that the intensity of his own cry for justice and mercy had arrested at least one of the actors in it before the curtain fell a few nights later as they sat together baird and latimer spoke of this incident and of the lecture it had followed upon repentance repentance latimer said what led you to dwell upon repentance thirty years of life was bairds answer forty of them he was leaning forward gazing into the redhot coals and after our talk he added deliberately margery latimer turned and gazed at him baird nodded yes he said her picture her innocent face and the soft helpless youth of it such young ignorance is helplesshelpless if in any hour of ruthlessnessor madnessa man had done such tenderness a wrong what repentancewhat repentance could undo none said latimer and the words were a groan nonethrough all eternity it was not a long silence which followed but it seemed long to both of them a dead stillness fell upon the room baird felt as if he were waiting for something he knew he was waiting for something though he could not have explained to himself the sensation latimer seemed waiting tooawaiting the power and steadiness to reach some resolve but at length he reached it he sat upright and clutched the arms of his chair it was for support why not now he cried why not now i trust you i trust you let me unburden my soul i will try it was bairds involuntary habit to sink into easy attitudes the long supple form of his limbs and body lent themselves to grace and ease but he sat upright also his hands unconsciously taking hold upon the arms of his chair as his companion did for a moment the two gazed into each others eyes and the contrast between their types was a strange onethe one mans face dark sallow harsh the other fine sensitive and suddenly awake with emotion i trust you said latimer again i would not have confessed the truth to any other living creatureupon the rack his forehead looked damp under his black locks you would not have confessed the truth baird asked in a hushed voice about what margery answered latimer margery he saw baird make a slight forward movement and he went on monotonously she did not die in italy he said she did not die lying smiling in the evening sun shedid not bairds low cry was a thing of horror she died latimer continued in dull confession in a log cabin in the mountains of north carolina she died in anguishthe mother of an hourold child my god my god my god three times the cry broke from baird he got up and walked across the room and back waitwait a moment he exclaimed for a moment dont go on as the years had passed more than once he had been haunted by a dread that some day he might come upon some tragic truth long hidden here he was face to face with it but what imagination could have painted it like this you think my liea damnable thing said latimer no no answered the other man harshly no no he moved to and fro and latimer went on i never understood he said she was a pure creature and a loving innocent one yes baird groaned loving and innocent go ongo on it breaks my heartit breaks my heart remembering that he had said you might have been my brother latimer caught his breath in a groan too he understood he had forgotten forgotten but now he must go on at home she had been always a bright happy tender thing she loved us and we loved her she was full of delicate gifts we are poor people we denied ourselves that we might send her to boston to develop her talent she went away radiant and full of innocent gratitude for some time she was very happy i was making every effort to save money to take her abroad that she might work in the studios there she had always been a delicate little creatureand when it seemed that her health began to fail we feared the old terrible new england scourge of consumption it always took such bright things as she was when she came home for a visit her brightness seemed gone she drooped and could not eat or sleep we could not bear to realise it i thought that if i could take her to france or italy she might be saved i thought of her day and nightday and night he paused and the great knot in his throat worked convulsively in the bondage of his shabby collar he began again when he recovered his voice i thought too much he said i dont know how it was but just at that time there was a miserable story going on at the millsi used to see the poor girl day by dayand hear the women talk you know how that class of woman talks and gives you details and enlarges on them the girl was about margerys age i dont know how it was but one day as i was standing listening to a gossipping married woman in one of their squalid respectable parlours and she was declaiming and denouncing and pouring forth anecdotes suddenlyquite suddenlyi felt as if something had struck me i turned sick and white and had to sit down oh god what an afternoon that was and how long it seemed before i got back home he stopped again this time he wiped sweat from his forehead before he continued hoarsely i cannot go over iti cannot describe the steps by which i was led tohorrid fear for two weeks i did not sleep a single night i thought i was going mad i laid awake making desperate plansto resort to in casein case his forehead was wet again and he stopped to touch it with his handkerchief one day i told my mother i was going to boston to see margeryto talk over the possibility of our going abroad together with the money i had worked for and saved i had done newspaper worki had written religious essaysi had taught i went to her it was baird who broke the thread of his speech now he had been standing before a window his back to the room he turned about you found he exclaimed low and unsteady you found it was true answered latimer the worst baird stood stock still if latimer had been awake to externals he would have seen that it was because he could not moveor speak he was like a man stunned latimer continued she was sitting in her little room alone when i entered it she looked as if she had been passing through hours of convulsive sobbing she sat with her poor little hands clutching each other on her knees hysteric shudders were shaking her every few seconds and her eyes were blinded with weeping a child who had been beaten brutally might have sat so she was too simple and weak to bear the awful terror and woe she was not strong enough to conceal what there was to hide she did not even get up to greet me but sat trembling like an aspen leaf what did you say to her baird cried out i only remember as one remembers a nightmare the other man answered passing his hand over his brow it was a black nightmare i saw before i spoke and i began to shake as she was shaking i sat down before her and took both her hands i seemed to hear myself saying margerymargery dont be frighteneddont be afraid of lucian i will help you margery i have come to talk to youjust to talk to you that was all and she fell upon the floor and lay with her face on my feet her hands clutching them for almost five minutes there was no other word spoken but the breathing of each man could be heard then latimers voice broke the stillness lower and more monotonous i had but one resolve it was to save her and to save my mother all the soul of our home and love was bound up in the child among the desperate plans i had made in the long nights of lying awake there had been one stranger than the rest i had heard constantly of americans encountering each other by chance when they went abroad when one has a secret to keep one is afraid of every chance however remote perhaps my plan was mad but it accomplished what i wanted years before i had travelled through the mountain districts of north carolina one day in riding through the country roads i had realised their strange remoteness from the world and the fancy had crossed my mind that a criminal who dressed and lived as the rudely scattered population did and who chose a lonely spot in the woods might be safer there than with the ocean rolling between him and his secret i spent hours in telling her the part she was to play it was to be supposed that we had gone upon the journey originally planned we were to be hiddenapparently man and wifein some log cabin off the road until all was over i studied the details as a detective studies his case i am not a brilliant man and it was intricate work but i was desperate i read guidebooks and wrote letters from different points and arranged that they should be sent to our mother at certain dates for the next few months my stronghold was that she was quite ignorant of travel and would think of nothing but that the letters came from me and were about margery i made margery write two or three then i knew i could explain that she was not strong enough to write herself i was afraid she might break down before we could leave home but she did not i got her away by roundabout ways we travelled to the north carolina mountains we found a deserted cabin in the woods some distance from the road we dressed ourselves in the rough homespun of the country she went barefooted as most of the women did we so secluded ourselves that it was some time before it was known that our cabin was inhabited the women have a habit of wearing deep sunbonnets when about their work margery always wore one and kept within doors we were thought to be only an unsociable married pair only once she found herself facing curious eyes a sharpfaced little hoosier stopped one day to ask for a drink of water when i was away he stared at her so intently that she was frightened but he never came again the child was born she died when it was born baird asked who cared for her we were alone answered latimer i did not know whom to call i read medical booksfor hours each day i read them i thought that perhaps i might be able to dowhat was necessary but on the night she was taken illi was stricken with terror she was so young and childlikeshe had lived through months of torturethe agony seemed so unnatural to me that i knew i must go for helpthat i was not mentally calm enough to go through the ordeal a strange chance took me to a man who had years before studied medicine as a profession he was a singular being totally unlike his fellows he came to her she died with her hand in his did the child die too baird asked after a pause no it lived after she was laid in the earth on the hillside i came away it was the next day and i was not sane i had forgotten the child existed and had made no plans for it the man i spoke ofhe was unmarried and lonely and a strange huge creature of a splendid humanenesshe had stood by me through alla mountain of strengththe man came to my rescue there and took the child it would be safe with him i know nothing more do you not know his name baird asked yes he was called dwillerby by the country people i think he had been born a gentleman though he lived as the mountaineers did afterwards said baird you went abroad as you had planned yes i invented the story of her death i wrote the details carefully i learned them as a lesson it has been my mothers comfortthat story of the last daythe open windowthe passing peasantsthe setting suni can see it all myself that is my lie did you suspect it when i told it no god knows baird answered i did not never inquired latimer what i have thought was that you had suffered much more than you wished your mother to know thatperhapsyour sister had suffered more than you would reveal and that you dreaded with all your being the telling of the story but never such tragedy as thisnevernever the manthe man who wrought that tragedy began latimer staring darkly before him somewhere he stands tonightunless his day is done somewhere he standsas real a man as you with all his load upon him said baird and he may have loved her passionately it should be a heavy load said latimer with bitter gloom heavyheavy you have not once uttered his name said baird the thought coming to him suddenly no said latimer i never knew it she prayed so piteously that i would let her hide it she knelt and sobbed upon my knee praying that i would spare her that one woe i could spare her no other so i gave way she thanked me clinging to me and kissing my hand ah her young young heart wrung with sobs and tears he flung himself forward against the table hiding his face upon his arms and wept aloud baird went and stood by him he did not speak a word or lay his hand upon the shaking shoulders he stood and gazed his own chest heaving and awful tears in his eyes chapter xxx in later years one at least of the two men never glanced back upon the months which followed without a shudder and yet outwardly no change took place in their relations unless they seemed drawn closer such a secret being shared between two people must either separate or bind them together in this case it became a bond they spoke of it but little yet each was well aware that the other remembered often sometimes when they sat together latimer recognised in bairds eyes a look of brooding and felt that he knew what his thought was sometimes baird glancing at his friend found his face darkened by reverie and understood once when this was the case he said suddenly what is your feeling aboutthe man do you wish to kill him it is too late latimer answered it would undo nothing if by doing it i could bring her back as she was before she had seen his faceif i could see her again the pretty happy child with eyes like blue convolvulus and laughing lipsi would kill him and gladly hang for it so would i said baird grimly to crucify him would not undo it said latimer looking sickly pale she was crucifiedshe lived through terror and shame she diedafraid that god would not forgive her that god would not baird gasped latimers bony hands were twisted together we were brought up to believe things like that he said i was afraid too that was the damnable part of it i could not help her i have changed since theni have changed through knowing you as children we had always been threatened with the just god the most successful preachers gained their power by painting pictures of the torments of hell that was the fashion then smiling horribly it is a wonderful thing that even the fashion in gods changes when we were shut up together in the cabin on the hillside she used to be overwhelmed by paroxysms of fear she read the bible a great dealbecause sinners who wanted to repent always read itand sometimes she would come upon threats and curses and cry out and turn white and begin to shiver then she would beg me to pray and pray with her and we would kneel down on the bare floor and pray together my prayers were worse than useless what could i say i was a black sinner tooa man who was perjuring his soul with liesand they were told and acted for her sake and she knew it she used to cling about my neck and beg me to betray herto whiten my soul by confessionnot to allow her wickedness to destroy mebecause she loved meloved me go back to them and tell them lucien she would cry i will go with you if i oughti have been wickednot youi have been shameful i must bear iti must bear it but she could not bear it she died were you never able to give her any comfort said baird his eyes were wet and he spoke as in bitter appeal this had been a child in her teens entrapped into bearing the curse of the world with all its results of mental horror and physical agony what comfort could i give was the answer my religion and my social creed had taught me that she was a vile sinnerthe worst and most shameful of sinnersand that i was a criminal for striving to save her from the consequences of her sin i was defying the law of the just god who would have punished her with heartbreak and open shame he would not have spared her and he would not spare me since i so strove against him the night she diedthrough the long hours of horrible unnatural convulsions of painwhen cold sweat stood in drops on her deathly childish face she would clutch my hands and cry out eternal torments for ever and ever and evercould it be like this lucienfor ever and ever and ever then she would sob out god god god in terrible helpless prayer she had not strength for other words baird sprang to his feet and thrust out his hand averting his pallid face dont tell me any more he said i cannoti cannot bear it she bore it said latimer until death ended it was there no oneto save her baird cried was she terrified like that when she died the man who afterwards took her childthe man dwillerby latimer answered was a kindly soul at the last moment he took her poor little hand and patted it and told her not to be frightened she turned to him as if for refuge he had a big mellow voice and a tender protecting way he said dont be frightened its all right and his were the last words she heard god bless the fellow wheresoever he is baird exclaimed i should like to grasp his hand the reverend john baird delivered his lectures in many cities that year the discussion they gave rise to had the natural result of awakening a keen interest in them there were excellent souls who misinterpreted and deplored them there were excellent souls who condemned there were even ministers of the gospel who preached against the man as an iconoclast and a pagan and forbade their congregations to join his audiences but his lecturehalls were always crowded and the hundreds of faces upturned to him when he arose upon his platform were the faces of eager breathless yearning creatures he was a man speaking to men not an echo of old creeds he uttered no threats he painted no hells he called aloud to that god in man which is his soul that god which is in youin me he proclaimed has lain dormant because undeveloped man having made for himself in the dark ages gods of wood and stone demanding awful sacrifice called forth for himself later a deity as material though embodied in no physical forma god of vengeance and everlasting punishments this is the mancreated deity and in his name man has so clamoured that the god which is mans soul has been silenced let this god rise and he will so demand justice and noble mercy from all creatures to their fellows that temptation and suffering will cease what can we do no good deed without the promise of paradise as reward can we refrain from no evil unless we are driven to it by the threat of hell are we such base traffickers that we make merchandise of our souls and bargain for them across a counter let us awake i say to you from the deepest depths of my aching soulif there were no god to bargain with then all the more awful need that each man constitute himself a godof justice pity and mercyuntil the worlds wounds are healed and each human thing can stand erect and claim the joy of life which is his own on the morning of the day he said these words to the crowd which had flocked to hear him he had talked long with latimer for some weeks he had not been strong the passion of intensity which ruled him when he spoke to his audiences was too strong an emotion to leave no physical trace after a lecture or sermon he was often pallid and shaken i have things to say he exclaimed feverishly to latimer there are things which must be said the spoken word livesfor good or evil it is a sound sent echoing through all the ages to come some men have awakened echoes which have thrilled throughout the world to speak ones thoughtto use mere wordsit seems such a small thingand yet it is my conviction that nothing which is said is really ever forgotten and his face was white his eyes burning when at night he leaned forward to fling forth to his hearers his final arraignment i say to you were there no god to bargain with then all the more awful need that each man constitute himself a god of justice pity and mercyuntil the worlds wounds are healed and each human thing can stand erect and claim the joy of life which is his own the people went away after the lecture murmuring among themselves some of them carried away awakening in their eyes they all spoke of the man himself of his compelling power the fire of meaning in his face and the musical farreaching voice which carried to the remotest corner of the most crowded buildings it is not only his words one is reached by it was said it is the mans self truly he cries out from the depths of his soul this was true it was the man himself nature had armed him wellwith strength with magnetic force with a tragic sense of the anguish of things and with that brain which labours far in advance of the thought of the hour men with such brainsbrains which work fiercely and unceasingly even in their own despitereach conclusions not yet arrived at by their world and are called iconoclasts some are madly overpraised some have been made martyrs but their spoken word passes onward and if not in their own day in that tomorrow which is the today of other men the truth of their harvest is garnered and bound into sheaves at the closing of his lectures men and women crowded about him to speak to him to grasp his hand when they were hysterical in their laudations his grace and readiness controlled them when they were direct and earnest he found words to say which they could draw aid from later am i developingor degeneratinginto a popular preacher he said once with a half restless laugh to his shadow you are not popular was latimers answer popular is not the word you are proclaiming too new and bold a creed that is true said baird the pioneer is not popular when he forces his way into new countries he encounters the natives sometimes they eat himsometimes they drive him back with poisoned arrows the country is their own they have their own gods their own language why should a stranger enter in but there is no record yet of a pioneer who livedor diedin vain said latimer some daysome day he stopped and gazed at his friend brooding his love for him was a strong and deep thing it grew with each hour they spent together with each word he heard him speak baird was his mental nourishment and solace when they were apart he found his mind dwelling on him as a sort of habit but for this one man he would have lived a squalid life among his people at janneys millssqualid because he had not the elasticity to rise above its narrow uneducated dullness the squalor so far as he himself was concerned was not physical his own small plain home was as neat as it was simple but he had not the temperament which makes a man friends baird possessed this temperament and his home was a centre of all that was most living it was not the ordinary willowfield household the larger outer world came and went when latimer went to it he was swept on by new currents and felt himself warmed and fed there had been scarcely any day during years in which the two men had not met they had made journeys together they had read the same books and encountered the same minds each man clung to the intimacy i want this thing baird had said more than once if you want it i want it more nothing must rob us of it the time has comeit came long ago his shadow said when i could not live without it my life has grown to yours it was latimers pleasure that he found he could be an aid to the man who counted for so much to him affairs which pressed upon baird he would take in hand he was able to transact business for him to help him in the development of his plans save him frequently both time and fatigue it fell about that when the lectures were delivered at distant points the two men journeyed together latimer entered bairds library on one occasion just as a sharpfaced rather theatricallooking man left it youll let me know your decision sir as soon as possible the stranger departed saying these things ought always to be developed just at the right moment this is your right moment everybody is talking you over one way or another when the stranger was gone baird explained his presence that is an agent he said he proposes that i shall lecture through the states idont know as if pondering the thing the things you say should be said to many remarked latimer the more the better said baird reflectively i know thatthe more the better they sat and talked the matter over at length the objections to it were neither numerous nor serious and i want to say these things said baird a little feverishly i want to say them again and again before they parted for the night it was decided that he should accede to the proposal and that latimer should arrange to be his companion it is the lecture repentance he tells me is most in demand baird said as he walked to the door with a hand in latimers chapter xxxi frequenters of the capitolwhether loungers or politicianshad soon become familiar with the figure of one of the de willoughby claimants it was too large a figure not to be quickly marked and unavoidably remembered big tom slowly mounting the marble steps or standing on the corridors was an object to attract attention and inquiries being answered by the information that he was a party to one of the largest claims yet made he not unnaturally was discussed with interest hes from the depths of the mountains of north carolina it was explained he keeps a crossroads store and postoffice but he has some of the best blood of the south in his veins and his claim is enormous will he gain it who knows he has mortgaged all he owns to make the effort the claim is inherited from his father judge de willoughby who died at the close of the war as he lived and died within the confederacy the government holds that he was disloyal and means to make the most of it the claimants hold that they can prove him loyal theyll have to prove it thoroughly the government is growing restive over the claims of southerners and there is bitter opposition to be overcome yes lyman nearly lost his last election because he had favoured a southern claim in his previous term his constituents are country patriots and they said they werent sending a man to congress to vote for rebs thats the trouble when mens votes are endangered by a course of action they grow ultraconservative a votes a vote that was the difficulty as tom found a vote was a vote the bitterness of war had not yet receded far enough into the past to allow of unprejudiced judgment members of political parties were still enemies wrongs still rankled graves were yet new wounds still ached and burned men who had found it to their interest to keep at fever heat the fierce spirit of the past four years of struggle and bloodshed were not willing to relinquish the tactics which had brought fortunes to them the higherminded were determined that where justice was done it should be done where it was justice alone clearly proved to be so there had been too many false and idle claims brought forward to admit of the true ones being accepted without investigation and delay in the days when old judge de willoughby had walked through the streets of delisleville ostracized and almost hooted as he passed among those who had once been his friends it would not have been difficult to prove that he was loyal to the detested government but in these later times when the old man lay quiet in what his few remaining contemporaries still chose to consider a dishonoured grave undeniable proof of a loyalty which now would tend to the honour and advantage of those who were of his blood was not easy to produce the man lived and died in the confederacy was said by those who were in power in washington he was constructively a rebel we want proofproof most of those who might have furnished it if they would were either scattered as to the four winds of the earth or were determined to give no aid in the matter a southerner who deserted the south in its desperate struggle for life need not come to southern gentlemen to ask them to help him to claim the price of his infamy that was the delisleville point of view and it was difficult to cope with if tom had been a rich man and could have journeyed between delisleville and the capital or wheresoever the demands of his case called him to see and argue with this man or that the situation would have simplified itself somewhat though there would still have remained obstacles to be overcome but a man who has hard work to look his room rent in the face and knows he cant do that for more than a few months is in a tight place said tom evidence that will satisfy the government isnt easily collected in dupont circle these fellows have heard men talk before theyve heard too many men talk theres stamps nowtheyve heard stamps talk stamps is way ahead of me where lobbying is concerned he knows the law and he doesnt mind having doors shut in his face or being kicked into the street so long as he sees a chance of getting indemnified for his herds of cattle im not a business man and i mind a lot of things that dont trouble him im not a good hand at asking favours and sitting down to talk steadily for a solid hour to a man who doesnt want to hear me and hasnt five minutes to spare but for rupert and sheba he would have given up the claim in a week and gone back to talbots crossroads content to end his days as he began them when he opened the storeliving in the little back rooms on beans and bacon and friend chicken and hominy that suited me well enough he used to say to himself when he thought the thing over there were times when i found it a bit lonelybut good lord loneliness is a small thing for a man to complain of in a world like this it isnt fits or starvation when a mans outlived the habit of expecting happiness it doesnt take much to keep him going but at his side was eager youth which had outlived nothing which believed in a future full of satisfied yearnings and radiant joys i am not alone now said rupert i must make a place and a home for sheba i must not be only a boy in love with her i must be a man who can protect her from everythingfrom everything she is so sweetshe is so sweet she makes me feel that i am a man she was sweet to big tom they were both sweet in their youth and radiant faith and capabilities for happiness they seemed like children and the tender bud of their lovely young passion was a thing to be cherished he had seen such buds before but he had never seen the flower id like to see the flower he used to say to himself to see it would pay a man for a good deal hed missed himself the pair of them could set up a pretty fair garden of edenserpents and appletrees being excluded they were happy even when disappointments befell them and prospects were unpromising they were happy they could look into each others eyes and take comfort ruperts dark moods had melted away he sometimes forgot they had ever ruled him his old boyish craving for love and home was fed the bare little rooms in the poor little house were home sheba and tom were love and affection when they sat at the table and calculated how much longer their diminishing store would last even as it grew smaller and smaller they could laugh over the sums they worked out on slips of paper so long as the weather was warm enough they strolled about together in the fragrant darkness or sat in the creeperhung porch in the light of summer moons when the cold nights came they sat about the stove or the table and talked while sheba sewed buttons on or worked assiduously at the repairing of her small wardrobe whatsoever she did the two men sat and admired and there was love and laughter the strenuous life which went on in the busier part of the townthe politics the struggles the plots and schemes the worldly pleasuresseemed entirely apart from them sometimes after a day in which judge rutherford had been encouraged or tom had had a talk with a friendly member who had listened to the story of the claim with signs of interest they felt their star of hope rising it never sinks far below the horizon when ones teens are scarcely of the pastand sheba and rupert spent a wonderful evening making plans for a future of ease and fortune at judge rutherfords suggestion tom had long sought an interview with a certain member of the senate whose good word would be a carrying weight in any question under debate he was a shrewd honest businesslike man and a personal friend of the presidents he was much pursued by honest and dishonest alike and as a result of experience had become difficult to reach on the day tom was admitted to see him he had been more than usually badgered just as tom approached his door a little man opened it cautiously and slid out with the air of one leaving within the apartment things not exhilarating on retrospect he was an undersized country man the cut of whose jeans wore a familiar air to toms eye even at a distance and before he lifted the countenance which revealed him as mr stamps we aint agwine to do your job no good today tom he said benignly hed a kicked me out ef i hadnt a bin smalljest same es you was gwine ter that time i come to talk to ye about sheby hes a smarter man than you be an he seed the argyment i hed to pint out to you ye wont help your job none today i havent got a job in hand tom answered your herds of stock and the judges coal mines and cotton fields are different matters he passed on and saw that when his name was announced the senator looked up from his work with a fretted movement of the head mr de willoughby of talbots crossroads he said tom bowed he became conscious of appearing to occupy too much space in the room of a busy man who had plainly been irritated i was told by judge rutherford that you had kindly consented to see me he said the senator tapped the table nervously with his pencil and pushed some papers aside well i find i have no time to spare this morning was his brutally frank response i have just been forced to give the time which might have been yours to a little hoosier who made his way in heaven knows how and refused to be ordered out he had a claim too and came from your county and said he was an old friend of yours he is not an old enemy answered tom there is that much foundation in the statement well he has occupied the time i had meant to give you said the senator and i was not prepossessed either by himself or his claim i think hes a man to gain a claim said tom im afraid im not it is fair to warn you that i am not friendly to claims made by the families of men who lived in a hotbed of secession said the senator he had been badgered too much this morning and this big rather convincing looking applicant worried him i have an appointment at the white house in ten minutes then this is no place for me said tom no man is likely to be friendly to a thing he has no time to talk of i will bid you goodmorning goodmorning returned the senator brusquely tom went away feeling that he was a blunderer the fact was that he was a neophyte and it was true did not possess the qualities which make a successful lobbyist mr stamps had wheedled or forced his way into the great mans apartment and had persisted in remaining to press his claim until he was figuratively turned out by the shoulders big tom had used only such means to obtain the interview as a gentleman might he had waited until he was called to take his turn and so had lost his chance when he had found the senator hurried and unwilling to spend time on him he had withdrawn at once not feeling mr stampss method to be possible i suppose i ought to have stayed and buttonholed him in spite of himself he thought ruefully im a greenhorn i suppose a man in my place ought to stand his ground whether its decent or indecent and make people listen to what he has to say and be quite willing to be kicked downstairs after he has said it im a disgrace to my speciesand i dont think much of the species as he was walking through one of the corridors he saw before him two men who were evidently visitors to the place he gathered this from their leisurely movements and the interest with which they regarded the objects about them they looked at pictures and remarked upon decorations one was a man who was unusually wellbuilt he was tall and moved well and had lightly silvered hair his companion was tall also but badly hung together and walked with a stoop of the shoulders tom walked behind them for some yards before his attention was really arrested but suddenly a movement of one mans head seemed to recall some memory of the past he did not know what the memory was but he knew vaguely that it was a memory he followed a few yards further wondering idly what had been recalled and why he should be reminded of the mountains and the pinetrees yes it was the mountains and pinetreeshamlin county but not the hamlin county of today why not the hamlin county of today why something which seemed more remote confound the fellow he had made that movement again tom wished he would turn his face that he might see it and he hurried his footsteps somewhat that he might come within nearer range the two men paused with their backs towards him and tom paused also they were looking at a picture and the taller of the two made a gesture with his hand it was a long bony hand and as he extended it tom slightly started it all came back to himthe memory which had been recalled he smelt the scent of the pines on the hillside he saw the little crowd of mourners about the cabin door inside women sat with bent heads upon two wooden chairs rested the ends of a slender coffin and by it stood a man who lifted his hand and said to those about him let us pray the years swept back as he stood there he was face to face again with the tragic mystery which had seemed to end in utter silence the man turned his face so that it was plainly to be seensallow rugged harsh in line the same face though older and perhaps less tragicthe face of the man he had left alone in the awful desolate stillness of the empty room the next moment he turned away again he and his companion passed round a corner and were gone tom made no attempt to follow them there is no reason why i should was his thought either for shebas sake or his own she is happy and he feels his secret safewhatsoever it may have been perhaps he has had time to outlive the misery of it and it would all be brought to life again but the incident had been a shock there was nothing to fear from it he knew but it had been a shock nevertheless he did not know the mans name he had never asked it he was plainly one of the many strangers who in passing through the capital went to visit the public buildings the merest chance might have brought him to the place the most ordinary course of events might take him away tom went back to dupont circle in a thoughtful mood he forgot the claim and the senator who had had no leisure to hear the statement of his case rupert and sheba were waiting for his return rupert had spent the afternoon searching for employment he had spent many a long day in the same way and with the same result they dont want me he had said when he came home they dont want me anywhere it seemseither in lawyers offices or drygoods stores i have not been particular they had sat down and gazed at each other i sometimes wonder said sheba what we shall do when all our money is goneevery penny of it it cannot last long now we cannot stay here and we cannot pay our way back to the mountains what shall we do i shall go out every day till i find something to do said rupert with the undiscouraged fervour of youth i am not looking for employment for a gentleman in these days i am looking for workjust as uncle matt is he chopped some wood yesterday and brought home two dollars sheba said he made me take it he said he wanted to pay his bode she laughed a little but her eyes were wet and shining rupert took her face between his hands and looked into it adoringly dont be frightened sheba he said dont be unhappy lovely darling i will take care of you she pressed her soft cheek against his hand i know you will she said and of uncle tom too i couldnt be unhappywe all three love each other so i do not believe we shall be unhappy even if we are poor enough to be hungry so their moment of dismay ended in smiles they were passing through a phase of life in which it is not easy to be unhappy somehow things always brightened when they drew near each other his observation of this truth was one of toms pleasures he knew the year of waiting had managed to fill itself with sweetness for them their hopes had been alternately raised and dashed to earth one day it seemed not improbable that they were to be millionaires the next that beggary awaited them after the dwindling of their small stock of money but they had shared their emotions and borne their vicissitudes together when tom entered the room they rose and met him with questioning faces was it good fortune they cried did you see him uncle tom what did he say he told his story as lightly as possible but it could not be transformed by any lightness of touch into an encouraging episode he made a picture of stamps sidling through the barely opened door and was terse and witty at the expense of his own discomfiture and consciousness of incompetence he laughed at himself and made them laugh but when he sat down in his accustomed seat there was a shade upon his face the children exchanged glances the eyes of each prompting the other they must be at their brightest they knew the sight of their happiness warmed and lightened his heart always he is tired and hungry sheba said we must give him a beautiful hot supper rupert we must set the table they had grown used to waiting upon themselves and their domestic services wore more or less the air of festivities sheba ran downstairs to miss burfords kitchen where uncle matt had prepared the evening meal in his best manner as the repasts grew more and more simple matt seemed to display greater accomplishments its all very well miss sheba he had said once when she praised the skill with which he employed his scant resources its mighty easy to be a good cook when youse got everythin right to han the giftness is to git up a fine table when you aint got nuffin dats whar dish yer niggah likes to show out de lard knows ise got too much yere dis vey minnitto be adoin credit to my speriencetoo much miss sheba he was frying hoecake and talking to miss burford when sheba came into the kitchen he was a great comfort and aid to miss burford and in a genteel way the old lady found him a resource in the matters of companionship and conversation her life was too pinched and narrow to allow her even the simpler pleasure of social intercourse and matts journeys into the world and his small adventures and his comments upon politics and social events were a solace and a source of entertainment to her just now he was describing to her the stories he had heard of a celebrated lecturer who had just arrived in the city whether hes a vivalist or jes a plain preacher what folks is runnin after i caynt quite make out maam he was saying i aint quite thinkin hes a vivalist but de peoples is arunnin after him shorean seems like dey doin it in evy city he goes to evybody want to heah himevybodyrich en poreyoung en ole de revend john bairds his name an hes got a fren travellin with him as they say is like jonathan was to david in dese yere ole bible times an i heern tell ev when he rise in de pulpit de peoples jest gets so worked up at what he preach to emdey jest cries an rocks de benches dats what make me think he might be a vivalistcos we all knows dat cryin an rockin an clappin hands is what makes a vival he was full of anecdotes concerning the new arrival whose reputation had plainly preceded him he gwine ter preach nex satday on pentance he said to sheba with a chuckle dats his big lecture evybody want to hear de hall shore to be pack full what im ahopin is dat itll be pack full er senators an members er congrest an hell set some of em apentin dey aint tend to dere business an git peoples claims through ef i knowd de genleman id ax him to menshun dat special an pertickler as they sat at supper sheba repeated his stories and comments all the comments were worthy of repetition and most of the anecdotes were suggestively interesting illustrating as they did the power of a single man over many i should like to go and hear him myself she said uncle tom have you anything to repent rupert have you uncle tom you have not forgotten the senator you look at me as if you were thinking of something that was not happy the senator was not particularly happy remarked tom he had just had an interview with stamps and he certainly was not happy at the sight of me he thought he had another on his hands hes in better spirits by this time sheba got up and went to his side of the table she put her arms round his neck and pressed her cheek against his forget about him she said i am not remembering him particularly said tom the shade passing from his eyes i am remembering youas you were nineteen years ago nineteen years ago said sheba i was a baby yes answered tom folding a big arm round her and speaking slowly i saw a man today who reminded me of the day you were born are you glad you were born sheba thats what i want to be sure of the two pairs of young eyes met glowing tom knew they had met by the warmth of the soft cheek touching him yes i am gladi am gladi am glad with grateful sweetness and iand i cried rupert he sprung up and held out an impetuous boyish hand to tom you know how glad uncle tomlook at herlook at mesee how glad we both are and it is youyou who have made it so its a pretty big thing said tom that two people should be glad they are alive and he grasped the ardent hand as affectionately as it was offered chapter xxxii the reverend john baird and his friend the reverend lucien latimer were lodged in a quiet house in a quiet street the lecturing tour had been fatiguing and baird was glad of such repose as he could secure in truth the excitement and strain of his work the journeying from place to place the hospitalities from which he could not escape had worn upon him he had grown thinner and often did not sleep well at night he used to find himself lying awake repeating to himself mechanically words from his own lecture repentance is too late his voice would whisper to the darkness repentance cannot undo his audiences found him an irresistible force he had become more than the fashion of the hour he was its passion people liked to look at as well as to hear him he was besieged by lionhunters overwhelmed with attentions in each town or city he visited reporters followed him interviewers besought appointments agreeable people invited him to their houses intrusive people dogged him latimer stood between him and as many fatigues as he could he transacted business for him and interviewed interviewers and he went to tiring functions when i enter a room without you and make your excuses they must make the most of my black face and they make the most of it but they dont love me he said still it is a thing to be borne if it saves you when you need all your forces what does it matter i have never expected to be smiled at for my own sake as they smile at me for yours in these days of close companionship each found in each new qualities increasing the tie between them latimer felt himself fed by the public affection surrounding the man who was his friend he was thrilled by the applause which thundered forth at his words he was moved by the mere sense of his success and the power he saw him unknowingly exercise through mere physical charm i am nearer being a happy or at least a peaceful man than i had ever thought to be he said to baird your life seems to fill mine and i am less lonely which was indeed a truth on the evening of the day on which big tom had caught his glimpse of the two strangers in the corridor of the capitol baird dined at the house of the senator whose adverse mood had promised such small encouragement to the de willoughby claim and in the course of the meal the host spoke of both claim and claimants the man is a sort of colossus he said and he looked all the heavier and bigger because my last visitor had been the smallest and most insignificant of the hoosier type is this man a hoosier was asked no he has lived among the most primitive and rutherford tells me is a sort of county institution but he is not a hoosier he has a large humane humorous face and a big humorous mellow voice i should rather have liked the fellow confound him if i hadnt lost my patience before he came into the room did he tell you the story of the claim enquired his married daughter no i didnt let him i was feeling pretty sick of claims and i had no time oh father i wish you had let him tell it exclaimed the pretty young woman the truth is i am beginning to be interested in that claim myself i am in love with judge rutherford and his stories of jenny and tom scott his whole soul is bound up in pushing this thing throughthats what he calls it he is the most delightful lobbyist i ever met he is like a bull in a china shopthough i dont believe anyone ever saw a bull in a china shop he does not know enough to give his friends a rest said the senator if he was not such a good fellow he would bore a man to death he bores many a man as it is and people in office wont stand being bored hes too ingenuous the shrewd ones say his ingenuousness is too good to be true he cant keep de willoughbys virtues out of his stories of himand a mans virtues have nothing much to do with his claim i met him in one of the squares yesterday said mrs meredith and he almost cried when he spoke of the claim he told me that everything was going wrongthat it was being pushed aside by all sorts of things and he had lost heart his eyes and nose got quite red and he had to wink hard to keep back the tears the fellow believes in it at any rate said the senator he has that to support him he believes in everything said mrs meredith and it would have touched your heart to hear him talk about the claimants there is a young nephew and a beautiful girl creature who is big mr de willoughbys adopted daughter she is not a claimant it is true but they all adore each other and the nephew is in love with her and if the claim goes through they will be happy forever afterwards i saw the nephew once and he was a beautiful boy with southern eyes and a charming expression upon the whole i think i am in love with the young couple too their story sounded like a pastoral poem when judge rutherford told it suppose you tell it to us marion said the senator with a laugh and a glance round the table it may appeal to our feelings and advance the interests of the claim pray tell it mrs meredith baird put in the mere mention of it has appealed to my emotions perhaps senator harburton and mr lewis will be moved also and that will be two votes to the goodperhaps more the charm of it is that it is a story without a plot mrs meredith said there is nothing in it but youth and love and innocence and beauty it is romeo and juliet without the tragedy romeo appeared on a moonlight night in a garden and juliet stood upon a balcony among rosesand their young souls cried out to each other it is all so young and innocentthey only want to spend their lives together like flowers growing side by side they want nothing but each other and the claim added the senator they cannot have each other if the claim fails they will have to starve to death in each others arms like the babes in the wood i am sure the robins will come and cover them with leaves but the big uncle her father asked poor fellow mrs meredith said judge rutherford is finest when he enlarges on him he says over and over again as if it were a kind of argument tom nowtom he wants those two young ones to be happy he says nature fixed it all for them so that they could be happyand he doesnt want to see it spoiled he says love aint treated fair as a rule and he wants to see it given a showa real show at least one pair of deeply interested listeners eyes were fixed upon her they were the reverend john bairds it might be a beautiful thing to see he said one does not see it there seems a fate against it the wrong people meet or the right ones do not until it is too late i should like to see it myself said the host but i am afraid that the argumentas an argumentwould not support a claim on the government i am going to see the claimants and hear all the arguments they can bring forward was mrs merediths conclusion i want to see romeo and juliet together may i go with you asked baird latimer had not come in when he returned to their lodgings he also had been out to spend the evening but it was not many minutes before baird heard his latchkey and the opening of the front door he came upstairs rather slowly you are either ill baird said when he entered or you have met with some shock yes it was a shock was the answer i have been dragged back into the black pit of twenty years ago twenty years said baird i have seen the man whowas with us in the hillside cabin through that night she died he passed me in the street baird stood still and looked at him without speaking what was there to be said he is such a noticeable looking fellow latimer went on that i felt sure i could find out who he was in the mountains they called him big tom dwillerby his real name is de willoughby and he has been here for some months in pursuit of a claim which is a great deal talked about the great de willoughby claim said baird they talked of it tonight at dinner latimer tapped the table nervously with the fingers of an unsteady hand he may be living within a hundred yards of uswithin a hundred yards he said we may cross each others path at any moment i can at least knowsince fate has brought us together againi should never have sought him outbut one can know whetherwhether it lived or died he has with him said baird a girl of nineteen who is his adopted daughter i heard it tonight she is said to be a lovely girl who is in love with a lovely boy who is de willoughbys nephew she is happy she is happy murmured latimer biting his livid lips he could not bring himself back to the hour he was living in he could only see again the bare little roomhe could hear the cries of terrified anguish it seems strange he murmured that margerys child should be happy chapter xxxiii it was not difficult to discover the abiding place of the de willoughby claimants the time had come when there were few who did not know who occupied the upper floor of miss burfords house near the circle miss burford herself had gradually become rather proud of her boarders and as the interest in the case increased felt herself becoming a prominent person if the claim goes through the de willoughby family will be very wealthy she said genteelly they will return to their southern home no doubt and restore it to its fawmah magnificence mr rupert de willoughby will be lawd of the mannah she spent many hourswhich she felt to be very aristocraticin listening to uncle matts stories of the old de willoughby place the ricefields in south callina and the thousands of acres of gol mines in the mountains there was a rich consolation in mere conversation on the subject of glories which had once had veritable substance and whose magnitude might absolutely increase if fortune was kind but it was not through inquiry that latimer discovered the whereabouts of the man who shared his secret in two days time they met face to face on the steps of the capitol latimer was going down them big tom was coming up the latter was lost in thought on his affairs and was not looking at such of his fellowmen as passed him suddenly he found himself one or two steps below someone who held out a hand and spoke in a low voice de willoughby the stranger exclaimed and tom lifted his eyes and looked straight into those of the man he had seen last nineteen years before in the cabin at blairs hollow do you know me again the man asked its a good many years since we met and i am not as easy to recognise as you yes i know you answered big tom grasping the outstretched hand kindly i saw you a few days ago and knew you i did not see you said latimer and you did not speak to me no answered tom slowly i thought it over while i walked behind you and i made up my mind that it might do you no goodand to hold back would do none of us any harm none of us questioned latimer big tom put a hand on his shoulder since you spoke to me of your own free will he said lets go and have a talk there are plenty of quiet corners in this place there were seats which were secluded enough though people passed and repassed within sight of them people often chose such spots to sit and talk together one saw pairs of lovers pairs of politicians couples of sightseers they found such a seat and sat down latimer could not well control the expression his face wore none of us he said again tom still kept a friendly hand on his shoulder she is a beautiful young woman though she will always seem more or less of a child to me he said i have kept her safe and ive made her happy that was what i meant to do i dont believe she has had a sad hour in her life what im sick of is seeing people unhappy ive kept unhappiness from her weve loved each otherthats what weve done shes known nothing but having people about who were fond of her they were a simple ignorant lot of mountain hoosiers but lord they loved her and she loved them shes enjoyed the spring and shes enjoyed the summer and shes enjoyed the autumn and the winter the rainy days havent made her feel dull and the cold ones havent made her shiver thats the way she has grown upjust like a pretty fawn or a forest tree now her young mate has come and the pair of them fell deep in love at sight they met at the right time and they were the right pair it was all so natural that she didnt know she was in love at first she only knew she was happier every day i knew what was the matter and it made me happy just to look on good lord how they love each otherthose children how they look at each other every minute without knowing they are doing it and how they smile when their eyes meetwithout knowing why i know why its because they are in paradiseand god knows if its to be done im going to keep them there my god broke from latimer what a heart you have man he turned his face to look at him almost as if in reverent awe margerys child margerys child he repeated to himself is she like her mother he asked i never saw her motherwhen she was happy tom answered she is taller than her mother and has eyes like a summer morning sky its a wonderful face i sometimes think she must be likethe other i want to see her said latimer she need know nothing about me i want to see her may i yes we are staying here to push our claim and we are living near dupont circle and doing it as cheaply as we can we havent a cent to spare but that hasnt hurt us so far if we win our claim we shall be bloated bondholders if we lose it we shall have to tramp back to the mountains and build a log hut and live on nuts and berries until we can raise a crop the two young ones will set up a nest of their own and live like adam and eveand i swear they wont mind it theyd be happy rich but theyll be happy poor when would you like to come and see her may i come tomorrow asked latimer and may i bring a friend with me he is the human being who is nearest to me on earth he is the only living soul who knowswhat we know he is the reverend john baird what said tom the man who is setting the world on fire with his lecturesthe repentance man yes shell like to see him no one better we shall all like to see him we have heard a great deal of him they did not part for half an hour when they did latimer knew a great deal of the past he knew the story of the childs upgrowing with the sun rising from behind one mountain and setting behind another he seemed to know the people who had loved and been familiar with her throughout her childish and girlish years he knew of the fanciful name given her in infancy and of the more fanciful one her primitive friends and playmates had adopted he knew the story of rupert and guessed vaguely at the far past in which delia vanuxem had lived and died thank god i saw you that day he said thank god i went to you that night and they grasped hands again and went their separate ways latimer went home and told baird of the meeting and of the appointment for the following day i felt that you would like to see the man he said he is the finest simple being in the world soul and body are on a like scale you were right in thinking i should like to see him answered baird i have thought of him often he regarded his friend with some anxiety to meet her face to face will be a strange thing he added do you think you can hide what you must feel it will not be easyeven for me it will not be easy for either of usif she looks at us with margerys eyes you will know them margery was happy too when the picture you have seen was made thatto see her stand before them in her youth and beauty all unknowingwould be a strange thing was the thought in the mind of each as they walked through the streets together the next evening the flare of an occasional streetlamp falling on latimers face revealed all its story to his companion though it might not have so revealed itself to another baird himself was wondering how they should each bear themselves throughout the meeting she would be so wholly unconsciousthis girl who had always been happy and knew nothing of the past to her they would be but a middleaged popular lecturer and his unattractivelooking friendwhile each to himself was a man concealing from her a secret they must eliminate it from their looks their voices their air they must be frank and courteous and conventional baird turned it all over in his mind when they reached the house the secondstory windows were lighted as if to welcome them matt opened the door for them attired in his best and bowing low to receive such guests he felt to be an important social event which seemed to increase the chances of the claim and point to a future when distinguished visitors would throng to a much more imposing front door he announced with an air of state that his master and young mistress were receivin and took ceremonious charge of the callers he had brushed his threadbare coat and polished each brass button singly until it shone an african imagination aided him to feel the dignity of hospitality the sound of a girls voice reached them as they went upstairs they glanced at each other involuntarily and latimers breath was sharply drawn it was not the best preparation for calmness a glowing small fire was burning in the stove and plain and bare as the room was it was filled with the effect of brightness two beautiful young people were laughing together over a book and both rose and turned eager faces towards the door big tom rose too and advancing to meet the visitors brought the girl with him she was built on long and supple lines and had happy eyes and lovely bloom the happy eyes were margerys though they were brown instead of harebell blue and looked out from a face which was not quite margerys though its smile was hers latimer asked himself if it was possible that his manner wore the aspect of ordinary calm as he stood before her sheba wondered at the coldness of his hand as she took it she was not attracted by his anxious face and it must be confessed that his personality produced on her the effect it frequently produced on those meeting him for the first time it was not he who was the great man but she felt timid before him when he spoke to her no one was shy of baird he produced his inevitable effect also in a few minutes he had become the centre of the small company he had made friends with rupert and launched tom in conversation sheba was listening to him with a brightness of look charming to behold they sat about the table and talked and he led them all back to the mountains which had been seeming so far away he wanted to hear of the atmosphere the life the people and yet as they answered his queries and related anecdotes he was learning from each one something bearing on the story of the claim when tom spoke of barnesville and judge rutherford or rupert of delisleville and matt their conversation was guided in such manner that business details of the claim were part of what was said it was tom who realised this first and spoke of it we are talking of our own business as if it was the one subject on earth he said thats the worst of people with a claim ive seen a good many of them since ive been in washingtonand we are all alike i have been asking questions because the subject interests me too said baird more people than yourselves discuss it it formed a chief topic of conversation when i dined with senator milner two nights ago milner said tom he was the man who had not time to hear me in the morning his daughter mrs meredith was inquiring about you she wanted to hear the story i shall tell it to her ah exclaimed tom if you tell it it will have a chance perhaps baird laughed i may be able to help you a man who is used to audiences might be of some practical value he met shebas eyes by accident a warm light leaped into them they care a great deal more than they will admit to me she said to him when chance left them together a few minutes later as tom and rupert were showing latimer some books they are afraid of making me unhappy by letting me know how serious it will be if everything is lost they care too much for mebut i care for them and if i could do anythingor go to anyone he looked into her eyes through a curious moment of silence it was not all jest he said after it what i said just now i am a man who has words and words sometimes are of use i am going to give you my wordsfor what they are worth we shall feel very rich she answered and her simple directness might have been addressed to a friend of years standing it was a great charm this sweet acceptance of any kindness but i thought you were going away in a few days yes but i shall come back and i shall try to set the ball rolling before i go she glanced at latimer across the room mr latimer she hesitated do you think he does not mind thatthat the claim means so much for us i was afraid he looked at me so seriously he looked at you a great deal interposed baird quickly he could not help it i am glad to have this opportunity to tell yousomething you are very likevery likesomeone he loved deeplysomeone who died years ago you must forgive him it was almost a shock to him to come face to face with you ah softly someone who died years ago she lifted margerys eyes and let them rest upon bairds face it must be very strangeit must be almost awfulto find yourself near a person very like someone you have lovedwho died years ago yes he answered yesawful that is the word when the two men walked home together through the streets the same thought was expressed again and it was latimer who expressed it and when she looked at me he said i almost cried out to her margery margery the cry leaped up from the depths of me i dont know how i stopped it margery was smaller and more childlikeher eyes are darker her face is her own not margerysbut she looks at one as margery did it is the simple clearness of her look the sweet belief which does not know life holds a creature who could betray it yes yes broke from baird the exclamation seemed involuntary yet there was one who could betray it latimer said you cannot forget said baird no wonder latimer shook his head the passing of years he said almost inevitably wipes out or dims all things but sometimesnot often thank fatethere comes a phase of suffering in some man or womans life which will not go i once knew a womanshe was the kind of woman people envy and whose life seems brilliant and full it was full of the things most people want but the things she wanted were not for her and there was a black wound in her soul she had had a child who had come near to healing her and suddenly he was torn out of her being by death she said afterwards that she knew she had been mad for months after it happened though no one suspected her in the years that followed she dared not allow herself to speak or think of that time of death i must not let myselfi must not she said this to me and shuddered clenching her hands when she spoke never never never will it be better if a thousand years had passed it would always be the same one thought or word of it drags me backand plunges me deep into the old awful woe oldit is not oldit never can be old it is as if it had happened yesterdayas if it were happening today i know this is not often so but it is so with me when a thing drags margery back to medrags me back to margery tonight baird think what it is tonight he put a shaking hand on bairds hand hurrying him by the unconscious rapidity of his own pace think what it is tonight he repeated she seems part of my being i cannot free myself i can see her as she was when she last looked at me as her child looked at me tonightwith joyful bright eyes and lips it was one day when i went to see her at boston she was doing a little picture and it had been praised at the studio she was so happyso happy that was the last time dont dont cried baird you must not call it back i am not calling it back it comes it comes you must let me go on you cant stop me that was the last time the next time i saw her she had changed i scarcely knew howit was so little the brightness was blurred thenthen comes all the rest her growing illnessthe anxiousnessthe long daysthe girl at the millsthe talk of those womenthe first ghastly damnable fearthe nightsthe lying awake his breath came short and fast he could not stop himself it was plain his words tumbled over each other as if he were a man telling a story in delirium i can see her he said i can see heras i went into her room i can see her shaking hands and lips and childish terrified eyes i can feel her convulsive little fingers clutching my feet and her faceher facelying upon them when she fell down i cannot bear it cried baird i cannot bear it he had uttered the same cry once before he had received the same answer she bore it said latimer fiercely that last nightin the cabin on the hillsideher criesthey were not humanno they did not sound human he was checked it was bairds hand which clutched his arm nowit seemed as if for support the man was swaying a little and in the light of a streetlamp near them he looked up in a ghastly appeal latimer he said dont go on you see i cant bear it i am not so strong as i wasbefore i began this work i have lost my nerve you bring it before me as it is brought before yourself i am living the thing i cant bear it latimer came back from the past he made an effort to understand and control himself yes he said quite dull that was what the woman i spoke of told methat she lived the thing again it is not sane to let ones self go back i beg your pardon baird chapter xxxiv its a curious job that de willoughby claim was said in a committeeroom of the house one day its beginning to attract attention because it has such an innocent air the sharp ones say that may be the worst feature of it because ingenuousness is more dangerous than anything else if a job is thoroughly rotten the claimants are the most straightforward pair the place has ever seena big humourous wellmannered country man and a boy of twentythree rutherford of hamlin county who is a monument of simplicity in himself is heart and soul in the thingand farquhar feels convinced by it farquhar is one of the men who are not mixed up with jobs milner himself is beginning to give the matter a glance now and then though he has not committed himself and now the reverend john baird the hero of the platform is taking it up baird had proved his incidental offer of aid to have been by no means an idle one he had been obliged to absent himself from washington for a period but he had returned when his lecture tour had ended and had shown himself able in a new way he was the kind of man whose conversation people wish to hear he chose the right people and talked to them about the de willoughby claim he was interesting and picturesque in connection with it and lent the topic attractions tom had been shrewdly right in saying that his talk of it would give it a chance he went often to the house near the circle latimer did not go with him and had himself explained his reasons to big tom i have seen her he said it is better that i should not see her often she is too much like her mother but baird seemed to become by degrees one of the household graduallyand it did not take longtom and he were familiar friends they had long talks together they walked side by side through the streets they went in company to see the men it was necessary to hold interviews with their acquaintance became an intimacy which established itself with curious naturalness it was as if they had been men of the same blood who having spent their lives apart on meeting found pleasure in the discovery of their relationship the truth was that for the first time in his life big tom enjoyed a friendship with a man who was educated and in a measure of the world into which he himself had been born bairds world had been that of new england his own the world of the south but they could comprehend each others parallels and precedents and argue from somewhat similar planes in the delisleville days tom had formed no intimacies and had been a sort of colossus set apart in the mountains of north carolina he had consorted with the primitive and uneducated in goodhumoured even grateful friendliness but he had mentally lived like a hermit to have talked to jabe doty or nath hayes on any other subjects than those of crops and mountain politics or sermons would have been to bewilder them hopelessly to find himself in mental contact with a man who had lived and thought through all the years during which he himself had vegetated at the crossroads was a wonderful thing to him he realised that he had long ago given up expecting anything approaching such companionship and that to indulge in it was to live in a new world bairds voice his choice of words his readiness and tact the very carriage of his fine silvering head produced on him the effect of belonging to a new species of human being you are all the things i have been missing for half a lifetime he said i didnt know what it was i was making up my mind to going withoutbut it was such men as you on his own part baird felt he had made a rich discovery also the large humour and sweetness the straightforward unworldliness which was still levelheaded and observing the broad kindliness and belief in humanity which were so far from unintelligent or injudicious were more attractive to him than any collected characteristics he had met before they seemed to meet some strained needs in him to leave his own rooms and find his way to the house whose atmosphere was of such curious homely brightness to be greeted by shebas welcoming eyes to sit and chat with tom in the twilight or to saunter out with him with an arm through his were things he soon began to look forward to he began also to realise that this life of home and the affections was a thing he had lived without during his brief and wholly unemotional married life he had known nothing like it his years of widowerhood had been presided over by mrs stornaway who had assumed the supervision of his child as a duty annie had been a properly behaved rather uninteresting and unresponsive little person she had neat features and a realisation of the importance of respectability and the proprieties which was a credit to willowfield and her training she was never gay or inconsequent or young she had gone to school she had had her frocks lengthened and been introduced at teaparties exactly as had been planned for her she never committed a breach of discretion and she never formed in any degree an element of special interest she greatly respected her fathers position as a successful man and left it to be vaguely due to the approbation of willowfield big tom de willoughby in two wooden rooms behind a crossroads store in a small frame house kept in order by a negro woman and in the genteel poverty of miss burfords second floor had surrounded himself with the comforts and pleasures of the affections it was not possible to enter the place without feeling their warmth and baird found himself nourished by it he saw that rupert too was nourished by it his young good looks and manhood were developing under its influence day by day he seemed to grow taller and stronger baird had made friends with him too and was with them the night he came in to announce that at last he had got work to do it is to sell things from behind a counter he said and he went to sheba and lifted her hand to his lips kissing it before them all we know a better man who has done it you know a bigger man who has done it said tom he did it because he was cut out for a failure you are doing it because you are cut out for a success it will be a good story for the reporters when the claim goes through my boy baird perceived at once that it was a good story even at this particular perioda story which might be likely to arouse curiosity and interest at a time when the awakening of such emotions was of the greatest value he told it at the house of a magnate of the supreme court the next night he had a varied and useful audience of important politicians and their wives and daughters the latter specially fitted to act as mediums of transmission to other audiences he told the anecdote well it was a good picture that of the room on miss burfords upper floor the large claimant smiling like a benign jove and the handsome youngster bending his head to kiss the girlish hand as if he were doing homage to a queen i think his feeling was that his failure to get a better thing was a kind of indignity done her baird explained he comes of a race of men who have worshipped women and beauty in a romantic troubadour fashion only the higher professions and those treated in a patrician amateur style were possible to them as work and yet as he said a better man than himself had done this same thing what moves one is that he has gone out to find work as if he had been born a bricklayer he tells me they are reaching the end of all they depend on ill tell you what it is said senator milner to his daughter a few days afterwards this is going to be a feminine claim there was a time when i swore i wouldnt touch it but i foresee what is going to happen im going to give in and the other opposers are going to give in and in the end the government will give in and it will be principally because a force of wives and daughters has marshalled itself to march to the rescue no one ever realises what a power the american woman is and how much she is equal to accomplishing if she took as much interest in politics as english women do she would elect every president and control every party we are a goodnatured lot and we are fond of our womenkind and believe in them much more than other nations do theyre pretty clever and straight you know as well as being attractive and we cant help realising that they are often worth listening to so we listen and when they drive a truth home we are willing to believe in it if the feminine halves of the two houses decide that the de willoughby claim is all right theyll prove it to us and there you are i believe we can prove it to you answered mrs meredith i went to see the people and you could prove anything straightforward by merely showing them to the houses in session they could not conceal a disingenuous thought among themthe delightful giant the boy with the eyelashes the radiant girl and the old black man put together in the meantime judge rutherford did his honest best he had been too sanguine not to do it with some ruefulness after the first few months during the passage of these few months many of his ingenuous ideals had been overthrown it had been borne in upon him that honest virtue was not so powerful a factor as he had believed the obstacles continually arising in his pathway were not such as honest virtue could remove the facts that the claim was as straight as a string and that big tom de willoughby was the best fellow in hamlin were bewilderingly ineffective when prospects seemed to shine they might be suddenly overshadowed by the fact that a man whose influence was needed required it to use for himself in other quarters when all promised well some apparently unexplainable obstacle brought things to a standstill now you see it and now you dont said tom resignedly thats the position this sort of thing might go on for twenty years he was not aware that he spoke prophetically yet claims resting on as solid a basis as his own passed through the same dragging processes for thirty years before they were finally settled but such did not possess the elements of unprofessional picturesqueness this particular one presented told to its upholders and opposers uncle matt himself was to be counted among these elements he had made himself as familiar and popular a figure in the public places of the capital as he had been in delisleville he made friends in the markethouse and on the steps of the capitol and the treasury and the pension office he hung about official buildings and obtained odd jobs of work his grey wool his polished air of respectfulness his readiness and amiability attracted attention and pleased those who came in contact with him people talked to him and asked him friendly questions and when they did so the reason for his presence in washington and the importance of the matter which had brought his young master to the seat of government were fully explained i belongs to de genelmen dats here tendin to de de willoughby claim sah he would say cose sah youve heern bout it up to de capitol ise yere waitin on marse rupert de willoughby but cose he don live yeretill ye gets his claim throughlike he do in de ole family manshn at delislevillean my time hangs heavy on my hans cos i got so much ledgerso i comes out like dish yeran takes a odd job now an agen it was not long before he was known as the de willoughby claimant and loiterers were fond of drawing him out on the subject of the gol mines he gathered a large amount of information on the subjects of claims and the rapid methods of working them he used to come to tom sometimes hot and excited with his struggles to comprehend detail what all dish yer bout marse ruperts granpan bein destructively disloyal dar warnt no disloyal bout it ef dar was a fault to be foun with the old judge it was dat he was mos too loyal he couldn hol in an he quol with mos evy genelman he talk to he pass shots with one or two he had a disagreement with he pass shots with em hows de guvment gwine call a genelman destructively disloyal when he ready any minit to pass shots with his bes frens ef dey don gree with his polticsan his poltics is on de side er marse abam lincoln an de yankees the phrase constructively disloyal rankled in his soul he argued about it upon every possible occasion and felt that if the accusation could be disproved the de willoughby case would be triumphantly concluded which was in a large measure true i steddies bout dat thing day an night he said to sheba seems like dar oughter be someone to tesify ef i had de money to travel back to delisleville id go an try to hunt someone up he was seated upon the steps of a government building one afternoon discussing his favourite subject with some of his coloured friends he had been unusually eloquent and had worked himself up to a peroration when he suddenly ceased speaking and stared straight across the street to the opposite side of the pavement in such absorption that he forgot to close his mouth he was gazing at an elderly gentleman with a hook nose and the dashing hat of the broad brim which was regarded as being almost as much an insignia of the south as the bonnie blue flag itself uncle matt got up and shuffled across the street he had become unconsciously apish with excitement his old black face worked and his hands twitched he was so far out of breath when he reached the strangers side that he could scarcely make himself heard as pulling his hat off he cried agitatedly doctah doctah atkinson sah doctah williams atkinson the stranger did not hear him distinctly and waved him off evidently taking him for a beggar ive nothing for you uncle he said with condescending goodnature uncle matt found some of his breath though not enough to steady his voice but his strenuousness was almost passionate doctah williams atkinson he said i aint beggin doctah atkinson sah ony axin if i might speak a few words to you sah his shrewd insistance on the name was effective the elderly gentleman turned and looked at him in surprised questioning how do you know me he said this is the first time i have been in washingtonand ive not been here an hour i knowed you doctah atkinson sah in delisleville delisle county evybody knowed you doctah i was dar endurin er de war i was dar de time youyou an judge de willoughby passed shots bout dat confedate flag what do you want said dr atkinson somewhat unsmilingly these were days when stories of the confederate flag were generally avoided northerners called it the rebel flag matt had had the discretion to avoid this mistake he was wild with anxious excitement suddenly here had appeared a man who could give all the evidence desired if he would do so he had left delisleville immediately on the close of the war and had not been heard of he might like so many be passing on to some unknown point and remain in the city only between trains there was no time to find any better qualified person than himself to attend to this matter it must be attended to upon the spot and at this moment uncle matt knew all the incongruities of the situation no one could have known them better but a sort of hysteric courage grew out of his desperation doctah williams atkinson sah he said may i take de liberty of walking jes behin you an axin you a question i mustnt keep you standin i beg you to scuse me sah i kin talk an walk at de same time dr williams atkinson was an amenable person and matts imploring old darky countenance was not without its pathos he was so evidently racked by his emotions what is it all about he enquired matt stood uncovered and spoke fast the hand holding his hat was shaking as also was his voice im nothin but a ole niggah man doctah atkinson sah he said it aint for myself ise intrudin on ye its cos dar wasnt time to go fer marse de willoughby that could talk it like it oughter be i jes had to push my ole niggah self in fear youd be gone an wed nevah set eyes on you agin walk along by me said the doctor what about the de willoughbys i thought they were all dead all but marse thomas and marse rupert deys yere tendin to de claim has you done heern bout de claim doctah atkinson no the doctor answered i have been in too far out west whereupon matt plunged into the story of the gol mines and the difficulties which had presented themselves in the pathway of the claimant and the necessity for the production of testimony which would disprove the charge of disloyalty the detail was not very clear but it had the effect of carrying dr williams atkinson back to certain good old days in delisleville before his beloved south had been laid low and he had been driven far afield to live among strangers an alien for that reason he found himself moved by the recital and listened to it to its end but what has this to do with me he asked what do you want of me when i seed you sah uncle matt explained it all come back to me in a minnit how you an de judge pass shots bout dat flag how you axed him to a dinnerparty an dar was a confedate officer daran a confedate flag hung up over de table an de judge when he seed it he fused pint blank to set down to de table an it ended in you goin out in de gyardin an changin shots yes damn it all cried dr atkinson but melted the next moment the poor old fellow is dead he said an he died in disgrace and without friends yes uncle matt protested eagerly without a single friend an all lone ceptin of marse rupertall lone an it was cos he was so strong for de unionan now de guvment wont let his fambly have his money cos deys tryin to prove him destructively disloyalwhen he changed shots with his bes friend cos he wouldnt set under de confedate flag a grim smile wakened in dr atkinsons face what he said do you want me to explain to the government that the old scamp would have blown my brains out if he could doctah atkinson sah said uncle matt with shrewd gravity things is diffrent dese days an de guvment dont call dem genelmen scamps as was called dat in de souf he looked up under the broad brim of his companions hat with impassioned appealing i jes member one thing sah he said dat you was a southern genelman and when a enemys dead a southern genelman dont cherish no harm agin him an you

like a pickpocket and spoiled a dresscoat for me when dresscoats were scarce hes dead doctah williams atkinson sah hes dead said matt it was mighty lonesome the way he died too in dat big house dat was stripped by de soldiers an evybody dead belonging to himmiss de willoughby an de young ladies an marse romaine an marse de courcyno one lef but dat boy it was mighty lonesome sah yes thats so said dr atkinson reflectively after a few moments silence he added whom do you want me to tell this to it may be very little use but it may serve as evidence uncle matt stopped upon the pavement would you let me scort you to senator milner sah he said in absolute terror at his own daring would you low me to tend you to senator grove i knows what a favior ise axin i knows it doun to de groun i scarcely darst to ax it but if i loses you sah marse thomas de willoughby an marse rupert may lose de claim ef i lose you sah seems mos like i gwine to lose my mind there were a thousand chances to one that senator milner might not be where uncle matt hoped to find him there were ten thousand chances to one that he might be absorbingly engaged there were uncountable chances against them obtaining an interview with either man and yet it so happened they had the curious good luck to come upon senator milner absolutely without searching for him it was rather he who came upon them at one of the entrances of the capitol itself before which stood his daughters carriage mrs meredith had spent the morning in the senate being interested in the subject under debate she was going to take her father home to lunch and as she was about to enter her carriage her glance fell upon the approaching figures of uncle matt and his companion father she said there is the faithful retainer of the de willoughby claimants and there is not a shadow of a doubt that he is in search of you i am convinced that he wishes to present that tall southerner under the big hat in a moments space uncle matt was before them the deprecatory respect implied by his genuflections could scarcely be computed senator milner sah he said doctah williams atkinson of delisleville has had de kindness to say he do me de favior to come yeah sah to tesify sah the large hat was removed by its owner with a fine sweep the old fellow thinks i can do his people a service senator explained dr atkinson he is the servant of the de willoughby claimants and it seems there has been some question of judge de willoughbys loyalty during the war sir he was called disloyal by his neighbours and was a much hated man uncle matts lips were trembling he broke forth forgetting the careful training of his youth dar wasnt a genelman in de county he cried dar wasnt a genelman in de state mo hated an spised an mo looked down on the lean southerner nodded acquiescently thats true he said its quite true he was a copperhead and a firebrand we detested him he insulted me at my own table by refusing to sit down under the southern flag and the matter ended with pistols this is interesting by jove said the senator and he looked from uncle matt to his capture i should like to hear more of it will you confer a pleasure on me by coming home to lunch with us said mrs meredith who had begun to look radiant i am interested in the de willoughby claim i would give a great deal to see my father entirely convinced he has been on the verge of conviction for some time i want him to hear the story with all the details i beg you will let us take you home with us dr atkinson madame replied dr williams atkinson with an eighteenth century obeisance judge de willoughby and i lived in open feud but i am becoming interested in the de willoughby claim also i accept your invitation with pleasure and they drove away together chapter xxxv there is a man who seems to have begun to haunt my pathway baird said to tom or perhaps it is latimers pathway for it is when latimer is with me that i meet him he is small and sharpfeatured and unwholesome it sounds like stamps laughed big tom he related the story of stamps and his herds the herds had not gained the congressional ear as mr stamps had hoped he had described their value and the gravity of his loss to everyone who would listen to his eloquence but the result had been painfully discouraging his boardinghouse had become a cheaper one week by week and his blue jeans had grown shabbier he had fallen into the habit of hanging about the entrances of public buildings and the street corners in the hope of finding hearers and sympathisers his sharp little face had become haggard and more weasellike than before baird recognised big toms description of him at once yes it must be stamps he said what is the meaning of his interest in us does he think we can provide evidence to prove the value of the herds what are you thinking of de willoughby in fact there had suddenly recurred to toms mind a recollection of shebas fifth birthday and the visit mr stamps had made him with something of a shock he recalled the shrewd meekness of his voice as he made his exit it begins with a l tom it begins with a l the need of money was merely the natural expression of mr stampss nature he had needed money when he was born and had laid infant schemes to secure cents from his relatives and their neighbours before he was four years old but he had never needed it as he did now the claim for governmental restitution of the value of the daily increasing herds had become the centre of his being his belief in their existence and destruction was in these days profound his belief that he should finally be remunerated in the name and by the hand of national justice was the breath of life to him he had at last found a claim agent whose characteristics were similar to his own and so long as he was able to supply small sums with regularity this gentleman was willing to encourage him and direct him to fresh effort mr abner linthicum of vermont had enjoyed several successes in connection with two or three singular claims which he had put through with the aid of genius combined with a peculiar order of executive ability they had not been large claims but he had put them through when other agents had declined to touch them in fact each one had been a claim which had been fought shy of and one whose final settlement had been commented upon with open derision or raised eyebrows yours is the kind of claim i like to take up he had said to his client in their first interview but its the kind thats got to be engineered carefully and money is needed to grease the wheels but itll pay to grease them it had needed money stamps had no large sums to give but he could be bled by drops he had changed his cheap boardingplace for a cheaper one that he might be able to save a few dollars a week he had left the cheaper one for one cheaper still for the same reason and had at last camped in a bare room over a store and lived on shreds of food costing a few cents a day that he might still grease the wheels abner linthicum was hard upon him and was not in the least touched by seeing his meagre little face grow sharper and his garments hang looser upon his small frame youll fat on the herds he would say with practical jocularity and mr stamps grinned feebly his thin lips stretching themselves over hungry teeth the little man burned with the fever of his chase he sat in his bare room on the edge of his mattresshaving neither bedstead nor chairs nor tablesand his fingers clutched each other as he worked out plans and invented arguments likely to be convincing to an ungrateful government he used to grow hot and cold over them ef tom d hev gone in with me an helped me to work out that thar thing about sheby we mought hev made suthin as would hev carried me through this he said to himself more than once he owed tom a bitter grudge in a mild way his bitterness was the bitterness of a little rat baulked of cheese he had kept safely what he had found in the deserted cabin but as the years passed he lost something of the hopes he had at first cherished when he had seen sheba growing into a tall beauty he had calculated that her market value was increasing a handsome young woman who might marry well might be willing to pay something to keep a secret quietif any practical person knew the secret and it was unpleasant welltodo husbands did not want to hear their wives talked about when rupert de willoughby had arrived mr stamps had had a moment of discouragement hes gwine to fall in love with her he said but hed oughter bin wealthier ef the de willoughbys was what theyd usedter be hed be the very feller as ud pay for things to be kept quiet the de willoughbys was allers proud an ristycratic an mighty highfalutin bout their women folk when the subject of the de willoughby claim was broached he fell into feverish excitement the de willoughbys had a chance in a hundred of becoming richer than they had ever been he took his treasure from its hidingplacesat turning it over gnawing his fingernails and breathing fast but treasure though he counted it he gained no clue from it but the one he had spoken of to tom when he had cast his farewell remark to him as he closed the door ef thered hev been more he said a name aint much when there aint nothin to tack on to it it was curis enough but itd hev to be follered up an found out ef he was only what he lowed to betaint nothin to hide that a mans wife dies an leaves a child i dont blieve thar wasnt nothin to hidebut itd hev to be provedan proved plain its mighty aggravatin one night seeing a crowd pouring into a hall where a lecture was to be delivered he had lingered about the entrance until the carriage containing the lecturer drove up here was something to be had for nothing at all eventshe could have a look at the man who was making such a name for himself there must be something in a man who could demand so much a night for talking to people he managed to get a place well to the front of the loitering crowd on the pavement the carriagedoor was opened and a man got out that aint him said a bystander thats latimer hes always with him the lecturer descended immediately after his companion but stamps who was pushing past a man who had got in front of him was displaying this eagerness not that he might see the hero of the hour but that he might look squarely at the friend who had slightly turned his face gosh ejaculated the little hoosier a minute later id most swear to him he was exasperatedly conscious that he could not quite have sworn to him the man he had seen nineteen years before had been dressed in clumsily made homespun he had worn his black hair long and his beard had been unshaven nineteen years were nineteen years and the garb and bearing of civilisation would make a baffling change in any man previously seen attired in homespun and carrying himself as an unsociable hoosier but id most swar to himmost stamps went through the streets muttering id most swar it was but a few days later that latimer saw him standing on a street corner staring at him as he himself approached it was his curious intentness which attracted latimer he did not recognise his face he had not seen him more than once in the days so long gone by and had then cast a mere abstracted glance at him he did not know him againthough his garments vaguely recalled months when he had only seen men clothed in jeans of blue or copperas brown he saw him again the next day and again the next and after that he seemed to chance upon him so often that he could not help observing and reflecting upon the eager scrutiny in his wrinkled countenance do you see that man he remarked to baird i come upon him everywhere do you know him no i thought it possible you didor that he recognised one of usor wanted to ask some question after his conversation with big tom de willoughby latimer heard from baird the story of the herds and their indefatigable claimant he comes from the crossroads said latimer i dont remember his face do you think said baird rather slowly that he thinks he remembers yours a week passed before latimer encountered him again on this occasion he was alone baird had gone south to delisleville in the interests of the claim he had unexpectedly heard rumours of some valuable evidence which might be gathered in a special quarter at this particular moment and had set out upon the journey at a few hours notice stamps had passed two days and nights in torment he had learned from mr linthicum that his claim had reached one of the critical points all claims must pass more money was needed to grease the wheels that they might carry it past the crisis safely stamps had been starving himself for days and had gone without fire for weeks but the wheels had refused to budge for the sum he managed to produce he was weak and so feverish with anxiety and hunger that his lips were cracked and his tongue dry to rasping its all i kin scrape linthicum he said to that gentleman i kin get a few dollars more if minty kin sell her crop o corn an send me the moneybut this is every cent i kin give ye now wont it do nothin no it wont answered the claim agent with a final sort of shrug were dealing with a business thats got to be handled well or itll all end in smoke i cant work on the driblets youve been bringing meand whats more i should be a fool to try but ye wouldnt give it up cried stamps in a panic ye couldnt throw me over linthicum theres no throwing over about it linthicum said i shall have to give the thing up if i cant keep it going moneys got to be used over a claim like this i have had to ask men for a thousand dollars at a timeand the thing they were working was easier to be done than this is a thousand dollars cried stamps he grew livid and a lump worked in his throat as if he was going to cry a thousand dollars ud buy me and sell me twice over mr linthicum im not asking you for a thousand dollars yet said linthicum i may have to ask you for five hundred before longbut im not doing it now five hundred gasped stamps and he sat down in a heap and dropped his damp forehead on his hands that night as latimer entered the house of an acquaintance with whom he was going to spend the evening he caught sight of the by this time familiar figure on the opposite side of the street the night was cold and damp and rain was falling when the door closed behind him he heard it descending steadily throughout the evening and more than once the continuance of the downpour was commented upon by some member of the company when the guests separated for the night and latimer turned into the street again he had scarcely walked five yards before hearing a cough he cast a glance over his shoulder and saw the small man in blue jeans the jeans were wet and water was dropping from the brim of the old felt hat the idea which at once possessed his mind was that for some mysterious reason best known to himself the wearer had been waiting for and was following him what was it for he turned about suddenly and faced the person who seemed so unduly interested in his actions do you want to speak to me he demanded this movement being abrupt rather upset mr stampss calculations he came to a standstill looking surprised and nervous thar aint no harm done he said i aimed to find out whar ye lived have you been waiting for me to come out of the house asked latimer feeling some curiosity stamps admitted that he had the admission being somewhat reluctant as if he felt it might commit him to something having so far betrayed himself however he drew something nearer with a suggestion of stealthiness yere mighty like a man i once knowed he said yer powerful like him i never seed two men more liker each other where did he live when you knew him latimer enquired the wretched dank little figure suddenly assuming the haunting air of something his eye must have rested on before i seen him in north callina he did not live tharin the way other folks did he was jest stayin i wont keep ye standin in the rain insinuatingly ill jest walk along by ye latimer walked on this dragged him back again as other things had done once or twice he did not speak but strode on almost too rapidly for stampss short legs the short legs began to trot and their owner to continue his explanations rather breathlessly he warnt livin thar same as other folks he said thar was suthin curis about him nobody knowed nothin about him an nobody knew nothin about his wife now i come to think of it nobody ever knowed his namebut me did he tell it to you said latimer rigidly no with something verging on a chuckle discreetly strangled at its birth neither him nor his wife was tellin things just then they was layin mighty low she died when her child was borned an he lit out right away an aint never been heern tell of since latimer said nothing the rain began to fall more heavily and mr stamps trotted on lowin for store clothes an agein he continued i never seen two fellers favour each other as you two do an his name bein the same as yourn makes it curiser still you are getting very wet was latimers sole comment i got wet to the skin long afore you come out that house where ye was said mr stamps but i low to find out whar ye live i live about a quarter of a mile from here said latimer the brick house with the bay windows opposite the square number id rather see ye in replied stamps cautiously i might go into a house i do not live in returned latimer ye wont its too late aint ye gwine to say nothin mr latimer what do you want me to say shebys goodlookin gal stamps said toms done well by her ef they get their claim through theyll be powerful rich young dwillerby hes mightily in love with heran he wouldnt want no talk there is the house i live in at present said latimer pointing with his umbrella we shall be there directly ministers dont want no talk neither proceeded stamps ef a minister had made a slip an tried hard to hide it an then hed it proved on him he wouldnt like itan his church members wouldnt like itan his high class friends thered be a heap er trouble number said latimer you see i was speaking the truth this is the gate i am going in his tone and method were so unsatisfactory and unmoved thatremembering abner linthicumstamps became desperate he clutched latimers arm and held it itd be worth money fur him to git safe hold of them letters thar was two on em i didnt let on to tom i wasnt gwine to let on to him till i found out hed go in with me them as knowed the man they was writ by ud be able to see a heap in em theyd give him away yed better get hold of em theyre worth five hundred theyre yournye wrote em yourself ye aint jest like himyere himill swar to ye latimer suddenly saw his mothers mild new england countenance with its faded blue eyes he remembered the hours he had spent telling her the details of the sunny days in italy where margery had lain smiling in the sunset he looked down the long wet street the lamps gleaming on its shining surface he thought of baird who would not return until the day on which he was to deliver a farewell lecture before leaving washington he recalled his promptness of resource and readiness for action if baird were but in the room above in which the light burned he would tell him his mind seemed to vault over all else at this instantto realise the thing which it had not reached at the first shock he turned on stamps you say there were letters he exclaimed forgetting his previous unresponsiveness two not long uns an wrote keerfulwithout no name but they say a heap they was wrote when he had to leave her latimers heart seemed physically to turn over in his side he had never known she had had a line of handwriting in her possession this must be some scrap of paper some last last words she clung to with such anguish of desperation that she could not tear herself from them and so had died leaving them in their secret hidingplace the thought was a shock the effort it cost him to regain his selfcontrol was gigantic but he recovered his outward calm you had better go home and change your clothing he said as coldly as he had spoken before you are not a young man or a strong one and you may kill yourself you are making a mistake about me but if you will give me your address i will see you again i thort ye wouldmebbe said stamps i thort mebbe ye would theyre worth it and he scribbled a few words on a scrap of paper with a stump of a pencilproducing both rapidly from his pocketand thrusting it into latimers hand trotted away contentedly down the long wet street chapter xxxvi as he entered his rooms latimer glanced round at bairds empty chair and wished he had found him sitting in it he walked over to it and sat down himselfsimply because it was bairds chair and suggested his presence latimer knew how he would have turned to look at him as he came in and that he would at once have known by instinct that the old abyss had been reopened if he were here he thought he would tell me what to do but he knew what he was going to do he must buy the little hoosiers silence if it was to be bought he should see the letters through all those months she had hidden them he could imagine with what terror she could not bear to destroy them and yet he knew there must have been weeks she did not dare to go near their hidingplace they must have been concealed in some cranny of the cabin how she must have shuddered with dread when he had accidentally approached the spot where they lay concealed he recalled now that several times he had been wakened from his sleep in the middle of the night by hearing her moving about her room and sobbing she had perhaps crept out of her bed in the darkness to find these scraps of paper to hold them in her hands to crush them against her heart to cover them with piteous kisses salt with scalding tears on one such night he had risen and going to the closed door had spoken to her through it asking her if she was ill no no lucien she had cried out butbut i am so lonelyso lonely she had told him the next day that the sound of the wind soughing in the pines had kept her from sleep and she had got up because she could not bear to be still and listen he had known well what she meant by her desolate little answer to him she had been a beloved thing always as a child her playmates had loved her as a schoolgirl she had won the hearts of companions and teachers alike nature had endowed her with the brightness and sweetness which win affection the smile in her eyes wakened an answer even in the look of passing strangers suddenly all had changed she was hidden in the darkness crushed and shamed an outcast and a pariaha thing only to be kept out of sight sometimes after she had been sitting lost in thought latimer had seen her look up bewildered glance at her little deformed body and sit white and trembling everything is different she panted out once it is as if all the world was black it isbecausebecause i am black latimer had made no effort to wring from her the name she had prayed to be allowed to hide yet he had often wondered that in some hysteric moment it had not escaped herthat mere helpless anguish did not betray her into uttering some word or phrase which might have served as a clue but this she had never done and between them there had been built a stone wall of silence yet in spite of it he had known that her young heart was broken with love for this nameless traitora love which would not die he had seen it in the woe of her eyes in the childlike longing of her look when she sat and gazed out over the wild beauty of the land thinking she was unobserved in his own soul there had been black bitter hate but in hers only loneliness and pain there came back to himand he sprang up and ground his teeth pacing the floor as he remembered ita night when she had wandered out alone in the starlight and at last he had followed her and found herthough she did not know he was nearstanding where the roof of pinetrees made a darkness and as he stood within four feet of her he had heard her cry to the desolate stillness if i could see you once if i could see you onceif i could touch youif i could hear you speakjust oncejust once and she had wailed it lowbut as a starving child might cry for bread and he had turned and gone away sick of soul leaving her he had told this to baird and had seen the muscles of his face twitch and his eyes suddenly fill with tears he had left his seat and crossed the room to conceal his emotion and latimer had known that he did not speak because he could not the letters were written with caution stamps had said and the mention of names had been avoided in them and though he ground his teeth again as he thought of this he realised that the knowledge brought by a name would be of no value to him long ago he had said to big tom in the cabin on the hillside if ever we meet face to face knowing each other i swear i will not spare him spare him spare him what what vengeance could he work which would wipe out one hour of that past woe none he had grown sick to death in dwelling with the memories he could not bury he had been born cursed by the temperament which cannot outlive there are such and it was the temperament to which vengeance brings no relief no if they two met face to face what words could be saidwhat deeds could be done his forehead and hands grew damp with cold sweat as he confronted the despair of it better that i should not know his name he cried better that we should never meet pray god that he is dead pray god the earth does not hold him the man who had followed him had plainly but one purpose which was the obtaining of money he looked as if he needed it directly he would go to him and pay him what he asked and get the papers they must be in no other hands than his own when he had them baird and himself would destroy them together and that would be the end he encountered no difficulties when he went in search of the address stamps had given him the room he had directed him to was over a small store on the south side of pennsylvania avenue when he entered it he saw at once that the man whose circumstances reduced him to living in it must be one whose need of money was great indeed it was entirely unfurnished except for a mattress lying on the floor and stamps was stretched upon it coughing and feverish come in he said i knowed yed be here purty soon thar aint no chair to ax ye to set down in i do not want to sit said latimer you are ill you caught cold last night i spose i did durn it answered stamps i got drenched to the skin an i hadnt nothin dry to put on when i got home but id seen yean told ye what id lowed to tell ye where are the papers you spoke of latimer asked stampss feverish lips stretched themselves in an agreeable smile they aint yere he answered an they wont be yere till ive got the pay fur em ef thar was names in em theyd cost ye a heap more than five hundred dollarsan theyd cost ye more anyhow ef i hadnt a use for that five hundred jest this particular time where are they enquired latimer he meant to waste no words theyre in north calliny answered the little mountaineer cheerfully an ive got a woman thar esll send em when i want em she may send them when you wish stamps fell into a paroxysm of coughing clutching his side will ye give five hundred he panted when it was over yes ye want em pretty bad do ye said stamps looking at him with a curiosity not untinged with dubiousness he was sharp enough to realise that upon the whole his case was not a strong one i dont want them for the reason you think i want them for latimer replied his voice was cold and hard and his manner unpromisingly free from emotion or eagerness i want them for a reason of my own as for your pretence of recognising me as a man you have seen before go out into the street corners and say what you choose my friends know how and where my life has been spent and you are shrewd enough to know how far your word will stand against mine if you need the money now you had better produce what you have to sell i could get ye mightily talked about said stamps restlessly try it answered latimer and turned as if to walk out of the room he knew what he was dealing with and saw the fevered cupidity and fear in the little shifting eyes stamps struggled up into a sitting posture on his mattress and broke forth into coughs again come back yere he cried between gasps ye neednt ter go latimer paused where he stood and waited until the fit of coughing was over and stamps threw himself back exhausted his shifty eyes burned uncannily his physical and mental fever were too much for him linthicum had just left him before latimer arrived and upon the production of five hundred dollars rested the fate of the claim for the herds ef yell bring the moneycash downnext saturday he said ill give ye the papers ill hev em yere by then when yeve got em with the agreeable grin again ye kin go to yer friends farwell lecture easy in ye mind ye wouldnt be likely to go to many of em ef he knowed what i could tell him hes powerful thick with tom dwillerby and sheby they think a heap of him tom must hev guessed what ive guessed but he dont want no talk on accounts o sheby tom knows which side his breads butteredhe aint nigh as big a fool as he looks latimer stood still next saturday was his sole response in the meantime i should advise you to send for the doctor he left him coughing and catching at his side chapter xxxvii during this week judge rutherfords every hour was filled with action and excitement he had not a friend or acquaintance in either house whom he did not seek out and labour with he was to be seen in the lobby in the corridors in committeerooms arguing and explaining with sheafs of papers in his hands and bundles of documents bulging out of his pockets he walked down the avenue holding the arm of his latest capture his trustworthy countenance heated by his interest and anxiety his hat thrust on the back of his head theres got to be justice done he would protest you see justice has got to be done theres no other way out of it and id swear there aint a man among you who doesnt own up that it is justice now all this evidence has been brought together the country couldnt be responsible for throwing the thing overeven till another session everythings in black and white and sworn to and provedand the papers baird has sent in clinch the whole thing now just look here and he would repeat his story and refer to his documents until even the indifferent succumbed through exhaustion if not conviction he appeared at dupont circle two or three times a day always fevered with delighted hope always with some anecdote to relate which prognosticated ultimate triumph if he could not find anyone else to talk to he seized upon miss burford or uncle matt and poured forth his news to them he wrote exultant letters to jenny the contents of which being given to barnesville travelled at once to talbots crossroads and wakened it to exhilarated joyfulness drawing crowds to the postoffice and perceptibly increasing the traffic on the roads from the mountains to that centre of civilised social intercourse toms agwine to win his claim it was said judge rutherfords walkin it right through for him tomll be way ahead of the richest man in hamlin shebyll be a hairest lordy what a sight itll be to see em come back wonder whar theyll build in washington it had begun to be admitted even by the reluctant that the fortunes of the de willoughby claim seemed to have taken a turn members of substantial position discussed it among themselves it was a large claim and therefore a serious one but it had finally presented itself upon an apparently solid foundation and it is the member from the mountain districts and the old negro and the popular minister who will have carried it through if it passes said senator milner to his daughter it is a monumental thing at this crisis of affairsa huge unpopular claim on a resenting government carried through by persons impelled solely by the most purely primitive and disinterested of motives an ingenuous county politician fresh from his native wilds works for it through sheer prehistoric affection and neighbourliness an old black manout of a storybookforges a powerful link of evidence for mere faithful loves sake a man who is a minister of the gospel a gentleman and above reproach gives to its service all his interest solely because he cherishes an affectionate admiration for the claimants nobody has laboured with any desire for return nobody has bargained for anything nobody would accept anything if it was offered to them the whole affair has been arcadian will it be decided for the de willoughbyswill it said mrs meredith yes answered the senator i think it will and i confess i shall not advance any objections meeting big tom on the avenue ezra stamps stopped him tom he wheezed hoarsely i heern tell you was likely ter git yer claim through there are times when you can hear that about almost any claim answered tom what im waiting for is to hear that ive got it through stamps gnawed his fingernails restlessly yere lucky he said ye allus was lucky how about the herds said tom stamps gave him an agonised look hev ye ever said anything agen me tomto any man with inflooence hev ye now twouldnt be neighbourly of ye if ye hedan we both come from the crossroadsan i allus give ye my custom ye wont never go agen me will ye tom ive never been asked any questions about you tom said look here you had better go to some hospital and ask to be taken in what are you walking about the street for in that fix you can scarcely breathe im agwine to walk about until saturday answered stamps with a grin im lookin arter my own claiman abner linthicum arter saturday ill lie up for a spell youd better do it before saturday tom remarked as he left him stamps stood and watched him walk away and then turned into a drugstore and bought a cheap bottle of cough mixture he was passing through the early stages of pneumonia and was almost too weak to walk but he had gone from place to place that morning like a machine linthicum had driven him so long as he was employed in badgering other men he was not hanging about the agents office linthicum was not anxious that he should be seen there too frequently after the payment of the five hundred dollars there would be no more to be wrung from him and he could be dropped he could be told that it was useless to push the claim further until the five hundred was secured however he must be kept busy consequently he went from one man to the other until he could walk no more then he crawled back to his room and sent a note to latimer i caynt git the papers tel saturday afternoon ef ye bring the money about seven ye ken hev them taint no use comin no earlier latimer found the communication when he returned to his rooms in the evening he had been out on business connected with bairds final lecture it was to be a special event and was delivered in response to a general request a building of larger dimensions than the hall previously used had been engaged the demand for seats had been continuously increasing the newspaper and social discussion of the prospects of the de willoughby claim had added to the interest in baird this brilliant and popular man this charming and gifted fellow had felt such a generous desire to assist the claimants that he had gone south in the interest of their fortunes he had been detained in delisleville and could barely return in time to appear before his audience the enthusiasm and eagerness were immense every man who had not heard him felt he must hear him now everyone who had heard him was moved by the wish to be of his audience again latimer had been besieged on all sides and after a hard day had come home fagged and worn but he was not worn only by business interviews newspaper people and applicants for seats which could not be obtained he was worn by his thoughts of the past days by his lack of bairds presence and his desire for his return his influence was always a controlling and supporting one latimer felt less morbid and more sane when they were together this same night senator milner and judge rutherford called in company at the house near the circle when uncle matt opened the door for them judge rutherford seized his hand and shook it vigorously the judge was in the mood to shake hands with everybody uncle matt he said were going to get it through and in a weeks time youll be a rich mans servant matt fled back to miss burford trembling with joy and excitement do ye think we is gwine trough maam he said dye think we is seems like we was the isrilites acrossin the red sea an the fust of us is jest steppin on de sho lordy miss burford maam i dont know how ise gwine to stan dat great day when we is though shore enuff washnton city aint gwine be big enuff to hol me it will be a great day uncle matthew replied miss burford with elated decorum of manner the de willoughby mansion restored to its former elegance mr thomas de willoughby the possessor of wealth and the two young people she bridled a little gently and touched her eyes with her handkerchief with a slight cough when marse de courcy an miss delia vanuxem was married dar was people from fo counties at de infar said matt de fust woman what i was married to she done de cookin senator milner was shaking hands with big tom upstairs he regarded him with interest remembering the morning he had evaded an interview with him the little room was interesting the two beautiful young people suggested the atmosphere of a fairy story you are on the verge of huge good fortune i think mr de willoughby he said i felt that i should like to come with rutherford to tell you that all is going very well with your claim members favour it whose expression of opinion is an enormous weight in the balance judge rutherford is going to speak for youand so am i judge rutherford shook toms hand rather more vigorously than he had shaken matts i wish to the lord i was an orator tom he said if i cant make them listen to me this time i believe i shall blow my brains out but what with williams atkinson and baird weve got things that are pretty convincing and somehow i swear the claim has begun to be popular when the two men had gone the little room was for a few moments very still each person in it was under the influence of curiously strong emotion anxious waiting cannot find itself upon the brink of great fortune and remain unmoved some papers with calculations worked out in them lay upon the table and big tom sat looking at them silently sheba stood a few feet away from him her cheeks flushed light breaths coming quickly through her parted lips rupert looked at her as youth and love must look at love and youth uncle tom he said at last are you thinking of what we shall do if we find ourselves millionaires no answered tom his eyes rested on the boy in thoughtful questioning no ill own im not thinking of that neither am i said rupert he drew nearer to sheba it would be a strange thing to waken and find ourselves owners of a fortune he said we may waken to find it soin a few days but there is always a chance that things may fail one i was thinking of what we should do ifwe lose everything sheba put out her slim hand she smiled with trembling lips we have been across the mountain she said we came togetherand we will go back together will you go back with us rupert he took her in his strong young arms and kissed her while tom looked on that is what i was thinking he cried that it does not matter whether we win the claim or lose it the house is gone and the store is gone but we can add a room to the cabin in blairs hollowwe can do it ourselvesand i will learn to plough he dropped on one knee like a young knight and kissed her little warm soft palm if i can take care of you and uncle tom sheba he said will you marry me yes i will marry you she answered we three can be happy togetherand there will always be the spring and the summer and the winter may she marry me uncle tom rupert asked even though we begin life like adam and eve she shall marry you the day we go back to the mountains said tom i always thought adam and eve would have had a pretty fair showif they had not left the garden of eden behind them when they began the world for themselves you wont have left it behind you youll find it in the immediate vicinity of talbots crossroads chapter xxxviii the facts in detail which the reverend john baird had journeyed to delisle county in the hope of being able to gather he had been successful in gaining practical possession of having personal charm grace in stating a case and many resources both of ability and manner he had the power to attract even the prejudiced and finally to win their interest and sympathies he had seen and conversed with people who could have been reached in no ordinary way and having met them had been capable of managing even their prejudices and bitterness of spirit the result had been the accumulation of useful and convincing evidence in favour of the de willoughbys though he had in more than one instance gained it from persons who had been firm in their intention to give no evidence at all this evidence had been forwarded to washington as it had been collected and when baird returned to the capital it was with the knowledge that his efforts had more than probably put the final touches to the work which would gain the day for the claimants his train was rather late and as it drew up before the platform he glanced at his watch in some anxiety his audience for the lecture must already have begun to turn their faces toward the hall in which the evenings entertainment was to be held he had hoped to reach his journeys end half an hour earlier he had wanted a few minutes with latimer whose presence near him had become so much a part of his existence that after an absence he felt he had lacked him he took a carriage at the depot and drove quickly to their rooms they were to leave them in a day or two and return to willowfield already some of their possessions had been packed up the sittingroom struck him as looking a little bare as he entered it is mr latimer out he asked the mulatto who brought up his valise yes sir he was called out by a message he left a note for you on the desk baird went to the desk and found it it contained only a few lines everything is prepared for you the audience will be the best you have had at any time i have been sent for by the man stamps he is ill of pneumonia and wishes to deliver some letters to me i will be with you before you go on the platform since he had left washington baird had heard from latimer but once and then but briefly he had felt that his dark mood was upon him and this reference to letters recalled the fact stamps is the little man with the cattle claim he commented to himself he comes from the neighbourhood of the crossroads what letters could he have to hand over and he began to dress wondering vaguely stamps had spent a sleepless night he could not sleep because his last interview with linthicum had driven him hard even though he had been able to promise him the required five hundred dollars he also could not sleep because the air of the city had been full of talk about the promising outlook of the de willoughby claim over the reports he had heard he had raged almost with tears the dwillerbys is ristycrats he had said theyre ristycrats an it gives em a pull even if they was rebels an southerners a pore man ez works hard an aint nothin but a honest farmer an a sound union man aint got no show ef id been a ristycrat i could hev got inflooence ez hed hev pulled wires fur me but i haint nothin but my loyal union principles i aint no ristycrat an i never aimed to be none the bitterness of his nervous envy would have kept him awake if he had had no other reason for being disturbed but most of all he was sleepless because he was desperately ill and in danger he knew nothing of cold and weeks of semistarvation anxiety excitement and drenched garments had done the little man to death and he lay raging with fever and stabbed with pain at each indrawn breath tossing and gasping and burning but thinking only of linthicum and the herds and the scraps of paper which were to bring him five hundred dollars he was physically wretched but even while he was racked with agonised fits of coughing and prostrated with pain it did not occur to him to think that he was in danger he was too wholly absorbed in other thoughts the only danger he recognised was the danger that there might be some failure in his plansthat linthicum might give him upthat the parson might back out of his bargain realising that after all letters unsigned save by a mans christian name were not substantial evidence perhaps he would not come at all perhaps he would leave the city perhaps if he came he would refuse to give more than half or quarter the sum asked then linthicum would throw him overhe knew linthicum would throw him over he uttered a small cry like a tortured cat i know hell do it he said i seen it in his eye yesterday when he let out on me an said he was agettin sick of the business i shed hev kept my mouth shut id said too much an it made him mad hell throw me over monday mornin ef i dont take him the money on sunday he ate nothing all through the day but lay waiting for the passing of the hours he had calculated as to which post would bring the letter from minty he had written to tell her of the hidingplace in which he had kept the bits of paper safe and dry through all the years she was to enclose them in a stout envelope and send them to him through the long dragging day he lay alone burning gasping fighting for his breath in the attacks of coughing which seemed to tear his lungs asunder there was a clock in a room below whose striking he could hear each hour between each time it struck he felt as if weeks elapsed sometimes it was months he had begun to be lightheaded and to think queer things once or twice he heard a man talking in a croaking wail and after a few minutes realised that it was himself and that he did not know what he had said though he knew he had been arguing with linthicum who was proving to him that his claim was too rotten to have a ghost of a chance by the time the afternoon post arrived he was semidelirious and did not know how it happened that he at last found himself holding mintys letter in his hand he laughed hysterically when he opened it it was all right there were the two yellowed sheets of papersmall sheets written close and in a peculiar hand he had often studied the handwriting and believed if he had seen it again he should know it it was small but strong and characteristic though that was not what he had called it ef id hed more time an could hev worked it out morean got him to write suthin downi could hev hed more of a hold he said plaintively but linthicum wouldnt give me no time the post arrived earlier than he had expected it and this gave him time to lie and fret and listen again for the striking of the clock in the room downstairs the waiting became too long and as his fever increased he became insanely impatient and could not restrain himself to lie and listen for his visitors footsteps upon the stairsto lie until seven oclockif he did not come till then would be more than he could endure that would give him too long to think over what linthicum would do if the whole sum were not forthcomingto think of the reasons why the parson might make up his mind to treat the letters as if they were worthless he lay and gnawed his fingernails anew i wouldnt give nothin for em ef i was in his place he muttered ef thard been anythin in em that proved anythin i should hev used em long sence but then im a business man an hes a parson an doesnt know nothin about the laws but he might go to some mansay a man like linthicumwho could put him up to things good lord in a new panic he maynt come at all he might jest stay away he became so overwrought by this agonising possibility that instead of listening for the striking of the clock he began to listen for the sound of some passing footstepthe footstep of someone passing by chance who might be sent to the parson with a note with intolerable effort and suffering he managed to drag himself up and get hold of a piece of paper and a pencil to write the following lines the letters hes come youd as well come an get em others will pay for em ef ye dont want em yerself his writing of the last sentence cheered his spirits it was a support to his small ignorant cunning hell think someone else is biddin agen him he said ef there was two of em biddin i could get most anythin i axed after he had put the communication in an envelope he dragged himself to the door almost bent double by the stabbing pain in his side once there he sat down on the floor to listen for footsteps its hard work this yere he panted shivering with cold in spite of his fever but its better than alyin thar doin nothin at length he heard steps they were the running stamping feet of a boy who whistled as he came stamps opened the door and whistled himselfa whistle of summons and appeal the boy who was on his way with a message to another room hesitated a minute and then came forward staring at the sight of the little undressed shivering man with his head thrust into the passage hallo he said what dyer want want ye to carry this yere letter to a man stamps got out hoarsely ill give ye a quarter will ye do it yes and he took both note and money still staring at the abnormal object before him when the messenger arrived latimer was reading the letters which had arrived by the last delivery one of them was from baird announcing the hour of his return to the city latimer held it in his hand when stampss communication was brought to him tell the messenger that i will come he said it was not long before stamps heard his slow approach sounding upon the bare wooden stairs he mounted the steps deliberately because he was thinking he was thinking as he had thought on his way through the streets in a few minutes he should be holding in his hand letters written by the man who had been margerys murdererthe letters she had hidden and clung to and sobbed over in the blackness of her nights and they had been written twenty years ago and margery had changed to dust on the hillside under the pines and nothing could be undone and nothing softened but for the sake of the little old woman ending her days quietly in willowfieldand for the sake of margerys memoryyes he wanted to save the childs memorybut for these things there would be no use in making any effort to secure the papers yet he was conscious of a dread of the moment when he should take them into his hand stamps turned eager miserable eyes upon him as he came in i thought mebbe yed made up yer mind to let the other feller hev them he said hev ye brought the money in bills latimer stood and looked down at him do you know how ill you are he said wal i guess i kin feel a right smartbut i dont keer sos things comes my way hev ye got the money with ye yes where are the papers whars the money latimer took out a pocketbook and opened it that he might see stampss countenance relaxed the tension was relieved thets far an squar he said dye wanter know whar i found em tom dwillerby never knowed i hed more than a envelopean i tuk care not to tell him the name that was writ on it ye was mighty smart never to let no one know yer name i dont know how you done it ceptin that ye kept so much to yerselves latimer remained silent merely standing and letting him talk as he seemed to have a feverish halfdelirious tendency to do he lay plucking at the scanty bedcovering and chuckling twas five years arter the child was born he went on i was ridin through blairs holler an it come to me sudden to go in an hev a look round keerful i looked keerfulmighty keerfulan at last i went on my hands an knees an crawled round an there was a hole between the logs an i seen a bit of whitei couldnt hev seen it ef i hadnt been crawlin an looked up an i dug it out it hed been hid mighty secret he put his hand under his wretched pillow give me the money he wheezed when ye lay it in my hand ill pass the envelope over to ye count it out first latimer counted the bills this was the moment twenty years gone byand nothing could be changed he put the money on the bed stamps withdrew his hand from under the pillow a stout illdirected envelope was in its grasp and he passed it over to latimer he was shivering and beginning to choke a little but he grinned i reckin its all right he said dye want to read em now no latimer answered and putting them in his breastpocket walked out of the room he passed down the stairs and into the avenue where the lamps were lighted and which wore its usual somewhat deserted evening air he walked along quietly for some minutes he did not quite know where he was going having left a line for baird explaining his absence he had time to spare if he wished to be alone he could be so until the hour of the beginning of the lecture for certain reasons it would be necessary that he should see baird before he went upon the platform yes he must be alone his mood required it he would go somewhere and look at the two yellowed letters written twenty years ago he did not know why it was that he felt he must look at them but he knew he must they would satisfy no curiosity if he felt it and he had none perhaps it was the old tragic tender feeling for margery which impelled him perhaps he unconsciously longed to read that this man had loved herthat she had not given her life for nothingthat the story had not been one of common caprice and common treachery as he walked his varied thoughts surged through his brain disconnectedly every now and then he involuntarily put his hand to his breastpocket to feel the envelope once there crossed his mind a memory of the woman whose boy had died and who dare not let herself recall him and so be swept back into the black maelstrom of woe tonight with these things on his breast it was not twenty years since he had heard margerys dying criesit was last nightlast nightand the odour of the pinetrees was in his nostrilsthe sough of their boughs in his ears he stopped near the entrance to the grounds of the smithsonian institute they were as secluded as a private park at this time but here and there was a seat and a light he turned in and found his way to the most retired part where he could find these thingsa bench to sit down on a light to aid him to read he heard his own breathing as he sat down he felt the heavy rapid pulsations of his heart as he took the papers from his breast his hand was shaking he could not hold it still he took out more papers than the envelope stamps had given him he drew forth with this the letter which had arrived from baird and which he had been reading when the messenger arrived he had abstractedly put it in his pocket it fell from his shaking hand upon the ground at his feet and he let it lie there forgetful of its existence then he withdrew the two letters from the large envelope and opened one of them he read them through oncetwicethree timesfour then he began again he had read them a dozen times before he closed them he had read them word by word poring over each character each turn of phrase as a man might pore over an enigma or a document written in a foreign language of which he only knew stray words if his hands had shaken at first he had not turned a page before his whole body was shaking and his palms his forehead his hair were damp with cold dew he had uttered one sharp convulsed exclamation like a suffocated crythen he went on readingreadingreadingand shuddering as he read they were not long letters but after he had read them once he understood them and each time he read them again he understood them better yes he could translate them they were the farewells of a man tossed by a whirlwind of passionate remorseful grief the child had been lovedher very purity had been loved while she had been destroyed and deceived the writer poured forth heartsick longing and heartsick remorse he had not at first meant to conceal from her that he was not a free manthen he had lost control over his very beingand he had lost his soul when she had discovered the truth and had not even reproached him but had stood silentwithout a wordand gazed at him with her childish agonised blueflower eyeshe had known that if men had souls his was damned there was no pardonhe could ask nonepardon would not undodeath itself would not undo what he had done margery margery oh childgod hear me if there is god to heari loved youi love youdeath will not undo that either he was going abroad to join his wife he spoke of the ship he sailed on latimer knew its name and who had sailed in it in the second letter he besought her to let him see and speak one word to herbut knew she would not grant his prayer he had seen her in the street and had not dared to approach i did not fear what a man might fear from other women he wrote i felt that it might kill you suddenly to see me near when you could not escape and after he had read it a third time latimer realised a ghastly truth the man who wrote had gone away unknowing of the blackness of the tragedy he had left behind he plainly had not known the secret death itself had helped to hide perhaps when he had gone margery herself had not known the worst latimer having finished his reading rested his head on his hand for a dull moment and stared down at the letter lying upon the ground at his feetthe letter he had dropped as he took out the others he felt as if he had not strength or inclination to pick it uphe had passed through a black storm which had swept away from him the power to feel more than a dull heavy physical prostration but after a few minutes he stooped and picked the letter up he laid it on his knee by the other two and sat gazing again he did not know he said in a colourless voice i told him he heard it first from me when i told him how she died the handwriting of the letters was bairdsevery character and word and phrase were hisbaird was the man who had written them chapter xxxix the street in which the lecture hall stood began to wear the air of being a centre of interest some time before the doors of the building were opened people who had not been able to obtain reserved seats wished to arrive early the lectures which had begun by being popular had ended by being fashionable at the outset an audience of sober religious tendencies had attended them but after the first one had been delivered other elements had presented themselves there had been a sprinkling of serious scientific men a prominent politician or so some society women whose faces and toilettes were wellknown and lavishly described in the newspapers on this last night the audience was largely of the fashionable political world carriages drove up one after another and deposited welldressed persons who might have been expected that night to appear at certain brilliant social functions and who had come to hear repentance instead he has always had good audiences said a member of the committee of arrangement but he has never had one like thisin washington at least there is the secretary of state with his wife and daughter i believe the president is to be here he has awakened an enormous interest the house will be literally crammed they are filling the aisle with seats already baird was in the small retiringroom which had been arranged for his convenience his journey had somewhat fatigued him and he was in the physical and mental condition to feel glad that this lecture was to be the last of the series he was going back to willowfield though he was not to remain there he had received a call from an important church in new york and had accepted it he was endeavouring to make arrangements that latimer could be near him on his return this evening he had found a letter he had been expecting it referred to latimer and he was anxious to talk it over with him he wished he would come in and felt a little restless over his delay though he knew they would have time to say but few words to each other before it was time for the lecture to begin he walked up and down the room looking down at the green carpet and thinking his thoughts wandering vaguely to the little pursuant of the herd claim and the letters he had wanted to deliver he smiled faintly remembering the small frame in the overlarge clothes and the bucolic countenance with its oversharpness of expression the member of the committee looked into the room they are beginning to turn people away from the doors he said half the cabinet is herei never saw such an audience as he went away smiling someone passed him in entering the room baird who was smiling also changed his expression of courteous appreciation to a smile of greeting for the man who had entered was latimer he advanced holding out his hand i am glad you have come he began to say i wanted at least a word with you before i went on then his smile died out leaving blank amazement which a breaths space later was alarmed questioning he recalled later how for a second he stood and stared latimers face was white and damp with sweat its lines were drawn and sunken deep his eyes were fixed on the man before him with something which had a ghastly resemblance to an unsteady smile which was not a smile at all he looked as if illnessor deathor madness had struck him he did not seem a sane man and yet a stillness so deadly was expressed by his whole being that it seemed to fill the small neat businesslike greenroom baird strode towards him and seized him by the shoulder what is it what is it what is it he cried out latimers face did not alter in a line he fumbled stiffly in his breastpocket and held out some pieces of yellowed letterpaperthis being done stiffly too he spoke in a hoarse whisper it seemed to search every corner of the room and echo there see he said these are two letters a man wrote them to a poor halfmad child twenty years ago the door opened and the member of the committee looked in again radiant with exultation the audience waiting in such breathless silence that you might hear a pin drop two thousand of them if theres one ten minutes to eight thank you answered baird the door closed again and he stood looking at latimers rigid hand and the papers they were written to margery went on latimer stamps found them in a chink in the logs she had hidden them there that she might take them out and sob over and kiss them i used to hear her in the middle of the night baird snatched them from his hand he fell into a chair near the table and dropped his face upon the yellowed fragments pressing them against his lips with awful sobbing sounds as if he would wrest from them the kisses the longdead girl had left there i too he cried i too oh my god margery dont say god said latimer when she was dying in an agony of fear she said it not that word another he said no otherand latimer drew nearer to him you wrote them he said they are written in your handin your wordsi should know them anywhere you may deny it i could prove nothing i do not want to prove anything deny it if you will baird rose unsteadily the papers were clutched in his hand his face was marred by the unnaturalness of a mans tears do you think i shall deny it he answered it is true i have sat and listened to your talk of her and thought i should go quite mad you have told me of her tortures and i have listened i did not knowsurely she did not know herselfof the childwhen i went away it is no use saying to youhow should it bethat i loved herthat i was frenzied by my love of her innocent sweetness no there is no use answered latimer in a voice actually void of emotion but i daresay it is true there is no use in calling myself by any of the names invented for the men who bring about such tragedies they are true of some men perhaps but they were not true of me i dont know what was true of me something worse than has ever been put into words perhaps for i loved her and i have loved her for twenty years i would have given up my careermy life anything she had asked but when she found you had acted a lie to her it seemed to fill her with the frantic terror of a child i dare not approach her i think she thought she would be struck dead by heaven great god how i understood your story of her prayers and it was iit was i he turned on latimer with a kind of ferocity you have crucified me he cried out let that comfort you you have crucified me by her side that i might see her diethat i might hear her low little piteous voicethat i might see her throes and terrors and i love herand remember every look of her loving childs eyesevery curve and quiver of her mouth through all the years i have been crucified knowing i had earned all that i felt latimer moved across the room putting the table between them he went and stood by the mantel a murmur of impatient applause from the audience came through the door you loved her he said standing with his hand holding something in his breast and i loved you she was the one brightness of my life when i was a boy and you were its one brightness when i was a man you gave me a reason for living i am not the kind of man to be my own reason i neednt tell you what you have been to me you were the one man on earth i dared to confess to i knew you would understand and that you knew what pity was baird groaned aloud he wiped the sweat from his forehead with his handkerchief as he listened i knew you were the one man i could trust i could trust you i could confide in you and talk to you about margery one day you said to me that you had learned to love her and that we might have been brothers when i was left free i had but one thought baird said to return to herto atone so far as atonement could beto pray of her upon my knees but she was deadshe was dead yes she was dead and i had no one left to talk to about her you were my one comfort and support and friend he drew his hand out of his breast baird started and then stood quite quiet the hand held a pistol are you going to kill me he said you know i asked you that once before no said latimer i am not going to kill you i am going to kill the man who loved you and found you his reason for living its all done with no no shrieked baird and he hurled himself across the table like a madman no you are not no latimer no god no they were struggling togetherbaird hung to his arm and tried to drag the pistol from his grasp but it was no use latimers long illhung limbs were the stronger his fixed face did not change but he wrenched himself free and flung baird across the room he set the pistol against his heart and pulled the trigger he gave something like a leap and fell down the door opened for the returning member of the committee and the impatient applause of the audience came through it almost a roar baird was struggling to rise as if his fall had stunned him latimer was stretched at full length quite dead chapter xl tom walked up the staircase pondering deeply the de willoughby claim was before the house judge rutherford was making his great speech and the chief claimant might have been expected to be sitting breathless in one of the galleries but he was not he was going to baird who had sent for him and baird was sitting in the room in which latimer lay dead with a bullet in his heart he had been sitting there for hours and when tom had arrived at the house he had been told that baird had asked that he should be taken to him in the deathchamber he was sitting on a chair by the bed on which latimer was stretched rigid with a still face which looked like a mask of yellow wax appearing above the exceeding freshness of the turneddown linen sheet baird did not move as tom entered but continued to gaze at the dread thing with dull drooping eyes tom went to him and laid his hand on his shoulder he saw the man was stupefied theres nothing to say baird he said after a silence when it comes to this there is something for me to say baird answered very quietly i want to say it before him while he lies there i wonder if he will hear he may it would not do any good to anyone if he did baird said the blackness of it all lies in thatthat he would not be helped she would not be helpedi should not she said tom baird got up at once stiffly and unsteadily he stood upright the lithelimbed slender form which was so much admired upon the platform held rigidly his face looked lined and haggard no other man shall feel an affection for mei think you are beginning to feel an affection for meunder a false impression that man loved me for long years and i loved him i think i helped him to something that was as near happiness as his nature would allow him to feel god knows i owed it to him i was one of those who repented too late that is why i have preached of repentance i have done it with a secret frenzied hope did he know your reason asked tom not until last night when he knew it he killed himself because began tom because he had loved and trusted me for half a lifetimebecause i was the one human creature to whom he had confided the tragedy of his lifeknowing he would be sure of comprehension and sympathy it was to me he poured forth the story of that poor child you saw her die she was his sister and i tom turned and looked at the face of the dead man and then slowly to the face of the living one who stood before him youwere the man he said yes tom turned to the dead man again he put his big warm hand with a curiously suggestive movementa movement somehow suggesting protectionupon the stiff clasped fingers no poor fellow he said as if speaking to him youno no there was nothing but thisfor you god have mercy on us no said baird there was nothing else for him i know that everything was whirled away i had hours last night thinking there is nothing else for me perhaps there is not but first i shall take his body back to his mother i must tell her lies this is the result of an accident that is what i shall tell her she is a little old woman who will not live long i must take care of herand let her talk to me about her son who loved meand her daughter he began to walk up and down the room a man does not livefor fifteen yearsside by side with anotherthat other loving him whollyand see the blackness of his own deed laid bareand hear again and again of the woe he has wroughthe does not live so in peace no answered tom i tell you wildlyi tell you there have been hoursas he has talked to me of herwhen the cold sweat has stood upon my flesh he came back to tom he was frantic with agonised restlessness in all the cruelty of it he cried there seems to have been one human pitying soul it was yours you were tender to her in those last hours you were mercifulyou held her hand when she died yes said tom in a somewhat husky voice since he remembered it so well she was frightened her little hand was cold i took it in mine and told her not to be afraid baird flung out his own hand with a movement of passionate feelingthen let it fall at his side we shall not meet again he said you will not want to see me big tom gave him a long steady look good lord man he said after it am i the man to judge another ive made nothing of life you have done no creature a wrong baird said and you have helped some to happiness well admitted big tom perhaps thats true but ive been a lumbering failure myself ive just judgment enough now to know that theres nothing a man can say about a thing like thisnothingand just sense enough not to try to say it if you go back to north carolina asked baird may i come to see youand to see her she need never know i shouldnt want her to know tom answered but you may come we shall go back and i intend to let those two young ones set up a garden of eden of their own it will be a good thing to look on at yes you may come that is mercifulness said baird and this time when he put out his hand he did not withdraw it and tom gave it a strong sober clasp which expressed more than one emotion when tom returned to the little house near dupont circle uncle matt wore a rigidly repressed air as he opened the door and miss burford stood in the hall as if waiting for something her ringlets were shaken by a light tremor we have either won the claim this afternoon or lost it tom said to himself having glanced at both of them and exchanged the usual greeting they had won it judge rutherford was striding up and down the sittingroom but it was sheba who was deputed to tell the news she did it in a little scene which reminded him of her childhood she drew him to a chair and sat down on his knee clasping both slim tender arms round his neck tears suddenly rushing into her eyes you and rupert are rich men uncle tom darling she said the claim has passed you are rich you need never be troubled about mortgages again he was conscious of a tremendous shock of relief he folded her in his arms as if she had been a baby thank the lord he said i didnt know i should be so glad of it chapter xli the unobtrusive funeral cortege had turned the corner of bank street and disappeared from view almost an hour ago in the front room of the house in which had lived the man just carried to his grave the gentle old woman who had been his mother sat and looked with pathetic patience at miss amory starkweather as the rough winds of the new england early spring rushed up the empty thoroughfare and whirled through the yet unleafed trees miss amory had remained after the other people had gone away and she was listening to the wind too we are both old women she had said we have both lived long enough to have passed through afternoons like this more than once before howsoever bad other hours may be it seems to me that these are always the worst just aftereverythinghas been taken away mrs latimer said now the house seems so empty faith tremulously even faith cant help you not to feel that everything has gonesuch a long long way off she did not wipe away the tear that fell on her cheek she looked very small and meek in her deep mourning she presented to miss amorys imagination the figure of a lovable child grown old without having lost its child temperament but i must not complain she went on with an effort to smile at miss amorys ugly old intelligently sympathetic countenance it must have been all over in a second and he could have felt no pain at all death by accident is always an awful shock to those left behind but it must scarcely be like death tothose who go he was quite well he had just bought the pistol and took it out to show to mr baird mr baird himself did not understand how it happened it is nearly always sothat no one quite sees how it is done miss amory answered do not let yourself think of it she was sitting quite near to mrs latimer and she leaned forward and put her hand over the cold little shrivelled one lying on the lap of the mourningdress though it was so sudden she said it was an end not unlike margerysthe slipping out of life without realising that the last hour had come yes i have thought that too she looked up at the portrait on the wallthe portrait of the bright girlface her own face lighted into a smile it is so strange to think that they are together again she said they will have so much to tell each other yes said miss amory yes she got up herself and went and stood before the picture mrs latimer rose and came and stood beside her mr baird has been with me every day she said he has been like a son to me a carriage drew up before the house and as the occupant got out both women turned to look mrs latimer turned a shade paler they have got back from the funeral she said it is mr baird then came the ring at the front door the footsteps in the passage and baird came into the room he was haggard and looked broken and old but his manner was very gentle when he went to the little old woman and took her hands i think he scarcely knew he had so many friends at janneys mills he said a great many of them came when i turned away the earth was covered with flowers he drew her to a chair and sat by her she put her white head on his arm and cried he was always so sad she said he thought people never cared for him but he was goodhe was good i felt sure they must love him a little it will be better for himnow miss amory spoke from her place before the fire where she stood rigidly with a baffled look on her face her voice was low and hoarse yes she said with eager pitifulness it will be better now the little mother lifted her wet face still clinging to bairds arm as she looked up at him and i have it to remember she sobbed that youyou were his friend and that for years you made him happier than he had ever been he said you gave him a reason for living baird was ashen pale she stooped and softly kissed the back of his hand somehow she said you seemed even to comfort him for margery he seemed to bear it better after he knew you i shall not feel as if they were quite gone away from me while i can talk to you about them you will spare an hour now and then to come and sit with me she looked round the plain respectable little room with a quiet finality i am too old and tired to live long she added it was baird who kissed her hand now with a fervour almost passion miss amory started at sight of his action and at the sound of the voice in which he spoke talk to me as you would have talked to him he said think of me as you would have thought of him let mein gods name let me do what there is left me miss amorys carriage had waited before the gate and when she went out to it baird went with her after he had put her into it he stood a moment on the pavement and looked at her i want to come with you he said may i yes she answered and made room for him at her side but he took the seat opposite to her and leaned back shutting his eyes while miss amorys rested upon him the life and beauty which had been such everpresent characteristics of his personality seemed to have left him never to return miss amorys old nerves were strung taut she had passed through many phases of feeling with regard to him as the years had gone by during those years she had believed that she knew a hidden thing of him known by no other person she had felt herself a sort of silent detective in the form of an astute old new england gentlewoman she had abhorred and horribly pitied him she had the clear judicial mind which must inevitably see the tragic pitifulness of things she had thought too much to be able to indulge in the primitive luxury of unqualified condemnation as she watched him today during their drive through the streets she realised that she beheld a kind of suffering not coming under the head of any ordinary classification it was a hopeless ghastly thing a breaking up of life a tearing loose of all the cords to which a man might anchor his existence when they reached the house and entered the parlour she went to her chair and sat downand waited she knew she was waiting and believed she knew what for in a vague way she had always felt that an hour like this would come to them they were somehow curiously akin baird began to walk to and fro his lips were trembling presently he turned towards the rigid figure in the chair and stood still it was not an accident he said he killed himself that i felt sure of miss amory answered tell me why he did it baird began to tremble a little himself yes i will he said i must i supposethere is a sort of hysteric luxury inconfession he did it because there was nothing else left the foundations of his world had been torn from under his feet everything was gone his voice broke into a savage cry oh in one short lifetimethe black misery a man can bring about yes said miss amory he threw himself into a chair near her for yearsyears he said he hid a secret miss amory bent forward she felt she must help him a littlefor pitys sake was it the secret of margery she half whispered did you know it when a woman has spent a long life alone thinkingthinking she answered she has had time to learn to observe and to work at problems the day she fainted in the street and i took her home in my carriage i began to fearto guess she was not only a girl who was illshe was a child who was being killed with some horror she was heartbreaking i used to go and see her in the end i knew idid not he said looking at her with haggard eyes there was a long pause she knew he had told her all in the one sentenceall she had guessed she did not know i knew she went on presently she believed no one knew oh i tell you again she was heartbreaking she did not know that there were wild moments when she dropped words that could be linked into facts and formed into a chain had you formed it he asked when you wrote and told me she had died yes it had led me to youto nothing more i felt death had saved her from what would have been worse it seemed as ifthe blackest devilwould be glad to know i am the blackest devil perhaps he said with stony helplessness but when i received your letter i was grovelling on my knees praying that i might get back to herand atoneas far as a black devil could and she was dead said miss amory wringing her hands together on her lap deaddead she stopped suddenly and turned on him he killed himself she cried because he found out that it was you yes i was the one man he lovedhe had told his secret to meto methe black devil nownow i must go to his mother day after day and be her sonbecause i was his friendand knew his love for margeryand of her sweetnessand her happy peaceful death he used to talk to me for hours shepoor tender soulwill talk to me againof margerymargerymargeryand of lucien whose one happiness i was it willalmostbeenough said miss amory slowly yes he answered it will almost be enougheven for a black devil and he turned on his chair and laid his face on his folded arms and sobbed like a woman chapter xlii the springtime sunshine had been smiling upon talbots crossroads all the day it was not hot but warm and its beauty was added to by the little soft winds which passed through the branches of the blossoming apple and pear trees and shook the fragrance from them the brown earth was sweet and odorous as it had been on the sunday morning sheba had knelt and kissed it and the garden had covered itself as then with hyacinths and daffodils and white narcissus during the last weeks the crossroads had existed in something like a state of delirium people rode in from the mountains and returned to their homes after hours of conversation semistupefied with enjoyment tom dwillerby had won his claims after months of mystified discouragement in which the crossroads seemed to have lost him in a vague and distant darkness life had seemed to begin again nobody was sufficiently analytical of mind to realise in what measure big tom dwillerby had been the centre of the community which was scattered over miles of mountain road and wood and clearing but when he had disappeared many things seemed to melt away with him in fact a large shrewd humanity was missing ill be doggered had been a remark of mr dotys in the autumn ef crops hes done es well sence he went there had been endless talk of the villanous tendencies of government officials and of the tricks played whose end was to defraud honest and longsuffering claimants of their rights there had even been dark hours when it had seemed possible that the vitiating effect of washington life might cause deterioration in the character of even the most upright could tom himself stand it and what would be its effect on sheba but when the outlook was the most inauspicious fortunes wheel had swept round once and all was changed a letter brought the newsa simple enough letter from tom himself the claim was won they were coming back to hamlin county he and sheba and rupert de willoughby sheba and rupert were to be married and spend the first weeks of their honeymoon on the side of the mountain which had enclosed the world the child sheba had first known on this particular day every man and woman who had known and played with her appeared at the crossroads there had not been a large number of them perhaps but gathered together at and about the postoffice and about the house and garden they formed a crowd as crowds are counted in scattered communities they embodied excitement enough to have exhilarated a much larger body of people half a dozen women had been helping aunt mornin for days the house wore a gala air and the cellar was stored with offerings of cake and homemade luxuries the garden was a mass of radiant scented bloom of spring mis doty sat at the open window of the kitchen and looking out on nodding daffodils appleblossom and pink peachflower warmed in the sun actually chuckled as she joyfully sniffled the air the way them things smells she said an the hummin o them bees goin about as ef the world hadnt nothin but flowers an honey in it seems like it was all jest got up for them two young uns lordy i do declar its a plum sight that bin a heap got up for em seems like said molly hollister smiling at the nearest appletree as if it were a particular friend fust off theyre dead in love

sheba as tom took me to look at lyin in her little old wooden cradle in the room behind the store she laughed as she said it a little hysteric laugh with suddenly moist eyes she was an emotional creature the road had been watched steadily for many hours before any arrival could have been legitimately expected it gave restless interestsomething to do at noon one of molly hollisters boys came running breathlessly up the road waving his hat theyre acomin he shouted theyre acomin theyre in a fine carriage let tom dwillerby alone for havin the finest team in hamlin said mr doty with a neighbourly grin almost immediately the carriage was to be seen the horses lifted their feet high and stepped at a pace which was felt worthy of the occasion uncle matt drove rupert and sheba sat side by side they looked very young and beautiful and rather shy they had only been married a few hours and were bewildered by the new radiance of things big tom humanely endeavoured not to look at them but found it difficult to avert his eyes for any length of time there was that about them which drew his gaze back in spite of himself thats old tom he heard familiar voices proclaim as they drew near the postoffice howdy tom howdy sheby wish ye much joy wish ye much joy then the horses stopped and the crowd of longknown faces surged near and were all about the carriage the clamour of the greeting voices the grasping of one hand after another seemed to sheba and rupert like something happening in a dream they were too far away from earth to feel it real just now though it was part of the happiness of thingslike the sunshine and the soft wind and the look in toms eyes when amid handshakes and congratulations and welcoming laughter he himself laughed back in his old way ye look jest like ye used ter tomjest like ye used ter cried jake doty ye haint changed a durned bit how did the day pass who knows what does it matter it was full of strange beauty and strange happiness and strange life for two young souls at least people came and went congratulating wondering rejoicing talbots crossroads felt that it had vicariously come into the possession of wealth and dignity of position among the many visitors mrs stamps rode up on a claybank mare she was attired in the black calico ridingskirt and sunbonnet which represented the mourning garb of the mountain relict im a widder she said to big tom in a tone not unresigned ye got yer claim through but stamps hadnt no influence an he was took off by pneumony ketched cold runnin to linthicum i guess his landlady was a honest enough critter she found a roll o five hundred dollars hid in his bed when she went to lay him out an she sent it back to me lord knows whar he got it fromi dont but it come in mighty handy by sunset the welcoming crowd had broken up and melted away into the mountains horses and oxwaggons had been mounted and ridden or driven homeward the postoffice was closed no one was to be seen in the porch no one was to be seen anywhere except in the garden among the blossoms where rupert and sheba walked under the fragrance of the trees talking to each other in low softly broken words tom sat in the porch and watched the moon rise in a sea of silver the scents the wind wafted to him the occasional sound of a faroff nightbird the rustle of the leaves brought things back to himthings he had felt in his youth there had been nights like this in the days when he had been a big clumsy young fellow wild with hopeless love for delia vanuxem on such nights the air had been full of this night breath of flowers the birds had stirred in their nests with just such sounds the moon had mounted as it did tonight higher and higher in a sky it thrilled a mans soul to lift his face to yes it was all like this he said leaning back and clasping his big hands behind his head just like this and those two out there are living it over again only theyve been fairly treated and they are trembling with the joy of it theyre pretty safe he ended theyre pretty safe theyve had a fair show rupert and sheba walked slowly side by side they saw and felt everything if a bird stirred with a sleepy sound they stopped to listen and smiled tremulously at each other more than once sheba knelt down and hid her face among the flowers kissing them her arms were full of white blossoms she and rupert had made white garlands for her hair and waist such as she had worn the night he had first seen her standing on her little balcony when rupert held her to his side the scent from their crushed petals filled the air they breathed the early night was at its stillest and fairest and the moonlight seemed to flood all the world when sheba stopped and looked up speaking softly shall we go now she said the moon will be shining down between the pines it will be so quiet yes he answered let us go now they had planned weeks ago the things they were going to do they were going to say goodnight to the small mound at blairs hollow when they left their horses at the foot of the hill even the pines could not look darkly under the fair light the balmy air passing through their branches made a sound as if it was hushing a child to sleep the little mound lay in the soft brightness of clear moonbeams sheba knelt beside it and began to lay her bridal blossoms on the grasscovered earth rupert stood and watched her his heart beat with a reverent rapturous tremor she looked like a young angel she bent down and laid her cheek upon the grass her arm was thrown out as if she clasped something to her girls breast she spoke in a whisperthrilled with love i am happy she said i am happy oh do you hear do you hear
