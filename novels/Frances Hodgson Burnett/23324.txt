surly tim a lancashire story by frances hodgson burnett copyright sorry to hear my fellowworkmen speak so disparagin o me well mester thats as it may be yo know happen my fellowworkmen ha made a bit o a mistakehappen what seems loike crustiness to them beant so much crustiness as summat elsehappen i mought do my bit o complainin too yo munnot trust aw yo hear mester thats aw i can say i looked at the mans bent face quite curiously and judging from its rather heavy but still not unprepossessing outline i could not really call it a bad face or even a sulky one and yet both managers and hands had given me a bad account of tim hibblethwaite surly tim they called him and each had something to say about his sullen disposition to silence and his short answers not that he was accused of anything like misdemeanor but he was glum loike the factory people said and a surly fellow well deserving his name as the master of his room had told me i had come to lancashire to take the control of my fathers spinningfactory a short time before being anxious to do my best toward the hands and i often talked to one and another in a friendly way so that i could the better understand their grievances and remedy them with justice to all parties concerned so in conversing with men women and children i gradually found out that tim hibblethwaite was in bad odor and that he held himself doggedly aloof from all and this was how in the course of time i came to speak to him about the matter and the opening words of my story are the words of his answer but they did not satisfy me by any means i wanted to do the man justice myself and see that justice was done to him by others and then again when after my curious look at him he lifted his head from his work and drew the back of his hand across his warm face i noticed that he gave his eyes a brush and glancing at him once more i recognized the presence of a moisture in them in my anxiety to conceal that i had noticed anything unusual i am afraid i spoke to him quite hurriedly i was a young man then and by no means as selfpossessed as i ought to have been i hope you wont misunderstand me hibblethwaite i said i dont mean to complainindeed i have nothing to complain of for foxley tells me you are the steadiest and most orderly hand he has under him but the fact is i should like to make friends with you all and see that no one is treated badly and somehow or other i found out that you were not disposed to feel friendly towards the rest and i was sorry for it but i suppose you have some reason of your own the man bent down over his work again silent for a minute to my discomfiture but at last he spoke almost huskily thank yo mester he said yore a koindly chap or yo wouldnt ha noticed an yore not fur wrong either i ha reasons o my own tho im loike to keep em to mysen most o toimes th fellows as throws their slurs on me would na understond em if i were loike to gab which i never were but happen th toime ll come when surly tim ll tell his own tale though i often think its loike it wunnot come till th day o judgment i hope it will come before then i said cheerfully i hope the time is not far away when we shall all understand you hibblethwaite i think it has been misunderstanding so far which has separated you from the rest and it cannot last always you know but he shook his headnot after a surly fashion but as i thought a trifle sadly or heavilyso i did not ask any more questions or try to force the subject upon him but i noticed him pretty closely as time went on and the more i saw of him the more fully i was convinced that he was not so surly as people imagined he never interfered with the most active of his enemies nor made any reply when they taunted him and more than once i saw him perform a silent halfsecret act of kindness once i caught him throwing half his dinner to a wretched little lad who had just come to the factory and worked near him and once again as i was leaving the building on a rainy night i came upon him on the stone steps at the door bending down with an almost pathetic clumsiness to pin the woolen shawl of a poor little mite who like so many others worked with her shiftless father and mother to add to their weekly earnings it was always the poorest and least cared for of the children whom he seemed to befriend and very often i noticed that even when he was kindest in his awkward man fashion the little waifs were afraid of him and showed their fear plainly the factory was situated on the outskirts of a thriving country town near manchester and at the end of the lane that led from it to the more thickly populated part there was a path crossing a field to the pretty church and churchyard and this path was a short cut homeward for me being so pretty and quiet the place had a sort of attraction for me and i was in the habit of frequently passing through it on my way partly because it was pretty and quiet perhaps and partly i have no doubt because i was inclined to be weak and melancholy at the time my health being broken down under hard study it so happened that in passing here one night and glancing in among the graves and marble monuments as usual i caught sight of a dark figure sitting upon a little mound under a tree and resting its head upon its hands and in this sadlooking figure i recognized the muscular outline of my friend surly tim he did not see me at first and i was almost inclined to think it best to leave him alone but as i half turned away he stirred with something like a faint moan and then lifted his head and saw me standing in the bright clear moonlight whos theer he said dost ta want owt it is only doncaster hibblethwaite i returned as i sprang over the low stone wall to join him what is the matter old fellow i thought i heard you groan just now yo mought ha done mester he answered heavily happen tha did i dunnot know mysen nowts th matter though as i knows on ony im a bit out o soarts he turned his head aside slightly and began to pull at the blades of grass on the mound and all at once i saw that his hand was trembling nervously it was almost three minutes before he spoke again that un belongs to me he said suddenly at last pointing to a longer mound at his feet an this little un signifying with an indescribable gesture the small one upon which he sat poor fellow i said i see now a little lad o mine he said slowly and tremulously a little lad o mine anan his mother what i exclaimed i never knew that you were a married man tim he dropped his head upon his hand again still pulling nervously at the grass with the other th law says i beant mester he answered in a painful strained fashion i conna tell mysen what godamoighty ud say about it i dont understand i faltered you dont mean to say the poor girl never was your wife hibblethwaite thats what th law says slowly i thowt different mysen an so did th poor lass thats whats the matter mester thats th trouble the other nervous hand went up to his bent face for a minute and hid it but i did not speak there was so much of strange grief in his simple movement that i felt words would be out of place it was not my dogged inexplicable hand who was sitting before me in the bright moonlight on the babys grave it was a man with a hidden history of some tragic sorrow long kept secret in his homely breastperhaps a history very few of us could read aright i would not question him though i fancied he meant to explain himself i knew that if he was willing to tell me the truth it was best that he should choose his own time for it and so i let him alone and before i had waited very long he broke the silence himself as i had thought he would it wur welly about six year ago i comn here he said more or less welly about six year i wur a quiet chap then mester an had na many friends but i had more than i ha now happen i wur better naterd but just as loike i wur loighterheartedbut thats nowt to do wi it i had na been here more than a

th eend id loike some one to know i ha meant no hurt when i seemed grum an surly it wurna illwill but a heavy heart he stopped here and his head drooped upon his hands again and for a minute or so there was another dead silence such a story as this needed no comment i could make none it seemed to me that the poor fellows sore heart could bear none at length he rose from the turf and stood up looking out over the graves into the soft light beyond with a strange wistful sadness well i mun go now he said slowly goodneet mester goodneet an thank yo fur listenin good night i returned adding in an impulse of pity that was almost a passion and god help you thank yo again mester he said and then turned away and as i sat pondering i watched his heavy drooping figure threading its way among the dark mounds and white marble and under the shadowy trees and out into the path beyond i did not sleep well that night the strained heavy tones of the mans voice were in my ears and the homely yet tragic story seemed to weave itself into all my thoughts and keep me from rest i could not get it out of my mind in consequence of this sleeplessness i was later than usual in going down to the factory and when i arrived at the gates i found an unusual bustle there something out of the ordinary routine had plainly occurred for the whole place was in confusion there was a crowd of hands grouped about one corner of the yard and as i came in a man ran against me and showed me a terribly pale face i ax pardon mester doncaster he said in a wild hurry but theers an accident happened one o th weavers is hurt bad an im goin fur th doctor th loom caught an crushed him afore we could stop it for some reason or other my heart misgave me that very moment i pushed forward to the group in the yard corner and made my way through it a man was lying on a pile of coats in the middle of the bystandersa poor fellow crushed and torn and bruised but lying quite quiet now only for an occasional little moan that was scarcely more than a quick gasp for breath it was surly tim hes nigh th eend o it now said one of the hands pityingly hes nigh th last now poor chap whats that hes savin lads for all at once some flickering sense seemed to have caught at one of the speakers words and the wounded man stirred murmuring faintlybut not to the watchers ah no to something far far beyond their feeble human sightto something in the broad without th eend he said aye this is th eend dear lass an th paths aw shinin or summat anwhy lass i can see thee plain an th little chap too another flutter of the breath one slight movement of the mangled hand and i bent down closer to the poor fellowcloser because my eyes were so dimmed that i could not see lads i said aloud a few seconds later you can do no more for him his pain is over for with a sudden glow of light which shone upon the shortened path and the waiting figures of his child and its mother surly tims earthly trouble had ended
