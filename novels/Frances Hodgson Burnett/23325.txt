seth by frances hodgson burnett copyright he came in one evening at sun set with the empty coaltrainhis dull young face pale and heavyeyed with weariness his corduroy suit dusty and travelstained his worldly possessions tied up in the smallest of handkerchief bundles and slung upon the stick resting on his shoulderand naturally his first appearance attracted some attention among the loungers about the shed dignified by the title of depot i say naturally because arrivals upon the trains to black creek were so scarce as to be regarded as curiosities which again might be said to be natural the line to the mines had been in existence two months since the english company had taken them in hand and pushed the matter through with an energy startling to and not exactly approved by the majority of good east tennesseeans after the first week or so of arrivalsprincipally welsh and english miners with an occasional irishmanthe trains had returned daily to the creek without a passenger and accordingly this one created some trifling sensation not that his outward appearance was particularly interesting or suggestive of approaching excitement he was only a lad of nineteen or twenty in working englishcut garb and with a short awkward figure and a troubled homely facea face so homely and troubled in fact that its halfbewildered look was almost pathetic he advanced toward the shed hesitatingly and touched his cap as if half in clumsy courtesy and half in timid appeal mesters he said goodday to yo the company bestirred themselves with one accord and to the roughest and most laconic gave him a brief goodday youre english said a goodnatured welshman arnt you my lad ay mester was the reply im fro lancashire he sat down on the edge of the rough platform and laid his stick and bundle down in a slow wearied fashion fro lancashire he repeated in a voice as wearied as his actionfro th deepton coalmines theer youll know th name on em i ha no doubt th same company owns em as owns these what said an outsiderlangley an em the boy turned himself round and nodded ay he answeredthem that was why i comn here i comn to get work frofro him he faltered in his speech oddly and even reddened a little at the same time rubbing his hands together with a nervousness which seemed habitual to him mester edard i mean he addedth young mester as is here i heerd as he liked merika anan i comn the loungers glanced at each other and their glance did not mean high appreciation of the speakers intellectual powers there was a lack of practicalness in such faith in another man as expressed itself in the wistful hesitant voice did he say hed give you work asked the first man who had questioned him the welshman evans no i dunnot thinki dunnot think hed know me if he seed me theer wur so many on us another exchange of glances and then another question where are you going to stay the homely face reddened more deeply and the lads eyesdull soft almost womanish eyesraised themselves to the speakers do yo knew anybody as would be loikely to tak me in a bit he said until i ha toime to earn th wage to pay i wouldna wrong no mon a penny as had trusted me there was manifest hesitation and then some one spoke lancashire jack might mester said the lad to evans would you moind speakin a word fur me i ha had a long tramp an im faggedloike anhe stopped and rose from his seat with a hurried movement whos that theer as is comin he demanded isna it th young mester the some one in question was a young man on horseback who at that moment turned the corner and rode toward the shed with a loose rein allowing his horse to choose his own pace ay said the lad with an actual tremor in his excited voiceits him sure enow and sank back on his seat again as if he had found himself scarcely strong enough to stand ii ha not aten much fur two or three days he said to evans there was not a man on the platform who did not evince some degree of pleasure at the approach of the newcomer the last warm rays of the sun already sinking behind the mountains seemed rather to take pride in showing what a debonair young fellow he was in glowing kindly upon his handsome face and strong graceful figure and touching up to greater brightness his bright hair the face was one to be remembered with a sentiment approaching gratitude for the mere existence of such genial and unspoiled good looks but the voice that addressed the men was one to be loved and loved without stint it was so clear and lighthearted and frank boys said he goodevening to you evans if you could spare me a minute evans rose at once ill speak to him he said to the lad at his side his word will go further with lancashire jack than mine would he went to the horses side and stood there for a few minutes talking in an undertone and then he turned to the stranger and beckoned come here he said the lad took up his bundle and obeyed the summons advancing with an awkward almost stumbling step suggestive of actual weakness as well as the extremity of shyness reaching the two men he touched his cap humbly and stood with timorous eyes upraised to the young mans face langley met his glance with a somewhat puzzled look which presently passed away in a light laugh im trying to remember who you are my lad he said but i shall be obliged to give it up i know your face i think but i have no recollection of your name i dare say i have seen you often enough you came from deepton evans tells me ay mester fro deepton a long journey for a lad like you to take alone with inward pity for the heavy face ay mester and now you want work if you please mester well well cheerily we will give it to you theres work enough though it isnt such as you had at deepton what is your name seth mesterseth raynor shifting the stick and bundle in uneasy eagerness from one shoulder to another an im used to hard work mester it wur na easy work we had at th deepton mine an im stronger than i look its th faggedness as makes me tremblyan hunger hunger i ha not tasted sin th neet afore last shamefacedly i hadna th money to buy an it seemt loike i could howd out hold out echoed langley in some excitement thats a poor business my lad here come with me the other matter can wait evans the downcast face and ungainly figure troubled him in no slight degree as they moved off together they seemed to express in some indescribable fashion so much of dull and patient pain and they were so much at variance with the free grandeur of the scene surrounding them it was as if a new element were introduced into the very air itself black creek was too young yet to have known hunger or actual want of any kind the wild things on the mountain sides had scarcely had time to learn to fear the invaders of their haunts or understand that they were to be driven backward the warm wind was fragrant with the keen freshness of pine and cedar mountain and forest and sky were stronger than the human stragglers they closed around and shut out from the world we dont see anything like that in lancashire said langley that kind of thing is new to us my lad isnt it with a light gesture toward the mountain in whose side the workers had burrowed ay mester raising troubled eyes to its grandeuriverythings new i feel aw lost sometoimes an fearedloike langley lifted his hat from his brow to meet a little passing breeze and as it swept softly by he smiled in the enjoyment of its coolness afraid he said i dont understand that i dunnot see into it mysen mester happen its th bigness an quiet an th lonely look an happen its summat wrong in mysen ive lived in th cool an smoke an crowd an work so long as it troubles me in a manner toto ha to look so high does it said langley a few faint lines showing themselves on his forehead thats a queer fancy so high turning his glance upward to where the tallest pine swayed its dark plume against the clear blue well so it is but you will get used to it in time shaking off a rather unpleasant sensation happen so mester in toime was the simple answer and then silence fell upon them again they had not very far to go the houses of the minersrough shanties hurriedly erected to supply immediate needswere most of them congregated together or at most stood at short distances from each other the larger ones signifying the presence ol feminine members in a family and perhaps two or three juvenile pioneersthe smaller ones being occupied by younger miners who lived in couples or sometimes even alone before one of the larger shanties langley reined in his horse a lancashire man lives here he said and i am going to leave you with him in answer to his summons a woman came to the doora young woman whose rather unresponsive face wakened somewhat when she saw who waited feyther she called out its mester langley an hes getten a stranger wi him feyther approaching the door showed himself a burly individual with traces of coaldust in all comers not to be reached by hurried and not too fastidious ablutions clouds of tobaccosmoke preceded and followed him and much stale incense from the fragrant weed exhaled itself from his wellworn corduroys i ha not nivver seed him afore he remarked after a gruff by no meansillnatured greeting signifying the stranger by a duck of the head in his direction a lancashire lad janner answered langley i want a home for him janner regarded him with evident interest but shook his head dubiously ax th missus he remarked succinctly dunnot ax me langleys goodhumored laugh had a touch of conscious power in it if it depended upon th missus he was safe enough his bright good looks and gay grace of manner never failed with the women the most practical and uncompromising melted however unwillingly before his sunshine and the suggestion of chivalric deference which seemed a second nature with him so it was easy enough to parley with th missus a lancashire lad mrs janner he said and so i know youll take care of him lancashire folk have a sort of fellow feeling for each other you see that was why i could not make up my mind to leave him until i saw him in good hands and yours are good ones give him a square meal as soon as possible he added in a lower voice i will be accountable for him myself when he lifted his hat and rode away the group watched him until he was almost out of sight the general sentiment expressing itself in every countenance theers summat noice about that theer young chap janner remarked with the slowness of a man who was rather mystified by the fascination under whose influence he found himselfsummat as goes wi th grain loike ay answered his wife so theer is an its natur too coom along in lad to seth an ha summat to eat yo look faintish black creek found him a wonderfully quiet member of society the lad seth he came and went to and from the mine with mechanical regularity working with the rest taking his meals with the janners and sleeping in a small shanty left vacant by the desertion of a young miner who had found life at the settlement too monotonous to suit his tastes no new knowledge of his antecedents was arrived at he had come fro deepton and that was the beginning and end of the matter in fact his seemed to be a peculiarly silent nature he was fond of being alone and spent most of his spare time in the desolate little shanty attempts at conversation appeared to trouble him it was discovered and accordingly he was left to himself as not worth the cultivating why does na tha talk more demanded janners daughter who was a strong brusque young woman with a sharp tongue i ha not gotten nowt to say was the meekly deprecating response miss janner regarding the humble face with some impatience remarkably enough found nothing to deride in it though being neither a beauty nor in her first bloom and sharp of tongue as i have said she was somewhat given to derision as a rule in truth the uncomplaining patience in the dull soft eyes made her feel a little uncomfortable i dunnot know what ails thee she remarked with unceremonious candor but theers summat as does its nowt as can be cured said the lad and turned his quiet face away in his silent fashion he evinced a certain degree of partially for his hosts daughter occasionally after his meals he lingered for a few moments watching her at her work when she was alone sitting by the fire or near the door and regarding her businesslike movements with a wistful air of wonder and admiration and yet so unobtrusive were these mute attentions that bess janner was never roused to any form of resentment of them thas goin to ha a sweetheart at last my lass was one of janners favorite witticisms but bess bore it with characteristic coolness im noan as big a foo as i look she would say an i dunnot moind him no more nor if he wus a wench hissen small as was the element of female society at black creek this young woman was scarcely popular she was neither fair nor fond a predominance of muscle and a certain rough deftness of hand were her chief charms ordinary sentiment would have been thrown away upon her and fortunately she was spared it shes noan hurt wi good looks our bess her father remarked with graceful chivalrousness on more than one occasion but hoo con heave amost as much as i con an thats summat consequently it did not seem likely that the feeling she had evidently awakened in the breast of their lodger was akin to the tender passion am i in yore way he would ask apologetically and the answer was invariably a gracious if curt one nono more than th cat stay wheer yo are lad an make yoresen comfortable there came a change however in the nature of their intercourse but this did not occur until the lad had been with them some three months for several days he had been ailing and unlike himself he had been even more silent than usual he had eaten little and lagged on his way to and from his work he looked thinner and his step was slow and uncertain there was so great an alteration in him in fact that bess softened toward him visibly she secretly bestowed the best morsels upon him and even went so far as to attempt conversation let yore work go a bit she advised yore noan fit fur it but he did not give up until the third week of illness and then one warm day at noon bess at work in her kitchen among dishes and pans was startled from her labors by his appearing at the door and staggering toward her whats up wi yo she demanded yo look loike death i dunnot know he faltered and then staggering again caught at her dress with feeble hands dunnot yo he whispered sinking forward dunnot yo let no onecome anigh me she flung a strong arm around him and saved him from a heavy fall his head dropped helplessly against her breast hes fainted dead away she said he mun ha been worse than he thowt fur she laid him down and loosening his clothes at the throat went for water but a few minutes after she had bent over him for the second time an exclamation which was almost a cry broke from her lord ha mercy she said and fell back losing something of color herself she had scarcely recovered herself even when after prolonged efforts she succeeded in restoring animation to the prostrate figure under her hands the heavy eyes opening met hers in piteous appeal and protest ithowt it wur death comn said the lad i wur hopin as it wur death what ha yo done as yo need wish that said bess and then her voice shaking with excitement which got the better of her and forced her to reveal herself she added ive fun out that as yove been hidin abrupt and unprefaced as her speech was it scarcely produced the effect she had expected it would her charge neither flinched nor reddened he laid a weak rough hand upon her dress with a feebly pleading touch dunnot yo turn agen me he whispered yo wouldna if yo knew but i dunnot know bess answered a trifle doggedly despite her inward relentings i comn to yo persisted the lad because i thowt yo wouldna turn agen me yo wouldna patiently again if yo knew gradually the ponderous witticism in which janner had indulged became an accepted joke in the settlement bess had fallen a victim to the tender sentiment at last she had found an adorer and had apparently succumbed to his importunities seth spent less time in his shanty and more in her society he lingered in her vicinity on all possible occasions and seemed to derive comfort from her mere presence and bess not only tolerated but encouraged him not that her manner was in the least degree effusive she rather extended a rough protection to her admirer and displayed a tendency to fight his battles and employ her sharper wit as a weapon in his behalf yo may get th best o him she said dryly once to the wit of the creek who had been jocular at his expense but yo conna get th best o me try me a bit lad im better worth yore mettle whats takken yo lass said her mother at another time yore that theer soft about th chap as theers no makkin yo out yo wur nivver loike to be soft afore somewhat testily an its noan his good looks neyther no said bessits noan his good looks happen its his lack on em then happen it is and there the discussion ended for want of material there was one person however who did not join in the jesting and this was langley when he began to understand the matter he regarded the two with sympathetic curiosity and interest why should not their primitive and uncouth love develop and form a tie to bind the homely lives together and warm and brighten them it may have been that his own mental condition at this time was such as would tend to often his heart for an innocent passion long cherished in its bud had burst into its full blooming during the months he had spent amid the novel beauty and loneliness and perhaps his new bliss subdued him somewhat always ready with a kindly word he was specially ready with it where seth was concerned he never passed him without one and frequently reined in his horse to speak to him at greater length now and then on his way home at night he stopped at the shantys door and summoning the lad detained him for a few minutes chatting in the odorous evening air it was thoroughly in accordance with the impulses of his frank and generous nature that he should endeavor to win upon him and gain his confidence we are both deepton men he would say and it is natural that we should be friends we are both alone and a long way from home but the lad was always timid and slow of speech his gratitude showed itself in ways enough but it rarely took the form of words only one night as the horse moved away he laid his hand upon the bridle and held it a moment some powerful emotion showing itself in his face and lowering his voice until it was almost a whisper mester he said if theers ivver owt to be done as is hard an loike to bring pain an danger yollyoll not forget me langley looked down at him with a mingled feeling of warm pity and deep bewilderment forget you he echoed the dullness seemed to have dropped away from the commonplace face as if it had been a veil the eyes were burning with a hungry pathos and fire and passion they were raised to his and held him with the power of an indescribable anguish dunnot forget as im here the voice growing sharp and intense ready an eager an waitin fur th toime to come let me do summat or brave summat or suffer summat for gods sake when the young man rode away it was with a sense of weight and pain upon him he was mystified people were often grateful to him but their gratitude was not such as this this oppressed and disturbed him it was suggestive of a mental condition whose existence seemed almost impossible what a life this poor fellow must have led since the simplest kindliness aroused within him such emotion as this it is hard to understand he murmured it is even a little horrible one fancies these duller natures do not reach our heights and depths of happiness and pain and yetcathie cathie my dear breaking off suddenly and turning his face upward to the broad free blue of the sky as he quickened his horses pace let me think of you this hurts me but he was drawn nearer to the boy and did his best to cheer and help him his interest in him grew as he saw him oftener and there was not only the old interest but a new one something in the lads facea something which had struck him as familiar even at firstbegan to haunt him constantly he could not rid himself of the impression it left upon him and yet he never found himself a shade nearer a solution of the mystery raynor he said to him on one of the evenings when he had stopped before the shanty i wish i knew why your face troubles me so does it trouble yo mester yes with a half laugh i think i may say it troubles me i have tried to recollect every lad in deepton and i have no remembrance of you happen not mester meekly i nivver wur much noticed yo see im one o them as foak is more loike to pass by an early train arriving next morning brought visitors to the creeka businesslike elderly gentleman and his daughter a pretty girl with large bright eyes and an innocent rosy face which became rosier and prettier than ever when mr ed ward langley advanced from the depot shed with uncovered head and extended hand cathie he said when the first greetings had been interchanged what a delight this is to me i did not hope for such happiness as this father wanted to see the mines answered cathie sweetly demure and ii wanted to see black creek your letters were so enthusiastic a day will suffice i suppose her paternal parent was wandering on amiably a man should always investigate such matters for himself i can see enough to satisfy me between now and the time for the return train i cannot whispered langley to cathie a century would not suffice if the sun would but stand still the lad seth was late for dinner that day and when he entered the house bess turned from her dishwashing to give him a sharp troubled look art tha ill again she asked nay he answered nobbut a bit tired an heavyloike he sat down upon the doorstep with wearilyclasped hands and eyes wandering toward the mountain whose pinecrowned summit towered above him he had not even yet outlived the awe of its majesty but he had learned to love it and draw comfort from its beauty and strength does tha want thy dinner asked bess no thank yo he said i couldna eat the dishwashing was deserted incontinently and bess came to the door towel in hand her expression at once softened and shaded with discontent summats hurt yo she said what is it summats hurt yo sore the laborroughened hands moved with their old nervous habit and the answer came in an odd jerky halfconnected way i dunnot know why it should ha done i mun be mad or summat i nivver had no hope nor nothin theer nivver wur no reason why i should ha had ay i mun be wrong somehow or it wouldna stick to me i this road i conna get rid on it an i conna feel as if i want to whats up wi me whats takken howd on me his voice breaking and the words ending in a sharp hysterical gasp like a sob bess wrung her towel with a desperate strength which spoke of no small degree of tempestuous feeling her brow knit itself and her lips were compressed whats happened she demanded after a pause i conna mak thee out the look that fell upon her companions face had something of shame in it his eyes left the mountain side and drooped upon his clasped hands theer wur a lass coom to look at th place today he saida lady lass wi her feytheran him she wur aw rosy red an fair white an it seemt as if she wur that happy as her laughin made th birds mock back at her he took her up th mountain an we heard em both even high up among th laurels th sound o their joy afloatin down from the height so nigh th blue sky made me sick an weakloike they wur na so gay when they comn back but her eyes wur shinin an so wur his an i heerd him say to her as foak didna know how nigh heaven th top o th mountain wur bess wrung her towel again and regarded the mountain with manifest impatience and trouble happen itll coom reet some day she said reet repeated the lad as if mechanically i hadna towd mysen as owt wur exactly wrong ony i conna see things clear i niwer could an th more i ax mysen questions th worse it gets wheerwheer could i lay th blame th blame said bess coom tha an get a bite to eat and she shook out the towel with a snap and turned away coom tha she repeated i mun get my work done that night as seth lay upon his pallet in the shanty the sound of langleys horses hoofs reached him with an accompaniment of a clear young masculine voice singing a verse of some sentimental modern carola tender song ephemeral and sweet as the sounds neared the cabin the lad sprang up restlessly and so was standing at the open door when the singer passed goodneet mester he said the singer slackened his pace and turned his bright face toward him in the moonlight waving his hand goodnight he said and pleasant dreams mine will be pleasant ones i know this has been a happy day for me raynor goodnight when the two met again the brighter face had sadly changed its beauty was marred with pain and the shadow of death lay upon it entering janners shanty the following morning seth found the family sitting around the breakfasttable in ominous silence the meal stood untouched and even bess looked pale and anxious all three glanced toward him questioningly as he approached and when he sat down janner spoke hasna tha heerd th news he asked nay seth answered i ha heerd nowt bess interposed hurriedly dunnot yo fear him feyther she said happen it isna so bad after aw four or live foak wur takken down ill last neet seth an th young mester wur among em an theers them as says its cholera it seemed as if he had not caught the full meaning of her words he only stared at her in a startled bewildered fashion cholera he repeated dully theers them as knows its cholera said janner with gloomy significance an if its cholera its death and he let his hand fall heavily upon the table ay put in mrs janner in a fretful wail fur they say as its worse i these parts than it is i englandth heat maks it worsean here we are i th midst o th summertoime an theers no knowin wheer itll end i wish thad takken my advice janner an stayed i lancashire ay i wish we wur safe at home better less wage an more safety yod niwer ha coom if yod listened to me howd thy tongue mother said bess but the words were not ungently spoken notwithstanding their bluntness dunnot let us mak it worse than it need be seth lad eat thy breakfast but there was little breakfast eaten the fact was that at the first spreading of the report a panic had seized upon the settlement and janner and his wife were by no means the least influenced by it a stolidly stubborn courage upheld bess but even she was subdued and somewhat awed i niwer heerd much about th cholera seth said to her after breakfast is this here true this as thy feyther says i dunnot know fur sure bess answered gravely but its bad enow coom out wi me into th fresh air said the lad laying his hand upon her sleeve i mun say a word or so to thee and they went out together there was no work done in the mine that day two of three new cases broke out and the terror spread itself and grew stronger in fact black creek scarcely comported itself as stoically as might have been expected a messenger was dispatched to the nearest town for a doctor and his arrival by the night train was awaited with excited impatience when he came however the matter became worse he had bad news to tell himself the epidemic had broken out in the town he had left and great fears were entertained by its inhabitants if you had not been so entirely thrown on your own resources he said i could not have come a heavy enough responsibility rested upon his shoulders during the next few weeks he had little help from the settlement those who were unstricken looked on at the progress of the disease with helpless fear few indeed escaped a slight attack and those who did were scarcely more useful than his patients in the whole place he found only two reliable and unterrified assistants his first visit was to a small farmhouse round the foot of the mountain and a short distance from the mine there he found the family huddled in a back room like a flock of frightened sheep and in the only chamber a handsome brighthaired young fellow lying upon the bed with a pinched and ominous look upon his comely face the only person with him was a lad roughly clad in miners clothesa lad who stood by chafing his hands and who turned desperate eyes to the door when it opened yore too late mester he saidyore too late but young as he wasand he was a very young manthe doctor had presence of mind and energy and he flung his whole soul and strength into the case the beauty and solitariness of his patient roused his sympathy almost as if it had been the beauty of a woman he felt drawn toward the stalwart helpless young figure lying upon the humble couch in such apparent utter loneliness he did not count much upon the lad at firsthe seemed too much bewildered and shakenbut it was not long before he changed his mind you are getting over your fear he said it wasna fear mester was the answer he received or at least it wasna fear for mysen what is your name seth ray nor mester him an me with a gesture toward the bed comn from th same place th cholera couldna fear me fro himnor nowt else if he wur i need so it was seth raynor who watched by the bedside and labored with loving care and a patience which knew no weariness until the worst was over and langley was among the convalescent the poor fellow and bess janner were my only stay the young doctor was wont to say only such care as his would have saved you and you had a close race of it as it was during the convalescence nurse and invalid were drawn together with a stronger tie through every hour wearied and weak langleys old interest in the lad became a warm affection he could scarcely bear to lose sight of the awkward boyish figure and never rested so completely as when it was by his bedside give me your hand dear fellow he would say and let me hold it i shall sleep better for knowing you are near me he fell asleep thus one morning and awakened suddenly to a consciousness of some new presence in the room seth no longer sat in the chair near his pillow but stood a little apart and surely he would have been no lover if the feeble blood had not leaped in his veins at the sight of the face bending over himthe innocent fair young face which had so haunted his pained and troubled dreams cathie he cried out aloud thegirl fell upon her knees and caught his extended hand with a passionate little gesture of love and pity i did not know she poured forth in hurried broken tones i have been away ever since the sickness broke out at home they sent me away and i only heard yesterdayfather tell him for i cannot he scarcely heard the more definite explanation he was at once so happy and so fearful sweetheart he said i can scarcely bear to think of what may come of this and yet how blessed it is to have you near me again the danger for me is all over even your dear self could not have cared for me more faithfully than i have been cared for raynor there has saved my life but cathie could only answer with a piteous remorseful jealousy why was it not i who saved it why was it not i and the place where seth had stood waiting was vacant for he had left it at the sound of langleys first joyous cry when he returned an hour or so later the more restful look langley had fancied he had seen on his face of late had faded out the old unawakened heaviness had returned he was nervous and ill at ease shrinking and conscious ive comn to say goodneet to yo he said hesitatingly to the invalid th young lady says as she an her feyther will tak my place a bit ill coom i th mornin you want rest said langley you are tired poor fellow ay quietly im tired an th worst is over yo see an shes here with a patient smile yo wunnot need me and theers them as does from that hour his work at this one place seemed done for several days he made his appearance regularly to see if he was needed and then his visits gradually ended he had found a fresh field of labor among the sufferers in the settlement itself he was as faithful to them as he had been to his first charge the same unflagging patience showed itself the same silent constancy and selfsacrifice scarcely a man or woman had not some cause to remember him with gratitude and there was not one of those who had jested at and neglected him but thought of their jests and neglect with secret shame there came a day however when they missed him from among them if he was not at one house he was surely at another it appeared for some time but when after making his round of visits the doctor did not find him he became anxious he might be at janners but he was not there nor among the miners who had gradually resumed their work as the epidemic weakened its strength and their spirits lightened making these discoveries at nightfall the doctor touched up his horse in some secret dread he had learned earlier than the rest to feel warmly toward this simple colaborer perhaps hes gone out to pay langley a visit he said ill call and see he may have stopped to have a rest but before he had passed the last group of cabins he met langley himself who by this time was well enough to resume his place in the small world and hearing his story langleys anxiety was greater than his own i saw him last night on my way home he said about this time too for i remember he was sitting in the moonlight at the door of his shanty we exchanged a few words as we always do and he said he was there because he was not needed and thought a quiet night would do him good is it possible no one has seen him since in sudden alarm come with me said his companion overwhelmed by a mutual dread neither spoke until they reached the shanty itself there was no sign of human life about it the door stood open and the only sound to be heard was the rustle of the wind whispering among the pines upon the mountain side both men flung themselves from their horses with loudlybeating hearts god grant he is not here uttered langley god grant he is anywhere else the place is so drearily desolate desolate indeed the moonbeams streaming through the door threw their fair light upon the rough boards and upon the walls and upon the quiet figure lying on the pallet in one of the corners touching with pitying whiteness the homely face upon the pillow and the hand that rested motionless upon the floor the doctor went down on his knees at the pallets side and thrust his hand into the breast of the coarse garments with a halfchecked groan asleep broke from langleys white lips in a desperate whisper notnot dead said the doctordead for hours there was actual anguish in his voice as he uttered the words but another element predominated in the exclamation which burst from him scarcely a second later good god he criedgood god langley bent down and caught him almost fiercely by the arm the exclamation jarred upon him what is it he demanded what do you mean it isa woman even as they gazed at each other in speechless questioning the silence was broken in upon swift heavy footsteps neared the door crossed the threshold and janners daughter stood before them there was no need for questioning one glance told her all she made her way to the moonlit corner pushed both aside with rough strength and knelt down i might ha knowed she said with helpless bitternessi might ha knowed and she laid her face against the dead hand in a sudden passion of weeping i might ha knowed jinny lass she cried but i didna it was loike aw th rest as tha should lay thee down an die loike this tha wast alone aw along an tha wast alone at th last but dunnot blame me poor lass nay i know tha wiltna the two men stood apart stirred by an emotion too deep for any spoken attempt at sympathy she scarcely seemed to see them she seemed to recognize no presence but that of the unresponsive figure upon its lowly couch she spoke to it as if it had been a living thing her voice broken and tender stroking the hair now and then with a touch all womanly and loving yo were nigher to me than most foak jinny she said an tha trusted me i know they left her to her grief until at last she grew calmer and her sobs died away into silence then she rose and approaching langley who stood at the door spoke to him scarcely raising her tearstained eyes i ha summat to tell yo an summat to ax yo she said an i mun tell it to yo alone will yo coom out here he followed her wondering and sad his heart was heavy with the pain and mystery the narrow walls inclosed when they paused a few yards from the house the one face was scarcely more full of sorrow than the other only that the womans was wet with tears she was not given to many words bess janner and she wasted few in the story she had to tell yo know th secret as she carried she said or i wouldna tell yo even now an now i tell it yo that she may carry the secret to her grave an ha no gossiping tongue to threep at her i dunnot want foak starin an wonderin an makkin talk

without speaking he left them and entered the shanty alone the moonlight streaming in as before fell upon the closed eyes and hands folded in the old old fashion upon the fustian jacket the low whisper of the pines crept downward like a sigh kneeling beside the pallet the young man bent his head and touched the pale forehead with reverent lips god bless you for your love and faith he said and give you rest and when he rose a few minutes later and saw that the little dead flower he had worn had dropped from its place and lay upon the pulseless breast he did not move it but turned away and left it resting there
