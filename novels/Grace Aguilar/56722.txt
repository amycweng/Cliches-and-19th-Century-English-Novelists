leading out of one of those close melancholy alleys in the environs of liverpool was a small cottage possessing little of comfort or beauty in outward appearance but much in the interior in favour of its inhabitants cleanliness and neatness were clearly visible greatly in contradistinction to the neighbouring dwellings there were no heaps of dirt and half burnt ashes no broken or even cracked panes in the brightly shining windows not a grain of unseemly dust or stains either on door or ledgeso that even poverty itself looked respectable the cottage stood apart from the others with a good piece of ground for a garden which stretching from the back led through a narrow lane to the banks of the mersey and thus permitted a fresher current of air the garden was carefully and prettily laid out and planted with the sweetest flowers the small parlour and kitchen of the cottage opened into it and so greatly to the disappointment and vexation of the gossips of the alley nothing could be gleaned of the sayings and doings of its inmates within the cottage the same refinement was visible the furniture though old and poor was always clean and neatly arranged the mezzuzot deut vi were carefully secured to every door post and altogether there was an indescribable something pervading the dwelling that in the very midst of present poverty seemed to tell of former and more prosperous days simeon and rachel perez had married with every prospect of getting on well in the world neither were very young for though they had been many years truly devoted to each other they were prudent and had waited till mutual industry had removed many of the difficulties and obstacles to their union all which might have been irksome was persevered in through the strength of this honest unchanging affection and when the goal was gained and they were married all the period of their mutual labour seemed but as a watch in the night compared to the happiness they then enjoyed simeon had been for several years foreman to a watchmaker and was remarkably skilful in the business rachel had been principal assistant to a mantua maker and all her leisure hours were employed in plaiting straw and various fancy works which greatly increased her little store never forgetting the end they had in view their mutual savings had so accumulated that on their marriage perez was enabled to set up a small shop which conducted with honesty and economy soon flourished and every year brought in something to lay aside besides amply providing for their fast increasing family the precepts of their god were obeyed by this worthy couple not only in word but in deed they proved their love for their heavenly father not only in their social and domestic conduct but in such acts of charity and kindness that many wondered how they could do so much for others without wronging their own perez and his wife were however if possible yet more industrious and economical after their marriage than before and many a time preferred to sacrifice a personal indulgence for the purer pleasure of doing good to others and never did they do so without feeling that god blessed them in the deed a painful event calling perez to london was the first alloy to their happiness a younger sister of his wife less prudent because perhaps possessed of somewhat more personal attraction had won the attentions of a young man who had come down to liverpool he said for a weeks pleasure no one knew anything about isaac levison as a companion perez himself owned he was very entertaining but that was not quite sufficient to make him a good husband assurances that he was well able to support a wife and family with perez and rachel they were not then married went for nothing they wanted proofs and these he either could not or would not bring but in vain they remonstrated leah had never liked their authority or good example and in this point determined to have her own way they were married and left liverpool to reside in london and leahs communications were too few and far between to betray much concerning their circumstances at length came a letter stating that leah was a mother but telling also that poverty and privation had stolen upon them their substance in a few troubled years had made itself wings and flown away when most needed and leah now applied for assistance to those very friends whose kindness and virtues she had so often treated with contempt the fact was levison had embarked all his little capital collected no one knew how in an establishment dashing in appearance but wanting the basis of honesty and religion after seeming to flourish for a few years it of course failed at last exposing its proprietors to deserved odium and distrust and their families to irretrievable distress for seven years perez and his wife almost supported leah and her child secretly indeed for no one in liverpool imagined they had need to do so leah was still too dear for the faults and follies of her husband and perhaps her own imprudences to form any subject of conversation with her relatives at length leah wrote that she was ill very ill she thought the hand of death was on her and she feared it for her child her darling sarah whom she had striven to preserve pure amidst the scenes of misery and sin which she now confessed but too often neared her dwelling what would become of her who would protect her how dared she appeal to the god of the orphan when her earthly father yet lived seeming to forget there was a god perez and his wife perused that sad letter together but ere it was completed rachel had sunk in bitter tears upon his bosom seeking to speak the boon which was in her heart but though it found no words perez answered you are right dear wife one more will make little difference in our household providence blessed us with four children and has been pleased to deprive us of one sarah shall take her place and in snatching her from the infection of vice and shame may we not ask and hope a blessing do not weep then my rachel leah may not be so ill as she thinks i will go and bring her and her child and there may be happy days in store for them yet perez departed that same night by the mail to london but prompt as he was poor leahs sufferings were terminated before his arrival her death though in itself a painful shock was less a subject of misery and depression to a mind almost rigid in its notions of integrity and honour as that of perez than the fearful state of wretchedness and shame into which isaac levison had fallen perez soon perceived that all hope of effecting a reformation was absolute folly his poor child had been so repeatedly prevented attending school by his intemperate or violent conduct that she was at length excluded levison could give no good reason for depriving his little girl of these advantages except that he hated the elders who were in office that he did not see why some should be rich and some should be poor and why the former should lord it over the latter he was as good as they were any day and his daughter should not be browbeaten or governed by any one however she might call herself a lady to reason with folly perez felt was foolishness and so he contented himself with entreating levison to permit his taking the little sarah at least for a time into his family levison imagined perez was the same rank as himself and therefore that his pride could not be injured by his consenting equal in birth perhaps they were but as far removed in their present ranks as vice from virtue dishonesty from truth perez however glad and grateful for having gained his point made no comment on the many muttered remarks of his brother in law as to his conferring not receiving an obligation by giving his child to the care of her aunt but hastened home longing to offer the best comfort to his wifes sorrow by placing the rescued sarah in her arms and it was a comfort for gradually rachel traced a hand of love even in this affliction the loss of her mother under such circumstances proving perhaps in the end a blessing to the child if her father would but leave her with them she feared that he would not at first but perez smiled at the fear as foolishness and it gradually dwindled away for years passed and the little sarah grew from childhood into womanhood still an inmate of her uncles family almost forgetting she had any father but himself but it is not to the unrighteous or the irreligious only that misfortunes come nay they may flourish for a time and give no evidence that there is a just and merciful god who ruleth but even those who have loved and served him through long years of probity and justice and who according to frail human perceptions would look for nothing but favour at his hand are yet afflicted with many sorrows and our feeble and insufficient wisdom would complain that such things are if this world were all then indeed we might murmur and rebel but our god himself has assured us there will come a day when he will discern between the righteous and the wicked between those who serve god and those who serve him not and it is our part to wait patiently for that day and that better world where that word will be fulfilled perez had now five children reuben his eldest son was full five years older than the rest a circumstance of rejoicing to perez as he hoped his son would supply his place to his family should he be called away before the threescore and ten years allotted as the age of man to do all he could towards obtaining this end perez early associated his son with him in his own business of watch making but too soon unhappily the parents discovered that a heavy grief awaited them from him to whom they had most fondly looked for joy they had indeed striven and prayed to train up their child in the way he should go but it seemed as if his after years would not confirm the sage monarchs concluding words wild thoughtless and headstrong reuben after a very brief trial determined that his fathers business was not according to his taste and he could not follow it his fathers authority indeed kept him steady for a few years but it was continued rebellion and reproof and often and often the fathers hard earned savings were sacrificed for the wild freaks and extravagance of the son perez trembled lest the other members of his family equally dear should suffer eventual loss but there is something in the hearts of jewish parents towards an eldest son which calls imperatively for indulgence towards and concealment of his failings again and again perez expended sums much larger than he could conveniently afford in endeavouring to fix his son in business according to his inclinations but no sooner was he apparently settled and comfortable and his really excellent abilities fairly drawn forth than by negligence or inattention or some graver misdemeanour he disgusted his employers and after a little longer trial was returned on his fathers hands deeply and bitterly his parents grieved using every affectionate argument to convince him of the evil of his ways and bring him back again to the paths of joy they did not desist however their efforts and prayers seemed alike unanswered they did not fail in faith though often it was trembling and faint within them one hope they had reuben was not hardened often he would repent in tears and agony of spirit and deplore his own ill fate that he was destined to bring misery to parents he so dearly loved but he refused to believe that it only needed energy to rouse himself from his folly for as yet it was scarcely more he said he could not help himself could not effect any change and therefore made no effort to do so but that which grieved his parents far more than all else was his total indifference to the religion of his forefathers his ears even as his heart and mind were closed to those divine truths his parents had so carefully inculcated he knew his duty too well to betray infidelity and indifference in their presence but they loved him too well to be blind to their existence what is it to be a jew they heard him once say to a companion but to be cut off from every honourable and manly employment to be bound fettered to an obsolete belief which does but cramp our energies and bind us to detestable trade no wonder we are looked upon with contempt believed to be bowed crushed to the very earth as void of all spirit or energy only because we have no opportunity of showing them little did he know the bitter tears these words wrung from his poor mother that no sleep visited his fathers eyes that night was this an answer to their anxious prayer yet they trusted still anxiety and grief did not prevent perez attending to his business but either from the many drains upon his little capital or that trade was just at that time in a very low state his prosperity had begun visibly to decrease and not long afterwards a misfortune occurred productive of much more painful affliction than even the loss of property which it so seriously involved a dreadful fire broke out in the neighbourhood gaining such an alarming height ere it was discovered that assistance was almost useless amongst the greatest sufferers were perez and his family their happy home was entirely consumed and all the little valuables it had contained completely destroyed perez gazed on ruin for one brief moment he stood as thunderstricken but then a terrible shriek aroused him he looked around he thought he had seen all whom he loved in safety but at one glance he saw his little ruth was not there his wife had caught a glimpse of the child in a part of the building which the flames had not yet reached and with that wild shriek had flown to save her he saw her as she made her way through falling rafters and blazing walls he made a rush forward to join and rescue or die with her but his children clung round him in speechless terror his friends and neighbours seconded them and before he could effectually break from them a loud congratulatory shout proclaimed that the daring mother had reached her child a dozen ladders were hurried forward their bearers all eager to be the first to plant the means of effectual escape and clasping her ruth closely to her breast regardless of her increasing weight for terror had rendered the poor child utterly powerless the mothers step was on the ladder and a hush fell upon the assembled hundreds there was no sound save the roar of the devouring element and the play of the engines the flames were just nearing the beam on which the ladder leaned but hope was strong that rachel would reach the ground ere this frail support gave way and numbers pressed round regardless of the suffocating smoke and heat in the vain hope of speeding her descent perez had ceased his struggles the moment his wife appeared with clasped hands and cheeks and lips so blanched as even in that lurid light to startle by their ghastliness he remained his eyes starting from their sockets in their intense and agonized gaze he saw only his wife and child but his children with horror which froze their very blood could only look on the fast approaching flames a wild cry of terror was bursting from young joseph ruths twin brother but sarah with instinctive feeling dreading lest that cry should reach his mothers ears and awaken her to her danger caught him in her arms and soothed him into silence carefully and slowly rachel descended she gave no look around her no one knew if she were conscious of her danger which was becoming more and more imminent then came a smothered groan from all all save the husband and the father the flame had reached the beamit crackedcaughtthe top of the ladder was wreathed with smoke and fire was there faltering in her step or did the frail support fail beneath her weight the half was past but one third to the ground remained fiercer and fiercer the flames roared and rose above her but yet there was hope it failed the beam gave way the ladder fell and rachel and her child were precipitated to the ground a heavy groan mingled with the wild shriek of horror which burst around perez rushed like a maniac forward but louder shriller above it all a cry resounded mother mother oh god my mother why was i not beside you to save ruth in your stead mother speak oh speak to me again and the father and son each unconscious of the others presence met beside what seemed the lifeless body of one to both so dear but rachel was not dead though fearfully injured and it was in the long serious illness that followed reuben proved that despite his many faults and follies affection was not all extinguished love for his mother remained in its full force and in his devotion to her his almost womans tenderness not only towards her but towards his little sister ruth whose eyes had been so injured by the heat and smoke as to occasion total blindness he demonstrated qualities only too likely so to gain a womans heart as to shut her eyes to all other points of character save them a subscription had indeed been made for the sufferers by the fire but they were so numerous that the portion of individuals was of course but small and even this perez honest nature shrunk in suffering from accepting religious and energetic as he was determined not to evince by word or sign how completely his spirit was crushed and thus give the prejudiced of other faiths room to say the jew has no resource no comfort he yet felt that he himself would never be enabled to hold up his head again felt it at the very moment friends and neighbours were congratulating him on the equanimity the cheerfulness with which he met and bore up against affliction yet even now when the sceptic and unbeliever would have said surely the god he has so faithfully served had deserted him perez felt he was not deserted that he had not laboured honestly and religiously so long in vain the wild and wayward conduct of the son could not in candid and liberal minds tarnish the character of the father and thus he was enabled easily and pleasantly to obtain advantageous situations for his two elder children the dwelling to which we originally introduced our reader was then to let and from its miserably dilapidated condition for when perez first saw it it was not as we described at a remarkably low rent an influential friend made it habitable and thither some three months after the fire the family removed and where was sarah levison in the midst of these changes and affliction in their heavy trial did rachel and perez never regret they had made her as their own nor permit the murmuring thought to enter that as the girl had a father they had surely no need to support an additional burden to such questions we think our readers will scarcely need an answer as their own daughter leah they loved and cherished their niece whose affection and gratitude towards them was yet stronger and more devoted than that of their own child affectionate as she was leah had never known other than kind untiring parents never even in dreams imagined the misery in which her cousins early years had passed to sarah life had been a strange dark stream of grief and wrath until she became an inmate of her uncles house though only just seventeen when these heavy sorrows took place her peculiarly quiet and reflective character and strong affections endowed her with the experience of more advanced age she not only felt but acted entering into the feelings alike of her uncle and aunt she unconsciously soothed and strengthened both she taught leahs young and from its high and joyous temperament somewhat rebellious spirit submission and self control she strengthened in the young simeon the ardent desire to work and not only assist his father now but to raise him again to his former station in life she found time to impart to the little joseph such instruction as she thought might aid in gaining him employment untiringly caressingly she nursed both her aunt and the poor little patient sufferer ruth telling such sweet tales of heaven and its beautiful angels and earth and its pleasant places and kind deeds that the child would forget her sorrow as she listened and fancy the sweet music of that gentle voice had never seemed so sweet before and while it spoke she could forget to wish to look once more on the flowers and trees and sky and reuben what was his cousin sarah not to him in these months of remorseful agony when he felt as if he could never more displease or grieve his parents when again and again he cursed himself as the real cause of his fathers ruin for had not such large sums been wasted upon him there might have been still capital enough to have set him afloat again for several days and nights sarah and reuben had been joint watchers beside the beds of suffering and the gentle voice of the former consoled even while to the divine comfort and hope which she proffered reuben felt his heart was closed he bade her speak on he seemed in those still silent hours to feel that without her gentle influence his very senses must have wandered and that heart must have been colder and harsher than sarahs which could have done other than believe she was not indifferent to him sarah did not think of many little proofs of affection at the time she was only conscious that at the very period heavy affliction had visited her uncles family a new feeling a new energy had awakened within her heart and she was happyoh so happy it was to sarahs exertions their new dwelling owed the comfort cleanliness and almost luxury of its interior arrangements her example inspired leah to throw aside the proud disdain with which she at first regarded their new hometo conquer the rebellious feeling which prompted her to entreat her father to apprentice her anywhere so she need not live so differently at home and not only to conquer that sinful pride but use her every energy to rouse her natural spirits and make her parents forget how their lot was changed and the girl did so for in spite of youthful follies there was good solid sense and warm feelings on which to work sarah and leah then worked in the interior and perez and simeon improved the exterior of the house so that when the little family assembled there was comfort and peace around them and thus their song of praise and thanksgiving mingled with and hallowed the customary prayer with which the son of israel ever sanctifies his newly appointed dwelling rachel could no longer work as she had done her right arm had been so severely injured as to be nearly useless but sarah supplied her place so actively so happily that rachel felt she had no right to murmur at her own uselessness the poor motherless girl she had taken to her heart and home returned tenfold all that had been bestowed she could have entered into more than one lucrative situation but she would not hear of leaving that home which she knew needed her presence and her services and this was not the mere impulse of the momentweek after week month after month found her active affectionate persevering as at first the most painful circumstance in their present dwelling was its low neighbourhood and partially to remedy this evil sarah prevailed on her uncle to employ his leisure in cultivating the little garden behind the house making their sitting room and kitchen open into it and contriving an entrance through them so as scarcely to use the front except for ingress and egress which necessity compelled this arrangement was productive of a twofold good it prevented all gossiping intercourse which their neighbours had done all they could to introduce and gave perez an occupation which interested him although he might never have thought of it himself both local and national disadvantages often unite to debar the jews from agriculture and therefore it is a branch in which they are seldom if ever employed their scattered state among the nations the occupations which misery and persecution compel them to adopt are alone to blame for those peculiar characteristics which cause them to herd in the most miserable alleys of crowded cities rather than the pure air and cheaper living of the country perez found pleasure and a degree of health in his new employment the delight which it was to his poor little blind ruth to sit by his side while he worked and inhale the reviving scent of the newly turned earth or budding flowers would of itself have inspired him but his wife too shared the enjoyment it was a pleasure to her to take the twins by her side and teach them their god was a god of love alike through his inspired word and through his works and joseph and ruth learned to love their new house better than their last because it had a garden and flowers and they learned from that much more than they had ever learned before for nine months all was cheerfulness and joy in that lowly dwelling the heavy sorrow and disquiet had partially subsided reuben was more often at home and seemed more steadily and honourably employed twice in six months he had poured his earnings in his mothers lap and while he lingered caressingly by her side how might she doubt or fear for him though when absent his non attendance at the synagogue his too evident indifference to his faith his visible impatience at all its enjoyments caused many an anxious hour simeon and leah gave satisfaction to their employers and sarah earned sufficient to make her aunts compelled idleness of little consequence perez himself had been gladly received by his former master as his principal journeyman at excellent wages and could he have felt less painfully the bitter change in his lot all might have been well pride however was unhappily his heirloom as well as that of levison with perez it had always acted as a good spiritwith levison as a bad inciting the former to all honourable deeds and thoughts and acting as religions best agent in guarding him from wrong now however it was to enact a different part in vain his solid good sense argued misfortune was no shame and that he was as high in a moral point of view as he had ever been equally vain was the milder more consoling voice of religion in assuring him a fathers hand had sent the affliction and therefore it was love that he failed in submission if he could not bear up against it in vain conscience told him while she was at rest and glad all outward things should be the same that while his wife and children had been so mercifully preserved thankfulness not grief should be his portion pride that dark failing which will cling to judaism bore all other argument away and crushed him had he complained or given way to temper his health perhaps would not have been injured but he was silent on his own griefs even to his wife for he knew their encouragement was wrong there was no outward change in his appearance or physical power and had he not been attacked by a cold and fever occasioned by a very inclement winter the wreck of his constitution might never have been discovered but trifling as his ailments at first appeared it was but too soon evident that he had no strength to rally from them gradually yet surely he sunk and with a grief which demonstrating itself in each according to their different characters was equally violent in all his afflicted family felt they dared not hope the husband and the father was passing to his home above and they would soon indeed be desolate it was verging towards the early spring when one evening perez lay on his lowly pallet surrounded by his family his hand was clasped in that of his wife whose eyes were fixed on him with a look of such deep love it was scarcely possible to gaze on her without tears the other rested lightly on the beautiful curls of his little ruth who resting on a wooden stool close beside his bed sometimes lifted up her sightless orbs as if in listening to the dear though now alas but too faint voice she could see his beloved face once more one alone was absentone for whom the father yearned as the patriarch jacob for his joseph reuben had been sent by his employer to manchester and though it was more than time for him to return and tidings of his fathers illness had been faithfully transmitted he was still away no one spoke of him yet he was thought of by all so little had his conduct alienated the affections of his family that no one would utter aloud the wish for his presence lest it should seem reproach but the eyes of his mother when they could turn from her husband ever sought the door and once as an eager step seemed to approach she had risen hastily and descended breathlessly but it passed on and she returned to her husbands pallet with large tears stealing down her cheeks rachel my own dear wife do not weep thus he will come yet whispered perez clasping her hands in both his and if he do not oh may god bless him still tell him there was no thought of anger or reproach within me my firstborn first beloved beloved through allfor wayward indifferent as he is he is still my sonperhaps if he tarry till too late remorse may work upon him for good may awaken him to better thoughts and if our god in his mercy detain him for this we must not grieve that he is absent for a moment he paused then he added mournfully i had hoped he would have supplied my placewould have been to you my rachel to his brothers and sisters all that a firstborn should but it may not be gods will be done oh no no do not say it may not be dear uncle think how young he is is there not hope still interposed sarah so earnestly that the colour rose to her cheeks he will be here i know he will or the letter has not reached him you cannot doubt his love and whilst there is love is there not must there not be hope the dying man looked on her with a faint sad smile i do not doubt his love my child but oh if he love not his god his love for a mortal will not keep him from the evil path his youth is but a vain plea my sarah if he see not his duty as a son and brother in israel now when may we hope he will but you are right in bidding me not despond he is my heaviest care in death but my god can lighten even that death sobbed leah suddenly flinging herself on her knees beside the bed and covering her fathers hand with tears and kisses death father dear dear father do not say that dreadful word you will live you must livegod will not take you from us my child call not death a dreadful word it is only such to the evil doers to the proud and wicked men of whom david tells us they shall not stand in the judgment nor enter the congregation of the righteous but shall be as chaff which the wind driveth away for them death is fearful for it is an end of all things but not to me is it thus my beloved ones i have sought to love and serve my god in health and life and his deep love and fathomless mercy is guiding me now holding me up here through the dark shadows of death his compassion is upon my soul whispering my sins are all forgiven that he has called me unto him in love and not in wrath there was a time i feared and trembled at the bare dream of death but now oh it seems but as the herald of joy of bliss which will never never change my children think that i go to god and do not grieve for me if not for you my father chide us not that we weep for ourselves answered simeon struggling with the rising sob what have you not been to all of us and how may we bear to feel that to us you are lost for ever that the voice whose accents of love never failed to thrill our hearts with joy and when in reproach ever brought the most obdurate in repentant sorrow to your feet that dear dear voice we may never he could not go on for his own voice was choked my boy we shall all meet again follow on in that path of good in which i have humbly sought to lead you forget not your god and the duties of your faith obey those commands and behests which to israel are enjoined never forget that as children of israel ye are the firstborn and beloved of the lord serve him trust him wait for him and oh believe the words of the dying we shall meet again never more to part i do but go before you my beloved ones and you will come to me there are many homes in heaven where the loved of the lord shall meet and i and ruthfather dear father how may we so love the lord as to be so loved by him tearfully inquired the young joseph drawing back the curtain at the head of the bed which had before concealed him for he did not like his father to see his tears does he look upon us with the same love as upon you who have served him so faithfully and well oh what would i not do that i may look upon death as you do and feel that i may come to you in heaven written amongst those he loves and our god does love you my little joseph child as you are or you would not think and wish this my works are not more in his sight than yours miserable indeed should i now be if i had trusted in them alone for my salvation and comfort now no my sweet boy you must not look to deeds alone study the word of your god to know and love him and then will you obey his commandments and statutes with rejoicing and glory that he has given you tests by which you may prove the love you bear him and in death though the imperfection and insufficiency of your best deeds be then revealed you will feel and know you have not loved your god in vain his infinite mercy will purify and pardon his voice sunk from exhaustion and rachel bending over him to wipe the moisture from his brow tenderly entreated him not to speak any more then despite the comfort of his simplest word it will not hurt me love he answered fondly after a pause i bless god that he permits me thus to speak before i pass from earth for ever when we meet again there will be no need for me to bid my children to know and love the lord for we shall all know him from the smallest to the greatest of us but to you my own faithful wife oh what shall i say to you in this sad moment i can but give you to his care the god of the widow and the fatherless and feel and know he will not leave you nor forsake you but bless you with exceeding blessing and in that heavy carewhich alas i must leave you to bear alonecare for our precious reuben oh my beloved wife remember those treasured words which were our mutual strength and comfort when we laboured in our youth how well do i remember that blessed evening when we first spoke our love and in our momentary despondence that long years must pass ere we could hope for our union we opened the hallowed word of god and could only see this verse commit thy ways unto the lord trust also in him and he will bring it to pass and did he not bring it to pass dear wife did he not bless our efforts and oh will he not still yes trust in him commit our reuben unto him and all shall yet be well yes yes i know it will but oh my husband pray for me that i may realize this blessed trust when you are gone you have been my support my aid till now cheering my despondence soothing my fears and now rachel my own wife i have not been to you more than you have to me it is our god who has been to us moreoh how much morethan we have been to each other and he is with you still he will heal the wound his love inflicts but for our erring yet our much loved boy i need not bid you love him forgive him to the endand his brothers and sisters oh listen to me my children he half raised himself in the energy of his supplication promise me but this throw him not off from your love your kindness however he may turn aside however he may fall even if that fearful indifference increase and in faith he scarcely seems your brother my children my blessed children oh love him still seek by kindness and affection to bring him back to his deserted fold promise me to love him to bear with him forget not that he is your brother even to the last many a wanderer would return if love welcomed him back many a one who will not bear reproach do not cast him from your hearts my children for your dead fathers sake father father can you doubt us burst at once from all and rising from their varied postures they joined hands around him love him yes however he may forget and desert us he is still our brother and your son we will love him bear with him oh do not fear us father there needed not this promise but we will give it we will never cease to love him bless you my children murmured the exhausted man as he sunk back sarah you have not spoken are you not our child she flung down her work and darted to his side she struggled to speak but no words came and throwing her arms round his neck she fixed on his face one long piercing look and burst into passionate tears it is enough my child i need not bid you love him whispered perez so as to be heard only by her would you were indeed our own there would be less grief in store and am i not your own she answered disregarding his last words which seemed however to have restored her to calmness have you not been to me a true and tender father and my aunt as kind a mother whose am i if i am not yours where shall i find another such home yet you have a father my gentle girl one whom i have lately feared would claim you because they told me he was once more a wealthy man and if he should if he would offer you the rest and comfort of competence why should you labour throughout your young years for us if he be rich he surely will not forget he has a child and therefore claim you he has done so replied sarah calmly regardless of the various intonations of surprise in which her words were repeated my father did write for me to join him he told me he was rich would make me cease entirely from labour and many similar kind offers and you refused them sarah my dear child why have you done this why she repeated pressing the trembling hand her aunt held out to her between both hers why because now only now can i even in part return all you have done for me because i cannot live apart from all whom i so love i cannot exchange for short lived riches all that makes life dear had my father sent for me in sickness or in woe i should fly to him without an hours pause but it is he who is in affluence in peace and you my best kindest friends in sorrow no no my duty was to stay with you to work for you to love you and i wrote to beseech his permission to remain even if it were still to labour i did not feel it labour when with you and i have permission i am still your child he will not take me from you gods blessing be upon him murmured rachel as she folded the weeping girl to her bosom a pause of deep emotion fell upon the group perez drew her faintly to him and kissed her cheek then saying he felt exhausted and should wish to be left alone a brief while sarah led the twins away and followed by leah softly left the apartment simeon and his mother still remained beside his couch the night passed quietly sarah put the twins to bed and persuaded leah to follow their example and exhausted by sorrow she was soon asleep leaving sarah to watch and pray alone and the poor girl did pray and think and weep till it seemed strange the night could so soon pass and morning smile again she had not told that permission to remain with her aunt had been scornfully and painfully given that her father had derided her as mean spirited and degraded that as she had chosen to remain with her poor relations she was no longer his daughter nor did she pray and weep for the dying or for those around him one alone was in that heart why was he not there at such a moment and she shuddered as she pictured the violence of the self accusing agony which would be upon him when he discovered he had lingered until too late hour after hour passed and there was no footstep she thought the chimes must have rung too near each other for as one struck she believed he must be at home ere it struck another and yet he came not she watched in vain day dawned and as light gleamed in upon the dying there was a change upon his face he had not suffered throughout the night seeming to sleep at intervals and then lay calmly without speaking but as the day gradually brightened he reopened his eyes and looked towards the richly glowing east another sun he said in a changed and hollow voice blessed be the god who sets him in the heavens strong and rejoicing as a young man to run a race my race is overmy light will pass before his i prayed one nights delay but still he does not come and now it will soon be over rachel my true wife call the children let me bless them each once more they were called and awestruck even to silence at the fearful change in that loved face they one by one drew near and bowed down their bright heads before him faintly yet distinctly he spoke a blessing upon each then murmured the god of my fathers bless you all all as you love him and each other never deny him acknowledge him as one hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one the words were repeated in tears and sobs by all he fell back and they thought his spirit gone minutes rolled by and then there was a rapid step without it neared the door one moment paused and entered my son my son o god i thank thee reuben my firstborn in time i bless bless the words were lost in a fearful gurgling sound but the fathers arms were flung wildly strongly round the son who with bitter tears had thrown himself upon his neckand there was silence father oh my father speakbless forgive me at length reuben wildly exclaimed breaking from that convulsive hold to sink as a penitent upon the earth he spoke in vain the spirit had lingered to gaze once more upon the firstborn of his love then fled from earth for ever chapter ii it is two years after the mournful event recorded in our last chapter that we recommence our simple narrative when time and prayer had softened the first deep affliction the widow and her family indeed proved the fulfilment of that blessed promise leave thy fatherless children to me and i will keep them alive and let thy widows trust in me for they prospered and were happy affliction either of failing health in those compelled to labour or in want of employment was kept far from them the widow indeed herself often suffered but she thanked god in the midst even of pain as she compared the blessings of her lot with those of others little ruth too from her affliction and very delicate health was often an object of anxiety but so tenderly was she beloved that anxiety was scarcely pain in the delight her presence ever caused sweet tempered loving and joyous with a voice of song like a birds and a laugh of child like glee and yet such strong affections such deep reverence for all things holy that who might grieve for her afflictions when she was so happy so gratified herself she was the star of that lowly little dwelling for sorrow or discord or care could not come near her joseph her twin brother had attracted the notice of a respectable jeweller who though he could not take the boy into his house as a regular apprentice till he was thirteen not only employed him several hours in the day in cleaning jewels etc but allowed him small wagesan act of real benevolence felt by the widow as an especial blessing rendered perhaps the dearer from the fact that it was the high character her husband had borne which gave his youngest son so responsible an office intrusted as it was to none but the strictly honest simeon now nearly seventeen was with the same watchmaker who had formerly brought forward his father it was not a trade he liked nay the delicate machinery required was peculiarly annoying to him but it was the only opening for him and he conquered his disinclination he had long since made a vow to use his every effort to restore his parents to the comfortable estate from which they had unfortunately fallen and no thought of himself or his own wishes should interfere with its accomplishment persevering and resolute he took a good heart with him to the business and though his first attempts were awkward and the laughter of his companions most discouraging the praise of his master and his own conscience urged him on and before the two years which we have passed over had elapsed he had conquered every difficulty and promised in time to be quite as good a workman as his father the extent of suffering which his fathers death had been to him no one knew but he had felt at first as if he could not rouse himself again it was useless to struggle on for the beloved parent for whose sake he had made this solemn vow was gone for ever his mother indeed was spared him but much as he loved and reverenced her his father had been if possible first in his affections perhaps it was that his own feelings his own character gave him a clue to all that his father had done and endured he had all his honesty and honour all his energy and love for his ancient faith one difference there was perez could bear with nay love all mankindcould find excuse for the erring even for the apostate much as he abhorred the deed could believe in the sincerity and piety of others though their faith differed from his own but simeon could not feel this often even in his childhood his father had to reprove him for prejudice and as he grew older his hatred against all those who left the faith or united themselves in any way with other than israelites continued violent prejudice is almost the only feeling which reason cannot conquerreligion may and simeon was truly and sincerely religious but he loved his faith better than he loved his god he would have started and denied it had any one told him so and declared it was impossibleone feeling could not be distinct or divided from the other yet so it was an earnest and heartfelt love of god can never permit an emotion so violent as hatred to any of gods creatures it is no test of our own sincerity to condemn or disbelieve in that of others and those who dowho prejudiced and violent against all who differ from themmay be no doubt are sincerely religious and well intentioned but they love their faith better than they love their god these peculiar feelings occasioned a degree of coldness in simeons sentiments towards his brother reuben of whom we have little more to say than we know already the death of his father was indeed a fearful shock yet from a few words which fell from him during some of his interviews with sarah she fancied that he almost rejoiced that he was bound by no promise to the dying in the midst of repentant agony that he had arrived too late for his parents blessing he would break off with a half shudder and mutter if he had spoken that he might have spoken more and i could not have disobeyed him on his death bed whatever he bade me promise i must have promised and then then after a few brief months been perjured oh my father my father why is it my fate to be the wretch i am this grief was violent but it did not produce the good effect which his parents had so fondly hoped even in the days of mourning it was evident that the peculiar forms which his faith enjoined as the son of the deceased chafed and irritated him and had it not been for the deep silent suffering of his mother which he could not bear to increase he would have neglected them altogether when he mixed with the world again he followed his own course and his own will scarcely ever mixing with those of his own race but seeking and at last finding employment with the stranger he had excellent abilities and from his having received a better education than most youths of his race obtained at length a lucrative situation in an establishment which trading to many different parts of the british isles often required an active agent to travel for them his peculiar creed had been at first against him but when his abilities were put to the proof and it was discovered he was in truth only nominally a jew that he cared not to sacrifice the sabbath and that no part of his religion was permitted to interfere with his employments his services were accepted and well paid had then reuben perez the beloved and cherished son of such good and pious parents indeed deserted the religion of his forefathers not in semblance for there were times when he still visited the synagogue and as he did so he was by many still conceived a good jew the flagrant follies of his youth had subsided he was no longer wild wavering and extravagant not a word could be spoken against his moral principles his public even his domestic conduct was unexceptionable and therefore he bore a high character in the estimation alike of the jewish and christian world what cause had his mother then for the grief and pain which swelled her heart almost to bursting when she thought upon her firstborn alas it was because she felt there was one who saw deeper than the worldone between whom and himself reuben had raised up a dark barrier of wrathone who loved him erring and sinful as he was with an immeasurable love but whose deep love was rejected and abusedeven his god that god who had been the saviour of his forefathers through so many thousand ages the mother would have preferred seeing him poor dependent obtaining but his daily bread yet faithful to his faith and to his god than prosperous courted and an alien the brothers seldom met and therefore simeon was ignorant how powerfully coldness was creeping over his affections for reuben how in violently condemning his indifference and union with the stranger he was rendering the observance of his promise to his dying father to bear with and love his brother a matter of difficulty and pain faithful and earnest himself he could not understand a want of earnestness and fidelity in others but however the world might flatter and appear to honour his exemplary moral conduct one truth it is our duty to recordreuben was not happy it was not the mere fancy of his mother and cousin it was truth they knew not whereforefor if he neglected and contemned his religion he could scarcely feel the want of itbut that he was unhappy perhaps was the secret cause which held the love of his mother and sarah so immovably enchained bidding them hope sometimes in the very midst of gloom of the female members of perez family we have little to remark leahs good conduct had not only made her the favourite of her mistress but her liveliness and happy temper had actually triumphed over the sometimes harsh disposition she had at first to encounter there was no withstanding her good humour she had the happy knack of making people good friends with themselves as well as with each other and was so happy herself that except when she thought of her dear father and wished that he could but see her and hear her sing over her work sorrow was unknown every friday evening she went home to remain till the sunday morning and that was superlative enjoyment not only to herself for her mother looked to the visit of her merry affectionate daughter as a source of pure feeling delight and recreation in sarah there was no change still pensive modest and industrious she continued quietly to retain the most devoted affections of her relatives and the goodwill and respect of her employers of her own individual feelings we must not now speak save to say that few even of her domestic circle imagined how strong and deep was the under current of character which her quiet mien concealed it was the evening of the sabbath and the widow and her daughters were assembled in their pretty little parlour simeon and joseph were not yet returned from synagogue reuben alas was seldom there on the sabbath eve the table was covered with a cloth which though not of the finest description was white as the driven snow and the sabbath lamp was lighted for in their greatest poverty this ceremony had never been omitted when they had no lamp and could not have afforded oil they burnt a wax candle frequently depriving themselves of some week day necessary to procure this indulgence the first earnings of sarah leah and simeon had been used to repurchase the ancient sabbath lamp the heirloom in their family for many generations it was silver and very antique and by a strange chance had escaped the fire which rendered perhaps the sale of it the more painful to perez his gratification on beholding it again had amply repaid his affectionate children never being used but on sabbaths it seemed to partake of the sanctity of that holy day bread and salt were also upon the table and the large bible and its attendant prayer books there also open as if they had just been used ruth had plucked some sweet flowers just before sabbath and arranged them tastefully in a china cup and leah had playfully removed a sprig of rosebuds and wreathed it in the long glossy curls which hung round ruths sweet face and over her shoulders the dresses of all were neat and clean for they loved to make a distinction between the seventh day and the six days of labour if we were about to pass a day in the presence of an earthly sovereign my dear children the widow had often been wont to say should we not deserve to be excluded if we appeared rudely and slovenly and dirtily attired you think we could not possibly do so it would not only be such marked disrespect but we should not be admitted how then dare we seek the presence of our heavenly sovereign in such rude and sinful disarray the seventh day is his day he calls upon us to throw aside all worldly thoughts and cares and come to him and give our thoughts and hearts to his holy service if an earthly king so called us how anxious should we be to accept the invitationshall we do less for god but dear mother leah would answer will god regard that is he not too holy too far removed from us too pure to mark such little things nothing is too small for him to remark if done in love and faith my child the heart anxious to mark the sabbath by increase of cleanliness and neatness in personal attire as well as household arrangements must conceive it gods own day and observing it as such will receive his blessing it is not the act of dressing or the dress he observes he only marks it as a proof his holy day is welcomed with love and rejoicing as he commanded and the smallest offering of obedience is acceptable to him but i have heard you remark with regret mother that some of our neighbours are dressed so very smart on sabbath if it be to mark the holy difference between that day and the others why should you regret it because love there ought to be moderation in all things and when i see very smart showy dresses which if not in material in appearance are much too fine and smart for our station i fear it is less a religious than a worldly feeling which dictates them have you not noticed that those who dress so gaily generally spend their sabbath in walking about the streets and exchanging visits conversing of course on the most frivolous topics i do not think this the proper method of spending our sabbath day and therefore i regret to see them devote so much time and thought on mere outward decoration which is so widely different from obedience to their god leah thought of this little conversation many times from thoughtlessness and dislike to trouble she had hitherto been rather negligent than otherwise in her dress then going to a contrary extreme felt very much inclined to imitate some young companions in their finery her mothers word saved her from the one and their subsequent misfortunes effectually from the other as all her earnings were hoarded for one holy purpose simply to assist her parents and she would have thought it sacrilege to have spent any portion on herself except on things which she absolutely needed but so neat and clean was she invariably in her dress that her mistress always sent her to receive orders and trifling as appearance may seem it repeatedly gained customers they are comingi hear their footsteps said the little ruth springing up to open the parlour door oh i do so love the sabbath eve for it brings us all together again so happily is it only simeon and joseph my child inquired the widow mournfully for there was one expectation on her heart and that of sarah which alas was seldom to be fulfilled ruth listened attentively only they mother she said checking her voice of glee and returning to her mothers side for she knew the cause of that saddened tone and she laid her little head caressingly on her mothers breast simeon and joseph at that moment entered and each advancing bent lowly before their mother who laying her hand upon each dear head blessed them in a voice faltering from its emotion and kissed them both the kiss of love and peace went round and gaily the brothers and sisters drew round the table which sarahs provident love speedily covered with the welcome evening meal the happy laugh and affectionate interchange of the individual cares and pleasures vexations and enjoyments of the past week occupied them delightfully during tea sarah had to tell of a new kind of work which had diversified her usual employment and been most successful a kind of wadded slipper which after many trials she had completed to her satisfaction in the intervals of other work and which not only sold well but gave her dear aunt an occupation which she could accomplish without pain in wadding and binding the silk leah told of a pretty dress and bonnet which her mistress had presented to her in token of her approbation of her steadiness in refusing to accompany her companions to some place of amusement which from its respectability being doubted she knew her mother would not approve and by staying at home enabled mrs magnus to finish an expensive order a day sooner than had been expected and so gained her a new and wealthy customer dearest mother you told me how to resist temptation even in trifles continued the affectionate girl with tears of feeling in her bright dark eyes you taught me from my earliest childhood there was purer and more lasting pleasure in conquering my own wishes than any doubtful recreation could bestow and that in that inward pleasure our heavenly fathers approval was made manifest and so you see though you were not near me and i could not as i wished ask your advice and permission it was you who enabled me to conquer myself and resist this temptation i did want to go and felt very very lonely when all went but when mrs magnus thanked me for enabling her to give so much satisfaction and said i had gained her a new customer oh no circus or play could have given me such happiness as that and it was all through you mother and so i told her the happy mother smiled on her animated girl but her heart did not glorify itself it thanked god that her early efforts had been so blessed and ruth some of our readers may exclaim poor blind ruth what can she have to say and we answer happy little ruth had much of industry and enjoyment to dilate on the straw she had plaited the hymns she had learnt through sarahs kindly teaching the dead leaves she had plucked from the shrubs and flowers for so delicate had her sense of touch become she could follow this occupation in perfect security to the plants distinguishing the dead and dying from the perfect leaves at a touch then she told of a poor little orphan beggar girl whom sarah had one day brought in cold and crying because she had been begging all day and had received nothing and she knew she should be beaten when she went home and how she had said she hated begging but she could do nothing else and little ruth had asked her if she would like to sell flowers and poor mary had told her she should like it very very much but she could not get any she knew no one who would let her take them from the garden how she ruth had promised to make her some little nosegays and sarah and her mother said they would make her some little nick nacks pincushions and housewives to put with her flowers ah we made her so happy continued the child clasping her little hands in delight mother gave her some of my old things which were quite good to her and it is quite a pleasure to me to make her nosegays and feel they give her a few pence better than begging and sarah is going to try if i can make her some little fancy things when winter comes you know i am quite rich to her for god has given me a home and such a kind mother and dear brothers and sisters and she has neither home nor mother nor any one to love her poor poor mary and then too some say the christians do not like the jews and i know she will and does like us and she may make others of her people like us too ruth said her brother simeon in a very strange husky voice ruth darling come here and kiss me i wish you would make me as good as you as good exclaimed the child springing on his knee and throwing her arms round his neck dear naughty simeon to say such a thing how much more you can do than i do you not work so very much that dear mother sometimes fears for your health and it is all for us to help to support us mother and me because we cannot work for ourselves ah i am blind and can only do little things and try to make every one happy that they may love me but i am only a little girl i cannot be as good as you ruth darling i could not do as you have done i cannot love and serve those who hate and persecute us as israelites they do not persecute us now brother sarah told me sad tales of what we suffered once but god was angry with us then and he made the nations punish us but now if they still dislike us we ought not to dislike them but do all we can to make them love us simeon bent his head upon his sisters her artless words had rebuked and shamed him but prejudice might not even then be overcome he knew she was right and he was wrong so he would not answer glad to hear leah gaily demand a history of his weekly proceedings as he had not yet spoken he had little to relate except that he was now beginning really to understand his business his master had said that he should soon be obliged to raise his salary and what was a real source of happiness from the care and quickness with which he now accomplished his tasks he found time for his favourite amusement of modelling which circumstances had compelled him so long to neglect joseph had to tell of similar kindness on the part of his master and industry on his own he told too with great glee that mr bennet had promised to give him some lessons in the evenings in the language which of all others he wished most particularly to understand he knew many were satisfied merely to read their prayers in hebrew whether they understood them or not but he wished to understand it thoroughly and all the time he was cleaning jewels for he was now quite expert he thought over what his master had so kindly taught him perhaps one day he might be able to know hebrew thoroughly himself and oh what a delight that would be by the time joseph had finished his tale the table had been cleared and then the widow opened the large bible and after fervently blessing god for his mercy in permitting them all to see the close of another week in health and peace read aloud a chapter and psalm varied as were the characters and wishes of all present every heart united in reverence and love towards this weekly servicein if possible increased devotion towards that beloved parent who so faithfully endeavoured to support not alone her own duties towards her offspring but those of their departed father she had not lost those hours and days aye and sometimes long weeks of suffering with which it had pleased god to afflict her when confined to her bed the bible had been her sole companion and she so communed with it and her own heart that many passages which had before been veiled were now made clear and light and her constant prayer for wisdom and religion to lead her offspring in its paths of pleasantness and peace granted to the full yet rachel was no great scholar let it not be imagined amongst those who read this little tale that she was unusually gifted she was indeed so far gifted that she had a trusting spirit and a most humble and child like mind and of worldly ways was most entirely ignorant and it was these feelings which kept her so persevering in the path of duty and leading her to the footstool of her god gave her the strength of wisdom that she needed and to every mother in israel these powers are given well my dear children to whom must i look for the text which is to occupy us this evening said the widow glancing affectionately round as she ceased to read to me and ruth mother for you know we always think together answered joseph eagerly and you dont know how we have both been longing for this evening for the verse we have chosen has made us think so much and with all our thinking we cannot quite satisfy ourselves but what is it my boy it is the one our dear father repeated on his death bed mother i have often thought of it since but feared it would make you sorrowful if we spoke of it for the first year or two but as i found ruth had thought of it and wished it explained also we said we would ask you to talk about it to night you repeat it ruth you pronounce the hebrew so prettily and timidly but sweetly ruth said first in hebrew and then in english commit your ways unto the lord trust also in him and he will bring it to pass ways continued the child was the word which first puzzled us but sarah has explained it to me so plainly i understand it better now tell us then sarah dear said her aunt it seems to me she said that the word ways has many meanings in the verse show me thy ways o lord i think it means actions in another verse the lord made known his ways unto moses his acts unto the children of israel i think ways mean thoughts and there are several in proverbs interposed simeon which would make us regard ways as the path we are to tread as for instance who leaveth the path of righteousness to walk in the ways of darkness but ruth and i want to know in which of these ways we are to regard it in our verse persisted joseph as meaning both outward actions and inward thoughts my dear children replied his mother i have thought long on this verse and i am glad you have chosen it for discussion perhaps you do not know my little joseph that we must think to act that it is very seldom any good or bad action is performed without previous thought and consequently if we would be pure in act we must commit our thoughts unto the lord but how are we to do this mother asked leah by constant prayer my love by endeavouring wherever we are or whatever we may be doing to remember god knows our every thought before it has words and long before it becomes action we are apt perhaps to indulge in the wildest thoughts simply because we imagine ourselves secure from all observation from human observation we are secure but not from our father who is in heaven and therefore we should endeavour so to train our thoughts as to banish all which we dare not commit unto our god but are there not some things dear aunt too trivial too much mingled with earthly feelings to bring before a being of such ineffable holiness and purity inquired sarah in a voice which notwithstanding all her efforts audibly faltered ah that is what i want so much to know added joseph you must not forget my dear sarah resumed mrs perez that our god is a god of love and compassion as infinite as his holiness that every throb of pain or joy in the creature his love has formed is felt as well as ordained by him no nation has a god so near to them as israel and we of all others ought to derive and realize comfort from the belief that he knows our nature in its strivings after righteousness as well as in its sin he knows all our temptations all our struggles far better than our dearest earthly friends and his loving mercy towards us is infinitely stronger therefore we can better commit our secret thoughts and feelings unto his keeping than to that of our nearest friends on earth and may children do this mother yes dear boy our father has children in his tender care and guiding even as those of more experienced age accustom yourselves while engaged in thought to ask can i ask my fathers blessing on these thoughts and on the actions they lead to and rest assured conscience will give you a true answer if it say no dismiss the trifling or sinful meditations on the instant send up a brief prayer to god for help and he will hear you if on the contrary conscience approve your thought encourage it as leading you nearer closer and more lovingly to god but is not this close communion more necessary for women than for men mother inquired simeon women may need it more my dear boy but believe me it is equally if not more necessary for man think of the many temptations to evil which men have in their intercourse with the world the daily almost hourly call for the conquest of inclination and passion which without some very strong incentive can never be subdued one unguarded moment and the labour of years after righteousness may be annihilated man may not need the comfort of this close communion so much as women but he yet more requires its strength nothing is so likely to keep him from sin as committing his thoughts even as his actions unto the lord thank you my dear mother that first bit is clear said joseph now i want the second the third is the most puzzling of all but we shall come to that by and bye you surely know what it means by to trust in him joseph said leah i think i do sister mine for it was mothers humble trust in the lord that supported her in her sorrows that i saw i felt though i was a child but he hesitated well my boy to trust i think means to have faith now henry stevens said the other day jews have no faithand how can we trust then my dearest joseph do not let your companions so mislead you answered his mother earnestly i know that is a charge often brought against us but it is always from those who do not know our religion and who judge us only from those who by their words and actions condemn it themselves the jew must have faith not only in the existence of god but in the sacred history our god inspired or he is no jew he must feel faithbelieve god hears and will answer or his prayers however fervent are of no avail without faith his very existence must be an enigma and his whole life misery oh believe me my dear children as no nation has god so near them so no nation has so much need of faith and no nation has so experienced the strength and peace and fulness which it brings but how does our verse mean that we are to trust in the lord mother asked ruth it belongs both to the first and last division of the verse my love if we commit our ways unto the lord and trust also in him remember one is of no avail without the other then he will bring it to pass ah that is it i am so glad we have come to that eagerly exclaimed joseph mother does it mean can it mean that our father will grant our prayers will give us what we most wish if it be for our good my boy if our wishes be acceptable in his sight if they will tend to our eternal as well as our temporal welfare and we bring them before him in unfailing confidence believing firmly that he will answer in his own good timewe may rest assured that he will answer us that he will grant our prayers but that which is for our good may not be what we most wish for resumed joseph despondingly but my boy if what we wish for is not for our good is it not more merciful and kind to deny than to grant it remember god knows us better than we know ourselves and we may ask what would lead us to evil temporally and eternally if for a wise and merciful purpose even our good desires are not granted be assured that peace strength and healing will be given in their stead the little circle looked very thoughtful as the impressive voice of the widow ceased sarah seemed more than usually moved for as she bent over her little bible which she had opened at the verse tears one by one fell silently upon the page whether ruth heard them drop or from her seat close by her cousin felt that the hand she caressingly held trembled we know not but the child rose and threw her little arms around her neck do you remember who it was wrote the verse we are considering said the widow after a pause king david answered joseph and simeon together then you see it was no prosperous monarch no peaceful lawgiver but one whose life had passed in trials compared to which our severest misfortunes must seem trifling hunted from place to place in daily danger of his life compelled even to feign madness separated from all whom he loved from all of happiness or peace even debarred from the public exercise of his faith his very prayers at times seemingly unheededyet it is this faithful servant of god who exclaims commit your ways unto the lord trust also in him and he will bring it to pass we know not the exact time he wrote these words but we know he wrote from experience for did not god indeed bring happiness to pass for him if we think of the life of him who wrote these blessed words as well as the words themselves we must derive strength and comfort from the reflection yes yes i see and feel it all now exclaimed joseph eagerly as before oh mother i can think about it now without any puzzling at all i am so glad cannot you ruth hush answered the child as she suddenly started up in an attitude of attentive listening hush i am sure that is reubens step he is coming he is coming oh what joy for me you are wrong dear and it only disappoints mother said leah gently no no i know i am not there listen do you not hear steps now yes but how can you be sure they are his answered simeon it is so very unlikely i should have thought of everybody else first ruth made no answer but she bounded from the room and had opened the street door regardless of leahs entreaties to wait at least till the steps came nearer a very few minutes more and all doubts were solved by the entrance of ruth not walking but clinging round her brother reubens neck and almost stifling him with kisses only interrupting herself to say who was right miss leah and master simeon ah you did not have reuben for long weeks to attend and nurse as i had or you would have known his step too you can love me still then murmured her brother as only to be heard by her then added aloud my mother should have had the first kiss dearest let me ask her blessing ruth she released him though she still held his hand and hastening to his mother he bent his head before her is it too late to ask my mothers sabbath blessing he said and his voice was strangely choked bless me dearest mother as you used to do the widow rose and laying her hands upon his head repeated the customary hebrew blessing and then folded him to her heart it is never never too late for a mothers blessinga mothers love my reuben she said her voice quivering with the efforts she made to restrain her emotion i could have wished it oftener and earlier asked on the sabbath eve but it is yours my boy each night and morning though you hear it not and will it always be mother mother will you never withdraw it from me no no you will not you love me only too too well and abruptly breaking from her after kissing her passionately he turned to greet his brothers and sisters all met him cordially and affectionately except perhaps that there was a stern look of inquiry in simeons eyes which reuben from some unexpressed feeling could not meet and looking from him he exclaimed sarah where is my kind cousin sarah will she not give me welcome she was here this moment said leah where can she have vanished not very far dear cousin i am here reuben can you believe one moment that i do not rejoice to see you once again at home said sarah advancing from the farther side of the room and placing her hand frankly in her cousins looking up in his face with her clear pensive eyes but cheeks as pale as marble reuben pressed her hand within his own tried to meet smilingly her glance and speak as usual but both efforts failed and again he turned away and he has come to stay with ushe will not leave us in a hurry again said the affectionate little ruth keeping her seat on his knee and nestling her head in his bosom i wanted but you to make this evening quite quite happy reuben kissed her to conceal a sigh and controlling himself he entered cheerfully and caressingly into all ruth and joseph had to tell called for all interesting conversation from the other members of his family and imparted many particulars of himself he was rising high in the world had been the fortunate means of preventing a great loss to the firm of which he was a servant and so raised his salary and himself in the estimation of his employers fortune smiled on him he said in many ways and he had had the happiness of securing a trifling fund for his mother which though small was sure and would provide her yearly with a moderate sum he had something else to propose but there would be time enough for that his mother blessed and thanked him but her heart was not at rest cheerful as the conversation was happy as the last hour ought to have been there was a dim foreboding on her spirit which she could not conquer something was yet to be told reuben was not at peace and when indeed he did speak that something it was with a confused more than a joyous tone i do not know why i should delay telling you of my intention mother he said at length i have had too many proofs of your affection to doubt of your rejoicing in anything that will make my happinessi am going to be married there was a general start and exclamation from all but two in the grouphis mother and cousin if it will make your happiness my son i do indeed rejoice the former said very calmly whom do you give me for another daughter you do not know her yet mother but i am sure you will learn to love her dearly it is jeanie wilson the only child of my fellow clerk jeanie wilsona christian reuben reuben how have you fallen burst angrily almost fiercely from simeon but it is folly to be surprisedi knew it would be so indeed wonderfully clear sighted as you were then if you consider such a union humiliation it would have been more brotherly perhaps to have warned me of the precipice on which i stood answered reuben sarcastically yes you gave me so fair an opportunity to act a brothers part never seeking me or permitting me to seek you for weeks together herding with strangers alonefollowing them alike in the store and in the martloving what they love doing as they doand like them scorning despising and persecuting that holy people who once called you sonforgetting your birthright your sainted heritagethrowing dishonour on the dead as on the living to link yourself with those who assuredly will if they do not now despise you shame foul shame upon you have you done calmly inquired reuben though the red spot was on his cheek it is something for the elder to be bearded thus by the younger yet be it so i have done nothing for which to feel shamenothing to dishonour those with whom i am related if they feel themselves dishonoured let them leave me i can meet the world alone aye so far alone that you will rejoice that others have cast aside the chains of nature and given you freedom to follow your own apostate path unquestioned and unrebuked peace i command you exclaimed the widow with a tone and gesture of authority which awed simeon into silence and checked the wrathful reply on reubens lips my sons profane not the sabbath of your god with this wild and wicked contention simeon however you may lament what reuben has disclosed it is not your part to forget he is your brotheryes an elder brotherstill i will own no apostate for my brother muttered the still irritated young man others may regard him as they list if he have given up his faith i will not call him brother i have neither the will nor occasion to forswear my faith replied reuben calmly mr wilson has made no condition in giving me his daughter except that she may follow her own faith which i were indeed prejudiced and foolish to deny he believes as i do to believe in god is enoughall religions are the same before him that is to say he is like yourself of no religion at all rejoined simeon bitterly better he had been prejudiced rigid even despising us as others do then this misfortune would not have befallen us is it a misfortune to you mother leahruthjoseph will you all refuse to love my wife you will not cannot when you see and know her as your wife reuben we cannot feel indifference towards her replied leah tears standing in her eyes yet if you had brought us one of our own people oh how much happier it would have made us and why should it my dear sister mother why should it be such a source of grief i do not turn from the faith of my fathers i may neglect disregard those forms and ordinances which i do not feel at all incumbent on me to obey but i must be a jewi cannot believe with the christian and i cannot feel how my marriage with a gentle loving and most amiable girl can make me other than i am we are in no way commanded to marry only amongst ourselves you are mistaken we are so commanded my dear son in very many parts of our holy law we are positively forbidden to intermarry with the stranger and as a proof that so to wed was considered criminal one of the first and most important points on which ezra and nehemiah insisted was the putting away of strange wives but they were idolaters mother jeanie and i worship the same god but you do not believe in the same creed and therefore is the belief in one god more dangerous we ought to keep ourselves yet more distinct now that we are mingled up amongst those who know god and serve him though not as we do you do not think thus my dear son and therefore all we may do is but to pray that the happiness you expect may be realized and in praying for it of course you doubt it though i still cannot imagine why sarah you have not spoken do you believe me so terrible a reprobate that there is no chance for my happiness temporally and eternally he spoke bitterly perhaps harshly for he had longed for her to speak and her silence strangely painfully reproached him he did not choose to know why and so he vented in bitter words to her the anger he felt towards himself my opinion can be of little value after my aunts she answered meekly but this believe dear cousin if you and jeanie are only as blessed and happy together as i wish you you will be one of the happiest couples on earth i do believe it he said passionately springing towards her and seizing both her hands sarah dear sarah forgive me i was harsh and bitter to you who were always my better angel say you forgive me he repeated the word with a strong emphasis upon it i did not know that you had given me anything to forgive reuben she replied struggling to smile but if you think you have i do forgive you from my very heart bless you for the word he said still gazing fixedly in her face which calmly met his look thank god one misery is spared me he muttered to himself then added and you think i may be happy i trust you will and if it please god to bless you with prosperity i think you may how do you mean that while all things go smoothly you will not feel the division the barrier which your opposing creeds must silently erect between you but if affliction if death should happen reuben dearest reuben may you never repent this engagement then the young man actually trembled at the startling earnestness of her words and will you surely you will not marry in church brother timidly inquired joseph he must he cannot help himself hoarsely interposed simeon who had remained sitting in moody silence for some time and yet he would say he is no apostate no deserter from our faith you said you had something to ask mother reuben said ruth pressing close to his side for she feared the painful altercation between her brothers might recommence i had he answered but i fear it is useless now mother jeanie and i hoped to have offered you a hometo have entreated you to live with us and return to the comforts which were yours we should seek but to give you joy but after what has passed this evening i fear we have hoped in vain i wonder you dared hope it muttered simeon would our mother live with any one who lives not as a jew whose dearest pride is to seem in all points like the stranger with whom he lives thank you for the kind will my dear son replied the widow affectionately though sorrowfully but you are right in thinking it cannot be i am too old and too ailing to mingle now with strangers i cannot leave my own lowly dwelling i cannot give up these forms and ordinances which i have learned to love and believe obligatory upon me bring your wife to me if indeed she does not scorn your poor jewish mother she will meet but love from me and mine reuben flung himself impetuously on her neck and she felt his whole frame tremble as with choking sobs his sister sarah and joseph reiterated their mothers words simeon alone was silent another half hour passedan interval painful to all parties despite the exertions of sarah and the widow to make it cheerful and then reuben rose to depart his affectionate embrace his warm good night god bless you was welcomed and returned as warmly by all and then he looked for simeon the youth was standing at the farther end of the apartment in the deepest shadow his arms folded on his breast his lip compressed and eyes fixed sternly on the ground simeon exclaimed reuben as he approached him with frankly extended hand simeon we are brothers let us part friends give up this intended marriage come back to the faith you have deserted and we are brothers answered simeon sternly if not we are severed and for ever be it as you will then answered reuben controlling anger with a violent effort should you need a brother or a friend you will find them both in me the god of our fathers demands not violence like this he does nothe does not simeon i beseech command you do not part thus with your brother on your love your duty to me as your only remaining parent i command this his mother said mildly but imperatively but for once she spoke in vain leah sarah joseph all according to their different characters sought to soften him but the dark cloud only thickened on his brow at that moment a light form pressed through them all and clasping his knees looked up in that agitated face as if those sightless orbs had more than common powerand ruth it was that spoke brother she said in her clear sweet voice brother our father bade us love our brother even if he turned aside from all we hold most sacred and most dear we stood around his death bed and we promised thisto love him to the end brother you will not break this vow no no our father looks upon us hears us still there was a strong and terrible struggle on the part of simeon and a heavy groan of repentant anguish broke from the very heart of reuben my father my poor father did he so love me and will you still hate me simeon he gasped forth another moment and the brothers were clasped in each others arms chapter iii it had been with the most simple and heartfelt prayer that the widow perez had sought to instil the beautiful spirit breathing in the verse forming the subject of their sabbath conversation in the hearts of her children yet ere the evening closed how sadly and painfully had her faith been tried and how bitterly did she feel that to her prayers there seemed indeed no answer it was her firstborn whom she had daily almost hourly committed to the lord for him she sought with her whole heart to trust that he would in his deep mercy awaken her boy to the error of his ways but did it appear as if indeed the gracious promise would be fulfilled and the lord would indeed bring it to pass alas farther and farther did it now seem removed from fulfilment by his marriage with a gentile what must ensuea yet more complete estrangement from his fathers faith the mothers heart indeed felt breaking but quiet and ever gentle who but her loving children might trace this bitter grief and there were not wanting very many to give the mother all the blame of the sons course of acting what else could she expect by her weak indulgence was almost universally said why did she not threaten to cast him off if he persisted in this sinful connection instead of encouraging such things in her other children which of course she did by receiving reuben as usual why had she not commanded him on peril of a parents curse to break off the intended match then she would have done her duty as it was it would be something very extraordinary if all her other children did not follow their elder brothers example the widow might have heard their unkind remarks but she heeded them little for she had long learned that the spirit guiding the blessed religion which she and her husband had felt and practised was too often misunderstood and undervalued by many of her co religionists the idea of love bringing back a wanderer was by the many thought too perfectly ridiculous ever to be counted upon but her conscience was at rest none but her own heart and her god knew how she had striven to bring up her firstborn as he should go or how agonizing she had ever felt this failure of her struggles and prayers in the conduct of her son and this last act more agonizing than all she knew aye felt secure that neither of her other children needed severity towards reuben to prevent their following his example in them she saw the fruits of her efforts in their education and she knew that they felt their brothers wanderings from their beloved faith too sorrowfully ever to walk in his ways they saw enough of their poor mothers silent uncomplaining grief to suppose for a moment that her absence of all harshness towards reuben proceeded from her approval of his marriage and each and all lifted up the fervent cry for strength always to resist such fearful temptation and to adhere to the faith of their fathers even until death we are quite aware that by far the greater number of our readers widow perez will be either violently condemned or contemptuously scorned as a weak mean spirited foolish woman we can only say that if so we are sorry so few have the power of understanding her and that the loving piety the spiritual religion of her character should find so faint an echo in the jewish heart the consequences of her forbearance will be too clearly traced in our simple tale to demand any further notice on our own part we would only ask with all humility our readers of every class and grade to recall any one single instance in which parental violence and severity even coupled with malediction have ever succeeded in bringing back a wanderer to his fold if so we will grant that our idea of love and forbearance effecting more than hate and violence is both dangerous and false but to return to our tale there was another in that little household bowed like the mother in grief sarah had believed that it was her care for reubens spiritual welfare which had engrossed her so muchthat it was as distinct from him temporally as from herself a rude shock awakened her from this dream and oh so fearfully the wild tumult of thought pressing on her heart and brain needs no description from the first year of her residence with her aunt reuben had been dear to her affection so strengthening increasing with her growth so mingled with her being that she was unconscious of its power and now that consciousness had comethe prayers the wishes of a lifetime were dashed down unheard and unregardedcould she believe in the soothing comfort of that inspired promise had she not committed her ways had she not trusted and had it not proved in vain sarah was young had all the inexperience the elasticity and consequent impatience of early life and so it was that while the mother trusted and believed despite of all aye trusted her boy would yet be saved to sarah life was one cheerless blank her heart so chilled and stagnant it seemed as it were the power of prayer was gonethere could be no darker woes in store perhaps her very determination to conceal these feelings from every eye increased the difficulties of self conquest day after day passed and her aunt and cousins saw nothing different from her usually quiet cheerful ways it might be that they suspected nothingthat even the widow knew not sarahs trial was yet greater than her own but at night it was that the effects of the days control were felt and weeks passed and time seemed to bring no respite you can trust if you cannot pray the clear still voice of conscience one night breathed in the ear of the poor sufferer so strangely distinct it seemed as if some spiritual voice had spoken come back to the father the god who has love and tenderness for allwho loves despite of indifference and neglectwho has balm for every wound even such as thine doth he not say cast your burden on him and he will sustain you trust in his word and sin no more it was strange almost awful in the dead stillness of night that low piercing whisper but it had effect for the hot tears streamed down like rain upon the deathlike cheek the words of prayer faint broken yet still trustful burst from that sorrowing heart and brought their balm from that hour the stagnant misery was at an end sarah awoke to duty alike to her god as to herself and then it was she felt to the full how unutterably precious was the close commune with the father in heaven which her aunts counsels had infused where could she have turned for comfort had she been taught to regard him as too far removed from earth and earthly things to love and be approached time passed reubens marriage took place at the time appointed and still with him all seemed prosperity it was impossible to see and not to love his gentle wife still in seeming a mere child so delicate in appearance one could scarcely believe her healthy as she said she was it was however only with his mother and sisters that reuben permitted her to associate he called himself at least to his mother a son of israel but all real feeling of nationality was dead within himyet he was not a christian nor was his wife except in name they believed there was a god at least they said they did but life smiled on them he was not needed and so they lived without him simeon true to his prejudices would not meet his brothers wife nor did his mother demand such from him it was enough that with reuben himself when they chanced to meet he was on kindly terms ruths appeal had touched his heart for the remembrance of his father was as omnipotent as his wishes had been during his lifetime the interests of the brothers alike temporal as eternal were however too widely severed to permit confidence between them and so they passed on their separate ways loving perhaps in their inward hearts but each year apparently more and more divided about six months after reubens wedding sarah received a letter which caused her great uneasiness our readers may remember at the conclusion of our first chapter we mentioned isaac levison having written to his daughter stating he was again well to do in the world and offering her affluence and a cessation from all labour if she liked to join him we know also that sarah refused those offers feeling that both inclination and duty bade her remain with the benefactors of her youth when they were in affliction and needed her and that irritated at her reply her father had cast her off and from that time to the present nearly three years she had never heard anything of him the letter she now received told her that levison was in the greatest distress and seriously ill his suspiciously amassed riches had been like his former partly squandered away in unnecessary luxuries for house and palate and partly sunk in large speculations which had all failed that he was now too ill to do anything or even to write to her himself but that he desired his daughter to come to him at once she had been ready enough to labour for others and therefore she could not hesitate for him who was the only one who had any real claim upon her the only one who can claim my labour thought the poor girl as she read the harsh epistle again and again what should i have been without the beloved friends whom he thus commands me to leave yet he is my father he sent for me in prosperityi could i did refuse him then but not now no no i must go to him now and leave all all i so dearly love and letting the paper fall she covered her face with her hands and wept bitterly yet perhaps it is better she thought after a brief interval of bitter sorrow i can never conquer this one consuming grief while i am here and so constantly liable to see its cause my heavenly father may have ordained this in love and even if it brings new trials i can look up to him trust in him still i do not leave him behind mehe will not leave me nor forsake me whatever i may be called upon to bear and inexpressibly strengthened by this thought she was enabled without much emotion to seek her much loved aunt to show her the letter and its mandate the widow saw at a glance the duty of her adopted child and though to part with her was a real source of grief she loved her too well to increase the difficulty of her trial by endeavouring to dissuade her from it you must go my beloved girl she said folding her to her heart but i trust it will be but for a short time my home is yours rememberalways your home wherever else you may be as only a passing sojourn your duty is indeed trying but fear not you will be strengthened to perform it yet however determined were the widow and her family to control all weakening sorrow and regret there was not one who did not feel the unexpected departure of sarah as an individual misfortune each was in some way or other so connected with her that separation caused a blank in their affections and what then must have been her own feelings they parted with but one dear friend she from them all to go amongst those with whom she had not one thought or feeling in common but she who had worked so perseveringly for them who had felt herself a child in blood as well in heart of the widows that she had never thought of making a distinct provision for herself this unselfish one was not to leave them portionless and with so much attention to her feelings did her aunt and cousins proffer their gifts it was impossible pained as she was to refuse they said it would be long perhaps before she could find employment in her new home and she might need it besides it was not a gift it was her due her earnings had all gone for them and they offered but her rightful share reuben and his wife were not at liverpool when sarah was compelled to leave it and she rejoiced that it was so we will not linger either on the day of parting or the poor girls sad and solitary journey simeon went with her as far as birmingham and when he left her the scene of loneliness of foreboding sorrow pressed so heavily upon her that her tears fell unrestrainedly but though her heart did feel desolate she knew she was not forsaken her god was with her still and he would in his own good time bring peace she was obeying his call by discharging her duty and he would lead her through her dreary path fear not abraham i am thy shield and exceeding great reward were the words in her little bible on which her eyes had that morning glanced dim with tearsthey could see but those again and yet again she read them till they seemed to fix themselves upon her heart as peculiarly and strangely appropriate to herself like abraham she was leaving home and friends to dwell in what was to her a strange land and the same god who had been with him the god of abraham and israel was her god also his arm was not shortened nor his ear heavy that he could not save and oh what unspeakable comfort came in such thoughts century on century had passed but the descendants of abraham were still the favoured of the lord having in the simple fact of their existence evidence of the bible truth sarah had often gloried in being a daughter of israel but never felt so truly so gratefully thankful for that holy privilege as she did when thinking over the history of abraham and the promise made to him and his descendants in her lonely journey and feeling to the full the comfort of the conviction that abrahams god was hers it was a dull and dreary evening when sarah entered the great city of london the stage put her down about half an hours walk from her destination and she proceeded on foot followed by a boy conveying her little luggage she struggled hard to subdue the despondency again creeping over her as she traversed the crowded streets in which there was not one to extend the hand of kindly greeting she felt almost ashamed though she could not define why that the boy should see the low dark alleys which she was obliged to tread before she could discover where her father now lived and when she did reach it she stood and hesitated before the door as if the house she sought could scarcely be there it was such a wretched looking place her timid knock was unheard and the impatient porter volunteered a tap loud enough to bring many a curious head to the other doors in the alley and hastily to open the one wanted a long curious stare greeted sarah from an old woman repulsive in feature and slovenly and dirty in dress who to sarahs faltering question if mr levison lived there somewhat harshly replied yes to be sure he does and who may you be that wants him he is not at home whatever your business is did he not expect me then i wrote to say i should be with him to night answered sarah trying to conquer the painful choking in her throat i thought he was too ill to go out why sure now you cannot be his daughter was the reply in a softened tone and the woman looked at her with something very like pity come in with you then if you really are sarah levison send the boy away and come in trembling from a variety of feelings sarah mechanically obeyed giving the boy the customary fee ere she discharged him a proceeding which caused the woman to look at her with increasing astonishment and to exclaim when sarah was fairly in the dirty miserable room called a parlour she can do that too and yet she comes here sarah levison are you not a great fool the poor girl started fairly bewildered by the question and looked at her companion very much as if she thought she had lost her wits a fool she repeated my good girl yes what have you left a comfortable house and kind friends and perhaps a good business for to obey my father replied sarah simply did he not send to tell me he was ill and wanted me that he was no longer the wealthy prosperous man that he was and i must labour for him now or have i been deceived and is it all false she added in accents of terror as she grasped old esthers arm and has some one only decoyed me here no child no folks about here are bad enough but not as bad as that levison is poor enough both in health and pocket and wrote as you say but for all that i say you are a fool for coming was it not my duty asked sarah oh it was sad enough to leave all i love i dare say it was dear i dare say it was and the old womans face actually lost its repulsiveness in such a strong expression of pity that the desolate girl drew closer to her and clasped her hand and mores the pity you should have left them at all dutyit is a fine sounding word but i dont know what duty levison can claimhe has never acted like a father never done anything for you how can he expect you should for him still he is my father repeated sarah he sent for me when he was prosperous and though i did not come his kind wish was the same and proved he did not forget me besides even if he had gods plain command is to honour your father and mother we can scarcely imagine any case when this command is not to be obeyed and surely not when a parent is in distress you have learned fine feelings my poor child i hope you will be able to keep them but i dont know i tried to do my duty god knows when i was young and hearty but now poverty and old age have come upon me and i have left off caring for anybody or anything it is better to take life as we find it and hard enough it is not if we believe and feel that god is with us and will lead us in the end to joy and peace rejoined sarah timidly why you cannot be so silly child as to believe that god her voice deepened into awe cares for such miserable worms as we are and would lead us as you say we are taught so and i do believe and feel it replied sarah earnestly taught so where child where reiterated old esther eagerly in gods own book the bible answered sarah the old womans countenance fell the bible child now that must be your own fancy i never found it there and i think i must have read it more than you have have you looked for it inquired sarah timidly for she feared to be thought presumptuous looked for iti dont know what you mean i read it every saturday the parts they tell us to read and i do not find much comfort in them for they seem to tell me god is too far off to care for such as us oh do not do not say so replied sarah with unaffected earnestness every word of that blessed book brings our god near us as a tender and loving fathertells us we are his children he loves us cares for us bears all our sorrow feels for us more deeply than any earthly friend i am not very old but i have learned this from his holy book and so i am sure will you forgive me she added meekly taking the old womans withered hand i am too young perhaps to speak so to one old and experienced as you are forgive youyou are a sweet angel hastily replied esther suddenly rising and pressing sarah in her arms too good too good to come to such a house as this god forbid you should have such trials as to make you doubt what you now so steadfastly believe the more you talk the more i wish you had not come but why do you regret it what is it i must expect pray tell me be my friend i have none on earth near me to love me now i wish i could be a friend to you poor child but i am of little service now and you can better tutor me than i can you it is a hard thing to say to a child of her own father but you are too good for such as he oh no no pray do not say so tell me only tell me i may love my father entreated sarah you cannot child you have been used to kindness and love you will find harshness and anger you have only associated with religion and virtue you have come to misery and vice as the niece of the worthy widow perez you have been respected and always found employment as the daughter of isaac levison you will be shunned and may be left to starve it is hard enough to find employment for children of respectable parents amongst us poor jews and so how can we expect it for others dont cry dear it is sad enough but it is only too true and so i grieve you have given up even your character to come here but what can i dowhat can i do repeated sarah lifting up her streaming eyes with an expression which almost brought tears to those of esther could i desert my own father and i heard he needed me is he not in poverty and distress and is his own child to forsake him because others do poor he is child and so are most of us but how can you help him can i not work for him as i did for my aunt yes if you can get employment which will not be very easy you are known in liverpool and you are not in london and the few trades in which we poor jews can work are overstocked take old esthers advicereturn as you came your father will never know you have been here and you may be sure i will not betray you go back to your happy home and kind friends it cannot be your duty to give up happiness for misery and as he forsook you your conscience can be quite at rest in your leaving him do not hesitate my good child go at once he has no claim upon you there are some who doubt the necessity of daily prayer that we need not pray against temptation there being so few times in which any great temptation is likely to assail us great temptations to sin perhaps we seldom have but smalloh of what hour can we be secure little did poor sarah imagine when she entered that lowly roof the almost overpowering temptation which was to assail her the home of peace cleanliness and comfort which she had deserted the beloved friends of her youth the happy hours that were gone all rose so vividly before her conjuring her to return to them not to devote herself to miserywhich after all was but a doubtful dutythat her first impulse was indeed to fly from a scene where everything around her confirmed old esthers ominous words but sarah was no weak wavering child of impulse her principles were steady her faith was fixed and the inward petition arose with a fervour and faith which gave it power to penetrate the skies save me from myself o god do not forsake me now teach me my duty the one straight path and whatever may befall let me abide by it the brief orison was heard for the god of israel has love and mercy for the lowest of his creatures and strength was given no esther no she answered mildly yet firmly i will not turn aside whatever may await me god sees my heart knows that i am here to do my duty even if i be mistaken in the means he will strengthen me for its performance do not try to frighten me away she added trying to smile i dare say all you tell me may be very true and it will be difficult to bear but a good heart and a firm faith may make it lighter you know i want a friend sadly and i feel as if you would be a kind one your experience may smooth my way blessings on your sweet face for such words my darling murmured the old woman it is long since old esther has heard anything but abuse and unkindness i wish i could do for you all my heart tells me but deary me that is a vain wish for i would take away all sorrow from you and how can a poor creature like me do that esther would have run on much more in the same strain and sarah felt much too grateful for the kind feeling however rudely expressed to check her had not the old woman suddenly recollected the poor traveller might like some tea which she hastened to prepare it was indeed a different meal both in quality and comfort to that which even in her uncles poorest days she had been accustomed to but sarah was too much engrossed in anxiety for her father to heed it and only made the effort to partake of it in gratitude to her companion she had time to conclude her meal and hear much concerning her father before he appeared esther said he had been ill but never seriously so that he could often have procured employment in various humble ways but for some of them he was too proud and in others behaved so as to disgust those who would have befriended him and that now he literally had not a friend in the world either amongst his superiors or his equals it was a sad sad tale and sarahs feelings as she listened may easily be imagined but how could he live old esther really did not know she lodged in the same house with him but she knew little of his private concerns she only knew he was a wretched temper which of course daily grew worse and worse he went to the synagogue regularly that he did but it did not seem to benefit him much how could it when his actions denied his prayers it was late before levison returned he was still a good looking man but miserably attired and pale from recent illness he greeted his daughter with affection for in the lowest and most debased amongst israel that redeeming virtue is seldom found wanting and sarah felt as she looked on him all the daughter glowing in her heart that she could love work for do anything for him little sleep had she that night not because her bed was hard its covering coarse and unseemly but from the many thoughts pressing on her mind her path was all dark nothing but the unexpected warmth of her fathers welcome and old esthers kindness to make it light she could but trust and pray not only for strength to meet her trials but that she might so be blessed as to erase from her heart the pang which lingered in it still weary days passed often and often did sarahs spirit so sink within her that she felt as if it could never rise again her fathers moroseness returned affection in a character like his could not obtain effective power over the evil habits of long years sarah could not realize that he loved her and had it not been for her firm confidence in the love which was unending pitying strengthening as the gracious lord from whom it comes her every energy must have failed she exerted herself to effect a reformation in their dwelling and in her fathers slender wardrobe to look on him any one would have believed him a very mendicant yet there were some few articles of clothing easily to be repaired and so made decent and this sarah did struck by her method her perseverance and the quiet easy way in which she did everything esther cardoza old and often ailing as she was did not disdain to profit by her example she became more tidy more careful and was surprised to find that it was just as easy to be clean and neat however poor her apparel as the contrary and for comfort the one could not be mentioned with the other one sweet source of pleasure sarah indeed had she had excited an ardent desire in the old womans mind to become thoroughly acquainted with gods holy volume and many an evening did they sit together and esther listened to the sweet pleading voice of her young companion till she felt with her whole heart that god must be with sarah she could not be the good gentle yet strong minded creature she was without his help and then came the thought and belief that if she sought him he would be found too of her unworthy and lowly as she was such a rich treasury of promises did sarah open to her longing heart and eyes that she often wondered how she could have been blind so long and she would thank and bless her with such strong feeling that sarah would feel with thankfulness and chastened joy in the midst of her own sorrows that she had not left her own dear home in vain i begin to think dearie esther one day said that i must have been cross and harsh myself which made folks abuse me as they did since you have been here i feel an altered creature and now meet with kindness instead of wrong perhaps you are more inclined to think it kindness said sarah smiling perhaps so dear but that is all your doing since you have read to me and proved to me that god even abrahams god cares for and loves me i am as happy again and i think if he can love me why surely some of my fellow creatures can too they cannot be as unjust and harsh as i once thought them what would have become of me if you had taken my advice and gone home again then you see esther i was not sent here for nothing humble as i am i have made one fellow creature happy you must make every one happy who talks with you darling but i want you to be happy yourself and you have not come here to be that im thinking it is better for me that i should not be happy yet esther or our father would make me so you know he could with a word and he will in his own good time i did not think i should find one friend but his love provided you her voice quivered and she threw her arms round old esthers neck to hide and subdue her emotion which kindness alone had power to excite but though for esther she had been permitted to do so much her father seemed neither to understand nor appreciate her and to change the opinions to which he so often gave vent and which from their strangeness and laxity often actually appalled her seemed to her utterly impossible the sacred name of god was with him a common interjection introduced in every phrase it mattered not whether called for by anger or vexation or any other feeling sarah shuddered with agony as she heard itthat awful name which she never dared pronounce save with reverence and love which should be kept far from all moods and tempers of sinthat name the holiness of which was enjoined as strictly as solemnly as thou shalt not kill and thou shalt not steal she could not conquer the feeling which its constant and sinful use excited and once so horror struck was her countenance that her father marked it and demanded its cause tremblingly she told him and a rude laugh was his reply coupled with an injunction not to preach to himwords which ever checked her when in his moments of irritation against the whole world and his own fate she sought to comfort him by the religion of her own pure mind she gave up the effort at length but she did not give up prayer she would not listen to the agonized supposition that for such as he even the long suffering of an infinitely compassionate god would be of no avail she prayed and wept for those who prayed not for themselves and there was comfort in her prayer but to pass her life in idleness was impossible from the first week of her residence in london she had sought for employment her father would not hear of her living out and so she endeavoured to find daily occupation or to work at home in both of these wishes as old esther had foreboded she failed in the low neighbourhood where her father dwelt there was no one to employ her and she had no friend to speak for her in the higher classes in vain she had at first urged she must seek for a situation in a private family as upper housemaid ladys maid or nurse levison so raged and stormed at the first mention of the plan that sarah felt as if she never dared resume it yet as weeks passed and the little fund she had brought from liverpool would very soon be exhausted something must be done our readers perhaps think that her idea of the duty she owed her father went so far as even in this to obey him they are wrong if they do sarahs mind was not of that weak cast which could not discern right from wrong she knew it was a false and sinful pride which actuated levisons refusal jews were jews he declared and one class should not serve the other his daughter was as good as any in the land and she should not call any one mistress mildly yet firmly sarah resisted his arguments we have not space to repeat all she said but her father at length yielded with an ill grace indeed and vowing she should go nowhere unless they would let her come to him when he wanted her but still he yielded and sarah thankfully pursued her plan but alas she encountered only disappointment there were no jewesses established as milliners dressmakers or similar trades in london and therefore no possibility of her getting occupation with them as she wished she would not heed old esthers assurances that no one would take jewish servants unsophisticated and guileless herself she could not believe that her nation would refuse their aid and patronage to those of their own faith and she strained every energy she conquered her own shrinking diffidence but all without effect again and again the fact of her being a jewess completed the conference at once one said that jewish servants were more plague than enough they should never enter her house another that their pride and ignorance were beyond all bounds and as for a proper deference towards their superiors a willingness to be taught or guided it was not in their nature another that a jewish cook might be all very well but for anything else it was quite out of the question they knew the low habits the laziness and insolence that characterised such kind of people and they certainly would not expose themselves to it with their eyes open in vain sarah pleaded for a trialthat she was willing most willing to be taught her duty that she was not wholly ignorant and humbly yet earnestly trusted she was not proud her duty to her god had she hoped taught her proper deference towards her superiors on earth some there were who only her superiors in point of fortune stared at her with stupid surprise and utterly unable to understand such pure and truthful feelings sharply terminated their conference at once others would not even hear her some there were really superior in something more than fortune and anxiously desirous to alleviate distress and aid their poorer brethren but they shrank from being the first to engage a jewess as ladys maid or nurse some touched by her respectful and gentle manner would have waived this but when the question who was her father was asked and answered the most kindly intentioned shrank backit could not be in vain she told them she had never been under his care and offered references to many respectable families in liverpool a daughter of levison was no fit servant for any respectable family they were sorry but they could do nothing for her day after day week after week thus passed till even months had elapsed and despite her unwavering faith sarahs weary spirit flagged but why should it be she asked one day as she sat by the rude bed to which poor old esther was confined and in answer to her observation it was only what she had feared but why should it be there must be some reason for our being so shunned those of the stranger faith of course could not employ us but our ownhow much better and happier we might be if they would take us into their families and unite us by kindness on the one hand and obedience and faithfulness on the other it certainly would make us happier but we must be better fitted for it sarah dear before it can be accomplished replied the old woman you dont know anything of the majority of us here how many of us hate the very idea of going into service what a dreadful deal of pride is amongst us and such false pride we very often throw away those that would be our friends and repay sometimes with abuse any kindness then again we want to be taught our proper duties it is not enough to read our bibles and prayer books because a great many are blinded to what they tell us we want some one to explain them and tell us plainly what we ought to do and may do without breaking our religion because you see dear when we were in jerusalem some things must have been different to what they can be now and as servants we might be called upon to do some things which we think we ought not then it is all very true about being lazy and sometimes insolent we must set about doing all we can to be kinder to ourselves before we can expect anybody to be kinder to us i see that now quite clearly though i did not once but for you darling you are good enough for anybody to find a treasure in you i wish i could help you there is one good kind charitable lady that i would send you to but a sister of mine behaved so ungratefully to her that i do not like intruding on her again she nearly clothed my sisters little girl and would you believe it becky went to her house and abused her what right forsooth had she to know that her child wanted clothes sarah uttered an exclamation of surprise indeed and yes dear and so you see though i had nothing to do with it i dont much like to go to miss leon again but you might though i am sure she would do what she could for you sarah eagerly inquired who this miss leon was none of your very rich carriage people dear indeed i dont know how she contrives to do all the good she does for she is not half as rich as many who think themselves poor she finds out those who want help she employs all she possibly can she gets us work from others makes our interests hers teaches our girls all sorts of useful knowledge gives many a poor family the meal on which they break their fast and all such good acts comes amongst us and somehow or other always does us good i dont know how many people she cured of rheumatism last winter by supplying them with some doctors stuff and warm clothing then as for the girls schools i dont know what would become of them without her she gets them work cuts out all they want and teaches them often herself she is a good creature god bless her i lost a kind friend by beckys behaving as she did for i never had the face to go to her again and i would not have her come to this low place but that she would not mind as she does not care for the world in doing good sarah listened eagerly had she indeed found a friend yet she checked her rising hopes miss leon might do her service but might not have the power before she could make up her mind to seek her she received as was her custom every month at least a long letter from the dear home she had left she had stated her many disappointments to her aunt and that beloved relative entreated her to return tell your father she wrote two thirds you earn shall be honestly sent to him and you can better much better support him here than in london entreat him to let you return to usall our happiness is damped when we think of your heavy trials come to us my love it can scarcely be your duty to remain any longer where you are sarah read this letter to her father hoping more than she dared acknowledge to herself that he would see how much better it would be for her to return but for this he was far too selfish sarah had so rivetted all the affection which he was capable of feeling that he would not let her leave him he was jealous and angry that she should so love her absent friends and swore that they should not take any more of her heart from him he would rather remain as he was than she should work for him at liverpool he did not want her labour he wanted her love and that she would not give him sarah submitted with a strange feeling of consolation amidst her sorrowdid he indeed want her love oh if she could but believe it she might have some influence over him yet not long after this as she was sitting reading one morning to poor old esther that holy book which was now as great a comfort to esther as to herself a lady unexpectedly entered and before even she heard her name sarah guessed who she was there was the decided manner and kind speech of which esther had spoken the plain attire with which to avert notice she ever went her rounds of charity and even had there been none of these peculiarities the very fact of her coming to that poor place at all proclaimed miss leon she gently upbraided the poor old woman for not letting her know she was ill and needed kindness would not accept her plea that after her sisters ungrateful conduct she could have no right to appeal to her and by a very few judicious words set esthers heart at rest she inquired what her ailing was seemed to understand it at once and promised soon to get her about again god bless you lady dear exclaimed the grateful creature fervently only the other day was i talking about you and all you did not that i wanted youfor you see my threescore and ten years are almost run out and it signifies little now if i suffer more or lessbut for this poor girl bless you lady you could do so much for her i ought not to call her poor though for in one sense god has made her rich enough and she has been a good angel to me with a vivid blush of true modest feeling that attracted miss leons penetrative eye at once sarah tried to check the old womans garrulity but in vain she would pour out all that sarah had done for her and wanted and suffered for herself and who she was and how brought up and where she came from miss leon meanwhile had quietly taken a seat and without the smallest symptom of impatience or failing interest listened to the tale when it was concluded she put some questions to sarah the answers to which appeared much to please and satisfy her she promised to do what she could making however no professions that could excite delusive hopes yet somehow leaving such comfort behind her that on her departure sarah sought her own room to pour forth her swelling thanksgiving to god miss leon never made professions but she always acted when it was known amongst her friends where she had been and whose daughter she intended if possible to befriend a complete storm of advice and warning and censure had to be encountered but adelaide leon was not to be daunted for advice she was grateful but timidity and selfish consideration never entered her code of charity she felt no fear of consequences whatever even had she to come in contact with levison himself she saw nothing very dreadful in it and as for the censure she smiled very quietly at the idea but when her conscience told her she was right it mattered little what other people said in a word she did as most strong minded right people dofinally carried her point she went to see esther three times that week and before a month had passed the old woman was able to sit up doing a little knitting which miss leon herself had taught her and sarah went sometimes four days in the week to work at the square a very brief period of intercourse convinced miss leon that sarah certainly was a superior person and her benevolent intentions did not terminate in merely getting her daily work she had not enough in her own family to occupy her sufficiently and many in her circle were too prejudiced to follow her good example now it so happened miss leon had a widowed sister a mrs corea who had four little girls and was in want of a young woman to attend on and work for them and take care of them when they were not with her or their governess genteel and modest in her manners without a portion of pride or insolence truly and unostentatiously pious and withal better informed on many subjects than very many who profess a great deal sarah was just the very person whom miss leon could desire to be with her nieces but the difficulties she had to contend with before she accomplished the end we have no space to dilate on mrs corea was about as weak minded prejudiced and foolish as miss leon was the contrary first she had a horror of all low born people however they might be brought up and no one could say but that if sarah was levisons child she was the very lowest of the low secondly she could not have a jewess she would give the children all sorts of superstitious ignorant ideas and was as helpless and exacting as any fine lady and thirdly and most convincing of all in her own ideas she did not like the plan and would not have her what would people say toodoing what no one else did fortunately for our poor sarah miss leon never desponded when determined to do good the more difficulties she had to contend with the more determined was she to carry her point and to the surprise of everybody even in this she succeeded mrs corea yielded to perseverance it was too much trouble to say no any longer she had seen no one that would do and adelaide had promised she would take all the blame and answer everybody who meddled and found fault and if sarah did not suit why adelaide would take the blame for that too and never torment her to take a jewess again sarah did not know all that miss leon had encountered in her cause but she knew it was to her she owed the comfortable situation in which she was at length installed and the grateful girl not only prayed god to bless her benefactress but to bless her own efforts that she might do her duty to her young charge and in serving them prove her gratitude to their aunt with her father she had at first a difficult part to play he of course could not be allowed to come to the house to see her and he had sworn she should go nowhere where he might not be admitted a voiceless prayer that his heart might be changed rose from sarahs heart as she attempted to tell him of her plans and the prayer was heard for to her own astonishment her gentle arguments and meek persuasions were successful his anger subsided at first into sullenness then he seemed endeavouring to conceal some strong emotion and at last as she drew closer to him trembling and fearful conjuring his reply he caught her in his arms kissed her again and again bade god bless her and spare her till he was a better man when she would love him more he knew she could not as he was but for her sake there was nothing she could not persuade him to do she did not know how much he loved her and as sarah sobbed from many varied feelings on his bosom she thanked god that he had called her to her father and permitted her even in the midst of sorrow and sin to cling to him still chapter iv our readers must imagine a period of eighteen months since we bade them farewell but few changes had taken place leah simeon and joseph continued in their respective situations every year increasing their wages and riveting the esteem and goodwill of their employers the widow might have had another home in a gayer part of the town but she refused to leave the lowly dwelling she had so dearly loved until leah or one of her sons had a home to keep which she was needed one change in the widows household had indeed taken place for ruth was in london sarahs excellent conduct had interested miss leon not only in herself but in her family as they were all comfortably providing for themselves miss leon could find no object for her active benevolence but the little ruth the poor child had not indeed so many resources as many similarly afflicted for though all were desirous none knew how to teach her it so happened miss leon was peculiarly interested in ruth because she had once had a sister who was blind one whom she had so dearly loved that she had learned the whole method of tuition for the blind simply for that sisters sake she died just when she was of an age to know all that affection had done for her and miss leon now offered to impart all she knew to ruth to give her board and lodging at her house till she was enabled to earn something for herself when she herself would send her to her mother it was a hard struggle before the widow could consent to part with her darling but the representations of leah and simeon and ruths own yearnings to be able to do something for herself overcame all selfish considerations she could not feel miss leon a stranger for her kindness to sarah had made her name never spoken without a blessing and sarah would always be near ruth to watch over and write of her and so with tears of thankfulness the widow consented leah was often permitted to take her work to the widows cottage and pursue it there and the little christian girl to whom ruth and sarah had been so kind was delighted to come and do any cleaning or scouring in the house or sit with the widow and work and read for her to prove how grateful she was and where was reuben perez all this while were his mothers prayers for him still unanswered alas farther and farther did they seem from fulfilment he had left liverpool to accept in conjunction with his father in law the management of a bank in one of the smaller towns of yorkshire and of course even his casual visits were discontinued not that they were of much avail going as he did but still his mother had hoped against her better reason that while near her he would never entirely take himself away now that hope was at an end he was thrown entirely amongst gentiles and sabbaths and holidays seemed wholly given up he did not often write home but when he did always affectionately and his mothers allowance was regularly paid she yearned to see and bless him once again but months above a year passed and his foot had never passed her threshold with regard to sarah a very few months association with her though only in the relative positions of mistress and servant had completely conquered mrs coreas prejudices and the very indolence and foolishness which had originally been so difficult to overcome was now as likely to ruin as they formerly had been to oppose but fortunately sarah was not one for indulgence and confidence to spoil indeed she often regretted her mistresss indolence from the responsibility it devolved on her mrs corea had repeatedly allowed herself to be cheated and deceived because it was too much trouble to find fault she often permitted the most serious annoyances in her establishmentkeys and even money repeatedly lying about her children neglected their clothes often thrown aside long before they were worn out in a very few months sarahs ready mind discovered this state of things one only she had the power of herself to remedythe neglect of her charge and so admirably did she do her duty by them that miss leon felt herself amply rewarded finding it was of no use to entreat mrs corea to have more regard to her own interest and not allow herself so repeatedly to be deceived sarah in distress appealed to miss leon who quietly smiled and assured her she would soon settle matters entirely to mrs coreas satisfaction she did so by giving to sarahs care almost the entire charge of the housekeeping with strict injunctions to take care of her mistresss keys and purse whenever she saw them lying about sarah at first painfully shrunk from the responsibility knowing well it would expose her yet more to the dislike of her fellow servants who as a jewess already regarded her with prejudice mrs corea was charmed that such a vast amount of trouble was spared her telling everybody sarah was a treasure and she only wondered there were not more jewish servants but our readers must not imagine that sarahs situation was all delightful she had many painful prejudices to bear with many slights and unkindness in her fellow servants to forgive and forget many jests at her peculiar religion and ridicule at its formsmuch that to a character less gently firm and forbearing would have led to such domestic bickering and misery that she would have been compelled to leave her place or perhaps have been induced weakly to hide if it did not shake her reverence for the observance of her ancient faith but sarah had not read her bible in vain she had not now to learn that such prejudice and scorn were of god not of man that he permitted these things in his wisdom to teach his people though they were still his own still his beloved their sins had demanded chastisement and thus received it that the very prejudice in which by the ignorant they were held was proof of the bibles truthproof that they were his chosen and his firstborn and more consolatory still that as the threatenings were thus fulfilled so in his own good time would be his promises sarah never wavered in the line of duty which she had marked out for herselfto make manifest that her faith was of god by actions not by words and she so far succeeded that after a while peace was established between her and her fellow servants they began to think even if she were a heathen she was a very harmless and often a very kind one and there was not so much difference between them as at first they had fancied these are but trifling things to mention but we most particularly wish our readers to understand that though good conduct will inevitably find reward even on earth it is not to be expected that it will have no trials virtue and religion will not exempt us from suffering but they teach us so to bear them that we can derive consolation and unfailing hope even in the darkest hours and instead of raising a barrier between us and our god they draw us nearer and nearer to him till we can realize his immeasurable love towards us and tracing every suffering from his hand sent for our good to love him more and more and in that very love find comfort do not then let us practise religion and virtue because we think they have power to shield us from all trial and sorrow but simply for the love of him who bids us practise them and who has promised if we seek him he will heal our sorrows and heighten our joys one unspeakable source of comfort sarah had it was that her influence with her father rather increased than lessened with him once every month she spent the sabbath evening with him and she felt that indeed he loved her old esther told her even that when she was absent he was an altered man he sought employment and after some difficulty found it though it was of a kind so humble that before sarah came to town he would have spurned it as so derogatory to his pride he would rather starve than have it but now it was welcome because he would not be a burden on his sarah his sarahevery dormant virtue seemed to spring into life with those dear precious words the very interjections of that sacred name of god which had been once ever on his lips were now constantly checked she does not like it my angel sarah and i will not say it esther heard him mutter when the accustomed phrase broke from him and many other evil habits that thoughtmy angel sarahhad equal power to remove the bad man seemed fast breaking from his sins and it was from the influence of his gentle pious child the father was at work within him and god blessed him through that feeling and through his daughters unceasing prayers every time sarah visited him she saw more to hope more for which with grateful tears to bless her god and each time to love him more and feel she was yet more beloved on sarahs returning home one afternoon after a brief visit to old esther who was not quite well she was informed a young man had called to see her and stayed some time but as she did not come as soon as they expected he had gone away promising to return in the course of the evening he had not left his name they added but he seemed a gentleman quite a gentleman though one of her own nation and was in the deepest mourning sarah was not one given to speculation or curiosity though she did wonder who this gentleman could be but quietly continued her usual employments she had just finished dressing her young ladies to go with their mother to the theatre and ran down to see them safely in the carriage when the footman called out sarah the gentleman has come again he is waiting for you in the housekeepers room she went accordingly but her self possession almost deserted her when on looking up in the face of the stranger as she entered she recognised at once her cousin reubenpale thin and worn indeed but still himself and it required a powerful effort even in that strong and simple mind to evince no feeling but surprise and welcome few words however at the first moment passed between them reuben sprang forward as she entered and clasped both her hands in his which were cold and trembling and she saw his lip quiver painfully and to her grief and almost terror as she spoke to him he gradually let go her hands and sinking on the nearest chair covered his face with his handkerchief and wept like a child i terrify you dear cousin do forgive me he said at length as he heard the gentle voice which sought to soothe him falter in spite of herself sarah dear sarah i do not know why your kind voice should affect me thus i cannot tell you why i have come to grieve you with my grief except that when i least desired it you were always kind and good and feeling and gave me comfort when i could not console myself and my heart has so yearned to you nownow when your own word has come to pass to tell you you were right in prosperity i might be happy though god knows it was but a strange unnatural happiness but in afflictionsarah do you remember your own words she did remember them but she had no voice to repeat them then and her quivering lip alone gave answer her cousin continued almost choked with many emotions if affliction if deathmay you never repent your engagement then these were the words you said and oh how often the last few months have they returned to me affliction has come my own cousin affliction oh such affliction that god alone could senddeath even death the word was almost inaudible death repeated sarah startled at once into perfect consciousness she looked at his dressthe deepest mourningand the words more fell from her than were spoken not jeanie your own jeanietell me it is not she then as she read his answer in the tighter pressure of his hand the convulsive movement of his lips she threw her arms round him and faintly exclaiming reuben my poor reuben may god grant you his comfort burst into tears nothing is so true a balm to the afflicted as unaffected sympathy and reuben roused himself from his own sorrow to bless his cousin for her tears yet bid her not weep for him it is better thus my gentle cousin the god of my parents has revealed himself to their sinful offspring even in his chastening i cannot tell you all now dear sarah how even when life seemed all prosperous around me there was still a void withini was not happy i had returned to virtue turned aside from all irregular and sinful pursuits kept steady to business and in doing kind acts towards men and more still i had a gentle being who so loved me that she forced me into loving her more than when i first sought her for then thensarah do not hate mei did but seek her because i thought a union with a christian would put a final barrier between me and the race i had taught myself to hatewould mark me no more a jew and so for this this dreadful sin i banished feelings which had once been mine sarah do not ask me what they were yet still still even when i did love my fair and gentle wife when she lavished on me such affection it ought to have brought but joy i was not happy i was away from all who knew my birth and race the once hated name a jew no longer hurt my ears courted flattered admired sarah sarah was it not strange there was still that gnawing void she looked up with streaming eyes it was a void no man could fill dear cousin you thought its cause was of earth and sought with earth to fill it but now oh let us thank god his image fills it now you have guessed aright my sarah as you always do but oh you know not all i endured before it was so filled i tried to believe with my jeanie and her father but i could not i attended their church at times i listened to their doctrines i read their books but no no gods finger was upon me i could not believe in any saviour any redeemer but himself and then that holy name that sacred subject which should be the dearest link between those that love never found voice we dared not read each others thoughts when we married you know jeanie thought little of those things but she became acquainted with a good and holy man a pious minister of her own faith and he made her think more seriously and what followed she loved me more and more but she knew i did not believe in that saviour whose recognition she deemed necessary for my salvation and so she drooped and drooped at the very time when nature demanded greater sustenance and support in a few months i was a father o god the agony of that hour which should have been all bliss then i felt in all its fulness there was a god and i had neglected him my innocent babe might be snatched from me as davids was for its fathers sin and how was i to avert this miseryhow devote it to its god as its mother believed i shuddered from that hour my jeanie sunk even though they said she had recovered all effects of her confinement month after month i watched over her i heard her clinging to a faith a saviour which to me was mockery i heard her call aloud for help and mercy from jesus not from god sarah it is in vain i cannot tell you what those hours were you can tell their anguish for you warned me such might be he paused every limb trembling with his emotion and sarah almost as much affected entreated him not to harrow his feelings by such recollections any more bear with me dear cousin i shall be better happier when all is told i saw her look on our infant thank god it was a girl with the big tear stealing down her pale face and i knew of what she thought yet i could not i dared not give her the only promise that might be her comfort and her love for me was so strong so intense she had no voice to ask it at length one evening after mr vaughan the clergyman had been urging on her the necessity of her child receiving baptism she called me to her and laying her head on my bosom conjured me to grant her last request the only one she said she had ever feared to ask me her voice was faint from weakness yet it thrilled so on my heart that it was a struggle to reply and conjure her not to say more i knew what she would ask but she interrupted me by sinking on her knees before me and wildly reiterating her prayer my child my child let her be made purelet me feel i shall look upon her again reuben my husband have mercy on us all sarah had that moment been all my punishment it would have been enough why could i not feel then as i had so often declared before that all faiths were the same in the sight of god why could i not make this promise to the dying and beloved i know not i know not now save that i felt myself a father and the immortal spirit of my child was of more value than my own had ever been i raised her i solemnly vowed that i would study both faithsi would read with and listen to mr vaughan and if i could believe my child should be reared a christian and be baptized with myself she raised her sweet face to mine with such a smile bless you bless you my own husband we shall all meet again then oh you have made me so happy jesus will savewill bring us all to her sweet voice sunk and her head drooped down on my bosom and thinking she was exhausted i clasped her closer to me and kissed her again and again nearly half an hour passed and i felt no movement heard no breath it was quite dark and with sudden terror i called aloud for lights they were brought i lifted the bright curls from her dear face and raised her head it was vain vain he ceased abruptly and there was silence for sarah could not speak reuben hastily paced the room then reseating himself by his cousin continued more calmly but limited as we are for space we are forbidden to continue the conversation though it deepened in interest even as it subsided in emotion reuben told how he had faithfully kept his promisehow for two months he had remained with his father in law studying the word of god and listening to all the instructions of mr vaughan whose very kindness and true piety in spirit made his arguments more difficult to resist than had they been harshly and determinately enforced a year was the period reuben had promised to devote to the fulfilment of his vow and if at the end of that time he could believe in jesus he and his child would of course be made christians but if his studies had a contrary effect no more either by mr wilson or the clergyman would be said to him on the subject sarah my dear cousin do not fear for me my god did not forsake me even when i forsook him he will not then forsake me now that i seek him and night and day implore him to reveal that path that faith which is most acceptable to him i have already read and felt enough to glory in the faith i once despisedto feel it is a privilege aye and a proud one to be a jew for the rest let us trust in him and your child dear reubenwhere is she with mrs vaughan at present at the conclusion of the year god willing and my mother is spared she shall be cared for by the same tender love which her erring father only now knows how to value and return and does my aunt know this no sarah no i cannot tell her i feel as if i had no right to go to her again until i have indeed returned with heart and soul to the faith in which all her gentle counsels had not power to retain me no no no i cannot cannot claim the solace of her love till i am worthy to be called her son in faith as well as love the cousins were long together and much much was spoken between them which we would fain repeat as likely to be useful to our readers but we are warned to desist enough to know that sarah prevailed on reuben to write to his mother and tell her all even if the story of his inward life were otherwise kept secret reuben said he had given up his place in the bank and intended for the remainder of the year to endeavour to obtain a situation in some jewish counting house as clerk for some hours in the day and thus allow him evenings sabbaths and holidays for his sacred purpose it was with this intention he had come up to london as though he might have procured employment in liverpool or manchester he shrunk from all remark even kindness from his own nation until he had in truth returned to them he had brought with him letters of high recommendation which had obtained a capital situation in a thriving house of his own nation a branch of which resided in birmingham to which place it was likely he should go it is not that i fear the temptations of this large city dearest sarah that i would rather live elsewhere no i shrink from all scenes of pleasure now with sensation of loathing but i feel as if it would be better for me to be alone even away from those i most love till this one year is passed sarah will you think of me pray for me he took both her hands and looked pleadingly in her face it would be a comfort such a comfort to come to you for sympathy for counsel for you it was when we watched together by my sick mothers bed who first made me feel that were all like you the name a jew would cease to be reproached but no no it is better for meperhaps too for your character dear girlthat we should not meet yet awhile i threw away happiness once when it might perchance have been mine and nowbut it is better thus he had spoken incoherently and he broke off abruptly sarah only answered by the simple assurance that she never ceased to pray for his happiness nor would she now and soon after they separated affectionately confidingly as in long past years perchance yet more so for then a barrier was between them now there was none their rock of refuge the shield of their salvation was the same to define sarahs feelings as she prostrated herself before her god in prayer that night is indeed impossible nor is there needsurely the coldest the most callous can imagine them and give her sympathy not indeed that hope was dawning for her long tried long hidden affection for reuben never dreamed he was so loved it was simply thanksgiving the purest most heartfelt that her prayers were heardthe beloved one of her heart brought back to his god yet many were the secret tears she shed as she pictured her cousins anguish she gave not one single thought to those words which a less guileless heart might have believed related to herself she never thought of the consequences which reubens return to his faith might bring to her individually it was enough of happiness to feel he had sought her in his sorrow had felt her as his friend but sorrow was at hand as unexpected as terrible about four or five months after her interview with reuben old esther came to her one day in such extremity of grief and horror that even her little share of discretion vanished before it and she imparted her tidings to sarah so suddenly that the poor girl stood stunned and paralyzed preserved only by a strong though almost unconscious effort from fainting levison had been taken up and carried to newgate as an accomplice in an act of burglary and robbery which attended by circumstances of unusual notoriety had been lately committed in the neighbourhood of epping levison had loudly and fiercely asserted his innocence but of course his asseverations had been disregarded but he has said ithe has said it he has declared he is innocent and he ishe is reiterated poor sarah with a violent burst of tears which restored sense and energy esther however seemed to derive no comfort from the assertion yes dear yes i do believe he is not guiltybad as some of us are we do not do such things who ever heard of a jew being a housebreaker or a thief but who will believe him who will take his word his oath oh what will become of us and the old woman rocked herself to and fro in the misery of the thought sarah was in no state to offer the usual comfort but stunned bewildered as she was her thought formed itself into unconscious prayer for help and strength her plan of action was decided on the instant she would she must go to him in vain esther bade her think of the consequences what would her mistress say if she knew that sarah was any way related to levison the reputed housebreaker much less that she was his daughter would you then advise me if this misery come to her knowledge deny my father now that he may need me more than ever oh esther i cannot do this replied sarah mournfully though firmly my mistress need not know my errand now perhaps and this terrible trial may be permitted to pass away before it comes to the worst but should it indeed reach her ears i cannot deny him he has only me and if it cause me the loss of my situation of my character in the opinion of my fellow creatures my god will love me care for me still i cannot desert my father and while she seeks him we must inform our readers briefly as may be how the matter really stood levison had been seen and recognised talking to a party of men the evening previous to the nights robbery no one could swear to his person as accessory to the act by having seen him in the house but in such earnest conversation with those who were taken in the fact that he was in consequence committed as one of the gang for the apprehension of whom a large reward had been offered it was true none of the stolen property had been found on his person or in his dwelling but these facts were little heeded in his favour he was a jewa man who had been noted for his dishonest practices in business and consequently there was no one to come forward with such report of his former character as could be taken in his favour he persisted that he was innocent that though he had been talking to the men as was alleged he knew nothing of their real character or intentions that he had been acquainted with them formerly but only in the way of business that they knew he had separated from them at seven oclock that evening to proceed several miles in a contrary direction to the burial ground of his people where he had been engaged to watch beside the grave of one that day interred the person who had been engaged to do so having been suddenly taken ill and asked him levison to watch in his stead how could he prove this he was asked the unhappy man groaned aloud for answerhe had no proof some one a gentleman had indeed visited the grave at break of day had demanded who he was and why he was there instead of the person engaged and he answered giving his full name the gentleman had thrown him money and hastily departed but who or what he was except a jew as himself levison did not know of course such a tale and from such a person was not to be believed and he was committed to newgate with his supposed accomplices to take his trial it was with great difficulty sarah gained admittance to his cell but it was not till in his presence till the door was closed upon her for a specified time that the energy which supported her throughout gave way she could but throw herself on her knees before him but fling her arms round him and sob forth father the convulsions of agony and fear which shook her every limb depriving her at once of power and of voice the effect of her presence on levison was terrible he gave vent to a wild shrill cry then catching her to his bosom gasped forth my daughter oh my daughter the god of wrath and justice will withdraw his hand if you are near and then sunk back in a strong convulsive fit perhaps it was as well that the poor girl was thus compelled to exertion terrified as she was she knew to call for help was useless for who could hear her but by unloosening his collar and the application of cold water which happened to be in the room after a few minutes of intense terror she saw the convulsive struggles gradually give way and he lay sensible but exhausted it was then she saw the ravages either illness or imprisonment had made it seemed as if even death itself was upon him he had never quite recovered the illness which had originally called her to london and the last few days seemed to have brought it back with increase of suffering and complete prostration of physical power his black hair had whitened and his form was bent as if a burden of many years had descended upon him his features were contracted and wan as death sarah sarah i thought god had forsaken me but i see you and i know he has not miserable and guilty as i amguilty of many sins as i know i feel nowbut not of this no no no my child my child i am innocent of this i turned away from vice and sin for your sake i made a vow to try and become worthy of such an angel child and see see what has come upon me i have been deceiving and dishonest in former days but even then i never never turned aside to stealto join a gang of thieves sarah sarah i thought to make you happy at last and i shall be but your curse your misery perhaps you too will not believe me but i am innocent of this crime my child my child i am indeed it was long ere sarahs gentle soothings and earnest assurances of her firm belief in his perfect innocence could calm the fearful agitation of her unhappy father still her presence the pressure of her hand was such comfort that a light appeared to have gleamed on the darkness of his despair and he poured forth his agonizing thoughts his terrors alike of life and death and eternity as if his child were indeed the ministering angel of hope and faith and comfort which his deep love believed her had i not you my daughter oh there would be no hope no mercy for one like me i have disobeyed and profaned my god and taken his holy name in vain and called down on me his wrath his vengeance and how can i how dare i hope for mercy i cannot repenti cannot seek righteousness now it is too late too late yet god has given me you and is he then all wrath all punishment tell me tell me there is mercy for the sinner even now father dear father there is has he not said it yes and reiterated it in his holy book till the most doubting of us must believe he hath no pleasure in the death of the wicked but rather that he should turn from his wickedness and live bidding us repent and believe and that in the day we did so our guilt should not be rememberedshould not appear against us telling us but to confess our sin to throw ourselves on his mercy that mercy all perfect to purify redeem and savethat he is merciful and gracious long suffering abundant in mercy and loveshowing mercy unto thousands my father oh my father there is no sin so infinite as his mercyno sin for which repentance and love and faith in him will not in his sight atone but i can make no atonement my child i can do nothing to prove repentancethat i would serve and love him nownothing to make reparation for past sin too late too late and he groaned aloud he does not ask works my father when he knows they cannot be performed have you not sought him this last year in penitence and prayer and amendment of your ways and does not he record this though man may not and now oh do but believe in him in his will and power to forgive and savedo but call upon him with the faith and repentance of a sorrowing child oh my father god asks no more than we can do his sacrifices are a broken heart and a contrite spirit which we all have power to bestow he has told us this blessed truth through the lips of one who had the power to do and give much more in atonement for his sin that we who can do nothing but believe and repent may be comforted father my own dear father if indeed you repent and love and believe oh god is near you will save you still much much more did sarah say as she sat on the straw pallet where her unhappy father half reclined her dark truthful eyes often swelling in large tears fixed on his face as she spoke it was impossible for one whom her influence the last twelvemonth had already through gods mercy changed in heart to listen to her healing words and look on her sweet pleading face and yet retain the doubts and terrors of despair it seemed to levison that if such a being could love and pity him and cling to him thus even in a prison cell he could not be cut off from all of heavenly hopethe all pitying love and consoling promises of god appeared to him through her as if by a voice from heaven they could not deceive and even in the depth of repentant agonyfor it was true repentancethere was comfort sarah was summoned away only too soon but she promised to visit him often again the piece of gold which she had slid into the turnkeys hand she knew would be her passport but to do this unknown to her mistress was an act of injustice towards her which her pure mind rejected yet how to tell her the determination was made but on the manner of fulfilling it poor sarah thought some time perhaps it was fortunate she was roused to exertion on entering the kitchen for something she wanted she saw her fellow servants congregated in a knot together the footman reading aloud the account of the robbery and the committal of the gang from the newspapers he stopped as she entered and every eye turned on her her cheek grew white as ashes and her lip quivered so as to be remarked by all the footman seemed about to speak but the housemaid laid her hand on his arm with an imploring look to forbear it was enough sarah felt she could better leave her mistress than encounter the questions or suspicions of her fellow servants and that instant she sought the parlour miss leon was with her sister the ghastly paleness and agonized expression of the poor girls face struck her at once and with accents of earnest kindness she inquired what was the matter bursting into tears sarah almost inarticulately related the heavy trial which had befallen her and her intention to give up her situation confidential happy as it was to devote herself to her unfortunate father feeling that the child of one suspected as he was could bring but disreputableness to a respectable family sarah felt her story was incoherent but that it was understood was visible in its effects mrs corea selfish and weak as her wont thought only of the trouble and annoyance sarahs resignation of her situation would bring her and overwhelmed her with reproaches as ungrateful and capricious miss leon spoke calmly and reasonably there was no need for any decisive parting sarah might leave them for a time if she were desirous of doing so though she did not think it wise that if mrs corea valued her so much she could have no objection to her returning what the daughter of a pickpocket a housebreaker no no if sarah were fool enough to say she were the daughter of such a person she would have nothing more to do with her but there was no need for her to do so what was to prevent her disclaiming all relationship and what good could she do him or herself by going to him it was all folly there were plenty of levisons in the world nobody need know this levison was sarahs father if the girl herself were not such a fool as to betray it and can you advise this miss leon implored sarah turning towards her oh do not do not say so i would not displease one so kind and good as you are i would do anything everything to show you i am grateful but i cannot oh i cannot deny my father i should never know a happy day again miss leon was not at all a person to evince useless emotion but there was certainly something rising in her throat which made her voice husky ere she replied reasonable and feeling however as her arguments were that without actually denying or deserting her father she need not ruin her own reputation for ever by proclaiming it was to visit him in person she left her place sarah could at that moment only feel her future was bound up in her fathers we have not however space to dilate on all miss leon urged or sarah felt suffice it that the next morning sarah turned away from the house which for nearly two years had been a happy home she knew not if she should ever be welcome there again miss leon was indeed still her friend but how could even she aid her now she returned to that dilapidated dwelling where old esther still lived feeling that heavy as she had thought her trial when she had first entered those doors it was light it was joy to that which was hers now day after day in the brief period intervening before levisons final trial did his devoted daughter visit his cell and not in vain the terror the anguish which had possessed him were passing from his soul he did believe in the saving power of his god he did approach his throne with a broken and contrite heart and it was the prayers the faith the forbearing devotion of his child which brought him there sarah had told all his story to miss leon who had listened attentively though she herself feared that to remedy this and prove him innocent was even to her energetic benevolence impossible the morning of the trial came the court was crowded for the extensive robberies traced home to this gang occasioned unusual excitement the trembling heart of the daughter felt that to wait to hear of its termination and her fathers sentence was impossible the very effort would drive her mad in vain old esther remonstrated offered infirm as she was to go herself if sarah would but remain quietly at home sarah insisted on accompanying her muffled up so as not to be recognised they mingled with the thronging crowds were jostled pushed and otherwise annoyed yet sarah knew it notseemed conscious of nothing till her eyes rested on her misguided father what was it she hoped she knew not except a strange undefined belief that even now in the eleventh hour his innocence would be made evident alas poor girl the summary proceedings of a court of justice on a gang of noted criminals allowed no saving clause he was sworn to as having been seen with them and that was sufficient all he said was unheeded perhaps unheard and sentence of transportation for life was pronounced on every man by name isaac levison included sarah did not scream she thought she did not faint for the words rung in her ears as repeated by a hundred echoes each one louder than the other but except this power of hearing every other sense seemed suddenly stilled she did not know whose arm led her from that terrible scenewho was conducting her hastily yet tenderly towards home she walked on quick quicker still as if the rapidity of movement should hush that mocking sound it would not it could not and when she was at home she sunk down powerless conscious only of misery that even faith might not remove sarah my own sarah look up speak to me this silence is terrible exclaimed a voice which roused her as with an electric shock reuben perez was beside her his arm around her the ice of misery the restraint of long hidden feelings were broken by the power of that voice and laying her head on his shoulder she sobbed in uncontrollable agony he told her how he had seen the name of levison in the papers and his defence and how he had trembled lest it should be her father how anxiously he had wished to come up at once to london but was unavoidably prevented leaving birmingham till the previous night how he had proceeded to the court at once recognised levison and at the same moment guided by some strange instinct looked for and found sarah muffled as she was he had gradually and with difficulty made his way through the crowd towards her and reached her just as the sentence was pronounced old esther had begged him to take care of sarah home as she could follow more slowly he tried to speak comfort respecting her father but in this he failed shudderingly she reiterated the sentence transportation and for lifeto be sent away to work to die untended unloved and then as with sudden thought she started up no no no she exclaimed a hectic glow tinging her pallid cheek why cannot i go too not with him they will not let me do that but there are ships enough taking out emigrants and i can meet him therebe with him again they shall not separate the father from his child and he is innocent my father my poor father your sarah will not forsake you even now and she wept again but less painfully than before startled as he was reuben could yet feel this was scarcely a resolution to be kept and with argument and persuasion sought to turn her from her purpose her father could not need such sacrifice how could she aid him in his far distant dwelling he has but mehe has but me she reiterated who is there that has claim enough to keep me from him i have thought a former trial heavy to be borne but had it not been for that my poor father might have died in sin for perhaps i could not have come to him as i did when free no no i was destined to be the instrument in the hands of mercy in bringing him back to the god he had offended and i may do so still reuben reuben who is there has such claim upon me as my poor poor father others love me and oh god only knows how i love them but they are happy and prosperous they do not need me sarah answered reuben his voice choked with emotion sarah you spoke of a former heavy trial one hard to bear oh answer me speak to me was not i its cause i deceived myself when i thought i had not injured your peace when i wrecked my own it matters little now replied sarah turning from his look while her cheek again blanched to marble my path is marked out for me i may not leave it even to think of what has been or might be it cannot must not matter now it mustit shall exclaimed reuben with more than wonted impetuosity sarah sarah you ask me who needs you as your father doesto whom you can be as you are to him i answer there is one one to whom as to your father you have been a guardian angel winning him back even by your memory when far separated to the god he had forsaken i trampled on the love i bore youmy own feelings as well as yoursto unite myself with a strange race to bid all who knew me cease to regard me as a jew i sought to believe i had nothing to reproach myself with as i had not caused you grief and yetconscience conscience oh sarah my poor jeanies very love was constant agony for i could not return it i never loved her as i loved you even though she wound herself about my very heart and her death seemed misery i looked to the end of this twelvemonth to feel myself worthy to tell you all my sin my misery and if you could forgive me to conjure you to become mine oh do not sentence me to increase of trial i looked to you to train up my motherless jeanie as indeed a child of god according to your own pure belief and to bind me to him by links i could never even in the strongest temptation turn aside and now now when my heart tells me i was deceived and i had injured youfor you did love me you do love meoh will you leave mefor a doubtful duty part from me for ever i care not how long i serve to win you sarah sarah only tell me you can still love me you will be mine too late too late oh it is all too late replied sarah firmly though her voice was choked with tears reuben dear reuben why have you spoken thus and at this moment it were a weak and idle folly to deny that to be your wife would be the dearest happiness which could be mine that i have loved you long before i knew what love could mean and prayed for you wept for youbut i must not think of these things now months ago such words from you would have been all joy but nowdo not speak them dearest reubenthey increase my trial but cannot change my purpose my poor father is innocent condemned unjustly were he guilty i might decide otherwise for perhaps it were then less a positive duty to tend him to the last and in vain did reuben combat this determination in vain rendered more eloquent from his conviction that he was beloved did he speak and urge and speak again he desisted at length not from lack of argument but because he saw it only increased the anguish of her feelings if it must be so dearestyet indeed indeed it is a mistaken duty do not look on me so beseechingly i will urge no more for myself i know i did not merit the joy i had dared to picture yet still still to resign it thus to know you love me spite of allsarah how may i struggle on with every hope and promise blighted do not say so reuben our father will not leave you lonely seek him love him and he will fill up all the void which my absence may create and do not think we part for ever oh reuben the love borne in my heart so long can know no cloud or change and though years may pass onmy first duty be accomplishedyet when it is and my poor fathers weary course is ended if you be still free may i not return to you all all your own she lifted up her pale face to his with such a look of confidence and love that reubens only answer was to fold her to his heart and bid god bless her for such words days passed on and though all who heard her resolution were against it though she had to encounter even miss leons arguments and entreaties that she would forego a purpose as uncalled for as misguided sarah never for one moment wavered vainly miss leon sketched the miseries that would await her in a foreign land the little chance there was of her even being permitted to be near her father the little she could do for him even if they were together she reasoned well and strongly and even feelingly but there are times and duties when the heart hears only its own impulses its own feelings and must follow them had she wavered before she again met her father after his condemnation which however she did not her first interview would have strengthened her yet more there was a wild and haggard look about him a hollow tone and wandering words that made her at the first moment tremble for his reason sarah my daughter they have banished me from my god they have sentenced me to return to sin better better had they said i was to die for then i should have gone direct from you to judgment and your prayers your angel words had turned me from my sin but they will send me from you and i shall sin again i shall fall away from all the good you taught me with you with you only i am safemy daughter oh my daughter and i will not leave you fatheri go with you not in the same ship but i will meet you in a strange land we shall be together there as here i will not leave you while you need me do not look so father i have sworn it to my god she threw herself upon his neck and the sinful but repentant man wept as an infant on her shoulder and from that hour her dread that his reason was departing never tormented her again the evening before levisons removal with his fellow convicts to portsmouththe ship awaiting them therethe influence of a larger bribe than usual from reuben to the turnkey had secured to sarah a few uninterrupted hours with her father in a separate cell there was something strange in levisons countenance which rather alarmed him when he joined them it was flushed and excited and as he walked across the cell his limbs seemed to totter beneath him they had not much longer to be together when an unusual number of footsteps crowded along the passage and soon after the turnkey a sheriff and a gentleman whom neither sarah nor reuben knew though he was evidently of their own nation entered the cell there was still quite daylight sufficient to distinguish persons and features and the very instant levisons eye caught the stranger he started with a shrill cry to his feet endeavoured to spring forward but failed and would have fallen had not reuben caught him in his arms where he remained in a fit of trembling which almost seemed convulsion now be quiet my good fellow you will do well enough whispered the turnkey as he stepped forward to assist in supporting levison upon his feet here is this here gemman come to swear to your person as having seen you in the burial ground just as how you said that there night proving an alibi dye see theyll let you go even nowwhod ha thought it you said sir that you saw and spoke to a man named isaac levison of the jewish nation in the burial ground of your people on the morning of wednesday the th of may exactly as the clock of mile end church chimed three deliberately began the pompous sheriff on whose blunted sensibilities the various attitudes of agonized suspense hope and terror delineated in the group before him excited no emotion whatever i have troubled you to come here to see this man who calls himself by that name and tells the same tale seeing that if you can swear to his person he must be detained from accompanying the rest of the gang and undergo a second trial that your assertion in the court may publicly prove it i do not see much use in that interrupted the gentleman who no lawyer did not quite comprehend technicalities i should think my oath as to his person quite enough to free him i did not appear on his trial simply because i was abroad and only heard of it through a friend sending me a newspaper and the particulars of the casea friend of his wishing the mans innocence to be proved he wrote to me knowing that either i or some one belonging to me had employed a watcher that night and vague as the tale was i might help to clear it this however is nothing to the purpose if the robbery you speak of was committed at epping on the th of may just about three oclock in the morning that man isaac levison is as innocent as i am for i can take my oath as to seeing and speaking with him that very morning at that very hour in the burial ground of our people at mile end i particularly remarked him as he was not the person i had engaged there is no justice in england if you do not let him gohe is innocent innocentinnocentinnocent my child you are right there is a god and a god of love blessedblessedforgiven he bounded from the detaining arms of reuben and the turnkey clasped sarah to his heart with strange unnatural strength and fell back a corpse chapter v a small but most comfortably furnished parlour of a new respectable looking dwelling in one of the best streets of liverpool is the scene to which we must conduct our readers about two years after the conclusion of our last chapter the furniture all looked new except a kind of antique silver lamp which stood on an oaken bracket opposite the window it was a room thrown out from the usual back of the house opening by a large french window and one or two steps into a small but beautifully laid out flower garden divided by a passage and another parlour from the handsome shop which opened on the street it was a silversmith and watchmakers with the words perez brothers in large but not showy characters over the door the shop seemed much frequented there was a constant ingress and egress of respectable people but there was no bustle nothing going wrong all seemed quietness and regularity orders received and questions answered and often articles of particularly skilful workmanship displayed with that gentle courtesy and good feeling which can spring but from the heart but we are forgettingit is the parlour and not the shop with which we have to do the room and its furniture may be strangers to usperhaps one of the inmatesbut not the other the still infirm and aged but the thrice blessed thrice happy mother was still spared to bless god for the prosperity the well doing and the unchanging faith and piety of her beloved children simeons wish was fulfilledhis mother was restored to her former station nay raised higher in the scale of society than she had ever been but meek in prosperity as faithful in adversity there was no change in that widowed heart save if possible yet deeper love and gratitude to god and a beautiful picture might that gentle face have made bending down with such a smile of caressing love on the lovely infant of nearly three years who had clambered on her knee and was folding its little round arms about her neck it was a touching contrast of age and infancy for rachel looked much older than she really was but there was nothing sad in it the unusual loveliness of the child cannot be passed unnoticed the snowy skin the rich golden curls just touched with that chesnut which takes away all insipidity from fairness might have proclaimed her not a child of israel but then there was the large lustrous black eye and its long fringe the subdued soul speaking beauty of the other featuresthat was israels and israels alone full of life and joyousness her infant prattle amused her grandmother till at the closing about six in the evening her son simeon joined her we should perhaps have said that an elderly jewess remarkably clean and tidy in her person had very often entered the parlour to see she said if the dear widow were comfortable or wanted anything or little jeanie were troublesome etc it was old esther who fulfilling all sorts of offices in the family acting companion and nurse to the widow and jeanie cleaning silverin which she was very expertseeing to the cooking of the dinner and taking care of the lads clothes delighted herself and more than satisfied those with whom she lived to satisfy our readers curiosity as to how this great change in the widows condition had been brought about we will briefly narrate its origin when reubens year of probation was over and he felt he was a jew in heart and soul and reason as well as name he returned to liverpool to delight his mother with the change he was met with love and with rejoicing no reference was made to the past and between himself and simeon not a shadow of estrangement remained the latter had at first hung back feeling self reproached that he had wronged his brother but reubens truly noble nature conquered these feelings and soon after bound him to him with the ties of gratitude as well as love simeons talent for modelling in silver was now as marked as his dislike to that trade which despite of disinclination he had perseveringly followed reuben on the contrary retained all his fathers instructions in watch making and had determined when he returned to liverpool to set up that business which from the excellent capital he had amassed and laid by was not difficult to accomplish he had determined on this plan feeling as if he thus tacitly acknowledged and followed his lamented fathers wishes and atoned to him even in death for former disregard he of course wished to associate simeon in the business but as the young mans desires and talents seemed pointed otherwise he placed him for a year with a first rate silversmith in london morris simeons late master had given up business and this in itself was a capital opening for reuben he made use of it and flourished in less than eighteen months after his return to liverpool perez brothers opened their new shop as silversmiths and watchmakers and from the careful economical and strictly honourable way in which the business was carried onthe name too with the associations of the honest hard working man of whom these were the sons adding golden weighta very few months trial proved that industry economy and honesty must carry their own reward but why was the widow alone was not reuben married and should not sarah have been with her gentle reader reuben is not yet married he has now gone to fetch his sarah for the term of probation for both is over the morrow is the thirteenth birthday of the twins and the widow is expecting the return of reuben and sarah and ruth as she sits with her darling jeanie in her little parlour the evening we meet her again levisons innocence and his sudden death had of course been made public not only in an official way but through the eagerness of reuben that not a shadow of shame should ever approach his sarah when the first month of mourning had expired sarah returned to her situation her mistress quite forgetting former anger and ready to declare sarah had only done just as she ought towards her poor innocent father that she was a pattern of jewish daughters and poured forth a volume of praises all in the joy of getting her back reuben had been anxious for their marriage as soon as he had completed two years from poor jeanie wilsons early death sarah fully sympathised in his feelings towards jeanie and they would often talk of her as a being dear to and cherished by them both when the two years were completed the marriage was still delayed mrs corea entreating sarah to remain with her till she went on the continent with her daughters which she intended to do in about six or eight months she had been too indulgent a mistress and miss leon too sincere a friend for sarah to hesitate a moment in postponing her own happiness besides the delay though reuben did not like it might be beneficial to him in allowing him time to get settled in his business before the period elapsed sarah and reuben too were rejoiced that she was still in london for ruth needed her the wherefore we shall find presently are they not late mother inquired simeon as he joined his mother in her own parlour troublesome loiterers i wish they would arrivei want my tea and is that all you want simeon said the widow smiling because that may easily be satisfied no no not quite so voracious as that comes to i want the loiterers themselves though i have seen them later than you have you know you wont find sarah a whit altered she is just the gentle yet energetic creature she always was only more animated more happy i think then ruth darling ruthoh how much i owe to her i never shall forget her reminding me of my promise to my poor fatherher compelling me as it were to love my brother and now what is not that brother to me mother is it not strange how completely prejudice has gone no my dear son your heart was too truly and faithfully pious too desirous really to love its god for prejudice long to obtain the ascendant it comes sometimes in very early youth when we are apt to think we alone are quite right but unless encouraged cannot long stand the light of strengthening reason and real spiritual love but does it not seem strange mother that i alone of my family should have been the one selected to receive such extreme kindness from a christianone of those whom in former days i was more prejudiced against than i dared acknowledge i was very ill on my way home from london and as you know mr morton had me conveyed to his house instead of leaving me to the care of heartless strangers at the public innhad a physician to attend me nursed me as his own sonwould read and talk to me even after he knew i was a jew on the spirit of religion which we both felt never shall i forget the impressive tone and manner with which he said when parting with me young man never forget this important truththat heart alone in sincerity loves god who can see in every pious man a brother despite of difference of creed that difference lies between man and his god to do good and love one another is mans duty unto man and can under no circumstances and in no places be evaded learn this lesson and all the kindness i have shown you is amply rewarded is it not strange this should have occurred to me i do not think it strange my dear son replied mrs perez affectionately though seriously i believe so firmly that gods eye is ever on us that he so loves us that he guides every event of our lives as will be most for our eternal good he saw you sought to love and serve himthat the very prejudice borne towards others had its origin in the ardent love you bore your faith and his infinite mercy permitted you to receive kindness from a gentile and a stranger that this one dark cloud should be removed and your love for him be increased in the love you bear your fellow creatures may i believe this mother it would be such a comfort such a redoubled excitement to love and worship answered simeon fixing his large dark eyes beseechingly on his mothers face but can i do so without profaneness without robbing our gracious god of the sanctity which is so imperatively his due surely you may my dear boy we have the whole word of god to prove and tell us that we are each individually and peculiarly his carethat he demands the heart for dearer even than a mothers love for her infant child is his love towards us how may we give him our heart if we never think of him but as a being too inexpressibly awful to approach how feel the thanksgiving and gratitude he loves to receive if we do not perceive his guiding hand even in the simplest events of our individual lives how seek him in sorrow if we do not think he has power and will to hear and to relievein daily prayer if we were not each of us especially his own my boy if the hairs of our head are numbered can we doubt the events of our life are guided as will be but for our eternal good and draw us closer to our god think but of one dear to us both did it not seem to our imperfect wisdom that reubens marriage must for ever have divided him from his nation yet that very circumstance brought him back our father in mercy permitted him to follow his own will to be prosperous to lose even the hated badge of israel that his own heart might be his judge affliction also sent from that same gracious hand deepened the peculiar feelings which becoming a parent had already excited then the year of research put the final seal on his return to us his mind could never have believed without calm unimpassioned steady examination he has examined not alone his own faith mr vaughan from being the explainer was forced to become the defender of his own creed he drew back avowing with a candour and charity which proved how truly of god was the spirit of religion within him spite of the mistaken faith that reuben never could become a convert and we know what true friends they are notwithstanding mr vaughans disappointment they have strengthened themselves in their own peculiar doctrines without in the least shaking each others yes yes you are quite right mother dear as you always are replied simeon putting his arm round her and affectionately kissing her what a blessing it has been for me to have such a mother why how now master joseph what has happened have you lost your wits if i have it is for very joy exclaimed the boy springing into the parlour flinging his cap up to the ceiling and so stifling his mother with kisses as obliged her to call for mercy mother mother how can i tell you the good news i must scamper about before i can give them vent not another jump not another step till you have told us exclaimed simeon laughing heartily at the boys grotesque movements and catching him midway in a jump that would not have disgraced a harlequin now what is it you overgrown baby are you not ashamed not to meet joy like a man no baby ever felt such joy simeon and though i am a man to morrow i am not ashamed to act the madcap to night mother have i not told you the notice mr morales has always taken of me and the books he has lent me well my master must have said such kind things of me for what what do you think he has offeredthat is if you will consent and i know oh i know you love me too well to refuse he will call on you himself to morrow about it about what reiterated simeon my good fellow it is of no use his calling you are gone distracted mad fit for nothing what does he offer my love anxiously rejoined the widow to take me home with him as companion and friend to his own son a boy just about my ageand such a fellow he has often come to talk with me about the books we have both read and mr morales said i shall learn all that conrad does that i shall go abroad with them and receive such an education that years to come if i still wish it i may be fitted to be what of all others i long to be the hazan of our people hebrew the bible and the talmud and latin and greek and everything that can help me for such an office besides the lighter literature and studies which will make me an enlightened friend for his son oh mother simeon is it not enough to make me lose my wits but i must not though for i shall want them more than ever you do not speak my own dear mother but you will not oh i know you will not refuse refuse repeated the grateful widow whose voice returned no no i would deserve to lose all the friends and blessings my god has given me could i be so selfish to refuse because for a few years my beloved child i must part with you i do not fear for you you will never forget to love your mother or to remember and obey her precepts give you joy brother mine though by my honour i had better not wish you any more joy for this has well nigh done for you laughingly rejoined simeon for he saw that both joseph and his mothers eyes were wet with grateful tears and he did not wish emotion to become pain yes one more joy but one it is almost sinful to wish more when so much has been granted me replied joseph almost sorrowfully would that ruth my own ruth could but look on me once more could but have sight restored that i might think of her as happy independent not needing me to supply her sight oh i should not have one wish remaining but sometimes i think afflicted as she is and bound so closely as we are i ought not to leave her then dont think any more silliness my boy reuben and your humble servant are much obliged to you for imagining because we do not happen to be her twin brothers we cannot be to her what you areout on your conceit make haste and be a hazan and give her a home and then you shall have her all to yourself till then we will take care of her josephs laughing reply was checked by the entrance of leah attended by a young man of very prepossessing appearance it was maurice carvalho the son and heir of a thriving bookseller and fancy stationer of liverpool noted for a devoted attendance on the pretty young milliner not arrived yet why i feared they would have been here before me and thought me so unkind said leah after affectionately greeting her mother are we not late dreadfully replied simeon mischievously mrs valentine said you were at liberty after five what have you been doing with yourselves taking a walk and went further than we thought said maurice with affected carelessness while leah turned away with a blush a walk whew and simon gave a prolonged whistle were you not cold cold you stupid fellow why it is scarce autumn yetthe evenings are delightful particularly when the subject of conversation is of a remarkably summer warmth with doves billing and cooing in the trees and nightingales singing to the rosethere am i not poetical leah my girl you used to like poetry you ought to like it better now betterwhy oh becausebecause poetry and love are twin brothers you know simeon remonstrated leah but the pleased expression of young carvalhos face and the satisfaction beaming on the widows betrayed at once that the bachelor was quite at liberty to talk and amuse himself at their expense their love was acknowledged to each other and hallowed by a parents blessing and consent joseph had scarcely had time to tell his joyful tale to his sister before a loud shout from simeon who had gone to the front to watch proclaimed the anxiously desired arrivals joseph and maurice darted out and in less than a minute reuben and sarah entered the parlour mother dearest mother she is herenever never with gods blessing to leave us again exclaimed reuben as sarah threw herself alternately in the arms of the widow and leah and then again sought the embrace of the former to hide the gushing tears of joy and feeling on her bosom without the power of uttering a single word my child my own darling child oh what a blessing it is to look on your dear face again still my own sarah spite of all the cares and trials you have borne since we parted exclaimed the widow fondly putting back the braids of beautiful hair to look intently on that sweet gentle face and your blessing mother dearest mother oh say as you have so often told me you could wish and ask no dearer better wife for your reuben and such blessing may give my sarah voice he threw his arm round her as he spoke and both bent reverently before the widow whose voice trembled audibly as she gave the desired blessing and told how she had prayed and yearned that this might be and sarahs voice returned with a tone so glad so bird like in its joy it needed but few words my ruth where is my ruth and where are joseph and simeon gone asked the widow when one joy was sufficiently relieved to permit her thinking of another she will be here almost directly mother she was rather tired with the journey and so i persuaded her to rest quiet at the inn close by till i sent simeon and joseph with a coach for her and our luggage they will not be long before they return but tell me where is my jeanie not in bed i hope though we are late no esther took her away about half an hour ago to amuse and keep her awakenot very difficult to do as she is as lively as ever reuben was off in a moment and esther dear reuben bid her come and see me rejoined sarah and then clasping her aunts hand oh my dear aunt what have i not felt since we last met that i owe you i thought i was grateful felt it to the full before but not till i was tried not till i learned the value of strong principles steady conduct and firm control did i know all you had done for me my god indeed was with me throughout but this would not have been had not your care and your affection taught me how to seek and love him oh will a life of devotion to our reuben and to you and to his offspring in part repay your kindness dearest aunt the widows answer we leave our readers to imagine fearing they should accuse us of again becoming sentimental old esther speedily made her appearance and her greeting was second only in affection to the widows own father dear father come home come home was the next sweet lisping voice that met the delighted ears of sarah and in another moment reuben appeared with the child in his arms her little rosy fingers twisted in his hair and her round soft cheek resting against his this is my poor motherless babe for whom i have bespoken your love your protection your guiding hand my sarah he whispered in a low earnest voice will you love her for my sake and for her own and for her mothers do not doubt me reuben if she is yours is she not then mine she answered in the same voice the child looked at her as if half inclined to spring into the caressing extended arms but then with sudden shyness hid her face on her fathers shoulder jeanie darling what was the word i taught you to say look at her and say it and kiss her as you do me the child still hesitated but then as if emboldened by sarahs sweet voice calling her name she looked full in her face and lisped out mother held up her little face to kiss her and was quite contented to be transferred from reubens arms to those of sarah ruth ruthi think i hear her coming joyfully exclaimed leah a few minutes afterwards go to her then deardetain her one minute hastily whispered reuben in a tone and manner that made his sister start do not ask me why nowyou will know the moment you see heronly go i must prepare my mother i did not think she would have been here so soon leah obeyed him her heart beating she did not know why and reuben turned to his mother sarah had given little jeanie to esthers care and was kneeling by her as if to intercept her starting up what is itwhat is it why do you keep my child from me why send her brothers and sisters to her instead of letting her come to me reuben sarah what new affliction has befallen my angel child affliction none none repeated sarah and reuben together it is joy dearest aunt all joy oh bear but joy as you have borne sorrow and all will be well joy she repeated almost wildly what greater joy can there be than to have my children all once again around me i have heard my ruth has been ill but that she was quite well quite strong again and have blessed god for that great mercy but there may be more my mother yet more for which to bless him oh are not all things possible with him he who in his wisdom once deprived of sight can he not restore it reuben sarah what can you mean my child my ruth but voice and almost power failed for such a trembling seized her limbs that reuben was compelled to support her as she sat it was but for a moment for the next a light figure had bounded into the room followed by simeon and joseph maurice and leah mother mother mother they need not tell me where you are you need not come to your poor blind ruth i can see your dear facesee it once again the widow had sprung up from her chair but ere she had made one step forward her child was in her armswas fixing those long closed eyes upon her face as if they would take in every feature with one delighted gaze one look was sufficient a deadly faintness from over excited feelings passed over the widows heart but as she felt ruths passionate kisses on her lips and cheeks life returned in a wild burst of thanksgiving and the widow folded her child closer and yet closer to her heart and overpowered by joy as she had never been by sorrow she lifted up her voice and wept reader our task is donefor need we say it was the benevolent exertion of miss leon under a merciful providence which procured the last most unlooked for blessing to the widow and her family she had remarked there was a slight change in the appearance of the childs eyes had taken her without delay to the most eminent oculist of the day and received his opinion that sight might be restored the rest to a character such as hers was easy and thus twice was she the means of materially brightening the happiness of the perez family for though we had not space in our last chapter to dilate on it it had been actually through her means the innocence of levison had been discovered though she herself was at the time scarcely conscious how she had mentioned it to everybody she thought likely to be useful in discovering it had been laughed at for her folly in believing such a tale warned against taking up the guilt or innocence of such a persons character and in short almost every one dissuaded her from mentioning the subject it really would do her harm but she had persevered against even her own hope of effecting good and was as we have seen successful before we quite say farewell we would ask our readers if we have indeed been happy enough in this simple narration to make one solemn and most important truth clear as our own heart would wishthat however dark may be our horizon however our prayers and trust may for a while seem unheeded our eager wishes denied us our dearest feelings the mere means of woe yet there is an answering and pitying god above us still who when he bids us commit our ways unto him and trust also in him has not alone the power but the will the loving kindness the infinite mercy to bring it to pass my friends that god is still our god and though the events of our simple tale may have no origin in real life is there one amongst us who can look back upon his life and prayers and thoughts and yet say that overruling providence is but fiction for we feel it know it not oh if so it is his own heart not the love and word of his god at fault all may not be blessed so visibly as the widow and her family but all who wait on and trust in the lord will have their reward if not on earth yet dearer more gloriously in heaven the stone cutters boy of possagno a sketch from his life i it was evening in venice the queen of the adriatic her marble palaces and princely halls her stately bridges and her dreary prisons lay sleeping in gorgeous beauty flushed by the glowing splendour of the setting sun lingering as loth to fade away and be lost in the more sombre hues of twilight which rising from the east was softly and balmily stealing over the expanse of heaven bearing silence and repose and quiet loveliness on her meekly pensive brow it was an hour of deep calmthe pause of life and nature when the business of the day was done the gay festivities of night not yet begun now and then the sound of a guitar or the thrill of melody from music gushing voices echoed from the water or whispered accents in the passioned tones of italy betraying some tale of happy love and then again might be traced a muffled figure with shadowed brow and stern closed lip holding himself aloof as if his world were contained in the mighty passions the deep secrets of his own heart and thus from hate or guile or scorn contemning all his fellows and then would come by with measured oar and evening hymn the fishers humble skiff and then in strange contrast the decorated bark of patrician pride with noble freight and liveried attendants presently light after light gleamed up from palace and hall and bridge rivalling the stars of heaven spangling earth and water sunset faded into twilight and twilight resting a brief interval on the bosom of night gave up to her the care of earth and disappeared but not with the marble palaces and their princely honoursnot with the midnight intrigue the lovers meetingnot with the pirate of the seas the brigand of the land all of which seem springing up more vivid than memory more tangible than fancy in that one magic word venicenot with these have we to treat in a small rudely furnished apartment scattered round with implements of sculpture half finished models in clay and stone sketches both in chalk and colouring and some few volumes of miscellaneous lore sat one a boy in years but bearing on his brow and in his eye somewhat faroh far beyond his age clothed as he was in the simplest most homely attire his peculiarly graceful and well proportioned figure marked him noble his intelligent nay more his soul breathing features the light of mind illumining his full dark eye and resting on the broad high forehead even the beautiful hair of glossy black curling so carelessly round the peculiarly well shaped headcould these characteristics belong to the stone cutters boy of possagno whose first twelve years had been passed in the mud walled cabin of his poor and hard working grandfather it was even so but the lowliness of birth was even at this early period of his life lost in the nobility of genius her voice had breathed its thrilling whisper within him and he heard but as yet understood it notwas unconscious of the deep meanings the glorious prophecy the mighty shadows of an unborn future of which those thrilling whispers spoke he only knew there was a spirit within him urging impelling he scarce knew what and longing for the infinite which pressed so heavily upon him that he felt to use his own impressive words he could have started on foot with a velocity to outstrip the wind but without knowing whither to direct his steps and when activity could no longer be supported he would have desired to lie down and die he would hurry to the haunts of naturethe wildest most boundless scenes gazing on the distant mountain the rushing torrent the dark mysterious forest and then up to the gorgeous masses of cloud sailing over the transparent heaven of his own bright land watch intently each light each shade each fleeting change longing to soar to them to penetrate the mysteries of nature at such moments he was happy for the sense of infinity seemed taken from his own overcharged heart to be impressed on nature to linger around below above him to breathe its tale aloud from the voice of the torrent to the glistening star reflected in its depthsfrom the radiant star to the lowly flower trembling beneath its burning gaze and the voice was less painfully oppressive then than when it came in the still the lonely hour to the deep recesses of his own young heart and from these scenes he would turn again to the work of his own hand and despondency and darkness at times clouded up his spirit for they gave not back the impress of the beauty the infinity with which his soul was filled he knew not the wherefore of this deep seated joy and woe and had there been one to whisper it did but prophesy immortal fame the boy would have smiled in disbelief but on this fair eve neither the hurrying impulse nor desponding sadness was upon him the boy sat beside the open casement looking forth on the gradual approach of night and her starry train on the still waters slumbering beneath or flashing in passing light from illuminated skiffs but his thoughts were not on these an open volume lay upon his knee which had so absorbed alike heart mind and fancy that darkness had stolen around him unconsciously and when compelled to cease reading there was a charm in the thoughts created too entrancing too irresistible to permit their interruption even by a movement why antonio lad what holds thee so tranced even thine own guiseppe stands beside thee rudely and inhospitably unnoticed shame on thee the falieri had not welcomed tonin thus with a start of joyful surprise the boy turned to grasp the extended hands of his noble friend to welcome him again and again and then to ask and answer so many questions interesting to none but themselves that some time passed ere guiseppe falieri found leisure to ask what had so engrossed his friend when he entered up in the skies again tonin ladriding on a star or reposing on a cloudyonder one perchance so exquisitely silvered by the moon no guiseppe mio i was more on earth than in heaven that moment thou on earth and with such a sky such a moon above us marvellous ah a book and attracted by antonios smile to the volume he took it up and read by the clear moonlight life of dante only his life nay had it been his divina commedia his soul thrilling poesy i could better have forgiven thy neglect yet perchance had his life no beatrice guiseppe italy had had no poet it was beatrice then that so enchanted thee come thats some comfort for my pride i give thee permission to neglect me for her yet he added after a brief pause how know we it was not all illusiona vision of the poeta fancya beautiful creation i have often thought it too shadowy too much of the ideal for dull dark reality illusion or reality oh it was blessed for italy thrice blessed for the poet answered antonio with such unaffected fervour that it extended to his companion without beatrice what had dante been a poet perchance but wanting the glow the life the thrilling beauty now gushing so eloquently from every line beauty and such as hers ethereal from first to last till nought but his own heart and heaven retained her oh guiseppe the glance of her eye the touch of her hand was all sufficient to ignite the electric lamp of genius which without such influence perchance had been buried in its own smouldering gloom and never flung its rays upon a world thinkest thou then tonin that the influence of beauty could indeed be so experienced by one who though so mighty in intellect was still only a boy in years do i think so guiseppeyes oh yes it filled up all the yearning void so dark before it threw a sunshine and a glory over all of life and earth it gave a semblance and a shape to all the glowing images of mind and as the countless rays down gushing from one sun it poured into the poets breast infinity from one guiseppe falieri looked on the enthusiast feeling far more than antonio himself the glorious gifts that boyish heart enshrined and loved aye reverenced himhim the peasant boy though he himself was noble the younger son of an illustrious venetian house but what he felt was rank of birth compared to rank of intellect and with that peasant boy the youthful noble remained for hours only leaving that lowly room to wander forth with him as their souls had freer more delicious communion under the blue vaults of heaven than in confining walls to enjoy the society of his humble friend in their brief visits to venice guiseppe falieri ever relinquished the more exciting pleasures of the boon companions of his rank and station and ere the mantle of age descended upon him how did he glory in the penetration of his boyhood ii it was morn in venice her seventy islets were lighted up with a flood of sunshine of transparent brilliance known only to fair italy but falling with soft and mellowed rays within the gallery of the proud farsetti palace thrown open to the youth of both sexes studying the fine arts private munificence had gathered together the most perfect specimens of ancient and modern artall that could forward the eager student in his darling pursuit ensuring priceless advantages even to the poorest and the humblest fostering in every individual breast the gift peculiarly his own oh truly is that country where such things are the nurse of genius truly may her children decorate her with the fruits of those resplendent gifts with which heaven has endowed them truly may her poets breathe forth lays to mark her as themselvesimmortal italy beautiful italy how does the heart burn the spirit love when we write of thee to this gallery the young antonio was a constant visitor and he was so persevering in his studies as to attract the attention and rivet the friendship of its noble owner at whose order he executed the first specimen of that sculpture which was to enrol his lowly name amid the mighty spirits of his native land and bear to distant shores the echoes of his fame morning after morning found him in the farsetti gallery engaged either in drawing modelling or painting from antique casts or from those modern ones to which the possessors of the establishment directed his notice no difficulty could deter no more tempting model could allure severely faithfully true to the path marked out every other student shrunk from competition with him as pigmies from a giant wrapt as antonio ever was in his task however severe or little interesting generally so absorbed as to be unconscious of all outward things it was strange that a voice had power to rouse him from such preoccupation and bid him half unconsciously yet inquiringly look round soft low silvery it thrilled to the boys soul as a voice that had haunted his dreams and was yet to reality unknown and the being from whom it came had he ever seen one like to her or was it the mere embodying of all those visions of beauty which sleeping or waking haunted his soul he knew not he only knew he sat entranced breathless awestruck as though some angelic being had stood before him demanding adoration young very young she seemed yet older than himself and pale but oh so exquisitely lovelywith all of heaven nought of earth een the deep feeling resting on that full bright lip the dark lustrous deep souled eye the rich the glorious intellect sitting throned upon that beauteous brow the smile flitting round that chiselled mouth as an emanation from the soul nay every movement of the sylph like form too light too spirit like for coarser earthall whispered to the boys full heart with power eloquence unfelt though often dreamed before and matter of astonishment it was to him that the other students so calmly continued their labours content with one glance of admiration on the stranger leaning on the arm of a friend or attendant she advanced up the gallery and took her seat as one of the students the model was selected her drawing materials arranged and silently she pursued her task little more did antonio do that day for the strange tumultuous emotions of his bosom seemed from that time to paralyse his hand he worked on indeed mechanically till the hour of closing and then oh how grateful was the fresh breeze of heaven the free active movement of a rapid walk yet even thenstrange incongruity of feelinghe yearned for the morrow to find himself anew by her side and then a trembling was upon him that it was all illusion all a sweet bright vision which would fade as it had come illustration but such it was not the hours of study came and passed and each morning found that frail ethereal being in the farsetti gallery attended on her entrance and departure but left to pursue her studies as was the custom alone and irresistibly the young sculptor chose those casts which drew him closer to her side that even as he worked he might glance on that surpassing beauty might watch each graceful movement and this was happiness inexpressible happiness although he knew not wherefore he could not speak it even to his dearest friend he felt it all too sacred too deeply shrined for voice as if the first breath that gave it utterance would bid it fly for ever he shrunk deeper and deeper within himself not moodily not sadly but only sensible that with such a being he should be for ever happy for even her silent presence shed a glow around him fading not even when she was no longer near he was feeling what his own lips had so vividly described as beautys influence on dante but the guileless unsophisticated boy knew not that such it was silently he felt and silently he worked for those new strange yet delicious feelings weakened not his mighty powers nay new light suffused them even to his own impartial often desponding eye once she stood by his side leaning on the arm of her attendant he felt the glance of those lovely eyes was fixed admiringly on the work of his hand and that hand trembled for the first time her voice reached his ear in its sweet music and though it simply praised his work as assai bello it lingered on his heart as a never forgotten melody thrilling through the deeper louder mightier voice of fame of monarchs praise of worlds applause as an angels whispering amidst the crashing storm he only bowed his head in low acknowledgment in voiceless answer he could not summon strength to breathe one word or meet that gentle glance but oh the deep full gushing joy which was upon him from that hour inspiring more air of beauty in his labours for her eye might rest on them again days weeks thus passed and still as by magnetic influence those youthful students were ever side by side but ere the second moon had wholly waned antonio sat alone that lovely one had vanished from her usual haunt and mournfully darkly the hours once so joyous passedfor the sunlight had departed from them day after day hope returned to the boys heart but not its beauteous object to his eye and heavily this silent adoration lay upon his soul another and another day and still she came not a week another and how might he inquire her fate when even could he speak that yearning sorrow he had no traceno clue to her identity she had come with nought but her own loveliness to steal upon his heart and he could not violate the sanctuary her image filled by one word of question he shrunk from every eye as if he feared his treasure were discovered and the notice of his fellows would sully its ethereal purity by mingling it with earth still he laboured indefatigably as before for her voice was sounding in the still depths of his own soul and perhaps it might sound againher praise might hallow the work even of his impotent hand and mark it blessed a ray of sunshine had fallen upon the work of the young sculptor giving it that peculiar light and shadow which it had worn that never to be forgotten day when his eye first marked the loveliness his soul had visioned such as the ray had reached him from its fount flashed back every feeling every pulsation of that hour till in its magic the very form of the beloved the worshipped one stood or seemed to stand before him tangible palpable as life save that the smile the shadowy form were as if all of earth had gone breathless pale motionless antonios trembling hand refused to guide the pencilhis fixed and starting eye to move lest all should fade away and leave him desolate a noise among the students aroused him and with a sudden start and heavy sigh he awoke to consciousness it was but vacancy on which he gazed or his spirit held commune with beings not seen of earth another week and antonio looked on the faithful attendant of his spirits idol but she was alone and pale and sad and robed in all the sable draperies of woe his heart throbbed his voice failed a sickness as of death crept over him yet as she passed to seek and remove the portfolio of the missing one he struggled to subdue that inward trembling and speak but only a few brief faltering accents came the signoraher friendwas she wellhad she quitted venice a burst of agonizing tears answered him and then the mournful confirmation the signora julia had gone to that heaven whose child she was earth would see her sweet face list her glad laugh feel her light step no more and the mourner passed on and antonio leaned his head upon his hands as if some invisible stroke had crushed him gone and for ever oh the unutterable agony to the young the loving contained in those brief words and never more did the young sculptor hear that name never did he know the birth the rank the story of her who so like a spirit had crossed his path men knew not dreamed not the tide of feeling on that young boys soul now in him were working the silent influences of beauty of hopeless love they saw him engaged each day studying his art laboriously working under his master ferrari on some still cold soulless statues still to be seen in the villa of trepoli and how could they imagine the glowing visions of beauty of poetry at work within no it was in after years when such forms of unrivalled loveliness of immortal beauty sprung in almost breathing life beneath the magic chisel of antonio canova that the vision of early boyhood might be traced and even now in the perfection to which his art attained man may behold the realization of those vague yet impelling yearnings after beauty infinity all that genius craves which had started into life and being from the lovely vision of his first and only love amte and yafh an allegory far in the illimitable space seeming to earth as one of those bright yet tiny stars which even the most powerful telescope will not increase in size so immeasurable is the distance between them and us two spirits sate enthroned each intrusted with an attribute of the creator with which to renew his image in man and vivify the earth their work was one each so aiding each that though in outward form distinct their inward being was the same the one known in the language of heaven as amteand who were there measurement of time in the children of eternity might seem the elderwas in aspect grave almost stern but those who could steadily gaze upon him and receive his image within their hearts and man did so a thousand and a thousand times though the spirits visible form was unrevealed loved him with such deep earnest love as to forget the seeming sternness in the deep calm and still security his recognition ever brought a coronet of light circled his brow his wings were of living sapphire and in his hand he held a transparent spear wherever he moved darkness and mist fled from before him and error sunk annihilated before one touch of that crystal lance change and mutability touched him not coeval with creation he endured to everlastingever presenting the same exquisite aspect producing on earth the same effect and through every age aiding to mould man for immortality distinct from his companion yet the same reflecting his every changeful hue of loveliness yet retaining undisturbed his own not such was the outward appearance of yafh less majestic less grave earth and heaven ever hailed him with rejoicing the latter indeed knew him not apart from amte and the former in her darkness sometimes greeted his semblance not himself robed in light drawn not from the ethereal fount which circled amte but from those dazzling iris coloured rays the reflection of which we sometimes catch when the sun shines upon a prism the various changes of his exquisite loveliness were impossible to be defined but it was only when in close unity with amte he was seen to full perfection and his glittering garb endowed with vitality and glory apart those iris rays shone forth resplendent and most dazzling but without the light glistening on the brow of his companion were too soon merged in gloom but this yafh himself knew not and in his young ambition besought permission to work alone his revealed form was more visible on earth than that of amte as he looked down and around and above him the attribute of which he was the guardian seemed so powerfully and palpably impressed that he could not trace the invisible workings of his companion and in his presumption he deemed it all his own and chafed and spurned the bond which since their creation had entwined and marked them one mournfully and earnestly amte conjured him to check the impious prayer that which the all wise had assigned them was surely best and safest but yafh would not heed and ceased not his murmuring supplication till it was granted with the work already done the work of creation he might not interfere but the archangelic minister bade him go down to earth and in the workshop of man be his creation of hand or brain display thy power thou art free to work alone and with a glad burst of triumphant song and the brilliant velocity of a fallen star the spirit darted down to earth follow him not commanded the archangel answering amtes imploring gaze once convinced of his nothingness alone he will never leave thee more that lesson learned thou mayest rejoin him meanwhile look down upon his course and sorrowingly amte obeyed he beheld him arrayed in even more than his wonted loveliness enter the several habitations of man his invisible but felt presence greeted with wild joy and his inspirings followed in the new creative genius of all whom he touched in the lowly homes of the mechanic and the artizan he lingered and their work grew beneath their hand and at first it seemed most lovely but still something was wanting and they toiled and toiled to find it but in vain and despair and ruin usurped the place of glad rejoicing they are of too low a grade too dull a mind murmured the spirit and he flew to the easel of the painter the workshop of the sculptor and new conceptions of loveliness floated so vividly in their minds that day and night unceasingly they toiled to give them embodied form and sweet dreams of fame mingled with their creation till life itself seemed brighter than before and yafh rejoiced for surely now he was triumphant here at least perfection would vitalize his presence and prove how little needed he amte he mingled invisibly with the judges of the works and he beheld them scornedcontemned as dreams of madmen and the artists fled disgraced and miserable to their homes with difficulty restrained from shivering their work to atoms terrified yet still not humbled yafh winged his flight to the studio of the musician and harmonies of heaven floated in his ear entrancing him with their exquisite perfection and hour after hour he laboured to bring them from their impalpable essence to the bondage of note and phrase but in vainin vain the sounds he did produce were wild discordant unconnected and in passionate agony he refused to listen more the poet the philosopher the historianwherever genius layyafh touched with his quivering breath and to all came the same dream of marvellous lovelinessthe same ideal perfection on all burst the torrent of inspiration compelling toil and work to give words to the pressing thought and all for awhile believed it perfect and their burning souls throbbed high in the fond hope that each glorious lay each novel discovery each startling hypothesisclothed in such glowing imagery and thrilling wordsmust last for ever and yafh triumphed for surely here he was secure and in these prove that he could work alone and needed the aid of none a brief brief while and the burning lays of the poet were forgotten and unread the theory of the philosopher lovely as it had seemed quivered into darkness before the test of usefulness and reason the new discoveries new thoughts of the historian met with scorn and laughter in the vain search for their foundation and in their deep despair yafh heard the names by which he was known to earth accursed and scorned his presence banished his inspirations rudely checked as bringing not loveliness and joy but misery and ruin and the spirit fled in his wild agony far far from the homes of earth and the hearts of men and shrinking from his starry home and light clad brother sought to pierce through and through the vast realms of unfathomable space and lose himself in darkness his iris rays seemed fading from his lovely form lost in denser and denser gloom above below and around him thunder rolled and the glittering hosts of heaven trembled lest his proud wish were to be chastised still further but soon the majestic form of the spirit amte stood beside his brother and before the touch of his glittering spear error and despair about to claim yafh fled howling yafh beloved we will descend together he said in tones clear distinct and liquid impossible to be withstood thy work shall yet live and be immortal nay twill be thine murmured the repentant spirit his darkened loveliness resuming light and glory from the effulgent brow so pityingly bent down on his what need hast thou for me go forth and work alone i have no part on earth thou hast for without thee i have no power man trembles at my form when at the eternals mandate i must go forth alone but with thee perchance because my sterner self is hidden he loves and hails me and permits my work ascendency without thee i could but bind to earth with thee i lead to heaven brother we are one though earth may deem us twain we cannot work for immortality apart side by side so closely twined that even their brother spirits could with difficulty distinguish their individuality amte and yafh stood within the dwellings of man the mechanic and the artizan started from their desponding trance the neglected work was resumed the form the inspiration was the same but as if a flash of light had touched it it gave back that perfect image of the mind for which before they had so toiled and toiled in vain on to the artist the sculptor the musician and one touch from that crystal spear and the misty cloud dispersed and the senseless canvas gave back the perfected thought the cold marble sprung into the warmth of actual being the impalpable but exquisite harmonies the ethereal essence of sound at the word of amte resolved itself into the necessary bondage of note and form and breathed forth to admiring thousands the music lent to one hovering over the poet again the thrilling words burst forth and fraught with such mighty meanings every heart responded as to the voice of the immortal folding his azure pinion round the panting soul of the philosopher the shrouding cloud dispersed and science deep stern lasting took the place of the mere lovely dream and on the page of the historian light from the brow of amte so flashed as to make him a gifted reader of the future by the wondrous record his spirit thought unfolded of the past wherever the spirits lingered man worked for immortality it mattered not under what guise or in what rank from the highest to the lowest each creative impulse fashioned by yafh received perfection from amte the former indeed alone was visible but never more he sought to work alone within his outward work was the vital essence breathed by amte without which the most exquisite form was incompletethe most lovely thought imperfectthe fairest theory a dream and so it is even now up up in yon distant star gleaming so brightly through the immeasurable space as may be their throne still does their glorious and united presence walk the earth their semblance may be found apart but not themselves twain as they are in name and aspect in essence they are one truth is the vital breath of beauty beauty the outward form of truth the real the sole foundation of the ideal the ideal but the spiritualized essence of the real footnote two hebrew words whose translations will be found in the concluding paragraph the fugitive a true tale judah azavdo was the only son of a rich jewish merchant settled in london his grandfather a native and resident of portugal having witnessed the fearful proceedings of the inquisition on some of his relations and friends secretly followers of israel as himself fled to holland bearing with him no inconsiderable property this through successful commerce swelled into wealth and when on his death his son with his wife and child removed to england and settled in the metropolis they were considered alike in birth education and riches one of the very highest families of the proud and aristocratic portuguese but the situation of the jews in england some eighty or ninety years ago was very different to their situation now riches nay even moral and mental dignity were not then the passport to society and friendliness lingering prejudice still predominant in the hearts of the english and pride and nationality equally strong in the hebrew kept both parties aloof so that no advance could be made on either side and each remained profoundly ignorant of the other not alone on the subject of opposing creeds but of actual character this though certainly a social evil was in some respects as concerned the israelites a national good it drew them more closely more kindly together aliens and strangers to the children of other lands the true followers of their persecuted creed were as brothers rich or poor it mattered not hebrews and portuguese were the ties in common and the joy or grief of one family was the joy or grief of all fashion was little thought of heartlessness and that false pride which forswears relation to or connection with poverty were unknown faults no doubt they had but a more kindly noble hearted set of men in their own sphere than the spanish and portuguese jews nearly a hundred years ago never had existence the restlessness and over sensitiveness of judah azavdo was a subject of as much surprise to his nation as of regret to his father sole heir to immense wealthunencumbered with businessnothing to occupy him but his own pleasuregifted with unusual mental powersdignified in figurea kindly and most winning manner when he chose to exert it yet was his whole life embittered by the morbid sensitiveness with which he regarded his most unfortunate lack of all attraction in face and feature he was absolutely and disagreeably plain we would say ugly did we not so exceedingly dislike the word yet there were times when the glow of mind or still more warmth of heart would throw such a soft and gentle expression over the almost deformed features that their natural disfigurement ceased to be remembered those who knew him never felt any difference between him and his fellow men save in his superior heart and mind but azavdo himself always imagined that wherever he went he must be an object of derision or dislike he shrunk from all society particularly from that of females who he was convinced would be terrified even to look at him entreaties commands and remonstrances were vain could he have known more mingled more with the world at large these morbid feelings would in time have been rubbed off but in his very limited circle of familiar friends this was impossible and the evil in consequence each year increased to the israelites of ninety years ago the idea of travelling for pleasure was incomprehensible they were too happy too grateful to the land which gave them rest and peace to think of quitting it for any other that judah azavdo should restlessly desire to leave england and seek excitement in foreign lands was in accordance with all his other extraordinary feelings but that his father the wise sedate contented old man whose every hope and affection were centred in this son should give his consent was more extraordinary still and many in kindness sought to dissuade him from it but azavdo loved his son too well to permit old habits and prejudices to interfere with the only indulgence judah had ever asked he gave him his blessing and carte blanche with regard to gold and the young man forthwith departed he was absent three years having travelled as far as the east and visited every scene endeared to him as one of that favoured race for whom the sea itself had been divided he had looked on misery in so many varied forms as the portion of his nation that he felt reproached and ashamed at his own repinings he learnt that only sin and crime could authorize the misery he had endured that he was an immortal being and one whose earthly lot was blessed so much above thousands of his brethren that he only marvelled his sin of discontent had not called down on him the wrath of god his soul seemed suddenly free from fetters and he moved among his fellow men fearless and unabashed notwithstanding the danger of such a routefor if known or even suspected as a hebrew he would inevitably have perishedjudah chose to return home through spain and portugal making himself known to some friends of his family still dwelling in the latter kingdom with them he remained some few months and then it was that a new emotion awoke within him chaining him effectually ere aware of its existence from his earliest youth judah had dreaded and so forsworn love feeling it next to impossible for him ever to be loved in return but love laughs at such forswearers before he could analyse why that bitterness against his unhappy ugliness should return when he had thought it so successfully conquered he loved with the full passionate fervour of his race and his own peculiar disposition and loved one of whom he could learn nothing trace nothing know nothing save that she was so surpassingly lovely that though he had seen her but three times never near and only once without her veil her beauty both of face and form lingered on his memory as indelibly engraved as if it had lain there for years and then had been called into existence by some strangely awakening flash she was as unknown to his friends as to himself only at the opera had she been visible no inquiry no search could elicit information once only he had heard the sound of her voice and it breathed music as thrilling and transporting as the beauty of her face yet was she neither saintlike nor angelic it was an arch witchery a shadowless glee infused with the nameless descriptionless but convincing charm of mind judah azavdo returned home an altered man yet still no one could understand him he no longer morbidly shunned society nor even cared to eschew the company of females seeming as wholly careless and insensible to the effects of his presence as he had before thought too much about it some said he was scornfully proud others that it was impenetrable reserve all agreed that he was changed but only his most intimate friends could perceive that he was unhappy and from some deep seated sorrow essentially distinct from the feelings engrossing him when he left england and that this one feeling it was which rendered him so totally indifferent to everything else three nearly four years elapsed and azavdo in character and habits remained the same his father was dead leaving him immense wealth which he used nobly and generously winning golden opinions from every class and condition of men who at the same time wished that they could quite understand him and so we must leave him to waft our readers over the salt seas and introduce them to a more southern land and a very different person in a luxuriously furnished apartment of a beautiful little villa a few miles from lisbon was seated a lady of that extraordinary beauty which ever fastens on the memory as by some strange spell not more than three or four and twenty all the freshness of girlhood was so united to the more mature graces of woman that it was often difficult to say to which of these two periods of life she belonged her large lustrous jet black eye and the small pouting mouth alike expressed at will either the mischievous glee of a mirth loving girl or the high souled intellectuality of maturer woman hair of that deep dark brown only to be distinguished from black when the sunshine falls upon it lay in rich masses and braids around the beautifully shaped head and giving from the contrast yet more dazzling fairness to the pure complexion of face and throat which it shaded the brow so thought thronged when at rest yet lit up when eye and mouth so willed with such arch laughter loving glee but we must pause for the pen can never do beauty justice and even if it did would be accused of exaggeration although there yet remains those who from personal acquaintance can still bear witness to its truth a gentleman was standing near her as she sat on her sofa in the busy idleness of embroidery and as part of their conversation may elucidate our tale we will record it briefly as may be then you refused him can you ask and the lightning flash of the ladys dark eye betrayed unwonted indignation he who would have so tempted a helpless girl of seventeeni was then no more though i had been married nearly a yearunder such specious reasoning that i dreamed not his drift till the words of actual insult came sought to sow suspicion and distrust in my heart against my husband his own brother to serve his vile purposes and you ask me if i refused him when being once more free to wed he dared pollute me with his abhorred addresses julian my fair cousin have you so forgotten inez if i had that indignant burst would have recalled her but of insult remember i knew nothing you were married when so young to a man so much older than yourself that when i heard of his death three years ago i fancied as you know is often the case with us you would have married his younger brother so much more suitable in point of qualities and years more suitable wrong again cousin mine if i did not love my husband i respected honoured himyes loved him too as a father but as for don pedro as men call him julian i would rather have trusted the tender mercies of the inquisition than i would him and so i told him you could not have been so mad in sober truth i was feeling too thoroughly indignant to weigh my words it matters not he dare not work me harm for the secret on which alone he can involves his safety as well as mine i wish i could think so there are many to say that he is in truth what he appears to be and therefore one most dangerous to offend i fear him as little as i scorn him much i have heard this report before but heed it not at all our holy cause loses little in the apostasy of such a member it may be so inez but he holds the lives of others in his keeping and therefore revenge is easily obtained you will not frighten me julian try as you may they say pedro benito is ill almost to deathi am sorry for him for i know no one more unfit to die but i have far too much pride to fear him believe me better he should injure me than i my own soul in uniting it with his see she continued laughing as she pointed to the portly figure of a dominican priest pushing his mule up the steep ascent leading to the villa in such evident haste and trepidation as to occasion some amusement to his beholders there is more fear there than i shall ever feel what can the poor priest need do you know him julian comes he to you or me i trust to neither inez for such hot haste bodes little good why now what a craven you have grown i will disown you for my cousin if you pluck not up more spirit man julian alvarez tried to give as jesting a reply but succeeded badly his spirits feeling strangely anxious and oppressed he was spared further rallying on the part of inez by the sudden reappearance of the priest whom they had lost sight of by a curve in the ascent without his mule at the private entrance of inezs own garden and without ceremony or question neared the window inez addressed him courteously though with evident surprise the priest seemed not to heed her words but laying his hand on her arm said in a deep low tone donna inez this is no time for courtesy or form daughter fly even now the bloodhounds are on the track the scent has been given a dying man proclaimed you a jewess in hearing of others besides his confessor else had you been still safe and free ere two hours nay in less time they will be here away pause not for thought seek to save nothing but life too precious for such sacrifice a vessel lies moored below which a brisk hours walk will reach she sails for england the moment the wind shifts secure a passage in her and trust in the god of israel for the rest and who are you who thus can care for me knowing that which i am answered the lady in accents low as the supposed priests but far less faltering and only evincing the shock she had sustained by the sudden whiteness of cheek and lip men call methink me padre jos my child but were i such you had not seen me here that which you are am i and because i thought pedro benito the same i stood beside his death bed vengeance and apostasy went hand in hand ask no more but hence at once how may those fragile limbs bear the rackthe flames senor alvarez shake off this stupor or it will be too late julian did indeed stand as paralysed so suddenly and fearfully were his worst fears confirmed fly and from all home friends luxury to be poor and dependent in a strange land it was even so the voice of vengeance had betrayed the fatal secret of race and faith the very first whisper of which consigned to the inquisitionbut another word for torture and death in two short hours part of which had already gone inez had to find the vessel be received on board and leave no trace whatever of her way her very domestics must suspect nothing or discovery would inevitably ensue and yet in the midst of all this sudden accumulation of misfortune inez but once betrayed emotion julian julian my boy she exclaimed her sole answer to the reiterated entreaties of her companions for her to depart at once what will they not do to him nothing lady he shall be with me till he can rejoin you who will suspect padre jos of harbouring an israelite save to convert him to the holy faith inez caught the old mans hand her lip and eyelids quivering convulsively but even the passion of choking tears was conquered by the power of mind in less than half an hour she was walking at a brisk pace through the shrubberies in the direction of the river enveloped in mantilla and veil and julian alvarez carrying a small parcel containing the few jewels which she could collect and one or two articles of clothing the all that the mistress of thousands could save from the rapacious hands which under the garb of religion were ever stretched out to confiscate and to destroy scarcely had they quitted the shrubberies after nearly an hours brisk walking and entered the high road their only path when about a dozen men in the full livery of the holy office were clearly discernible on a slight rising not half a mile beyond them pushing their horses so as directly to face them and advancing at full speed to turn back was to excite suspicion to meet them tempt discovery fortunately a small enclosure of tall larches and thick firs lay forward a little to the left and there inez impelled her bewildered companion walking as carelessly to all appearance as taking a saunter for amusement they saw the troop rapidly advance pause exactly in front of their hiding place look round inquiringly one or two spurred forwards as to beat the bushes a mans step at the same time sounded in their rearhis dress fanned them as he passed it was one of donna inezs own labourers they heard him hailed as he appeared and questions asked of which they heard nothing but that wordless sound of voices so torturing to those who deem that life or death are hanging on the words a few minutesfeeling hoursthe conference lasted some direction loudly repeated along the file betrayed that their questions only related to their further route to the villa benito and the horses galloped on without exchanging a syllable inez and her companion hurried forward it was still full half an hours walk to the river the sun was declining and the wind had risen fresh and balmy but while julian rejoiced in its reviving power he trembled lest it should be bearing his cousins only chance of safety farther from them their pace was brisk as could be yet every step seemed clogged with lead and weary felt the way till the rivers brink was gained bathed in the lingering glow of a magnificent sunset the bright waters lay before them and every sail spread gliding softly yet swiftly on her course they beheld the longed for vessel receding from their sight for one minute they stood gazing on the departing ship as mute as feelingless as stone save to the horrible consciousness that flight was over all hope of escape must be vain but great emergencies prevent the continuance of despair ere julian had recovered the stupor of alike disappointment and dread inez had hailed the boatman and drawing a diamond ring of immense value from her hand bade him place her in safety on board the english vessel and it should be his the man hesitated then swore it was worth the trial and very speedily a boat was ready manned by four stout rowers impatient as herself and now farewell dear julian she said calmly taking the parcel from his hand and looking in his astonished face with her own sweet smile you go no farther i will not risk your life so precious to your wife and children because i weakly fear to meet my destiny alone do not attempt to argue with me it will be useless as you ought to know look to my poor boy he needs you more than i do her voice sunk to a thrilling whisper the god we both serve bless you and keep you from a similar fate she wrung his hand and lightly springing into the boat it was pushed off and rapidly cutting the yielding waters ere julian alvarez recovered sufficiently from his emotion to speak even a farewell word and now with feelings wrought almost to agony he watched a chase seemingly so utterly vain for some time the vessel still kept ahead but the efforts of the rowers in no degree relaxed he heard their stentorian hail repeated by the innumerable echoes on the shore but still there seemed no answer again and yet again it is fancy no the sails are lowered the vessels speed is diminished till the boat appears almost alongside julian strained his gaze while his very heart felt to have ceased beating in the sickening fear that even now her flight might be prevented by a refusal to receive her he could discern no more for twilight had gathered round him and interminable seemed the interval till the boat returned with the blessed assurance that the senora was safe on board night fell the lovely southern night with its silvery moonshine on the gleaming waters its glistening stars appearing suspended in the upper air as globes of liquid light with its fresh soft breezes bearing such sweet scents from the odoriferous shores that a poet might have fancied angelic spirits were abroad making the atmosphere luminous with their pure presence and every breeze fragrant with their luscious breath inez sat upon the deck a fugitive and alone she who only the evening previous had been the centre of a brilliant group whose halls had sounded with the voice of revelry the blithesome dance whence aught of sorrow seemed so far away as to be but a name not a reality to us looking back on the extraordinary fact of the most catholic kingdoms being literally peopled with secret jews whose property and life might be sacrificed from one hour to another it appears incomprehensible that security or happiness could ever have existed and still more difficult to understand what secret feeling it was which thus bound them to a country where acknowledged or discovered judaism was death when there were other parts of the globe where they could be protected and received yet so it was and there are still families in england to trace their descent from those who like the senora benito were compelled to fly at an hours warning saving little else than life some spirits would have sunk under a misfortune so sudden so overwhelming in its details but inez rose above it she had nothing to look to but her own resources the few valuables she had secreted would she knew soon be exhausted did she depend on them alone she was going to a land where she knew not one her only credentials being a letter hurriedly written by her cousin to one of his friends in london loneliness privation care and even manual toil all awaited her child as she had been of luxury and wealth lavish as it was believed exhaustless yet as she looked forth on the glorious night with her star lit dome as she inhaled the sweet breath of a thousand flowers floating on the breeze she knew she was not forsaken he who cared for all nature would still more care for her and when the spirit is at peace how lightly is all of sorrow borne the unusual stir in the harbour which they reached about midnight attracted the attention not only of inez but of the captain and crew on stopping at the quay for passengers and freight he was told that the vessel must remain at anchor no english ship being allowed to leave the harbour until it had received a visit from the officers of the inquisition in search of a female fugitive suspected of judaism who having effectually disappeared from her home was supposed to have taken refuge in some english vessel the general receivers of heretics and unbelievers i halt not at any mans beck or bidding was the proud reply england owns no inquisitional supremacy had any such fugitive taken refuge in my ship no power of the inquisition backed by the whole kingdom should force me to give her up time for reply or seizure there was none every sail spread at the word of command and almost bending beneath her weight of canvas the gallant ship with her right english hearted crew sped on to sea inez had seen all felt allbut though her heart beat quicker no word or sign betrayed it she saw the captain look hastily on her and for a terrible moment she knew not whether the glance of discovery for such it was would be followed by her surrender or her safety his words speedily reassured her and sent her to the berth provided for her comfort with more care than for any other passenger with the grateful feeling that all of danger was indeed at end she was in englands keeping and no inquisition could work her harm nor was it the mere excitement of misfortune which so endowed her with courage to endure she retained not only firmness but liveliness during the voyage and when received in england with the most hospitable kindness by julians friends gaily consulted them on the best means of subsistencewhether to take in plain work or enter upon the business of fancy confectionary for both of which her convent education had well fitted her and what with her brilliant beauty her sparkling wit and readiness of repartee ere two days had passed she had completely fascinated old and young the evening of the third day mr nunezs family had been engaged to spend with a friend living a few miles from london on sending to state that a portuguese lady staying with them would prevent their going an entreaty was instantly forwarded that she would accompany them what go and my whole wardrobe consists of this one dress was her laughing reply i shall bring shame on your fashionable reputation my kind friends they assured her that dress was of little consequence and even if it were she need not be alarmed being more likely to bring them fame by the fashion of her face than shame by the plainness of her robe which by the way a rich black velvet set off the dazzling clearness of her complexion more becomingly than the most carefully assorted garb to the house of their friend in consequence they went and the beautiful stranger with her broken english sweetly spoken portuguese and most romantic story soon commanded universal attention towards the middle of the evening a rapidly approaching carriage followed by a thundering rap announced the arrival of some new guest that is azavdo observed one i know him by the sound of his four horses a strange fancy that always sporting a carriage and four when in everything else he has no pretension whatever did you expect him cordoza he asked of his host he said he might look in on his way to epping was the reply what a changed man he is said another i remember when he literally loathed society and shrunk from beauty male or female as if it stung him by the contrast with himself i have never heard him admire a woman yet though rejoined the first speaker i wonder if he will notice the beauty of to night azavdo entered as he spoke and after addressing his host and hostess began an earnest conversation with a friend near them a low musical laugh from the centre of a merry group at the opposite end of the large drawing room caused azavdo suddenly so to start with such an indescribable change of countenance as to impel the anxious query whether he were ill he answered hurriedly in the negative but his friend perceiving his eye fixed on the group eagerly entered on the story of the stranger from whom the laugh had come inviting him to join the circle round her somewhat hesitatingly he did so inez in compliance with the customs of her own country still wore her veil which in answer to the inquiry of some one near her as to the different fashions of wearing it in portugal she had drawn so closely round her as to hide every feature tell her that it is not the custom of english ladies to wear veils whispered azavdo to his hostess in tones of such strong and most unusual excitement that she looked at him as if in doubt of his identity his hint was acted upon however and inez with winning courtesy soon after laid aside her veil azavdo had become in some degree a man of the world and it was well he was or he might have found it difficult so to suppress inward emotion as to conceal it from those around him he looked once more on the being who for four long years had in secret so occupied his heart as never to permit the entrance of another image or the faintest thought of another love she was there not only yet more radiant in finished loveliness than when he had first beheld her but free and of his own race and creed and so exquisite were the feelings of the moment that he feared to be introduced lest her first glance upon his face if it revealed the horror that he believed it would should sentence him to misery that he had trembled needlessly was proved by his never leaving her side that evening the lively spirits of the young stranger appeared by some extraordinary species of mesmerism to call forth the same from him and lie conversed more brilliantly more unreservedly than he had ever before been known to do judah azavdo pursued his journey to his country house and inez quietly fixed her residence with a jewish family in london and pursued her intention of taking in plain work giving no more thought of her former affluence save to wish that part had been spared for her boy who through the efforts of padre jos and julian alvarez joined her about three weeks after her flight bringing the information that every article belonging to her had been seized and confiscated twice a week then three times and at length every day did azavdo on some pretence or other visit the fair fugitive folks talked and wondered but for once he heeded neither but why prolong our tale claimed as it is by truth however it may read like fiction not six weeks after inez left portugal a fugitive for her very life she became the wife of judah azavdo the richest hebrew in london and the possessor of a love as warm and unwavering as was ever felt by man but did shecould shereturn it reader we will not blazon the simplicity of truth with the false colouring of romance she did not love him in the general acceptation of the term and she told him so beseeching him to withdraw his offer if his heart could not rest satisfied with the respect and gratitude which alone she felt he thanked her for her candour but the hand was not withdrawn and they were married some biographers stop here bidding the curious reader probe not too deeply into the history of wedded life as regards our heroine however we shrink not from the probe the romance of love before marriage she might not have known but its reality afterwards she made so manifest even when disease joined to other infirmities so tried her husband as to render him fretful and irritable that there are still living some to assert that never was wife more tenderly affectionate more devotedly faithful than was inez azavdo her extraordinary beauty seemed invulnerable to age for i have heard it said that even in her coffin and she lived to the full age of mortality she retained it still the edict a tale of the love that bids the patriot rise to guard his countrys rest with deeper mightier fulness thrills in womans gentle breastms and we must wander witheringly in other lands to die and where our fathers ashes be our own may never liebyron then thou wouldst not leave this beautiful valley even with me josephine nay thou knowest thou dost but jest imri thou wouldst not give me such a painful alternative how knowest thou that love perchance i may grow jealous even of thy country an it hold so dear a place in thy gentle breast and seek a home elsewhereto prove if thy love of imri be dearer than thy love of land i know thou wouldst do no such thing my imri so play the threatening tyrant as thou mayest ill not believe thee or lessen by one throb the love of my land which shares my heart with thee i know too well thy heart beats true as mine thou wouldst not take me hence never my best beloved our children shall rove where we have roved and learn their fathers faith uninjured by closer commune with its foes here where the exiles of israel for centuries have found a peaceful home will we rest my josephine filling the little hearts of our children with thanksgiving that there is one spot of earth where the wandering and the persecuted may repose in peace and surely it is for this cause the love we bear our country is so strong so deep that the thought of death is less bitter than the dream of other homes we stand alone in our peculiar and most sainted creed alone in our law alone in our lives on earth in our hopes for heaven our doom is to wander accursed and houseless over the broad earth exposed to all the misery which man may inflict without the power to retaliate or shun surely oh surely then the home that is granted must be doubly dearso sheltered from outward ill so blessed with inward peace that it might seem we alone were the inhabitants of spain oh it is not only memory that hallows every shrub and stream and treeit is the consciousness of safety of peace of joy which this vale enshrines while all around us seemeth strife and gloom dearest imri is it marvel that i love it thus the speaker was a beautiful woman of some two or three and twenty summers there was a lovely finished roundness of form a deep steady lustre in her large black eye a full red ripe on her beautiful lip a rose soft yet glowing as the last tinge of sunset beaming in the energy of her words upon a cheek usually more paleall bespeaking a stage of life somewhat past that generally denominated girlhood but only pressing the threshold of the era which follows life was still bright and fresh and buoyant as youth would paint it but in the heart there were depths and feelings revealed that were never known to girlhood her companion some three or four years her senior presented a manly form and features more striking from their frankness and animation than any regular beauty but there was one other individual seated at some little distance from the lovers for such they were whose peculiar and affecting beauty would rivet the attention to the exclusion of all else he was a slight boy who had evidently not seen more than ten years though the light in the dark blue eye so deep so concentrated in its expression that it seemed to breathe forth the soul the expression ever lingering round his small delicately pencilled mouth appeared to denote a strength and formation of character beyond his years his rich chesnut hair long and gracefully curling fell over his light blue vest nearly to his waist and parted in the centre exposed a brow of such transparent fairness so arched and high that it scarce appeared natural to his eastern origin and spanish birth long lashes much darker than his hair almost concealed the colour of the eye save when it was fixed full on those who spoke to him and shaded softly yet with a mournful expression the pale and delicate cheek to which exertion or emotion alone had power to bring the frail and fleeting rose an indescribable plaintiveness pervaded the countenance none could define wherefore or why his very smile would gush on the heart like tears he was seated on the green sward weaving some beautiful flowers into a garland or wreath in perfect silence although he was not so far removed from his companions as to be excluded from their conversation could he have joined in it alas those lips had never framed a word no sound had ever reached his ear an animated response from imri followed his josephines last eager words and the boy as if desirous of partaking their emotion whatever it might be bounded towards them placing his glowing wreath on the brow of josephine with a fond admiring glance calling on imri by a sign to admire it with him then nestling closer to her bosom inquired in the same manner the subject of their conversation and when told there was no need of language to speak the boys reply he glanced eagerly almost passionately around him he stretched forth his arms as if embracing every long loved object and then he laid his hand on his heart as if the image of each were reflected there and stretching himself on the mossy earth as if there should be his last long sleep he pointed to distant mountains made a movement with his hands to denote the world beyond them then turned shudderingly away and laid his head on the bosom of his nearest and dearest relative on earth the situation of the valley of eshcol was in truth such as to inspire enthusiasm in colder hearts than josephines formed by one of the many breaks in the sierra morena and sharing abundantly the rich vegetation which crowns this ridge of mountains nine months in the year it appeared set apart by nature as a guarded and blessed haven of peace for the weary wanderers of israel who when the roman spoiler desolated their holy land tradition said there found a resting place lofty rocks and mountains hemmed it round throwing as it were a natural barrier between the valley and the world beyond the heath the rosemary the myrtle and the cistus grew in rich profusion amidst the cliffs while below the palm the olive the lemon orange and almond interspersed with flowering shrubs of every variety marked the site of the hamlet and might mournfully remind the poor fugitives of the yet richer and holier land their fathers sins had forfeited to the east a thick grove of palm cedar and olive surrounded the lowly temple where for ages the simple villagers worshipped the god of israel as their fathers did its plain and solid architecture resisted alike the power of storm and time and it was the pride of every generation to preserve it in the primitive simplicity of the past innumerable streams issuing from the mountains watered the vale some flowing with a silvery murmur and sparkling light others rushing and leaping over crags their prominences hid in the snowy foam creating alike variety and fertility the brilliant scarlet flower of the fig marigold mingled with the snowy blossoms of the myrtle peeping forth from its dark glossy leaves formed a rich garland around the trunks of many a stalwart tree and often at the sunset hour the perfume of the orange and almond the balsamic fragrance of the cistus mingling with yet apart from the others would float by on the balmy pinions of the summer breeze adding indescribably to the soothing repose and natural magic of the scene but it was not the mere beauty of nature which sunk so deeply on the hearts of the eshcolites as to create that species of amor patri of which josephines ardent words were but a faint reflection it was the fact that it was had been and they fondly hoped ever would be to them a second judea its very name had been bestowed by the unhappy fugitives from the destruction of jerusalem who hailed its natural loveliness as their ancestors did the first fruits of the land of promise throughout the whole of spain indeed the sons of israel were scattered far more numerously and prosperously than in any other country despite her repeated revolutions her internal wars her constant change of masters the hebrews so continued to flourish that the whole commerce of the kingdom became engrossed by them and occupying stations of eminence and trustthe heads of all seminaries of physic and literaturethey commanded veneration even from the enemies and persecutors of their creed with the nation at large however our simple narrative does not pretend to treat century after century found the little colony of eshcol flourishing and happy acknowledging no law but that of moses no god but him that law revealed it mattered not to them whether mahommedan or nazarene claimed supremacy in spain schism and division were unknown amongst them the same temple received their simple worship from age to age for if it chanced that the more eager the more ambitious spirits sought more stirring scenes they returned to the simplicity of their fathers conscious they had no power to alter and satisfied that they could not improve varying in population from three to five hundred families actuated by the same interests grief and joy became as it were the common property of allthe one inexpressibly soothed the other heightened by sympathythe vale of eshcol seemed marked out as the haven of peace the poet the minstrel the architect the agriculturist even the sculptor were often found amongst its inmates flourishing and venerated as men more peculiarly distinguished by their merciful creator than their fellows the sins that convulse kingdoms and agitate a multitude to them were unknown for the seditious the restless the ambitious sought a wider field bidding an eternal farewell to the vale whose peaceful insipidity they spurned crimes were punished by banishment perpetual or for a specified time according to the guilt liable indeed to death if the criminal returned but of this the records of eshcol present no example situated in the southern ridge of the sierra morena on the eastern extremity of andalusia and consequently at the very entrance of the moorish dominions yet natures care had so fortified the vale that it had remained both uninjured and undiscovered by the immense armies of ferdinand and isabella who for ten years had overrun the beautiful province of grenada and now at the commencement of our narrative had completed its reduction and compelled the last of the caliphs to acknowledge their supremacy in spain misery and death were busy within ten miles of the hebrew colony but there they entered not some aspiring youths had in truth departed to join the contending hosts but by far the greater number more indifferent to the fate of war cared not on which side the banner of victory might wavetheir affections centred so strongly on the spot of earth at once their birthplace and their tomb that to depart from it seemed the very bitterness of death tedious as this digression may seem it is necessary for the clear comprehension of our narrative for the appreciation of that feeling of amor patri which is its basis an emotion experienced in various degrees by every nation but by the jew in spain with a strength and intensity equalled by none and understood but by a few josephine castello in whom this feeling was resting yet more powerfully than in her compeers was regarded as an orphan and as such peculiarly beloved yet an orphan she was not the youth of her father simeon castello had been marked by such ungovernable passions as to render him an object of doubt and dread to all with the sole exception of onethe meekest gentlest most timid girl of eshcol perhaps it was the contrast with herselfthe generous temper the frank and winning smile the bold character of his striking beauty or the voiceless magic which we may spend whole lives in endeavouring to define and which only laughs at our wisdombut rachel asher loved him so faithfully so unchangeably that it stood the test of many months nay years of wandering on the part of simeon who on each return to the vale appeared more restless more wayward than before men said he was incapable of loving and augured sorrow and neglect for the gentle rachel even when seemingly touched by her meek and timid loveliness he bent his proud spirit to woo her love and was accepted they were married and some few years of quiet felicity appeared to belie the prognostics of the crowd but soon after the birth of a daughter the wandering propensities of her father again obtained ascendency and for months and then years he would be absent from his home uncomplainingly rachel bore this desertion for he was ever fond when he returned and even when she once ventured to entreat permission to accompany him it was with soothing affection not harsh repulse he refused assuring her though honoured and trusted by the nazarene he was seldom more than a month at one place and he could not offer delicate females the quiet settled home they needed rachel could have told him that privation and hardship with him would be hailed as blessings but she knew her husbands temper and acquiescing sought comfort in the increasing intelligence and beauty of her child ten years thus passed and then simeon as if involuntarily yielding to the love of his wife and child declared his intention of never again seeking the nazarene world and for two years he adhered to his resolution at the end of that time hailing with pleasure the promise of another little one to share with josephine the affection he lavished upon her this sudden change of character could not pass unnoticed by his fellows and no man being more tenacious of his honour than simeon castello it was of course exposed to many aspersions which his passionate temper could not brook it happened in a jovial meeting of youngsters when somewhat heated by excitement and wine that the character and actions of castello were canvassed somewhat more freely than sobriety would have ventured one of them at length remarked that in all probability he was glad to avail himself of the retreat of eshcol to eschew the hundred eyes of justice or revenge then die in thy falsehood liar were the words that uttered in thunder startled the assembly the man lives not who dares impugn the honour of castello and the hapless youth sunk to the earth before them stricken unto death the speechless horror of all around might easily have permitted flight but castello scorned it he knew his doom and met it in stern unflinching silenceto wander forth alone with the thoughts of blood clinging to his conscience till the mandate of his god summoned him to answer for his crimedeath if he ever ventured to insult the sacred precincts of his native vale by seeking to return the voice of his father faltered not as from his seat of judgment amid the elders of his people he pronounced this sentence his cheek blanched not as the wife and child of the murderer flung themselves at his feet beseeching permission to accompany the exile it could not be nay more did he return the law was such that his own wife or child must deliver him up to justice or share the penalty of his crime hour by hour beheld the wretched suppliants pleading for mercy but in vain nor did this more than roman firmness for it was based on love not stoicism desert him when in agonized remorse his son besought his forgiveness and his blessing he confessed his sin for he felt it such no provocation could call for blood and headstrong and violent as were the passions of simeon castello his father believed in his remorse his penitence for he knew deeds of blood were foreign to his nature he raised his clasped hands to heaven he prayed that the penitence of the sinner might be accepted he spoke his forgiveness and his blessing and then flinging his arms around his son his head sunk upon his shoulder minutes passed and there was no soundthe hebrew father had done his duty but his heart had brokenhe was dead from the moment she was released from the parting embrace of her doubly wretched husband and her strained eyes might no longer distinguish his retreating figure no word escaped the lips of rachel for the first time she looked on the sorrow of her poor child without any attempt to soothe or console she resumed her usual duties but it was as if a statue had been endowed with movement nor could the entreaties of her aged grandfather her sole remaining relative nor the caresses of josephine wring even one word of suffering from her lips a week passed and josephine held a little brother in her arms the looks of her mother appeared imploring her to cherish and protect him and kneeling she solemnly swore to make him the first object of her life belief beamed in the eyes of the dyingher look seemed beseeching the blessing of heaven on them both but josephine yearned in vain for the sweet accents of her voiceshe never spoke again from that hour the gay and sprightly child seemed changed into premature and sorrowing womanhood she stood alone of her race alone with the sole exception of that aged relative who had seen his children and childrens children fall around him and her infant brother she shrunk in her sensitiveness from the young companions who would have soothed her grief she did not fear that the crime of her father would be visited upon her innocent head for such feelings were unknown to the simple government of eshcol but her loneliness the shock which had crushed every hope and joy of youth caused her to cling closer to her aged relative and direct every energy to the welfare of her young andas alas she too soon discoveredafflicted brother she watched his increase in strength intelligence and loveliness and pictured in vivid colouring the delight which would attend his instruction she longed intensely for the moment when her ear should be blessed by the sweet accents of his voice that moment came not the affliction of her mother had descended to the child she bore and josephine in irrepressible anguish became conscious that not only was his voice withheld from her but hers might never reach his ear her deep affection for him however roused her from this mournful conviction and energetically she sought to render his affliction less painful than it had appeared and she succeeded she led him into the fields of natureevery spot became to the child a fruitful source of intelligence and love providing him with language even in inanimate objects by his mothers grave she instilled the thoughts of god and heaven of their peculiar race and history of the god of israels deep love and long suffering and she was understoodthough to what extent she knew not imagined not till the hour of trial came that she was inexpressibly assisted by the childs rapid conception of the good and evil of the sublime and beautifulby its extraordinary intellect and truly poets soul is true but the lowly spirit of josephine felt as if a special blessing had attended her task and urged yet further efforts for his improvement by means of waxen tablets formed by the hand of imri benalmar she taught him to read and write leading his attention to familiar objects she would write down their appropriate names and familiarising his eye to the writing he gradually associated the written word with the visible object the rest was easy to a mind like his the flushed cheek and sparkling eye denoted the intense delight with which he perused the manuscripts collected and often adapted for his use by imri and poesy became his passion breathing in the simplest words on his waxen tablets the love he bore his devoted sister and the pure beautiful sentiments which filled his soul the kindness of imri to her arli passed not unfelt by the heart of josephine tremblingly she became conscious that an emotion towards him was obtaining ascendency which she deemed it her duty to conquer or at least profoundly to hide she could not forget the stigma on her name and believed none could seek her love the daughter of a murderer for though the crime was involuntary such he was was lonely upon earth dignified and reserved they would have thought her proud had not her constant kindness her total forgetfulness of self in continually serving others belied the thought but this they did think and imri benalmar himself so well did she hide her heart that her affections were centred in her aged relative and her young brother but when the magic words were spoken when imri benalmar whose unwavering piety and steady virtue had caused him to stand highest and dearest in the estimation of his fellows young and old conjured her with a respectful deference which vainly sought to calm the passionate affection of his soul to bless him with her love her trustthe long hidden feelings of josephine were betrayed their inmost depths revealed blessed indeed was that moment to them both fondly did imri combat her arguments that she had no right to burden him with the aged asher and her helpless arli yet from them she could never consent to part had not arli ever been dear to him as a brotherhad he not always intended to prove himself such he asked with many other arguments of love and how might josephine reply save with tears of strong emotion to consent to become his bride josef asher heard of their engagement with delight but he would not consent to burden them with his continued company true he was old but neither infirm nor ailing he would retain possession of his own dwelling which had descended to him from many generations but the nearer his children resided the greater happiness for him imri understood the hint and as if by magic a picturesque little cottage not two hundred yards from her native home rose before the wondering eyes of josephine and arli as he watched its progress clapped his hands in childish joy and sought to aid the workmen in their tasks presents from all as is the custom of the hebrew nation were showered on the youthful couple to enable them to commence housekeeping with comfort or add some little ornament or useful article of furniture to the house or its adjoining lands the more the fiances were beloved the greater source of public joy was a wedding in eshcol the conversation which the commencement of our tale in part records took place a few evenings previous to the day fixed for the nuptials on leaving his sister and her betrothed arli betook himself as was his custom ere he joined the evening meal to his mothers grave to water the flowers around it and peruse in his simple and innocent devotion the little bible which josephine and imris love had rendered into the simplest spanish from the hebrew scriptures of their race the shades of evening had already fallen around the leafy shadowed place of tombs but there was sufficient light remaining for the boy to discern a cloaked and muffled figure prostrate before his mothers grave the head resting in a posture of inexpressible anguish on the cold marble of the tomb the strangers form moved convulsively and though arli could distinguish no sound he knew that it was grief on which he gazed softly he approached and laid his little hand on that of the stranger who started in evident alarm looking upon that angelic face with a strange mixture of bewilderment and love he spoke but arli shook his head mournfully putting his arm around his neck caressingly as if beseeching him to take comfort then as if failing in his desired object he hastily drew his tablets from his vest and wrote rapidly poor arli cannot speak nor hear but he can feel do not weep it is so sad to see tears in eyes like thine and why is it sad sweet boy the stranger wrote in answer straining him as he did so involuntarily closer to his bosom oh man should not weep and man like thee who can list the sweet voice of nature and the tones of all he loves who can breathe forth all he thinks and feels and likes tears are for poor arli and yet they do not come now as they did once for i have a father who loves and who can hear me too though none else can a father wrote the stranger who is thy father gentle boy thou bearest a name i know not tell me who thou art oh i have no father that i may see and hearnone that is on earth but i love him for he smiles on me through the sweet flowers and sparkling brooks and beautiful trees and i know he loves me and cares for me deaf and dumb and afflicted as i am and he hears me when i ask him to bless me and my sweet sister and reward her for all she does for me he is upup there and all around he stretched out his arms pointing to the star lit heavens and beautiful earth my fathers house is everywhere and when my body lies here as my mothers does my breath will go up to him and arli will be so happyso happy thy mother burst from the strangers lips as though the child could hear him and his hand so trembled that he could hardly guide the steel pencil which traced the word who is thy motherwhere does she lie arli laid his hand on the tomb pointing to the name of rachel castello there simply engraved the effect almost terrified him the stranger caught him in his armshe pressed repeated kisses on his cheek his brow his lipsclasping him as if to release him were death the child returned his caresses without either impatience or dissatisfaction after a while the stranger again wrote thy sister sweet boyis it she who hath taught thee these thingsdoth she liveis she happy oh so happy and imri kind imri will make her happier still arli loves him next to josephine and grandfather and i am to live with them and we are all happy oh how i love josephine i should have been so sadso sad had she not loved me taught me all but come to hershe will make thee happy too and thou wilt weep no more the evening meal waits for us bothwilt thou not come josephine will love thee for thou lovest arli a deep agonized groan escaped from the stranger vibrating through his whole frame several minutes passed ere he could make reply and then he merely wrote in almost illegible characters i am not good enough to go with you my child pray for melove me i shall remember thee and then again he folded him in his arms kissed him passionately and disappeared in the gloom ere arli could detain him or perceive his path though he sprang forward to do so the child watered his flowers more hastily than usual evidently preoccupied by some new train of thought which was shown by a rapid return to his grandfathers cottage and an animated recital through signs and his tablets of all that had occurred adding an earnest entreaty to imri to seek and find him josephine started from the tablethe rich glow of her cheek faded into a deathlike paleness and without uttering a syllable she threw her mantle around her and hastily advanced to the door imri and even the aged josef threw themselves before her whither wouldst thou go josephine dearest josephine this is not wellwhom wouldst thou seek my father she replied in a voice whose low deep tone betrayed her emotion shall he be lingering near unheeded uncared for by his child imri stay me not i must see him once again thou must not thou shalt not was imris agonized reply clasping her in his arms to prevent her progress josephine thy life is no longer thine own to fling from thee thus as a worthless thing it is minemine by thine own free gift thou shalt not wrest it from me thus my child seek not this stranger draw not the veil aside which he has wisely flung around him the penalty to both may not be waivedthou mayest not see him save to proclaimor die my child my child leave me not in my old age alone the mournful accents of the aged man completed what the passionate appeal had begun josephine sunk on a seat near him and burst into an agony of tears arli clung round her terrified at the effect of his simple tale and for him she roused herself warning him to repeat the tale to none but indeed to grant the strangers boon and remember him in lowly prayers fearfully both imri and asher waited the morning dreading lest its light should betray the stranger and thankfully did they welcome the close of that day and the next without his reappearance a very different feeling actuated the afflicted arli he sought him with the longing wish to look on his face again for it haunted his fancy lingered on his loveand a yet more hallowed spot became his mothers tomb the intervening days had passed the affection of imri bearing from the heart of josephine its last lingering sadness and enabling her to feel the anguish her impetuosity might have brought not only on her father and herself but on all whom she loved the first of may her bridal morn found her composed and smiling like herself she had placed her future fate without one doubt or fear in the keeping of imri benalmar for the tremors and emotions of modern brides were unknown to the maidens of eshcol once only her calmness had been disturbed when her young brother had approached her had clasped his arms about her neck and with glistening eyes had written his boyish love look at the sun sweet sister how brightly and beautifully he shines how soft and blue the sky and the sweet flowers and the little birds oh they all love thee and can smile and sing their joy and gentle friends throng round thee and speak loving words oh why is poor arli alone silent when his heart is so full but he can pray sweet sister pray as thou hast taught him and he will pray his father to give back to thee all which thou hast done for him was it marvel that josephines tears should fall over those fond words but the boys caresses turned that dewy joy to softer smiles as surrounded by her youthful companions she waited the entrance of her aged relative to conduct her to the temple three hours after noon the nuptial party there assembled marriages among the hebrews seldom being performed at an earlier hour twenty young girls dressed alike and half that number of matrons attended the bride and proudly did old josef gaze upon her as she leaned on his arm in all the grace and loveliness of beautiful womanhood unconscious how well it contrasted with his sinewy and athletic form his silvery beard and hair alone betrayed his four score and fourteen years there was no shadow of age upon his features beaming as they were in his quick sympathy with all around him the path was strewed with the fairest flowers and the freshest moss of varied hues while rich garlands interwoven with the blushing fruits festooned the trees the whole village wore the aspect of rejoicing and every shade passed from the brow of the young arli the flush deepened on his fair cheek the intense blue of his beautiful eye so sparkled in light that the eyes of all were upon him till they glistened in strange tears the bridegroom awaited the bride and her companions in the temple attended by an equal number the little edifice was filled for marriages in eshcol were ever solemnized in public the number that attended evincing the feelings with which the betrothed were regarded the ceremony commenced and save the voice of the officiating priest there was silence so profound that the faintest sound could have been distinguished as josephine flung back her veil at once to taste the sacred wine and prove to imri that no leah had been substituted for his rachel a distant trampling fell clearly on the still air the service continued but many looked up to the high casements as if in wonder the sun still poured down his golden flood of light no passing cloud announced an approaching storm so to explain the unwonted sounds as distant thunder they came nearer and nearer still the trampling of many feet seemed echoing from the mountain ground and at the moment imri flung down the crystal goblet on the marble at his feet as the conclusion of the solemn rites the shrill blast of many trumpets and the long roll of the pealing drum were borne on the wings of a hundred echoes far and near wild birds whose rest had never before been so disturbed rose screaming from their haunts darkening the air with their flapping wings again and again at irregular intervals this unusual music was repeated but though alarm blanched many a maidens cheek and the brows of the sterner sex became knit with indefinable emotion the afternoon service which ever follows the jewish nuptials continued undisturbed the eyes of josephine were fixed on imri more in wonder than alarm and benalmar had folded his arm round her and whispered mine mine in woe or in weal mine thou art and wilt be love whatever ill these martial sounds forbode a smile so bright so confiding was the answer that even had he not felt her cling closer to his heart imri would have been satisfied a sudden paleness banished the rich flush from the cheek of the deaf and dumb he relinquished his station under the canopy which had been held over the bride and bridegroom during the ceremony and drew closer to them he had heard indeed no sound but so keen are the other senses of the deaf and dumb that many have been known to feel what they cannot hear arli could read in a moments glance the countenances of those around him and at the same instant he became conscious of a thrilling sensation creeping through his every vein he took the hand of imri and looked up inquiringly in his face the answer was given and the child resumed the posture of devotion which his strange feelings had disturbed the last words of the presiding priest were spoken and there was silence even the sounds without were hushed and a voiceless dread appeared to withhold those within from seeking the cause there was evidently a struggle ere the usual congratulations could be offered to the young couple and so preoccupied was the attention of all that the absence of arli was unnoticed till as trumpet and drum again pierced the thin air he darted back and with hasty and agitated signs related what he had beheld soldiers many soldiers it may be so yet wherefore this alarm my children exclaimed the aged asher stepping firmly forward and speaking in an accent of mild reproof what can ye fear nazarene and mahommedan have oft times found a shelter in this peaceful valley fearlessly they came uninjured they departed wrong we have never done to man peace and goodwill have been our watchword wherefore then should we tremble to meet these strangers my children the god of israel is with us still the cloud passed from the brows of his hearers the young maidens emulated the calm firmness of the bride and gathering round her followed their male companions from the temple the spot on which the sacred edifice stood commanded a view of the village market place which from its occupying the only level ground half a mile square was surrounded by all the low dwellings of the artizans and was often the place of public meeting when any point was discussed requiring the suffrages of all the male population this space was now filled with spanish soldiers some on horseback others on foot while far behind scattered in groups amongst the rocks many a steel morion flung back the suns glistening rays the villagers startled and amazed had assembled on all sides and even josef asher for a moment paused astonished let us on my children he said and learn the meaning of this unusual muster yet stay he added as several young men hastened forward to obey him they are about to speak we will hear first what they proclaim another flourish of drums and trumpets sounded as he spoke and then one of the foremost cavaliers attired as a herald drew from his bosom a parchment roll the officers around doffed their helmets and he read words to the following import from the most high and mighty sovereigns ferdinand and isabella joint sovereigns of arragon and castile to whose puissant arms the grace of god hath given dominion over all heretics and unbelievers before whose banner of the holy cross the moorish abominations have crumbled into dustto our loyal subjects of every principality and province of every rank and stage and calling of every grade and every state theseto which we charge you all in charity give good heed whereas we have heard and seen that the jews of our states induce many christians to embrace judaism particularly the nobles of andalusia for this they are banished from our domains four months from this day we grant them to forswear their abominations and embrace christianity or to depart pronouncing death on every jew found in our kingdom after that allotted time signed ferdinand and isabella given at our palace of segovia this thirtieth day of march of the year of grace one thousand four hundred and ninety two as a thunderbolt falling from the blue and cloudless skyas the green and fertile earth yawning in fathomless chasms beneath their feet so but more terribly more vividly still did this edict fall on the faithful hearts who heard a sudden pause and then a cry an agonized cry of horror and despair burst simultaneously from young and old woman and child and then as awakened from that stupor of woe wilder shouts arose and the fiery youth of eshcol gathered tumultuously together and shrill cries of vengeance vengeance cut them downrend the lying parchment into shreds and scatter it to the four winds of heaventhus will we defend our rights found voice amid groans and hisses of execration and assault a volley of stones fell among the spaniards who standing firmly to their arms appeared in the act of charging when both parties were arrested by the aged patriarch of eshcol rushing in their very centre heeding not nay unconscious of personal danger calling on them to forbear are ye all mad he cried would ye draw down further ruin on your devoted heads think ye to cope with those armed by a sovereign mandate backed by a mighty kingdom oh for the love of your wives your children your aged helpless parents keep the peace and let your elders speak even at that moment their natural veneration for old age had influence reproved and sorrowful they shrunk backthe angry gesture calmed the muttered execration silenced surrounded by his brother elders asher drew near the spaniards who struck by his venerable age and commanding manner consented to accompany him to the council room near at hand desiring their men on the severest penalties to create no disturbance the edict was laid before them its purport explained enforced emphatically yet kindly for the spaniards felt awed in spite of themselves but vainly the old men urged that the given cause of their banishment could not extend to them they had had no dealing with the nazarene they lived to themselves alone they interfered not with the civil or religious government of the country which had sheltered them from age to age they warred with none offended none their very existence was often unsuspected they asked but liberty to live on as they had lived and would the sovereigns of spain deny them this it could not be the spaniards listened mildly but the edict had gone forth they said unto all and every class of jews within the kingdom and not one individual was exempt from its sentence save on the one conditiontheir embracing christianity it was true that many of their nation might be faithful subjects but even did their banishment involve loss to spain her sovereigns impressed with religious zeal welcomed the temporal loss as spiritual gain if indeed they could not comply with the very simple condition they urged the old men instantly to depart for one month out of the four had already elapsed the edict bearing date the last day but one of the month of march they added the secluded situation of the valley had caused the delay and might have delayed its proclamation yet longer had not chance led them to these mountains in search of an officer of rank who had wandered from them and they feared had perished in the hollows even at that moment a chilling dread shot through the heart of the aged asher could that officer be he whom arli had seen but seven days previous he dared not listen to his hearts reply and gave his whole attention to that which followed a second edict the spaniards continued to state had been issued prohibiting all christians to supply the fugitives with bread or wine water or meat after the month of april the old men heard there was little to answer though much to feel and sorrowing council occupied some time after the officers had retired they wished to learn the condition of their wretched countrymen and the real effects of this most cruel edict the blow had descended so unexpectedly it seemed as if they could not unless from the lips of an eye witness believe it true and they decided on sending twenty of their young men to learn tidings under the control of one calm firm and dispassionate enough to restrain those acts of violence to which they had already shown such inclination but who was this one how might they ask him the old men together sought the various groups and expressing their wishes all were eager to obey josef asher alone approached his children who sat apart from their companions he related all that had passed between them and the spaniards and then awhile he paused imri he said at length my son thou hast seen the misguided passion of our youth they must not go forth on this mission of unimpassioned observation alone our elders the wise and moderate must husband their little strength for their weary pilgrimage thou my son hast their wisdom with all the activity and energy of youth we would that thou shouldst head this band but a very brief absence is needed canst thou consent a low cry of suffering broke from the pale lips of josephine and she threw her arms round imri as thus to chain him to her side in such an hour wilt thou leave me imri his lip quivered his cheek paled and the few words he uttered were heard by her alone yes yes thou shalt go my beloved heed not my womans weakness thou wilt return and thenthen we will depart together oh what a world of agony did that one word speak the instant departure of the younger villagers occasioned some surprise but without further interference the spaniards began to pitch their tents amongst the rocky eminences as preparing for some months encampment had not the inhabitants of eshcol felt that their cup of bitterness was already full to the brim the appearance of an armed force in the very centre of their peaceful dwellings would have added gall but every thought feeling and energy were merged in one engrossing subject of anguish some there were who rejected all belief in the edicts truth they could not be banished from scenes in which they and their fathers had dwelt from age to age in peace and bliss others felt their minds a void they asked no question of their elders spoke not to each other but in strange and moody silence awaited the return of imri and his companions nor could the obnoxious sight of a huge wooden crucifix which the next morning greeted the eyes of every villager rouse them effectually from the lethargy of despair and josephine did she weep and moan now that the fate she so instinctively dreaded had fallen her tears were on her heart lying there like lead slowly yet surely undermining strength and poisoning the gushing spring of life in sobs and tears her young companions gathered round her and she spoke of comfort and resignation her gentle kindness soothing many and rousing them to hope on the return of the young men things might not be found so despairing as they now seemed but when twilight had descended and all was hushed josephine led her young brother to her mothers grave she looked on his sweet face paled with sympathetic sorrow though as yet he knew not why he wept and she sought to speak and tell him all but the thought that his young joys yet more than her own were blightedthat weakly and afflicted as he was he too must be torn from familiar scenes and objects which formed his innocent pleasures and encounter hardships and privation that stood in dread perspective before heroh was it strange that that noble spirit lost its firmness for the moment and that sinking on the green sward she buried her face in her hands and sobbed in an intensity of suffering which found not its equal even midst the deep woe around her arli knelt beside her he clasped her cold hands within his own he hid his head in her lapseeking by all these mute caresses which had never before appealed in vain to restore her to composure for his sake she roused herself she raised her tearful eyes to the star lit heavens in silent prayer and drawing him closer to her commenced her painful task too well his ready mind conceived her meaning his beautiful lip grew white and quiveringthe dew of suffering stood upon his brow but he shed no tearnay he sought to smile as thus to lessen his sisters care but when she told him the condition which was granted and bade him choose between the land of his love or the faith of his fathersa change came over his features he started from her side the red flush rushing to his cheek he drew his little bible from his bosom pressed it fervently to his lips and heart shook his clenched fist in direction of the spanish encampment and then laid down beside the grave my boy my boy there spoke the blessed spirit of our race and tears of inexpressible emotion coursed down the cheek of josephine as she clasped him convulsively to her aching heart death and exile aye torture thou wilt brave rather than desert thy faith my god my god thou wilt be with us still it was not till the ninth day from their departure that imri benalmar and his companions returned one glance sufficed to read their mournful tale on all sides they said they had beheld but cruelty and ruin perjury or despair from every town from every province their wretched brethren were flocking to the sea coasttheir homes their lands left to the ruthless spoiler or sold for one tenth of their value they told of a vineyard exchanged for a suit of clothesa house with all its valuables for a mule their gold silver and jewels prohibited either to be exchanged or carried away with them became the prey of their cruel persecutors famine and horror on every side assailed them many they had seen famishing on the roads for none dared give them a bit of bread or a draught of water and even mothers were known to slay their own children husbands their wives to escape the agony of watching their lingering deaths their illustrious countryman isaac abarbanel imri said had offered an immense sum to refill the coffers of spain emptied as they were by the moorish war would his sovereigns recall the fatal edict they had appeared to hesitate when thomas de torquemada advancing boldly into the royal presence raised high before them a crucifix and bade them beware how they sold for a higher price him whom judas betrayed for thirty pieces of silverto think how they would render an account of their bargain before god he had prevailed and the edict continued in full force on a towering rock in the centre of the mourning populace the aged asher stood he stretched forth his hands in an attitude of supplication and tears and groans were hushed to a voiceless pause there was a deep red spot on the old mans either cheek but his voice was still firm his attitude commanding my children he said we have heard our doom and even as our brethren we must go forth let us not in our misery blaspheme the god who so long hath blessed us with prosperity and peace and pour down idle curses on our foes my children cruel as they seem they are but his tools and therefore as to his decree let us bow without a murmur have we forgotten that on earth the exiles of jerusalem have no restingthat for the sins of our fathers the god of justice is not yet appeased oh if we have this fearful sentence may be promulgated to recall us to himself ere prosperity be to us as to our misguided ancestors the curse hurling us into eternal misery we bow not to man it is the god of israel we obey we must hence for who amongst us will deny him tarry not then my children we are but few days journey from the sea and in this are blest above our fellows waste not then the precious time allowed us in fruitless sorrow there are some among ye who speak of weakness and timidity in thus yielding to our foes without one blow in defence of our rights rights unhappy men ye have no rights sons of judah have ye yet to learn we are wanderers on the face of the earth without a country a king a judge in israel my children we have but one treasure which if called upon we can die to defendthe glorious faith our god himself hath given to him then let us unite in solemn prayer beseeching his guidance in our weary pilgrimagehis forgiveness on our cruel foes and fearless and faithful we will go forth where his will may lead the old man knelt and all followed his example and silence deep as if that wild scene were desolate succeeded those emphatic words a fervent blessing was then pronounced by the patriarch and all departed to their homes and now day after day beheld the departure of one or two families from the village we may dwell no longer on their feelings nor on those of their brethren in other parts of spain we envy not those who feel no sympathy in that devotedness to a persecuted faith which could bid men go forth from their homes their temples the graves of their fathers the schools where for centuries they had presided honoured even by their foes and welcome exile privation misery of every kind woes far worse than death rather than depart from it if they think we have exaggerated let the sceptic look to the histories of every nation in the middle ages and they will acknowledge this simple narrative is but a faint outline of the sufferings endured by the persecuted hebrews and inflicted by those who boast their religion to be peace on earth and goodwill to all men reduced from affluence to poverty from every comfort to the dim vista of every privation without the faintest consciousness where to seek a home or how to cross the ocean did imri benalmar regret that he had now a wife and a young helpless boy for whom to provide nay that josephine was his ere this dread edict was proclaimed was even at this moment a source of unalloyed rejoicing he knew her noble spirit and that had not the solemn service been actually performed she would have refused his protection his love and rather than burden him with such increase of care have lingered in that vale to die that she was inviolably his own endowed him however with an energy to bear which had he been alone would have failed him he thought but of her sufferings for though from her lips they had never found a voice he knew what she endured he told her there were some of their unhappy countrymen who rather than lose the honourable situations they enjoyed the riches they possessed had made a public profession of christianity and received baptism at the very moment they made a solemn vow in secret to act up to the tenets of their fathers faith alas are there indeed such amongst us thus doubly perjured was the sole observation of josephine looking up sorrowfully in his face they do not think it perjury my beloved they say the god of israel will pardon the public falsehood in consideration of their secret allegiance to himself but thou imri canst thou approve this course of acting couldst thou rest in such fatal security were i alone my josephine with none to love or care for death itself were preferable but oh when i look on thee and remember thy deep love for this fair soilwhen i think on arli on all that he must sufferthe misery we must all endurei could wish my mind would reconcile itself to act as others do that to serve my god in secret and those of wood and stone in public were no perjury oh do not say so imri think not of me my beloved i love not my home better than my godi would not accept peace and prosperity at such a price had i been alone death even by the sword of slaughter would have been welcome would have found me here for i could not have gone forth but now i am thine imri thine and whither thou goest i will go and thou shalt make me another home than this my husband where we may worship our god in peace and joy and there shall be blessing for us yet she had spoken with a smile so inexpressibly affecting in its plaintive sweetness that her husband could only press her to his heart in silence and inwardly pray it might be as she said of arli she had not spoken and he guessed too truly wherefore from the hour of their banishment a change had come over the spirit of the boy his smiles still greeted those he loved but he was longer away than was his wont and imri following him at a distance could see him ever lingering amid his favourite haunts and when far removed as he believed from the sight of man he would fling himself on the grass and weep till sometimes from very exhaustion sleep would steal over him and then starting up he would make hasty sketches of some much loved scenes to prove to his sister how well he had been employed these painful proofs of the poor boys sorrow imri could conceal but not the decay of bodily strength or deny when josephine appealed to him that his frame became yet more shadowy in its beautiful proportionsthat the rose which had spread itself on either cheek the unwonted lustre of the eye the increased transparency of his complexion told of the loveliness of another world yet for him how might they grieve it happened that one of the spanish soldiers a father himself and less violently prejudiced than his fellows had taken a fancy to the beautiful and afflicted boy always wandering about alone and he thought it would be doing a kind action to prevent his accompanying the fugitives by adopting him as his own believing it would be easy to rear him to the catholic church as one so young and moreover deaf and dumb could have imbibed little of the jewish misbelief kindly and tenderly he sought and won the childs affection and found means to converse with him intelligibly incapable of thinking evil arli doubted not his companions kindness and though aware he was a spaniard and a catholic artlessly betrayed the deep suffering his banishment engendered fadrique worked on this he told him he should not leave them that he would bring his family and live there and arli should be loved by all he worked on the boys fancy till he felt he had gained his point then erecting a small crucifix bade him kneel and worship the film passed from the eyes of the child indignation flashed from every feature and springing up he tore the cross to the earth and trampled it into the dust ten or twelve soldiers who had been carelessly watching fadriques proceedings from a distance enraged beyond measure at this insult from a puny boy darted towards him flung him violently to the earth and pointed their weapons at his throat at that instant josephine stood before them for she too had watched with the anxious eye of affection the designs of fadrique are ye men she exclaimed and the rude soldiers shrunk abashed from her glance that thus ye would take the blood of an innocent helpless childone whose very affliction should appeal to mercy denied as it may be to others on yourselves ye called this insult to your faith how else could he tell ye he refused your offers you bade him acknowledge that which his soul abhors and was it strange his hand should prove that which he hath no voice to speak and for this would ye take his life oh shame shame on your coward hearts sullenly the men withdrew at once awed by her mien and remembering that in assaulting any hebrew before the time specified in the edict was over they were liable to military severity fadrique lingered this was not my seeking he said respectfully i sought but the happiness of that poor child i would save him from the doom of suffering chosen by the elders of his race leave him with me and i pledge my sacred word his life shall be a happy one i thank thee for thy offer soldier replied josephine mildly but my brother has chosen his own fate i have used neither entreaties nor commands the boy who had betrayed no fear even when the deadly weapons were at his throat now took the hand of fadrique and by a few expressive signs craved pardon for the insult he had been led to commit and firmly and expressively refused his every offer thou hast yet to learn the deep love borne to our faith by her persecuted children my good friend said josephine perceiving the mans surprise was mingled with some softer feeling that even the youngest jewish child will prefer slavery exile or death to forswearing his fathers god may the god of israel bless thee for the kindness thou hast shown this poor afflicted boy but seek him not again she drew him closer to her and they disappeared together a tear rose to the spaniards eye but he hastily brushed it away and then telling his rosary as if it were sin thus to care for an unbeliever rejoined his comrades the family of imri benalmar was the last to quit the vale each was mounted on a mule and there were two led or sumpter mules on which was strapped as much clothing as they could conveniently stow away and provisions which they hoped would last them till they reached the vessel knowing well they could procure no more some few valuables imri contrived to secrete but his fortune principally consisting in land and its produce was of necessity irretrievably ruined josef asher accompanied them he had been active in consoling encouraging and assisting his weaker brethren not a family departed without receiving some token of his sympathy and love and young and old crowded round him ere they went imploring his blessings and his prayers it was however observed that of his own departure his own plans asher never spoke that he would accompany his children all believed and so did josephine herself but all were mistaken on the evening of their first days journey as they halted for rest and refreshment some unusual emotion was observable in the mien and features of the old man he asked them to join him in prayer and as he concluded he spread his hands upon their heads and blessed each by name emphatically unfalteringly as in his days of youth and now he said as they arose farewell my beloved children the god of israel go with ye and lead ye even as our ancestors of old with the daily cloud and nightly pillar i go no further with ye no further what means our father exclaimed imri and josephine together that i am too old to go forth to another land my children the god of judah demands not this from his old and weary servant fourscore and fifteen years i have served him in the dwelling place of mine own people and there shall his angel find me my sand is well nigh run out my strength must fail ere i reach the shore wherefore then should i go forth and by my infirmities bring down danger and suffering on my children oppose me not beloved ones refuse not your aged father the blessing of dying beside his own hearth alone untended and perchance by the sword of slaughter oh my father ask us not this exclaimed josephine with passionate agony throwing herself at his feet and clinging to his knees my child the spirit of my god will tend me i shall not be alone for his ministering angels will hover round me ere he takes me to himself and if it be by the sword of slaughter twill be perchance an easier passage for this sorrowing soul than the lingering death of age then let me return and die with you not so my child thy life hath barely passed its spring twould be sin thus to sport with death the god who calls me to death bids thee go forth to serve himto proclaim his great name in other lands thy husband thy poor arli both call on thee to live for them thou wouldst not turn from the path of duty my beloved child dark and dreary as it may seem see thine imri weeps and thou who shouldst cheer hast caused these unmanly tears she turned towards her husband and with a painful sob sunk into his extended arms asher gave one long lingering look of love folded the weeping arli to his bosom and ere imri could sufficiently recover his emotion to speak the old man was gone the death he sought was speedily obtained the spanish officers and several of the men had quitted eshcol leaving only the lowest rank of soldiery to keep watch lest any of the fugitives should return and taking advantage of the secluded situation of the vale set the edict at defiance effectually to prevent this the men were commanded to turn the little temple to a place of worship for true believers workmen with images shrines and pictures were sent to assist them and a pension promised to every catholic family who would reside there thus to exterminate utterly all trace of heresy and its abominations the men thus employed ignorant and bigoted exulted in the task assigned them and only lamented that no human blood had been shed to render their holocausts to their patron saints more efficacious still the return of asher excited some surprise but believing he would depart ere the allotted period had expired they took little heed of his movements the work continued crosses were affixed to every side images decked the interior and all promised fair completion when one night a wild cry of fire resounded and hurrying to the spot they beheld their work in flames it was an awful picture the night was pitchy dark but far and near the thick woods and blackened heavens suddenly blazed up with lurid hue there were dusky forms hurrying to and fro oaths and execrations mingled with the stormy gusts which fanned the flames into greater fury and amidst them all calmly looking on the work his hand had wrought there stood an aged man whose figure in that glow of light appeared gigantically proportioned his silvery hair streamed back from his broad unwrinkled brow and stern unalterable resolution was impressed upon his features he was seen recognised and with a yelling shout the murderers darted on their prey come on he cried waving his arms triumphantly above his head come on and wreak your vengeance on these aged limbs tis i have done this better flames should hurl it to the dust than the temple of god be profaned by the abominations he abhors come on i glory in the deed he spoke and fell pierced with a hundred wounds a smile of peculiar beauty lighted up his features blessed be the god of israel the sole one the holy one he cried and his spirit fled rejoicing to the god he served slowly and painfully did imris little family pursue their way they chose the most secluded paths but even there traces of misery and death awaited them and they shrank from suffering they could not alleviate there might be seen a group dragging along their failing limbs their provisions exhausted and the pangs of hunger swallowing up all other thoughts there lay the blackening bodies of those who had sunk and died scarcely missed and often envied by the survivors often did the sound of their footsteps scare away large flocks of carrion birds who screaming and flapping their heavy wings left to the travellers the loathsome sight of their half devoured prey and they saw too the fearful fascinated gaze of those in whom life was not utterly extinct as they watched the progress of these horrible birds dreading lest they should dart upon them ere death had rendered them insensible josephine looked on these things and then on her young brother whose strength each day too evidently declined arlis too sensitive spirit shrank in shuddering anguish from every fresh scene of human suffering he whose young life had been so full of peace and bliss knowing but love and goodwill passing from man to man how might he sustain the change he had no voice to speak those feelings no time to give them vent in the sweet language of poesy which in happier hours had been the tablet of his soul as the invisible worm at the root of a blooming flower secretly destroying its sap its nourishment and the flower falls ere one of its leaves hath lost its beauty so it was with the orphan boy each day was imri compelled to shorten more and more their journey for often would arli drop fainting from his mule though the cheek retained its exquisite bloom his eye its lustre imri became fearfully anxious from the comparative vicinity of the sea shore he had believed their provisions would be more than sufficient to last them on their way but from these unlooked for delays the horrors of famine thirst that most horrible death stood darkly before him josephine his own his loved would she encounter horrors such as they had witnessed imri shuddered one evening arli lay calmly on the soft bed of moss and heath his sisters love had framed his hand clasped hers his eyes seemed to speak the unutterable love and gratitude he felt they were in the wildest part of a thick forest in the sierra nevada and imri unable to look on the sufferings of his beloved ones had wandered forth alone distant sounds of the chase fell at intervals on the ears of josephine but they were far away and her soul was too enwrapt to heed them suddenly however her attention was effectually roused by the large crashing of the bushes near them accompanied by low yet angry growls arli marked the sudden change in her features his eye too had caught an object by her still unseen he sprang up with that strength which energy of feeling so often gives when bodily force has gone and grasped tightly the hunting spear he held scarcely had he done so when a huge boar sprung through the thicket his flanks streaming with blood his tusks upraised his mouth gaping covered with foam and uttering growls denoting pain and fury yet more clearly than his appearance he stood for a second motionless then as if startled by the agonized scream of terror bursting from josephine he sprung upon the daring boy undauntedly arli met his approach his spear aimed by an eye that never failed pierced him for a second to the earth but alas the strength of the boy was not equal to his skill the boar yet more enraged tore the weapon from the ground which it had not pierced above an inch once more he fell struck down by a huge stick which arli with the speed of lightning had snatched up again he rose and fastened on the child a blow from behind forced him to relax his stifling hold furious he turned on the slight girl who had dared attack him and josephine herself would have shared her brothers fate when the spear of imri whizzed through the air true to its mark and the huge animal with a cry of pain and fury rolled lifeless on the ground the voice of his beloved had startled imri from his mournful trance the roar which followed explained its source and winged by terror he arrived in time josephine was saved indeed but no word of thankfulness broke from that heart which in grateful devotion had never been dumb before she knelt beside the seemingly lifeless body of her arli scarcely conscious of the presence of her husband his hands his neck his brow were deluged in blood she bathed him plentifully with cold water could she remember at such a moment that no springs were near and that if overwhelmed with thirst the pure element would be denied them oh no no she saw only the helpless sufferer to whom her spirit clung with a love that in their affliction had with each hour grown stronger but death was still a brief while deferred though so fearfully had arli been injured they could not move him thence his wounds were numerous and painful and strength to support himself even in a sitting position never again returned yet never was that sweet face sad his smiles his signs were ever to implore his sister not to weep for himto take comfort and be happy in another land that the blissfulness of heaven was already on his soulthat if it might be he would pray for her before his god and hover like a guardian spirit over her weary wanderings till he led her to a joyous home for him indeed josephine might not grieve but for imri she felt the deepest anxiety the horrors to which this unlooked for delay exposed him had startled her into consciousness and on her knees she besought him to seek his own safety she would not weakly shrink but when all was over she would follow him and in all probability they would meet again in another land not to risk his precious life and strength by lingering with her beside the dying boy she pleaded with all a womans unselfish love but need we say in vainthat imris sole answer was to lift his right hand to heaven and swear by all they both held most sacred never to leave herthey would meet their fate together days passed their small portion of food and water economised as it was dwindled more and more away and so did the strength of arli it was a night of unclouded beauty millions and millions of stars spangled the deep blue heavens the moon in her full glory walked forth to silver many a dark tree and dart her most refulgent rays on that little group of human suffering yet all was not suffering the purest happiness beamed on the features of the dying and an unconscious calm pervaded the weary spirit of these lonely watchers nature was so still they spoke almost in whispers as fearing to disturb her a sudden change spread on the features of the dying boy imri started josephine the chains are renthe hears us he cried and josephine raising him in her arms almost involuntarily spoke in uttered words arli my own my beautiful he heard the film was removed one brief moment from his ear her voice sweet as thrilling music fell upon his soul his lips moved and one articulate word then came unearthly in its sweetness josephine he raised his clasped hands to heaven and sunk back upon her bosom his soul had hovered on the earth one moment free then fled for ever imri and josephine joined in prayer beside the loved they neither mourned nor wept and calmly josephine wrapped the fadeless flower in the last garment of mortality while imri formed his resting place they laid him in that humble grave strewed flowers and moss upon it prayed that their god would in mercy guard his body from the ravening beasts then turned from that hallowed spot and silently pursued their journey it wanted but two days to the completion of the allotted period when faint weak and well nigh exhausted imri and his josephine stood on the sea shore and there horrible indeed was the sight that presented itself hundreds of the wretched fugitives lay famishing on the scorching sands many who had dragged on their failing limbs through all the horrors of famine of thirst of miseries in a thousand shapes which the very pen shrinks from delineating arrived there but to die for there were but few vessels to bear them to other lands and these often sailed with half their number either because the bribes they demanded were refused for the wretched victims had nought to give or that their captains swore so many heretics would sink their ships and they would take no more then it was that with a crucifix in one hand and bread and wine in the other the catholic priests advanced to the half senseless sufferers and offered the one if they acknowledged the other was it marvel that at such a moment there were some who yielded oh there is a glory and a triumph in the martyrs death men look with admiring awe on those who smile when at the stake but the faith that inspired courage and firmness and constancy mid suffering which we have but faintly outlinedmid lingering torments neath which the heart yet more than the frame was crushedthat faith is regarded with scorn as a blinded wilful misbelief could man endow his own spirit with this devotedness pride might lead him to the stake but not to bear what israel had borne aye and will bear till the wrath of his god is turned aside no the same god who strengthened abraham to offer up his son enables his wretched people to give up all for him would he do this had they denied and mocked him imri saw the cold shuddering creeping over the blighted form of his beloved and he led her to a sheltering rock whose projecting cliffs partly concealed the wretched objects on the beach there was one vessel on the broad ocean and in her he determined at once to secure a passage if to do so cost the forfeit of the few valuables he had been enabled to secrete he lingered awhile by the side of his josephine for he saw with anguish the noble spirit which had so long sustained and consoled her now for the first time appear to droop the sudden appearance of a spanish officer and his apparent advance towards them arrested him as he was about to depart he was attired richly his whole bearing seeming to denote a person of some rank and consequence josephines gaze became almost unconsciously riveted upon him he came nearer nearer still they could trace his features on which sorrow or care had fixed its stamp a moment he removed the plumed cap from his head and passed his hand across his brow an exclamation of recognition escaped the lips of imri and in another moment josephine had bounded forward and was kneeling at his feet my father my father she sobbed forth o god i thank thee for this unlooked for mercy i have seen him once again thouart thou my child my josephine whom i left in such bright blooming beautywhom i have sought in such trembling anguish from the moment i might reach these shores child of my rachel art thou canst thou be oh yes yes yes twas thus she looked when i departed could i hope to see thee as i left thee when blight and misery fell upon thy native vale as on all the dwellings of thy wretched race and io godmy child my child curse me hate mei hurled down destruction on thy house but even as he spoke in those wild accents of ungovernable passion but too familiar to the ears that heard he had raised and strained her convulsively to his breast covering her cheeks and lips with kisses till his burning tears of agonized remorse mingled with those of softer feeling on the cheeks of josephine but not long might she indulge in the blessed luxury of tears shuddering she repeated his last words gazing up in his face with eyes of horrified inquiry yes i even i my child i was not sufficiently wretchedthe bitter cup of remorse was not yet full the edict was proclaimed on all sides there was but wretchedness and unutterable misery beyond all this woe built world hath known then came a wild yearning to look again upon my native valeto know if in truth its concealed and sheltered caves had escaped uninjured by the wide spreading devastating scourge that edict broughtto look on thee my child if i might without endangering that precious lifeto know the fate of my unborn babe i dared not dream my wife yet lived josephine i looked upon her tomb and by its side beheld my own my beautiful my unknown boy o god o god my crime was visited upon his innocent head and whereoh where is he why may i not look upon his sweet face again he ceased choked by overwhelming emotion and some minutes passed ere either of his agitated listeners could summon sufficient composure to reply but the anguish of castello seemed incapable of increase for several minutes indeed he was silent the convulsive workings of his features denoting how deeply that simple narrative had sunk when he spoke it was briefly and hurriedly to relate how he had lingered in the vicinity of eshcol till at length discovered by a party of spaniards sent to seek him with a message from the sovereigns his wanderings had been tracked and that which he had most desired to avert he had been the means of accomplishingthe discovery of the vale and then convulsively clasping the hands of josephine and imri in his own he besought them to remove in part the load of misery from his heartto say they would not leave him more goest thou then forth my father hast thou indeed tarried for us that we may seek a home together the fathers eyes shrunk beneath those mild inquiring eyes my child i go not forth he said at length and his voice trembled josephine gently withdrew herself from his arms and laid her hand on her husbands my child my noble child he said in smothered accents i am not perjured i am still a son of israel though to the world a catholic oh do not turn from me come with me to my home and thou shall see how the exiled and the persecuted can defy the power of their destroyers life with every luxury shall be thy portion thine imri shall have every dream of ambition and joy fulfilled the children of sigismund castello will be courted cherished and loved tis but to kneel in public before the cross of the nazarenein private we are sons of israel still father urge me not it cannot be was her calm and firm reply hast thought on all that must befall thee in other perchance equally hostile lands my child thou knowest not all thou mayest have to endure it is welcome she answered the more rugged the path to heaven the more blessed will seem my final rest and thou wilt leave me to all the agonies of remorse to struggle on with the blackening thought that not only have i murdered those i love best on earthmy wife my boybut sent ye forth to poverty privation and misery josephine josephine have mercy and the father threw himself before his child grovelling in the sand and clasping his hands in the wild energy of supplication father father drive me not mad i cannot cannot bear this imri my husband if thou wouldst save my heart from treachery raise himin mercy raise him i cannot answer with him there god god of israel leave me not now my brain is reelingsave me from myself she staggered back and terrified at those accents of almost madness her father sprang from the ground he caught her again in his arms while imri kneeling beside her chafed her cold hands in his imploring her to speak to look on him again my child my child wake wake i will not grieve thee thus again but oh thy husbands look would pray thee not to go forth the god of love of pity demands not this self sacrifice imri one word from thee would be sufficient look on her think to what thou bearest her when peace comfort and luxuries await ye with but one word speak speak thou canst not wilt not take her hence though well nigh senseless well nigh so exhausted alike in body and mind that further exertion seemed impossible josephine roused herself from that trance of faintness to gaze wildly and fearfully on the face of her husband it was terribly agitated she threw herself on his neck and gasped forth canst thou bid me do this thing my husband he struggled to answer but there came no word strength the mighty strength of virtue returned to that sinking frame she stood erect and spoke without one quivering accent or one failing word imri my husband by the love thou bearest me by all we both hold sacred by that great and ineffable name we are forbidden to pronounce i charge thee answer me truly didst thou stand alonewere josephine no morehow wouldst thou decide the eye of god is upon theedeceive me not he turned from that searching glance his strong frame shook with emotion his voice was scarcely audible yet these words came i never could deny my god exile and death were welcomebut for thee enough my husband she exclaimed and throwing her arms around him she turned again to her father a glow of holy triumph tinging her pallid cheek and wouldst thou tempt him to perjury for my sake on no no father beloved revered from the first hour i could lisp thy name oh pardon me this first disobedience to thy will did i linger how might i save thee from remorse when each day each hour thou wouldst see me fade beneath the whelming weight of perjury and falsity no no bless me oh bless me ere i go and the prayers of thy child shall rise each hour for thee again she knelt before him and castello inexpressibly affected felt he dared urge no more how might he agonize that heart when in neither word nor hint nor sign did she utter reproach on him again and again he reiterated blessings on her sainted head and when he could release her from his embrace it was to secure their speedy passage in the vessel which his command had detained in her moorings though the hope that he should once more look upon his child had well nigh faded ere she came the exiles stood upon the deck a hundred other of the miserable fugitives had found a refuge in this same vessel whose captain somewhat more humane than many of his fellows and richly bribed by castello set food before the famishing wanderers directly they had weighed anchor but even the cravings of nature were lost in the one feeling that they gazed for the last time on the land they loved there were dark thunder clouds sweeping over the sky mingled with others of brilliant colouring that proclaimed the hour of sunset the ocean horizon seemed buried in murky gloom but the shores of spain stood forth bathed in a glow of warm red light as if to bid the unhappy wanderers farewell in unrivalled brilliance for awhile there was silence on the vessel so deep so unbroken that the flapping of the sails against the masts was alone distinguishable it was then a wild and wailing strain burst simultaneously from the fugitives the young and the old the strong man and exhausted female joined almost unconsciously in the language of jerusalem they chanted forth their wild farewell which may thus be rendered in english verse farewell farewell we wander forth doomd by th eternals awful wrath with nought to bless our lonely path across the stormy wave cast forth as wanderers on the earth torn from the land that hailed our birth from childhoods cot from manhoods hearth from temple and from grave farewell farewell thou beauteous sod which israel has for ages trod we leave thee to the oppressors rod weeping the exiles doom we go no more thy turf we press no more thy fruits and vineyards bless no land to loveno home possess save earths cold breastthe tomb where we have roamed the strangers roam the stranger claims each cherished home and we must ride on oceans foam accursed and alone false gods pollute our holy fane false hearts its sacred precincts stain false tongues our fathers god profane but we are still his own farewell farewell oer land and sea whereer we roam our soul shall be land we have loved so long with thee though sad and lone we dwell thou land where happy childhood played where youth in loves sweet fancies strayed where long our fathers bones have laid our own bright landfarewell illustration wilder and louder thrilled the strain until the last verse when mournfully the voices for a few seconds swelled and then gradually died away to silence broken only by sobs and tears imri and josephine alone sat apart they had not joined the melody but their souls in silence echoed back its mournful wailing josephine half sat half reclined on a pile of cushions where she might command the last view of spain imri leaned against a mast close beside her but few words passed between them for each felt the effort to speak was made only for the other and they ceased to war thus with nature a sudden gloom darkened the heavens the glow passed from the beautiful shores a heavy fall of dense clouds hung over them and concealed them from the eyes which in that direction lingered still the last gleam of light disclosed to imri his josephine in the attitude of calm and happy slumber her head reclined upon her arm and the long dark curls had fallen over her face and neck he rejoiced for he thought nature had at length found the repose she so much needed his own eyelids felt heavy and his limbs much exhausted but he remained watching untired the sleep of his beloved heavy gusts now at intervals swept along the ocean the blackened waves rolled higher and higher at the call now crested by the snowy foam the vessel rocked and heaved and speedily driven from her course mocked every effort to guide her southward one moment riding proudly on the topmost wave the next sinking in a deep valley as about to be whelmed by huge mountains of roaring water distant thunder mingled with the moaning gust coming nearer and nearer till it burst above their heads louder and longer than the discharge of a hundred cannons the foiled lightning streamed through the ebon sky illumining all around for above a minute by that blue and vivid glare and then vanishing in darkness yet more terrible the elements were at war around them cries of human terror joined with the roar of the ocean the rolling thunder the groaning blasts but there was no movement in the form of josephine could she still sleep could exhaustion render her insensible to sounds like these imri knelt beside her and called her by namejosephine my beloved oh waken there was no answer at that moment a bright flash darted through the gloom and sea and sky appeared on fire a strange and crashing sound succeeded followed by a cry of agony which bursting from a hundred throats echoed far and near drowning even the noise of the raging storm for it was the deep tone of human terror and despair the topmast fell shivered by the lightning in the very centre of the deck flames burst forth where it fell and on went the devoted vessel a blazing pile on the booming waters imri benalmar moved not from his kneehe heard not the cries of suffering echoing roundhe knew not the cause of that livid glare which had so suddenly illumined every objecthe knew nothing felt nothing save that he gazed on the face of the dead a fearful sound seeming distinct from the warring elements called forth many of the hardy inhabitants of malaga from their homes they hurried to the beach and appalled and startled beheld one part of the horizon completely bathed in living fire sea and sky united by a sheet of flame presently it appeared to divide and borne onwards by the winds and waves a ball of fire floated on the water it came nearerand horror and sympathy usurped the place of superstition as a burning vessel rose and fell with every heaving wave the storm was abated though the sea yet raged and many a hardy fisherman pushed out his boat in the pious hope of saving some of the unfortunate crew their efforts were in vain ere half the distance was accomplished there came a hissing sound the flames for one brief moment blazed with appalling brilliancethen sunk and there was a void on the wide waste of waters the escape a tale of dark lowers our fate and terrible the storm that gathers oer us but nothing till that latest agony which severs thee from nature shall unloose this fixed and sacred hold in thy dark prison house in the terrific force of armed law yea on the scaffold if it needs must be i never will forsake theejoanna baillie about the middle of the eighteenth century the little town of montes situated some forty or fifty miles from lisbon was thrown into most unusual excitement by the magnificence attending the nuptials of alvar rodriguez and almah diaz an excitement which the extraordinary beauty of the bride who though the betrothed of alvar from her childhood had never been seen in montes before of course not a little increased the little church of montes looked gay and glittering for the large sums lavished by alvar on the officiating priests and in presents to their patron saints had occasioned every picture shrine and image to blaze in uncovered gold and jewels and the altar to be fed with the richest incense and lighted with tapers of the finest wax to do him honour the church was full for although the bridal party did not exceed twenty the village appeared to have emptied itself there alvars munificence to all classes on all occasions having rendered him the universal idol and caused the fame of that days rejoicing to extend many miles around there was nothing remarkable in the behaviour of either bride or bridegroom except that both were decidedly more calm than such occasions usually warrant nay in the fine manly countenance of alvar ever and anon an expression seemed to flit that in any but so true a son of the church would have been accounted scorn in such a one of course it was neither seen nor regarded except by his bride for at such times her eyes met his with an earnest and entreating glance that the peculiar look was changed into a quiet tender seriousness which reassured her from the church they adjourned to the lordly mansion of rodriguez which in the midst of the flowering orange and citron trees stood about two miles from the town the remainder of the day passed in festivity the banquet and dance and song both within and around the house diversified the scene and increased hilarity in all by sunset all but the immediate friends and relatives of the newly wedded had departed some splendid and novel fireworks from the heights having attracted universal attention alvar with his usual indulgence gave his servants and retainers permission to join the festive crowds liberty to all who wished it was given for the next two hours in a very brief interval the house was cleared with the exception of a young moor the secretary or book keeper of alvar and four or five middle aged domestics of both sexes gradually and it appeared undesignedly the bride and her female companions were left alone and for the first time the beautiful face of almah was shadowed by emotion shall i oh shall i indeed be his she said half aloud there are moments when our dread secrets are so terrible it seems to forbode discovery at the very moment it would be most agonizing to bear hush silly one was the reply of an older friend discovery is not so easily or readily accomplished the persecuted and the nameless have acquired wisdom and caution at the price of bloodlearned to deceive that they may triumphto conceal that they may flourish still almah we are not to fall i know it inez a superhuman agency upholds us we had been cast off rooted out plucked from the very face of the earth long since else but there are times when human nature will shrink and tremblewhen the path of deception and concealment allotted for us to tread seems fraught with danger at every turn i know it is all folly yet there is a dim foreboding shadowing our fair horizon of joy as a hovering thunder cloud there has been suspicion torture death oh if my alvar nay almah this is childish it is only because you are too happy and happiness in its extent is ever pain in good time comes your venerable guardian to chide and silence all such foolish fancies how many weddings have there been and will there still be like this come smile love while i re arrange your veil almah obeyed though the smile was faint as if the soul yet trembled in its joy on the entrance of gonzolas her guardian she was an orphan and an heiress her veil was thrown around her so as completely to envelope face and form taking his arm and followed by all her female companions she was hastily and silently led to a sort of ante room or cabinet opening by a massive door concealed with tapestry from the suite of rooms appropriated to the private use of the merchant and his family there alvar and his friends awaited her a canopy supported by four of the youngest males present was held over the bride and bridegroom as they stood facing the east a silver salver lay at their feet and opposite stood an aged man with a small richly bound volume in his hand it was open and displayed letters and words of unusual form and sound another of alvars friends stood near holding a goblet of sacred wine and to a third was given a slight and thin venetian glass after a brief and solemn pause the old man read or rather chanted from the book he held joined in parts by those around and then he tasted the sacred wine and passed it to the bride and bridegroom almahs veil was upraised for her to touch the goblet with her lips now quivering with emotion and not permitted to fall again and alvar where now was the expression of scorn and contempt that had been stamped on his bold brow and curling lip before gonelost before the powerful emotion which scarcely permitted his lifting the goblet a second time to his lips then taking the venetian glass he broke it on the salver at his feet and the strange rites were completed yet no words of congratulation came drawn together in a closer knot while alvar folded the now almost fainting almah to his bosom and said in the deep low tones of intense feeling mine mine for ever nowmine in the sight of our god the god of the exile and the faithful our fate whatever it be henceforth is one the old man lifted up his clasped hands and prayed god of the nameless and homeless he said and it was in the same strange yet solemn sounding language as before have mercy on these thy servants joined together in thy holy name to share the lot on earth thy will assigns them with one heart and mind strengthen thou them to keep the secret of their faith and raceto teach it to their offspring as they received it from their fathers pardon thou them and us the deceit we do to keep holy thy law and thine inheritance in the land of the persecutor the exterminator be thou their shield and save them for thy holy name but if discovery and its horrible consequencesimprisonment torture deathawait them strengthen thou them for their enduranceto die as they would live for thee father hear us homeless and nameless upon earth we are thine own aye strengthen me for him my husband turn my woman weakness into thy strength for him almighty father was the voiceless prayer with which almah lifted up her pale face from her husbands bosom where it had rested during the whole of that strange and terrible prayer and in the calmness stealing on her throbbing heart she read her answer it was some few minutes ere the excited spirits of the devoted few then present male or female master or servant could subside into their wonted control but such scenes such feelings were not of rare occurrence and ere the domestics of rodriguez returned there was nothing either in the mansion or its inmates to denote that anything uncommon had taken place during their absence the portuguese are not fond of society at any time so that alvar and his young bride should after one week of festivity live in comparative retirement elicited no surprise the former attended his house of business at montes as usual and whoever chanced to visit him at his beautiful estate returned delighted with his entertainment and his hosts so that far and near the merchant alvar became noted alike for his munificence and the strict orthodox catholicism in which he conducted his establishment and was alvar rodriguez indeed what he seemed if so what were those strange mysterious rites with which in secret he celebrated his marriage for what were those many contrivances in his mansion secret receptacles even from his own sitting rooms into which all kinds of forbidden food were conveyed from his very table that his soul might not be polluted by disobedience how did it so happen that one day in every year alvar gave a general holidayleave of absence for four and twenty hours under some well arranged pretence to all save those who entreated permission to remain with him and that on that day alvar his wife his moorish secretary and all those domestics who had witnessed his marriage spent in holy fast and prayerpermitting no particle of food or drink to pass their lips from eve unto eve or if by any chance the holiday could not be given their several meals to be laid and served yet so contriving that while the food looked as if it had been partaken of not a portion had they touched that the saturday should be passed in seeming preparation for the sunday in cessation from work of any kind and in frequent prayer was perhaps of trivial importance but for the previous mysteriesmysteries known to alvar his wife and five or six of his establishment yet never by word or sign betrayed how may we account for them there may be some to whom the memory of such things as common to their ancestors may be yet familiar but to by far the greater number of english readers they are in all probability as incomprehensible as uncommon alvar rodriguez was a jew one of the many who in portugal and spain fulfilled the awful prophecy of their great lawgiver moses and bowed before the imaged saints and martyrs of the catholic to shrine the religion of their fathers yet closer in their hearts and homes from father to son the secret of their faith and race descended so early and so mysteriously taught that little children imbibed itnot alone the faith but so effectually to conceal it as to avert and mystify all inquisitorial questioning long before they knew the meaning or necessity of what they learned how this was accomplished how the religion of god was thus preserved in the very midst of persecution and intolerance must ever remain a mystery as happily for israel such fearful training is no longer needed but that it did exist that jewish children in the very midst of monastic and convent tuition yet adhered to the religion of their fathers never by word or sign betrayed the secret with which they were intrusted and in their turn became husbands and fathers conveying their solemn and dangerous inheritance to their posteritythat such things were there are those still amongst the hebrews of england to affirm and recall claiming among their own ancestry but one generation removed those who have thus concealed and thus adhered it was the power of god not the power of man human strength had been utterly inefficient torture and death would long before have annihilated every remnant of israels devoted race but it might not be for god had spoken and as a living miracle a lasting record of his truth his justice aye and mercy israel was preserved in the midst of danger in the very face of death and will be preserved for ever it was no mere rejoicing ceremony that of marriage amongst the disguised and hidden israelites of portugal and spain they were binding themselves to preserve and propagate a persecuted faith they were no longer its sole repositors did the strength of one waver all was at end they were united in the sweet links of loveframing for themselves new ties new hopes new blessings in a rising familyall of which at one blow might be destroyed they existed in an atmosphere of death yet they lived and flourished but so situated it was not strange that human emotion both in alvar and his bride should on their wedding day have gained ascendency and the solemn hour which made them one in the sight of the god they worshipped should have been fraught with a terror and a shuddering of which jewish lovers in free and happy england can have no knowledge alvar rodriguez was one of those high and noble spirits on whom the chain of deceit and concealment weighed heavily and there were times when it had been difficult to suppress and conceal his scorn of those outward observances which his apparent catholicism compelled when united to almah however he had a stronger incentive than his own safety and as time passed on and he became a father caution and circumspection if possible increased with the deep passionate feelings of tenderness towards the mother and child as the boy grew and flourished the first feelings of dread which the very love he excited called forth at his birth subsided into a kind of tranquil calm which even almahs foreboding spirit trusted would last as the happiness of others of her race though alvars business was carried on both at montes and at lisbon the bulk of both his own and his wifes property was by a strange chance invested at badajoz a frontier town of spain and whence he had often intended to remove it but had always been prevented it happened that early in the month of june some affairs calling him to lisbon he resolved to delay removing it no longer smiling at his young wifes half solicitation to let it remain where it was and playfully accusing her of superstition a charge she cared not to deny the night before his intended departure his young moorish secretary in other words an israelite of barbary extraction entered his private closet with a countenance of entreaty and alarm earnestly conjuring his master to give up his lisbon expedition and retire with his wife and son to badajoz or oporto or some distant city at least for a while anxiously rodriguez inquired wherefore you remember the senor leyva your worships guest a week or two ago perfectly what of him master i like him not if danger befall us it will come through him i watched him closely and every hour of his stay shrunk from him the more he was a stranger yes benighted and had lost his way it was impossible to refuse him hospitality that he stayed longer than he had need i grant but there is no cause of alarm in thathe liked his quarters master replied the moor earnestly i do not believe his tale he was no casual traveller i cannot trust him you are not called upon to do so man said alvar laughing what do you believe him to be that you would inoculate me with your own baseless alarm hassan ben ahmeds answer whatever it might be for it was whispered fearfully in his masters ear had the effect of sending every drop of blood from alvars face to his very heart but he shook off the stagnating dread he combated the prejudices of his follower as unreasonable and unfounded hassans alarm however could only be soothed by the fact that so suddenly to change his plans would but excite suspicion if leyva were what he feared his visit must already have been followed by the usual terrific effects alvar promised however to settle his affairs at lisbon as speedily as he could and return for almah and his son and convey them to some place of greater security until the imagined danger was passed in spite of his assumed indifference however rodriguez could not bid his wife and child farewell without a pang of dread which it was difficult to conceal the step between life and deathsecurity and destructionwas so small it might be passed unconsciously and then the strongest nerve might shudder at the dark abyss before him again and again he turned to go and yet again returned and it was with a feeling literally of desperation he at length tore himself away a fearful trembling was on almahs heart as she gazed after him but she would not listen to its voice it is folly she said self upbraidingly my alvar is ever chiding this too doubting heart i will not disobey him by fear and foreboding in his absence the god of the nameless is with him and me and she raised her eyes to the blue arch above her with an expression that needed not voice to mark it prayer about a week after alvars departure almah was sitting by the cradle of her boy watching his soft and rosy slumbers with a calm sweet thankfulness that such a treasure was her own the season had been unusually hot and dry but the apartment in which the young mother sat opened on a pleasant spot thickly shaded with orange lemon and almond trees and decked with a hundred other richly hued and richly scented plants in the centre of which a fountain sent up its heavy showers which fell back on the marble bed with a splash and coolness peculiarly refreshing and sparkled in the sun as glittering gems a fleet yet heavy step resounded from the garden which seemed suddenly and forcibly restrained into a less agitated movement a shadow fell between her and the sunshine and starting almah looked hastily up hassan ben ahmed stood before her a paleness on his swarthy cheek and a compression on his nether lip betraying strong emotion painfully restrained my husband hassan what news bring you of him why are you alone he laid his hand on her arm and answered in a voice which so quivered that only ears eager as her own could have distinguished his meaning lady dear dear lady you have a firm and faithful heart oh for the love of him who calls on you to suffer awake its strength and firmness my dear my honoured lady sink not fail not o god of mercy support her now he added flinging himself on his knees before her as almah one moment sprang up with a smothered shriek and the next sank back on her seat rigid as marble not another word she needed hassan thought to have prepared gradually to have told his dread intelligence but he had said enough called upon to suffer and for him her godher doom was revealed in those brief words one minute of such agonized struggle that her soul and body seemed about to part beneath it and the wife and mother roused herself to do lip cheek and brow vied in their ashen whiteness with her robe the blue veins rose distended as cords and the voicehad not hassan gazed upon her he had not known it as her own she commanded him to tell her briefly all and even while he spoke seemed revolving in her own mind the decision which not four and twenty hours after hassans intelligence she put into execution it was as ben ahmed had feared the known popularity and rumoured riches of alvar rodriguez had excited the jealousy of that secret and awful tribunal the inquisition one of whose innumerable spies under the feigned name of leyva had obtained entrance within alvars hospitable walls one unguarded word or movement the faintest semblance of secrecy or caution were all sufficient nay without these more than a common share of wealth or felicity was enough for the unconscious victims to be marked tracked and seized without preparation or suspicion of their fate alvar had chanced to mention his intended visit to lisbon and the better to conceal the agent of his arrest as also to make it more secure they waited till his arrival there watched their opportunity and seized and conveyed him to those cells whence few returned in life propagating the charge of relapsed judaism as the cause of his arrest it was a charge too common for remark and the power which interfered too mighty for resistance the confusion of the arrest soon subsided but it lasted long enough for the faithful hassan to escape and by dint of very rapid travelling he reached montes not four hours after his masters seizure the day was in consequence before them and he ceased not to conjure his lady to fly at once the officers of the inquisition could scarcely be there before nightfall you must take advantage of it hassan and all of you who love me for my child my boy she had clasped him to her bosom and a convulsion contracted her beautiful features as she spoke you must take care of him convey him to holland or england take jewels and gold sufficient andand make him love his parentshe may never see either of them more hassan hassan swear to protect my child she added with a burst of such sudden and passionate agony it seemed as if life or reason must bend beneath it bewildered by her words as terrified by her emotion ben ahmed gently removed the trembling child from the fond arms that for the first time failed to support him gave him hastily to the care of his nurse who was also a jewess said a few words in hebrew detailing what had passed beseeching her to prepare for flight and then returned to his mistress the effects of that prostrating agony remained but she had so far conquered as to seem outwardly calm and in answer to his respectful and anxious looks besought him not to fear for her nor to dissuade her from her purpose but to aid her in its accomplishment she summoned her household around her detailed what had befallen and bade them seek their own safety in flight and when in tears and grief they left her and but those of her own faith remained she solemnly committed her child to their care and informed them of her own determination to proceed directly to lisbon in vain hassan ben ahmed conjured her to give up the idea it was little short of madness how could she aid his master why not secure her own safety that if indeed he should escape the blessing of her love would be yet preserved him do not fear for your master hassan was the calm reply ask not of my plans for at this moment they seem but chaos but of this be assured we shall live or die together more she revealed not but when the officers of the inquisition arrived near nightfall they found nothing but deserted walls the magnificent furniture and splendid paintings which alone remained of course were seized by the holy office by whom alvars property was also confiscated had his arrest been deferred three months longer all would have goneswept off by the same rapacious power to whom great wealth was ever proof of great guiltbut as it was the greater part secured in spain remained untouched a circumstance peculiarly fortunate as almahs plans needed the aid of gold we have no space to linger on the mothers feelings as she parted from her boy gazing on him perhaps for the last time yet she neither wept nor sighed there was but one other feeling strong in that gentle bosoma wifes devotionand to that alone she might listen now great was old gonzalos terror and astonishment when almah attended only by hassan ben ahmed and both attired in the moorish costume entered his dwelling and implored his concealment and aid the arrest of alvar rodriguez had of course thrown every secret hebrew into the greatest alarm though none dared be evinced gonzalos only hope and consolation was that almah and her child had escaped and to see her in the very centre of danger even to listen to her calmly proposed plans seemed so like madness that he used every effort to alarm her into their relinquishment but this could not be and with the darkest forebodings the old man at length yielded to the stronger more devoted spirit with whom he had to deal his mistress once safely under gonzalos roof ben ahmed departed under cover of night in compliance with her earnest entreaties to rejoin her child and to convey him and his nurse to england that blessed land where the veil of secrecy could be removed about a week after the incarceration of alvar a young moor sought and obtained admission to the presence of juan pacheco the secretary of the inquisition as informer against alvar rodriguez he stated that he had taken service with him as clerk or secretary on condition that he would give him baptism and instruction in the holy catholic faith that alvar had not yet done so that many things in his establishment proclaimed a looseness of orthodox principles which the holy office would do well to notice meanwhile he humbly offered a purse containing seventy pieces of gold to obtain masses for his salvation this last argument carried more weight than all the rest the young moor who boldly gave his name as hassan ben ahmed which was confirmation strong of his previous statement as in leyvas information of alvar and his household the moorish secretary was particularly specified was listened to with attention and finally received in pachecos own household as junior clerk and servant to the holy office despite his extreme youthfulness and delicacy of figure face and voice hassans activity and zeal to oblige every member of the holy office superiors and inferiors gradually gained him the favour and goodwill of all there was no end to his resources for serving others and thus he had more opportunities of seeing the prisoners in a few weeks than others of the same rank as himself had had in years but the prisoner he most longed to see was still unfound and it was not till summoned before his judges in the grand hall of inquisition and of torture hassan ben ahmed gazed once more upon his former master he had attended pacheco in his situation of junior clerk but had seated himself so deeply in the shade that though every movement in both the face and form of alvar was distinguishable to him hassan himself was invisible the trial if trial such iniquitous proceedings may be called proceeded but in nought did alvar rodriguez fail in his bearing or defence marvellous and superhuman must that power have been which in such a scene and hour prevented all betrayal of the true faith the victims bore once judaism confessed the doom was death and again and again have the sons of israel remained in the terrible dungeons of the inquisitionendured every species of torture during a space of seven ten or twelve years and then been released because no proof could be brought of their being indeed that accursed thinga jew and then it was that they fled from scenes of such fearful trial to lands of toleration and freedom and there embrace openly and rejoicingly that blessed faith for which in secret they had borne so much alvar rodriguez was one of theseprepared to suffer but not reveal they applied the torture but neither word nor groan was extracted from him engrossed with the prisoner for it was his task to write down whatever disjointed words might escape his lips pacheco neither noticed not even remembered the presence of the young moor no unusual paleness could be visible on his embrowned cheek but his whole frame felt to himself to have become rigid as stone a deadly sickness had crept over him and the terrible conviction of all which rested with him to do alone prevented his sinking senseless on the earth the terrible struggle was at length at an end alvar was released for the time being and remanded to his dungeon availing himself of the liberty he enjoyed in the little notice now taken of his movements hassan reached the prison before either alvar or his guards a rapid glance told him its situation overlooking a retired part of the court cultivated as a garden the height of the wall seemed about forty feet and there were no windows of observation on either side this was fortunate the more so as hassan had before made friends with the old gardener and pretending excessive love of gardening had worked just under the window little dreaming its vicinity to him he sought a well known hebrew air with its plaintive hebrew words sung tremblingly and softly under his window first roused alvar to the sense that a friend was near he started almost in superstitious terror for the voice seemed an echo to that which was ever sounding in his heart that loved one it could not be nay he dared not even wish it but still the words were hebrew and for the first time memory flashed back a figure in moorish garb who had flitted by him on his return to his prison after his examination hassan the faithful hassan alvar felt certain it could be none but he though in the moment of sudden excitement the voice had seemed anothers he looked from the window the moor was bending over the flowers but alvar felt confirmed in his suspicions and his heart throbbed with the sudden hope of liberty he whistled and a movement in the figure below convinced him he was heard one point was gained the next was more fraught with danger yet it was accomplished in a bunch of flowers drawn up by a thin string which alvar chanced to possess ben ahmed had concealed a file and as he watched it ascend and beheld the flowers scattered to the winds in token that they had done their work for alvar dared not retain them in his prison hassan felt again the prostration of bodily power which had before assailed him for such a different cause and it was an almost convulsive effort to retain his faculties but a merciful providence watched over him and alvar making the feeblest and the weakest instruments of his all sustaining love we are not permitted space to linger on the various ingenious methods adopted by hassan ben ahmed to forward and mature his plans suffice it that all seemed to smile upon him the termination of the garden wall led by a concealed door to a subterranean passage running to the banks of the tagus this fact as also the secret spring of the trap the old gardener in a moment of unwise conviviality imparted to ben ahmed little imagining the special blessing which such unexpected information secured an alcayde and about twenty guards did sometimes patrol the garden within sight of alvars window but this did not occur often such caution seeming unnecessary it had been an evening of unwonted festivity among the soldiers and servants of the holy office which had at length subsided into the heavy slumbers of general intoxication hassan had supped with the gardener and plying him well with wine soon produced the desired effect four months had the moor spent within the dreaded walls and the moment had now come when delay need be no more at midnight all was hushed into profound silence not a leaf stirred and the night was so unusually still that the faintest sound would have been distinguished hassan stealthily crept round the outposts many of the guards were slumbering in various attitudes upon their posts and others dependent on his promised watchfulness were literally deserted he stood beneath the window one moment he clasped his hands and bowed his head in one mighty piercing though silent prayer and then dug hastily in the flower bed at his feet removing from thence a ladder of ropes which had lain there some days concealed and flung a pebble with correct aim against the bars of alvars window the sound though scarcely loud enough to disturb a bird reverberated on the trembling heart which heard as if a thousand cannons had been discharged a moment of agonized suspense and alvar rodriguez stood at the window the bar he had removed in his hand he let down the string to which hassans now trembling hands secured the ladder and drew it to the wall his descent could not have occupied two minutes at the extent but to that solitary watcher what eternity of suffering did they seem alvar was at his side had clasped his hands had called him hassan brother in tones of intense feeling but no word replied he sought to fly to point to the desired haven but his feet seemed suddenly rooted to the earth alvar threw his arm around him and drew him forwards a sudden and unnatural strength returned noiselessly and fleetly as their feet could go they sped beneath the shadow of the wall a hundred yards alone divided them from the secret door a sudden sound broke the oppressive stillness it was the tramp of heavy feet and the clash of arms the light of many torches flashed upon the darkness they darted forward in the fearful excitement of despair but the effort was void and vain a wild shout of challengeof alarmand they were surrounded captured so suddenly so rapidly alvars very senses seemed to reel but frightfully they were recalled a shriek so piercing it seemed to rend the very heavens burst through the still air the figure of the moor rushed from the detaining grasp of the soldiery regardless of bared steel and pointed guns and flung himself at the feet of alvar o god my husbandi have murdered him were the strange appalling words which burst upon his ear and the lights flashing upon his face as he sank prostrate and lifeless on the earth revealed to alvars tortured senses the features of his wife how long that dead faint continued almah knew not but when sense returned she found herself in a dark and dismal cell her upper garment and turban removed while the plentiful supply of water which had partially restored life had removed in a great degree the dye which had given her countenance its moorish hue had she wished to continue concealment one glance around her would have proved the effort vain her sex was already known and the stern dark countenances near her breathed but ruthlessness and rage some brief questions were asked relative to her name intent and faith which she answered calmly in revealing my name she said my intention must also be disclosed the wife of alvar rodriguez had not sought these realms of torture and death had not undergone all the miseries of disguise and servitude but for one hope one intentthe liberty of her husband thus proving his guilt was the rejoinder had you known him innocent you would have waited the justice of the holy office to give him freedom justice she repeated bitterly had the innocent never suffered i might have trusted but i knew accusation was synonymous with death and therefore came i here for my faith mine is my husbands and know you the doom of all who attempt or abet escape deathdeath by burning and this you have hurled upon him and yourself it is not the holy office but his wife who has condemned him and with gibing laugh they left her securing with heavy bolt and bar the iron door she darted forwards beseeching them as they hoped for mercy to take her to her husband to confine them underground a thousand fathoms deep so that they might but be together but only the hollow echo of her own voice replied and the wretched girl sunk back upon the ground relieved from present suffering by long hours of utter insensibility it was not till brought from their respective prisons to hear pronounced on them the sentence of death that alvar rodriguez and his heroic wife once more gazed upon each other they had provided almah at her own entreaty with female habiliments for in the bewildering agony of her spirit she attributed the failure of her scheme for the rescue of her husband to her having disobeyed the positive command of god and adopted a male disguise which in his eyes was abomination but which in her wild desire to save alvar she had completely overlooked and she now in consequence shrunk from the fatal garb with agony and loathing yet despite the haggard look of intense mental and bodily suffering the loss of her lovely hair which she had cut close to her head lest by the merest chance its length and luxuriance should discover her so exquisite so touching was her delicate loveliness that her very judges stern unbending as was their nature looked on her with an admiration almost softening them to mercy and now for the first time alvars manly composure seemed about to desert him he too had suffered almost as herself save that her devotedness her love appeared to give him strength to endow him with courage even to look upon her fate blended as it now was with his own with calmness in that merciful god who called him thus early to himself almah could not realize such thoughts but one image was ever present seeming to mock her very misery to madness her effort had failed had she not so wildly sought her husbands escapehad she but waitedthey might have released him and now what was she but his murderess little passed between the prisoners and their judges their guilt was all sufficiently proved by their endeavours to escape which in itself was a crime always visited by death and for these manifold sins and misdemeanours they were sentenced to be burnt alive on all saints day in the grand square of the inquisition at nine oclock in the morning and proclamation commanded to be made throughout lisbon that all who sought to witness and assist at the ceremony should receive remission of sins and be accounted worthy servants of jesus christ the lesser severity of strangling the victims before burning was denied them as they neither repented nor had trusted to the justice and clemency of the holy office but had attempted to avert a deserved fate by flight not a muscle of alvars fine countenance moved during this awful sentence he stood proudly and loftily erect regarding those that spake with an eye bright stern unflinching as their own but a change passed over it as breaking from the guard around almah flung herself on her knees at his feet alvar alvar i have murderedmy husband oh my husband say you forgiveforgive hush hush beloved mine own heroic almah fail not now he answered with a calm and tender seriousness which seeming to still that crushing agony strengthened her to bear and raising her he pressed her to his breast we have but to die as we have lived my own true to that god whose chosen and whose firstborn we are have been and shall be unto death aye and beyond it he will protect our poor orphan for he has promised the fatherless shall be his care look up my beloved and say you can face death with alvar calmly faithfully as you sought to live for him god has chosen for us a better heritage than one of earth she raised her head from his bosom the terror and the agony had passed from that sweet faceit was tranquil as his own it was not my own death i feared she said unfalteringly it was but the weakness of human love but it is over now love is mightier than death there is only love in heaven aye answered alvar and proudly and sternly he waved back the soldiers who had hurried forward to divide them men of a mistaken and bloody creed behold how the scorned and persecuted israelites can love and die while there was a hope that we could serve our god the holy and the only one better in life than in death it was our duty to preserve that life and endure torture for his sake rather than reveal the precious secret of our sainted faith and heavenly heritage but now that hope is at an end now that no human means can save us from the doom pronounced know ye have judged rightly of our creed we are those chosen children of god by you deemed blasphemous and heretic do what ye will men of blood and guile ye cannot rob us of our faith the impassioned tones of natural eloquence awed even the rude crowd around but more was not permitted rudely severed and committed to their own guards the prisoners were borne to their respective dungeons to almah those earnest words had been as the voice of an angel hushing every former pang to rest and in the solitude and darkness of the intervening hours even the thought of her child could not rob her soul of its calm or prayer of its strength the first of november dawned cloudless and lovely as it had been the last forty days never had there been a season more gorgeous in its sunny splendour more brilliant in the intense azure of its arching heaven than the present scarcely any rain had fallen for many months and the heat had at first been intolerable but within the last six weeks a freshness and coolness had infused the atmosphere and revived the earth as it was not a regular auto da f alvar and his wife being the only victims the awful ceremony of burning was to take place in the square of which the buildings of the inquisition formed one side mass had been performed before daybreak in the chapel of the inquisition at which the victims were compelled to be present and about half past seven the dread procession left the inquisition gates the soldiers and minor servitors marched first forming a hollow square in the centre of which were the stakes and huge faggots piled around then came the sacred cross covered with a black veil and its body guard of priests the victims each surrounded by monks appeared next closely followed by the higher officers and inquisitors and a band of fifty men in rich dresses of black satin and silver closed the procession we have no space to linger on the ceremonies always attendant on the burning of inquisitorial prisoners although from the more private nature of the rites these ceremonies were greatly curtailed it was rather more than half an hour after nine when the victims were bound to their respective stakes and the executioners approached with their blazing brands there was no change in the countenance of either prisoner pale they were yet calm and firm all of human feeling had been merged in the martyrs courage and the martyrs faith one look had been exchanged between themof love spiritualized to look beyond the graveof encouragement to endure for their god even to the end the sky was still cloudless the sun still looked down on that scene of horror and then was a husha pausefor so it felt in nature that stilled the very breathing of those around illustration hear o israel the lord our god the lord is onethe sole and holy one there is no unity like his unity were the words which broke that awful pause in a voice distinct unfaltering and musical as its wont and it was echoed by the sweet tones from womans lips so thrilling in their melody the rudest nature started it was the signal of their fate the executioners hastened forward the brands were applied to the turf of the piles the flames burst up beneath their handwhen at that moment there came a shock as if the very earth were cloven asunder the heavens rent in twain a crash so loud so fearful so appalling as if the whole of lisbon had been shivered to its foundations and a shriek or rather thousands and thousands of human voices blended in one wild piercing cry of agony and terror seeming to burst from every quarter at the self same instant and fraught with universal woe the buildings around shook as impelled by a mighty whirlwind though no sound of such was heard the earth heaved yawned closed and rocked again as the billows of the ocean were lashed to fury it was a moment of untold horror the crowd assembled to witness the martyrs death fled wildly shrieking on every side scattered to the heaving ground the blazing piles lay powerless to injure their bonds were shivered their guards were fled one bound brought alvar to his wife and he clasped her in his arms god god of mercy save us yet again be with us to the end he exclaimed and faith winged the prayer on on he sped up up in direction of the heights where he knew comparative safety lay but ere he reached them the innumerable sights and sounds of horror that yawned upon his way every street and square and avenue was choked with shattered ruins rent from top to bottom houses convents and churches presented the most fearful aspect of ruin while every second minute a new impetus seemed to be given to the convulsed earth causing those that remained still perfect to rock and rend huge stones falling from every crack were crushing the miserable fugitives as they rushed on seeking safety they knew not where the rafters of every roof wrenched from their fastenings stood upright a brief while and then fell in hundreds together with a crash perfectly appalling the very ties of nature were severed in the wild search for safety individual life alone appeared worth preserving none dared seek the fate of friendsnone dared ask who lives in that one scene of universal death on on sped alvar and his precious burden on over the piles of ruins on unhurt amidst the shower of stones which hurled in the air as easily as a ball cast from an infants hand fell back again laden with a hundred deaths on amid the rocking and yawning earth beholding thousands swallowed up crushed and maimed worse than death itself for they were left to a lingering tortureto die a thousand deaths in anticipating one on over the disfigured heaps of dead and the unrecognised masses of what had once been magnificent and gorgeous buildings his eye was well nigh blinded with the shaking and tottering movement of all things animate and inanimate before him and his path obscured by the sudden and awful darkness which had changed that bright glowing blue of the sunny sky into a pall of dense and terrible blackness becoming thicker and denser with every succeeding minute till a darkness which might be felt enveloped that devoted city as with the grim shadow of death his ear was deafened by the appalling sounds of human agony and natures wrath for now sounds as of a hundred water spouts the dull continued roar of subterranean thunder becoming at times loud as the discharge of a thousand cannons at others resembling the sharp grating sound of hundreds and hundreds of chariots driven full speed over the stones and this mingled with the piercing shrieks of women the hoarser cries and shouts of men the deep terrible groans of mental agony and the shriller screams of instantaneous death had usurped the place of the previous awful stillness till every sense of those who yet survived seemed distorted and maddened and nature herself convulsed and freed from restraining bonds appeared about to return to that chaos whence she had leaped at the word of god still still alvar rushed forwards preserved amidst it all as if the arm of a merciful providence was indeed around him and his almah marking them for life in the very midst of death making his rapid way across the ruins of st pauls which magnificent church had fallen in the first shock crushing the vast congregation assembled within its walls alvar paused one moment undecided whether to seek the banks of the river or still to make for the western heights there was a moments hush and pause in the convulsion of nature but alvar dared not hope for its continuance ever and anon the earth still heaved and houses opened from base to roof and closed without further damage with a brief fervid cry for continued guidance and protection scarcely conscious which way in reality he took and still holding almah to his bosomso supernaturally strengthened that the weakness of humanity seemed far from him rodriguez hurried on taking the most open path to the estrella hill an open space was gained half way to the summit commanding a view of the banks of the river and the ruins around panting almost breathless yet still struggling with his own exhaustion to encourage almah alvar an instant rested ere he plunged anew into the narrower streets a shock violent destructive convulsive as the first flung them prostrate while the renewed and increased sounds of wailing the tremendous and repeated crashes on every side the disappearance of the towers steeples and turrets which yet remained revealed the further destructiveness which had befallen a new and terrible cry added to the universal horror the sea the sea alvar sprung to his feet and clasped in each others arms he and almah gazed beneath not a breath of wind stirred yet the river which being at that point four miles wide appeared like the element they had termed it tossed and heaved as impelled by a mighty stormand on it came roaring foaming tumbling as if every bound were loosed on over the land to the very heart of the devoted city sweeping off hundreds in its course and retiring with such velocity and so far beyond its natural banks that vessels were left dry which had five minutes before ridden in water seven fathoms deep again and again this phenomenon took place the vessels in the river at the same instant whirled round and round with frightful rapidity and smaller boats dashed upwards falling back to disappear beneath the booming waters as if chained to the spot where they stood fascinated by this very horror alvar and his wife yet gazed their glance fixed on the new marble quay where thousands and thousands of the fugitives had congregated fixed as if unconsciously foreboding what was to befall again the tide rushed inon on over the massive ruins heaving raging swelling as a living thing and at the same instant the quay and its vast burthen of humanity sunk within an abyss of boiling waters into which the innumerable boats around were alike impelled leaving not a trace even when the angry waters returned to their channel suddenly as they had left it to mark what had been twas the voice of god impelled me hither rather than pausing beside those fatal banks almah my best beloved bear up yet a brief while morehe will spare and save us as he hath done now merciful providence behold another wrathful element threatens to swallow up all of life and property which yet remains great god this is terrible and terrible it was from three several parts of the ruined city huge fires suddenly blazed up hissing crackling ascending as clear columns of liquid flame up against the pitchy darkness infusing it with tenfold horrorspreading on every sideconsuming all of wood and wall which the earth and water had left unscathed wreathing its serpent like folds in and out the ruins forming strange and terribly beautiful shapes of glowing colouring fascinating the eye with admiration yet bidding the blood chill and the flesh creep fresh cries and shouts had marked its rise and progress but aghast and stupefied those who yet survived made no effort to check its way and on every side it spread forming lanes and squares of glowing red flinging its lurid glare so vividly around that even those on the distant heights could see to read by it and fearful was the scene that awful light revealed now for the first time could alvar trace the full extent of destruction which had befallen that glorious city which a few brief hours previous lay reposing in its gorgeous sunlightmighty in its palaces and towersin its churches convents theatres magazines and dwellingsrich in its numberless artizans and storeslay perished and prostrate as the grim spectre of long ages past save that the fearful groups yet passing to and fro or huddled in kneeling and standing masses some bathed in the red glare of the increasing fires others black and shapelesssave when a sudden flame flashed on them disclosing what they wererevealed a strange and horrible present yet lingering amid what seemed the shadows of a fearful past nor was the convulsion of nature yet at an endthe earth still rocked and heaved at intervals often impelling the hissing flames more strongly and devouringly forward and by tossing the masses of burning ruin to and fro gave them the semblance of a sea of flame the ocean itself too yet rose and sunk and rose again vessels were torn from their cables anchors wrenched from their soundings and hurled in the airwhile the warring waters the muttering thunders the crackling flames formed a combination of sounds which even without their dread adjuncts of human agony and terror were all sufficient to freeze the very life blood and banish every sense and feeling save that of stupefying dread but human love and superhuman faith saved from the stagnating horror the conviction that the god of his fathers was present with him and would save him and almah to the end never left him for an instant but urged him to exertions which had he not had this all supporting faith he would himself have deemed impossible and his faith spake truth the god of infinite mercy who had stretched out his own right hand to save and marked the impotence of the wrath and cruelty of man was with him still and despite of the horrors yet lingering round them despite of the varied trials fatigues and privations attendant on their rapid flight led them to life and joy and bade them stand forth the witnesses and proclaimers of his unfailing love his everlasting providence with the great earthquake of lisbon the commencement of which our preceding pages have faintly endeavoured to portray and its terrible effects on four millions of square miles our tale has no further connection the third day brought our poor fugitives to badajoz where alvars property had been secured they tarried there only long enough to learn the blessed tidings of hassan ben ahmeds safe arrival in england with their child that his faithfulness in conjunction with that of their agent in spain had already safely transmitted the bulk of their property to the english funds and to obtain ben ahmeds address forward tidings of their providential escape to him and proceed on their journey an anxious but not a prolonged interval enabled them to accomplish it safely and once more did the doubly rescued press their precious boy to their yearning hearts and feel that conjugal and parental love burned if it could be the dearer brighter more unspeakably precious from the dangers they had passed and not human love alone the veil of secrecy was removed they were in a land whose merciful and liberal government granted to the exile and the wanderer a home of peace and rest where they might worship the god of israel according to the law he gave and in hearts like those of alvar and his almah prosperity could have no power to extinguish or deaden the religion of love and faith which adversity had engendered the appearance of old gonzalos and his family in england a short time after alvars arrival there removed their last remaining anxiety and gave them increased cause for thankfulness not a member of the merchants family and more wonderful still not a portion of his property had been lost amid the universal ruin and to this very day his descendants recall his providential preservation by giving on every returning anniversary of that awful day certain articles of clothing to a limited number of male and female poor red rose villa and its inhabitants a sketch on the outskirts of a certain country town which for euphony we will call briarstone from its being situated in one of the most picturesque but least known parts of old england and almost imbedded in hills and lanes where the wood or briar rose grew redundantly was a certain castellated looking mansion glowing with red bricks and bright blue slates storied with large paned windows framed with such fresh green that it would seem as if the painters brush could never have been absent above a month together the entrance door of most aristocratic dimensions was of bright glazed yellow never sullied by dust or dimness below the portentous looking circular knocker briarstone was yet in happy ignorance of the un aristocracy of knockers was a large brass plate glittering in the sunshine like burning gold and bearing thereon in large and dignified letters as if the name was of such importance in itself that it required no engravers ornament the monosyllablesportentous in their very brevitymiss brown the gravel walk which led up to the imposing flight of steps white as the most scrupulous care could make them that the yellow door surmounted was kept so particularly neat that the very birds feared to alight upon it lest they should be swept off for some intrusive leaf or twig quicker even than their voluntary flight it was impossible to look upon the exterior of the mansion without being impressed with a grand idea of its as yet invisible interior standing as red rose villa did in a spacious garden full ten minutes walk out of the town it was marvellous how the daily events of this said town became known within its walls as if a train had been laida sort of electrical conductorto the interior of every dwelling which conveyed back to its starting place all the information required however invisible the means of communication the effects were certain for miss brown knew everything even before the persons affected knew it themselves now miss brown though her dignified name appeared on the brass plate solus was not the sole inmate of this stately mansion by any means she was in fact one of a multitude for there were times when the capacious walls of red rose villa enshrined no fewer than fifty living souls the truth must out on our paper though miss brown would have been shocked almost to annihilation had any one suggested the propriety of permitting it to speak on her cherished brass platemiss brown kept a first rate finishing academy for young ladies of the first families and a boarding house for all who needed kind friends cheerful lodgings and comfortable board then she had an english and a french and an italian and of course a german teacherall exemplary young women masters were rarely admitted it being a gross impropriety in miss browns educational code to accustom young ladies to male tuition one indeed there was a mr gilbert givevoice but then miss brown and his lamented mother had been such friends that at one time they had thought of becoming another miss ponsonby and lady eleanor butler and causing a sensation by retiring to live on friendship but unfortunately before this could be carried into effect a mr givevoice appeared and miss brown was left to mourn the inconsistency of those professions which had declared friendship all sufficient for life the offence was not forgiven for many years but when mrs givevoice was left a widow miss brown generously relented and gilbert showing some musical talent magnified by the briarstonians into marvellous genius he was gradually installed as music master general and aid extraordinary in all the concerns of red rose villa besides five and twenty pupils a dozen boarders four teachers and half a dozen servants miss brown was blessed with two brothers and two sisters to all of whom she had performed most inimitably a mothers part many marvelled that such grown men as mr gustavus and mr adolphus brown should so contentedly succumb to female domination and not seek homes for themselves but petticoat government was so supreme in red rose villa that even the hint of such a thing would have been far too great a stretch of masculine audacity and in fact they were very well contented where they were mr adolphus was a bankers clerk and was only known at home as going to sleep upon the sofa mr gustavus had been according to his own account at one time a land surveyor at another an architect and then an engraver but he was he declared one of the unlucky ones and so quietly sunk down in his sisters establishment as merely a domestic man who could set his hand to anything he taught writing and arithmetic and oriental tinting and lead tinting and a variety of finishing accomplishments and copied music and invented patterns for all the young lady boarders who were worth something more than smiles mr adolphus was always asleep mr gustavus never seemed to sleep at all thin as a lath he was here there and everywhere busying himself in everybodys concerns but never succeeding in forwarding his own miss brown portly and majestic in carriage as of imperturbable gravity in look possessed a fund of high sounding choice worded conversational powersthat is to say her speech once entered upon flowed on in such a continuous gently murmuring stream that to break or interrupt it by a rejoinder was utterly impossible the voice was as imperturbable and unvarying as the face she was wondrously learned schooled in the lore of the ancient and wise in the ways of the modern world no scheme could be set afloat at briarstone unless miss brown had been consulted no shop was the fashion unless miss brown had patronised no case of distress worth relieving unless forwarded by miss brown and in sober truth miss brown was benevolentwas generousdid the kindest deeds imaginable but as she never left her pinnacle of ice to look into human hearts lest their warmth should thaw hers she received neither the regard nor esteem which her sterling qualities in reality merited miss wilhelmina brown was her antipodesall sweetnessall graciousnessall fascination miss brown was learned and not accomplished miss wilhelmina accomplished and not learned miss brown was all sobriety miss wilhelmina all smiles at thirty she learnt the harp at five and thirty the guitar at forty she discovered she had a voice and could sing inimitablyall the briarstone soires said so and of course it must be true whole scenes from the french tragediansstanzas from dantelong lines from schillermiss wilhelmina would recite with such pathos such expression there was no occasion to understand the languages to enter into such charming recitations english poetry was not ventured upon byron and moore were charming certainly but then her sisters responsible positionshe dared not admit them upon the drawing room tables of red rose villashe could only indulge herself strictly in private miss angelica the youngest of the family by some years was different to either sister nature had not been very bountiful in the powers of the brain but in their stead had endowed her with powers of housewifery in no common degree she managed all the domestic concerns of this human noahs ark as no one else could from morning till night she was moving so overlooking every department that at the farthest sound of her footsteps none of the lightest for miss angelica was as short and stout as miss wilhelmina was tall and languidly slim every brush and broom seemed endowed with double velocity jingle jingle went a huge bunch of keyspat pat her substantial feet from kitchen to atticscullery to roof even if she sat down her fingers continued the same perpetual motion in the creation of sundry caps bonnets head dressesall the paraphernalia of female elegancies no one dressed so becomingly as the misses brown and miss angelica was considered the originator and inventor of fashions which all briarstone followed the pupils were like most misses in their teens originality of character always succumbed to system in red rose villa miss browns was a finishing academy for manners as well as morals and so in the weekly soires of her mansion the young ladies by alternate eights appeared in the drawing room dressed very becomingly to sit down and smile and answer in monosyllables to play their last specimen of herz or thalberg or sing their last bravura or make one in a quadrille but in all they did to bear witness to the admirable code of tuition and government carried out in red rose villa the boarders presented a variety of characters but as our sketch only extends over one evening we can merely mention them generally officers widows on half pay who by a residence in miss browns establishment combined first rate education for their daughters and society for themselves ancient spinsters who had not given up the idea of becoming middle aged matrons well knowing that miss browns philanthropic disposition gave them opportunities for the cultivation of the tender passion when any one else would have imagined the time for such juvenilities was over in the fortnightly soires one two or three pairs of lovers were always found among miss browns guestsunfortunates whose interminable engagements from pecuniary difficulties or the stern dissent of cruel guardians would have seemed hopeless to all but for the energetic encouragement of the benevolent miss brown who always acted on the idea passion i see is catching and still more urgent reason never did a wedding party issue from the well glazed portals of red rose villa and such events did really occur but an accession of pupils and boarders immediately followed amongst the boarders were two young ladies sisters children and both orphans but the similitude went no further isabel morland the eldest by two years was a sparkling brunettesatiricalclever eccentric in habits uneven in temper and capricious as the wind but what did all this signify she was an heiress and reckoning according to the estimation of briarstone a rich one she had been a pupil and her love of display and coquetry and determination to get a husband had occasioned her resolve to remain with a family whom in heart she detested rather than reside with the only relations she possessed old respectable folks in the country she had sense enough to know that her fortune inexhaustible as it seemed in briarstone would not endow her with the smallest consequence elsewhere and though so highly gifted by nature as had she selected the society of superior minds to have become both estimable and happy yet her love of powerof feeling herself superior to any one with whom she associatedmade her voluntarily become a member of a family whom she lost no opportunity of turning into objects of satire and abuse receiving the marked attentions of mr gustavus brown so graciously when no better offered as to give him every hope of ultimate success but cold distant and disdainful at the remotest chance of achieving a more desirable conquest very different was laura gascoigne unusually retiring in manner the peculiar charm hovering around her could better be felt than described possessing neither the wit nor the cleverness or as coleridge so happily expresses it the brain in the hand which characterised her cousin she had judgment feeling thoughtthe rare power of concentration which enabled her to succeed in all she attemptedthe quiet persevering energy which leads to completion even in the simplest trifles and prevents all mere superficial acquirement perhaps early sorrow had deepened natural characteristics from the time her mother became widowed no pen can describe the devotedness which was the tie between them the failing health of mrs gascoigne had during the last year of her life compelled a residence in the south of england and when in the neighbourhood of briarstone the real kindness to the mother and daughter received from the misses brown induced laura after mrs gascoignes death to make their house her home till she could decide on her future plans she was indeed lonely upon earth and the straitened means which had urged her to teach many hours in the day to supply her mother with luxuries and comforts by stamping them as poor prevented her being known in those circles where her gentle virtues would have gained her real appreciating friends all that she had sacrificed in her filial devotion even her mother never knew though that mighty sacrifice had been made full two years before her death an invalid whose life might pass from night till morning with none on earth to love and tend her but her child laura could not leave her and when she had said this her lover in all the jealous irritation of an angry passionate nature reproached her that she did not could not love him else every other consideration would be waivedthat the reports of her affections having been transferred to another were true and therefore it was better they should part she had meekly left him to resume her sad duties by her mothers side and they had never met again she knew he had been on the eve of leaving england for an honourable appointment in the west indies to which he had been nominated but the wish would rise that he would write he could not continue in anger towards her time must show the purity the justice of her motive in her refusal at such a moment to leave england and gladly would she have remained in one spot hoping believing on but her mother needed constant change and they had gone from place to place that perhaps even if he had written no letter could have reached her three years had passed and if the hope to prove her truth still lingered the expectation had indeed long gone and so lauras early youth had passed with not one flower cast upon it save those her own sweet disposition gave miss browns establishment was not indeed a congenial home but she had her own room her own pursuits and though often yearninghow intenselyfor sympathy and intellectual companionship could be thankful and contented she could not love the miss browns but she respected their sterling qualities and regretted their eccentricities and so found some good point to dilate on when others quizzed and laughed at them that her presence always checked ill nature what is the cause of all this unusual confusion and excitement isabel inquired laura one morning entering her cousins apartment do enlighten me you always know everything as thoroughly as miss brown herself and you always know nothing my most rustic cousin fortunate for you you have so superior a person as myself to come to there is to be a grand assembly in the lower regions to night and so of course sweet wilhelmina is practising and tuning enough to terrify away all harmony and angelica is buried in all the mysteries of supper craft dont look unbelieving it is true and it is wednesday not saturday isabel granted laura but such a grand event as receiving a baronet and his sister demands everything uncommon even to a change of night it would be doing him no honour to receive him on a usual soire night learned lucretia is deep in the last novel and this months most fashionable magazine folks report that sir sydney harcourt likes literary conversation i mean to try if isabel morland will not have more effect in captivating than the three graces lucretia wilhelmina and angelica altogether backed by their whole corps of spinsters and schoolgirls what has seized you laura that you do not scold me as usual for my self conceit do you begin to feel it is breath wasted my dear you shall see me in perfection to night sir sydney shall not depart heart whole from briarstone though he does look as if nobody within it could be worth speaking to isabel was standing before a large mirror much too engrossed in admiring her own face and studying various attitudes and the best mode of arranging her glossy black hair to notice how strangely and fitfully lauras colour varied and the voice in which she said sir sydney harcourt is he a new resident at briarstone was not sufficiently agitated to cause remark save to a much quicker perception than isabels yes within the last few days such a sensation has his arrival made you must have heard of it even in your sanctum my dear isabel have i not been staying out the last fortnight and only returned last night oh by the bye so you have how much you must have missed me i did the first few days but my good child how could i think of anything but the new lion splendid as he is too he is only here for a month will you dare me to the field laura to make that month two or six or something more into the bargain no isabel you need no daring only remember your own peace may be endangered too my peace my dear foolish child i shall see sir sydney at my feet long before any such catastrophe lady harcourt how well it sounds and mr brown isabel the wretch we have quarrelled irretrievably and when i left you were giving him every encouragement you could nonsense laura you are always preaching of my giving encouragement the poor wretch would die in despair if i did not relent sometimes better as i have always told you put an end to his attentions at once i am certain he would cease to persecute if you did not encourage him as you know you do i know i do poor dear gussyhe is very well when i can get no one else but indeed isabel you are very wrong your manner to him is the talk of every one i do not care for what every one thinks as i have told you hundreds of times i will just pursue my own inclination whether the world approve of it or not what is the world to me you cannot possibly imagine i mean ever to become mrs brown why the very name is enough to make me drown myself first no i am free to receive all sir sydneys attentions which i fully mean to win you know i have some power laura to attract but not to keep isabel laura if you were not a thorough simpleton i should say you had designs on sir sydney yourself come will you run a tilt with me for him i will be generous and keep back some of my fascinations that we may try as equals if you will thank you for the proposal but it would hardly be fair you will burst upon sir sydney in the freshness and brilliancy of novelty in addition to all your other attractions i have not even novelty to befriend me for i rather think i have met him before sir sydney harcourt how sly of you not to tell me all this time whenhowwhere how could i tell you before isabel when you have scarcely given me breathing space but do you know anything of his former life report says he was jilted by a poor insignificant girl and has been a professed woman hater ever since i do believe there he is in his curricle what a splendid set outdo look laura stayi shall see him better in the next room and to the next room she flew so engrossed with sir sydneys splendid driving that she did not perceive that laura had not accepted the invitation but had quietly retired to her own room miss gascoigne i trust you will join us to night i expect the honour of sir sydney harcourts and his accomplished sisters company your manners and appearance are so completely comme il faut that they will no doubt be glad to meet you i do not approve of young ladies hunting after gaiety and dissipation but it is a great advantage to mix in such society as i can offer you to night i shall expect to see you of course and without waiting for a replyfor such a thing as dissent to miss browns commands was not to be thought ofmiss brown or learned lucretia in isabel morlands phraseology majestically floated onwards laura my sweet laura play over the accompaniment to this luscious ah te o cara mr givevoice will be here to night so i shall not want you but now if you will assist me you will do me such a favour the music is so mellifluous it will quite repay you for the trouble and laura complied regretting most sincerely that a person possessing such real sense and goodness as miss wilhelmina should so expose herself to ridicule but feeling that young as she was it was more her duty to bear with folly than reprove it laura dear put the finishing bows to lucretias cap for me theres a love i have such innumerable things to see after and get done before seven oclock to night that i have no time to breathe you are always busy my dear miss angelica i wish you would make me of use i shall finish this in ten minutes so you had better give me something else to do you are the best girl in the world laura my dear but you cant assist me in household concerns no one can they worry me to deathbut i dont grow thin upon them thats one comfort come i am glad you are smiling laura my dear what a pity you are not more merry by the bye you may help me very muchi shall never get through the tea making all by myself let me take it off your hands entirely i will with pleasure thank youthank you my dear but nothing would go right if i were not there too depend upon it if there is not molly only going now to dust the roomsthe lazy huzzy and off trotted miss angelica to scold and dust by turns the evening at length arrived confusion and noise and sundry domestic jars had subsided into silence and solemnity actually portentous the pupils with the exception of six most highly favoured had been dismissed to their dormitories and the schoolroom fitted up for the supper which under miss angelicas auspices in the culinary department miss wilhelminas in the elegant arrangement of fruit and flowers and miss lucretias in the selection of sweets and solids least hurtful to the gastronomic and digestive powers was to be unequalled in the front drawing room the misses and messrs brown and their train of boarders sat in imposing state the covers had all been removed from the couches chairs lounges ottomans etc displaying a variety of embroidery by the fair fingers of miss wilhelmina and the splendid designs of mr gustavus the harp was uncovered the guitar with its broad blue ribbon laid carelessly on the grand piano forte which was open and at his post on the music stool sat mr gilbert givevoice fair and famous smiling very sweetly on his tall pupil miss wilhelmina who was in earnest conversation by his side miss brown was on the sofa looking wiser and grander than ever a vacant place was left beside her which no one thought of taking for that it was designed for miss harcourt being as well known as if the name had been chalked up on the wall behind presently all the presentable inhabitants of briarstone flocked in attired in their very best and satisfying miss brown as to the imposing appearance of her saloon the back drawing room somewhat less brilliantly lighted was occupied as usual by three or four sets of lovers the blue room opened from it and laura was there ensconced as miss angelicas aid extraordinary the door being thrown open permitted a full view of the two drawing rooms and all their proceedings though from the blue room occupying a sort of angular corner its inmates could not even be observed isabel morland looking actually dazzling from her becoming dress and indescribable tournure had chosen to settle down into a regular flirtation with a mr manby a young man she sometimes deigned to notice at others deemed too little even to be visible mr gustavus looked black as a thunder cloud his thin form moving in and out the circle but always hovering nearest isabel who took no more notice of him than of his vacant chair at length the magic words sir sydney and miss harcourt were pronounced and the door flung back as if its very hinges should suffer martyrdom to do them honour and the whole roomful rose as by one movement except isabel who carelessly remained seated then came sundry flourishes and introductions and mutual bows and curtseys till miss harcourt fairly sank down on her seat of honour casting a rueful glance at her brother who returned it with one so irresistibly comic that isabel to whom alone the look was visible was compelled to smile too sir sydney whose eye was wandering round the room caught the look eagerly bowed recognition and in another minute was at her side leaving mr gustavus with half his tale untold that sir sydney was handsome and had all the ease and elegance of a polished gentleman there could not be two opinions about but there was something more about him no one could exactly define what he was too well bred to be haughty or repulsive when he had quite willingly accepted miss browns invitation yet he certainly did not seem in his element he did smile and talk well but miss wilhelmina whispered to an intimate friend to observe how very melancholy his countenance was when at rest she was certain he was not a happy man and what could be the reason miss harcourt was pronounced after a trial of ten minutes a most charming accomplished elegant girl she was in reality merely an unaffected genteel quiet little personage without any pretension whatever and somewhat past what she deemed girlhood the evening proceeded most harmoniously tea was accomplished elegantly under miss angelicas active surveillance she was in the blue room back and front drawing rooms so quickly one after the other that she seemed gifted with ubiquity for the evening then miss brown proposed music and dancing she thought they were such delectable adjuncts to young peoples amusementsuch social pleasure etc to all of which miss harcourt gracefully assented she would be happy to perform her part her brother seldom danced a general lamentation followed what a loss to the dancers perhaps he would prefer music they could offer him some very passable and a concert commenced in appearance very naturally given but in reality performed in exact accordance with well cogitated arrangements beforehand whether sir sydney benefited by the succession of sweet sounds or not remained a problem as isabel to miss brown and mr gustavuss excessive annoyance kept him so exclusively her attendant that it required all his acquaintance with worldy tact to save him from rudeness to his hostesses at the same time that he fully encouraged his companion the only thought isabel could spare from sir sydney was for laura to witness her triumph but laura was nowhere to be seen if isabel could have known that her cousin saw her and sir sydney too and the sickness of heart that vision gave she might have triumphed more dancing was at length accomplished and sir sydney actually joined in it dancing two quadrilles successively with isabel and then remaining standing with her leaning against the piano in such apparent earnest conversation as allowed attention to nothing else mr manby and several other beaux of briarstone whom isabel never disdained at the public balls when none superior were to be had came in humble adoration entreating the honour of her hand the toss of the head and curl of the lip with which they were refused elicited an expression in sir sydneys eye and very handsome mouth which must have startled isabel had she not been too engrossed with her own apparent conquest to perceive it sydney you are wrong whispered miss harcourt as isabel for an instant disappeared to find a musical album on which she very much prided herself mary i am right was the reply if young ladies choose to play the coquette it is but fair in us to pay them back in their own coin how ungracious i should be to let all these graceful arts be wasted miss harcourt still looked disapproval but further rejoinder was impossible for isabel flushed with conquest had returned more animated and engrossing than before of course you sing miss morland no sir sydney i abhor all pretension and as i knew i could never sing like a professor i never attempted it pardon me but i think you are wrong there can be no necessity for private performers to equal professors indeed i would banish all italian bravuras from private rooms you will think my brother a sad goth miss morland but he prefers a simple english ballad to anything else i admire his taste but you surely do not think ballad singing an easily accomplished matter easy enough for any one with natural feeling replied sir sydney somewhat hastily and with boldness sufficient to express it i would rather hear go forget me as i have heard it than the finest italian scena by a prima donna i am delighted sir sydney that we have it in our power to afford you that gratification energetically interposed miss wilhelmina the baronet made her a graceful bow looking at his sister however with eyes that plainly said save me from this laura sir sydney actually started but recovered himself so rapidly that the sudden flushing of his brow was unremarked even by isabel dear me where can the dear girl have hid herself i assure you sir sydney though she sings very seldom she is considered first rate in english ballads and away gracefully glided miss wilhelmina in search of her who is this dear girl miss morland can she really sing that song i would rather she chose any other said sir sydney in a tone almost of irritation isabel looked up with one of her most mischievous smiles which recalled him instantly to his artificial self but before he could rally sufficiently to speak again miss wilhelminas voice in its most dulcet tones of encouragement was close beside him come laura my dear we are all friends you knowno one to be afraid of sir sydney is so particularly partial to go forget me i am sure you will favour him or any other song the young lady likes i would not be so arbitrary as to select for her he exclaimed springing up with gentlemanly politeness to relieve miss wilhelmina of the music book she carried and as he took it from her coming in close contact with the fair girl behind her whom her flowing drapery had till then completely concealed laura miss gascoigne is it possible he articulated in a tone which though suppressed must to any perception less obtuse than the misses browns have betrayed intense emotion but miss wilhelmina only read casual acquaintanceship and supposed an introduction had taken place in the early part of the evening laura bowed sir sydney thought coldly and quietly passed on to the piano the song was selected and sung she had often been heard before but her voice had never seemed the same as at that moment it might have been that what a baronet and his sister listened to with such interest that the former had moved himself some distance from miss morlands fascinations to look at and listen to the singer unobserved must be of greater value than it had ever before been supposed or that there really was some spell in the song which laura had never been heard to sing before miss wilhelmina seeing it amongst her music had spoken on supposition merely but it fell upon the most thoughtless the most obtuse with such unaccountable power that even when the strain ceased the sudden and unusual hush continued until rudely broken by mr gustavus brown and mr gilbert givevoice clapping their hands most vehemently exciting an uproar of applause under which laura tried to make her escape but she was prevented by the friendly advance of miss harcourt who with both hands extended exclaimed so as to be heard by all miss gascoigne will you permit me to thank you for your beautiful song and claim your acquaintance in the same breath we have in truth never met before but if you knew me as well as i know you from report we should be friendsnay more alliesalready you need not look so very terrified she added with laughing earnestness i am not a very formidable person though my want of ceremony may really be rather startling but i am so glad to have found you that i must entreat miss browns kind permission to excuse me if i do forget everybody but you for a little while her ready tact met with the rejoinder she desired she was entreated by all the sisters to make herself quite at home they were delighted she should know their dear laura the blue room was quite deserted and they could chat there quite comfortably and to the blue room miss harcourt eagerly led her companion who so trembled that she feared for the continuance of her composure the door was not closed to do so would have occasioned remark but as we said before the room was so situated for its inmates to be completely retired from all observation isabel morland was furious she had seen sir sydneys suppressed emotion and with the quickness of thought connected that and miss harcourts eager address with the floating rumours of sir sydneys early life but that her insignificant unfashionable cousin could be the heroine of the tale and retain such hold of his recollection as to drive all her present fascinations from his mind was a degradation not to be passively endured in fact it was impossibleshe would not think about itsir sydney should be caught yet but at present there certainly was little hope of it he had deserted her and was in earnest if not agitated conversation with miss lucretia and miss wilhelmina brown who were listening and answering and then gradually entering into detail with so much interest that all superficial folly gave way for the time before the real goodness of heart which they in general so strenuously contrived to conceal disagreeable designing old women isabel thought what can he see in them to hold his attention so chained he shall not listen any longer and she glided close to the sofa where the two were seated sir sydney rose and offered her his seat no she would rather stand sir sydney bowed and quietly sat down again something seemed the matter with isabels bracelet she clasped and unclasped it vehemently but the movement did not disturb the earnest conversation which sir sydney in a low voice still continued the trinket broke and fell at his feet he gracefully raised and presented it regretting the accident and turned again to the misses brown an exclamation of what could have become of her beautiful bouquet was the young ladys next effort to recall the deserter to his allegiance but sir sydney did not even seem to hear it or if he did before he could make a move to seek it it was presented to her by the officious gussy with a most malicious bow isabel did not quite throw it at his head as inclination prompted but in a very few seconds every flower lay in fragments at her feet one beautiful exotic fell uninjured so close to miss wilhelmina that she raised it with an expression of lamentation but isabel snatched it from her and hastily stamped her pretty little foot upon it with such a very unequivocal expression of temper that sir sydney almost unconsciously fixed an astonished gaze upon her it was too much to be borne quietly she turned angrily away sauntering through the rooms deigning to hold converse with none and would have so far sacrificed all propriety as to enter the blue room to solve the mystery at once had not laura and miss harcourt at that instant reappeared the countenance of the latter bore such evident traces of emotion spite of the strong control she was practising that isabel was on the point of making some bitterly satirical remark but those dark reproving eyes were again upon her and sir sydney spoke before she did but it was to laura not to her has my sister pleaded in vain or may i indeed claim an old friendand forgiveness he added speaking the last word in so low a tone as only to be heard by his sister laura and isabel lauras lip so quivered that no word would come but her hand was unhesitatingly placed in that which sir sydney so eagerly extended and her eyes met his he drew her arm in his and led her to all appearance so easily and naturally to a quadrille that was forming that few suspected more than that they had been old friends and how strange it was they should meet there and then and if he should talk to her and make her sing twice again during the short remainder of the evening it was nothing remarkable isabel had thrown herself moodily on one of the sofas in the blue room half concealed by the curtains of the window trying in vain to connect sir sydneys conduct and the report of his former life it seemed clear enough but she would not believe it there was nothing in his manner but old acquaintanceship she would conquer him yet how could laura vie with her alas for the delusion miss harcourts shawl by the provident care of miss angelica had been brought to the blue room and there with laura she repaired the misses brown in trio assembled to do them great honour and isabel remained wholly unperceived after being well shawled miss harcourt disappeared with her body guard of browns sir sydney who had come ostensibly to hurry her lingered laura my own beloved forgivenloved through all how could i doubthow could i make myself and you so miserable can i ever repay you even by a long life of love if you but knew the remorse the wretchedness i have endured you would forgive still more were the somewhat incoherent sentences that fell distinctly on isabels ear and though there was no answer no words she could see sir sydneys arm thrown round her cousin and that she shrunk not from his parting kiss another moment and both had disappeared sir sydney to take such farewell of the really worthy women who had befriended his laura that he left them in perfect raptures and laura to fly to the security of her own room where burying her face in her hands the tears burst forth like a torrent giving relief vent calm to a heart which though so sustained in grief had been so unused to joy that its presence had well nigh prevented its realization our readers must imagine all the various crosses and vexatious contretemps which had prevented sir sydney harcourt from discovering laura as he had so ardently desired to do for ours is a mere sketch not a tale they must recollect he had only the last six months returned from the west indies a residence in which had entirely frustrated his wishes for a reconciliation even by a letter for as we have said before mrs gascoignes constant removals had prevented the possibility of any letter from such a distance finding them when he had first loved her he was dependent on a coarse minded worldly relation to whom an affection for a poor girl dared not be breathed he had sought an appointment abroad to escape a matrimonial connection which was being forced upon him and he had wished laura to consent to a private marriage and accompany him abroad as the companion of his sister who preferred daring the miseries of the west indies with her brother to remaining in england without him sir sydney then plain sydney harcourt with little hope of the baronetcy and independence for many years naturally of a fiery and somewhat jealous temper materially increased from the privations and checks he was constantly enduring chose to believe lauras calm reasoning indifference and her refusal to leave her ailing mother only a cover to reject his affection for that of some richer lover time his sisters representations and the bitter pain of separation cooled these unjust suspicions and he only recollected lauras look of suffering and tone of suppressed agony with which she had bade him farewell the unexpected demise of his relation the baronetcy and a moderate independency recalling him to england much sooner than he had dreamed of every effort was put in force to find laura but in vain till chance led him to briarstone and some magnetic instinct urged him to accept an invitation which it was more in his nature to have travelled some miles to avoid he always declared his belief in mesmeric influences henceforward isabels schemes to prevent the course of true love from running smooth were fruitless the old adage had already had its more than quantum of fulfilment and laura gascoigne became lady harcourt before she was two months older the delight and self complacency of the misses brown were beyond description miss lucretia looked grander miss wilhelmina more gracious and miss angelica more bustling than ever an accession of pupils and boarders was almost the immediate consequence of lauras marriage and the fair fame of red rose villa was so well established as fortunately to receive no diminution from an affair which so scandalized miss brown that she herself could not rally from it for months after alternately encouraging mr gustavus brown and mr gilbert givevoice till each gentleman so believed himself the favoured individual as to be ready to call his rival out if he dared to deny it isabel morland one fine summer morning eloped with an italian emigrant count who much against miss browns ideas of propriety she would have to teach her italian leaving both lovers in the somewhat disagreeable predicament of having been most egregiously deceived and laughed at at the very moment they were anticipating the gold far more than the hand of an heiress and as such was the origin of their dreams and the source of their disappointment we can better forgive isabels conduct to them than we can her conduct to herself alas indeed for those whom nature has so gifted and over whom principle has no sway footnote a fact gonzalvos daughter i constance my child take comfort all is not lost to thee though i must leave thee sooner than i expected were the almost inarticulate words of a dying warrior as supported in the arms of an attendant he bent over a beautiful girl who had flung herself on her knees beside his rude pallet burying her face in his hand in all the abandonment of grief it was a low roofed rudely furnished chamber in the olden castle of ruvo supporting on its panelled walls and divisions of the ceiling many specimens of the warlike implements of the time shields of massive workmanship with the overhanging helmet the long sword and misericorde or dagger interspersed with spears and iron caps were suspended on all sides while jars and flasks a bugle horn an unsheathed sword and belt and such like gear were scattered on the floor the dying man was stretched on the only couch the room afforded a wooden pallet serving alike for bed and chair one part of which was occupied by two of the warriors men at arms their eyes fixed alternately on their beloved commander and the fair being on whom his last thoughts seemed centred on their left stood two venerable monks the one holding aloft the cross the other bearing on a silver salver the consecrated bread and wine which the warrior had received in lowly faith convinced his last moment was at hand two other armed figures sturdy cavaliers finished the group individual sorrow was deepened by the thought that with duke manfred died the last lingering hopes of naples he had refused to follow his brother the voluntarily exiled monarch frederic to the court of france hoping still to preserve his ill fated country from being trampled on even if its liberty were gonestruggling against spain and her great captain simply because he thought france less likely to look on naples as a slave though for him individually life had lost all joyfor he felt his country would never again rise beautiful and free as she had been mortally wounded in an unexpected skirmish with the spaniards manfred would yet have met death calmly if not willingly had not the deep grief of the fair girl who had clung to him as to a second fatherpreferring to linger by his side in the roughest part of naples to accompanying her own royal parent to the luxurious court of louisdistracted him to the forgetfulness of all save how to comfort her he knew it was no small loss she mournedthe young impoverished yet noble luigi vincenzio to whom the first freshness of her young affections had been given with all the fervid warmth of an italian heart was as dear to manfred as his own son and he had promised to plead for vincenzio with her father in lieu of the gay duke de nemours whom frederic favoured but whom constance instinctively abhorred no marvel the words of the dying man fell vainly and discordantly upon her earthat she clung to him as if that wild embrace should fetter life withinhe should not must not leave her fainter and fainter became the voice of manfredand then all was silent save the convulsive sobs of the kneeling girl whose tears had so bedewed the rough hand she clasped that she knew not how cold it grew and the deep yet suppressed breathings of those around a quick step made its way through the groups of mourning neapolitans who thronged the chamber and a tall manly form stood reverentially and mournfully beside the pallet alas alas too latehe has gone his look his voice of kindly blessingall denied me constance my beloved the voice aroused her she started to her feet looked shudderingly on the face of the dead and then sinking in the arms of vincenzio wept less painfully upon his bosom but brief as was that upward glance it displayed a face so youthful and of such touching loveliness that tears should have been strangers there child like as it was yet there was something in its sweet expression which told the threshold of life was past she had looked beyond and tasted the magic draught whose first drop transforms the being and influences the whole of after life her rich golden hair hung loose and dishevelled over her pale cheek and her deep blue beautifully formed eye was swollen with weeping yet was she lovely despite of all but short communion was allowed the youthful pair for the last wish of the dying warrior had been that his niece should seek the convent of st alice twenty miles distant there to remain till happier hours dawned for naples or she could more securely rejoin her father yes better there than lingering here where nemours may deem himself privileged to seek thee when he lists resumed the young neapolitan when his words of gentle soothing had had effect and constance was comforted sweetest it shall be but a very brief farewell the thought that thou art in safety shall soothe the hours of absence and thou wilt promise to think of memy own think of thee she repeated and a smile lit up that sweet face till to say in which it looked more lovely smiles or tears would have been difficult there is no need to make me promise that my luigi i could not if i would think aught of other save her voice faltered of the kind heart gone she paused a moment then added sorrowfully my father my poor father i should wish to join himyet i cannot luigi dearest luigi tis my turn to chide now if thou lookest doubtingly and sad our best friend has gone oh we cannot weep too long for him yet canst thou think if frederic knew whom his constance loved he would still deny her no no smile on me love and trust me constance of naples will have none other lord but thee he did trust her and the brief period left them passed in such sweet and hopeful converse that sorrow itself was soothed and both were strengthened for the parting hour luigi himself headed the gallant little troop of native warriors collected to convey her with all honour to the convent he dreaded that nemours obtaining notice of the intended movement would attempt the capture of the princess by force and otherwise annoy them but to his surprise not a trace of the french army awaited them quartered as they were almost all over calabria generally presenting their steel fronts as strong lines of defence for the towns and castles round this desertion appeared extraordinary particularly as their aim had been to incapacitate the spaniards from leaving their entrenchments within the fortified city of barletta twelve miles to the south of ruvo where they were at present quartered night was falling when vincenzio returned to ruvo but there was still light enough for him to distinguish more than usual military bustle within the walls soldiers were hurrying to and fro arms were burnishing lances and swords sharpening large fires blazing up bands of armed men assembling the heavy harness and unsheathed weapons forming in heaps and lines to be donned and grasped at a moments warning anxious and curious vincenzio hastened to the quarters of the sire de la palice governor of the town and found him though joyous and laughter loving as was his wont alternately giving orders to several officers who seemed to appear and disappear with a glance and muttering oaths and execrations on some extraordinary act of folly the nature of which or by whom committed luigi found some difficulty in comprehending our limits will not permit our becoming personally acquainted with la palice which a conversation might accomplish we must confine ourselves to a brief relation of historical facts it appeared that the inhabitants of castellanata enraged beyond all measure at the licentious and insulting conduct of the french troops quartered in their vicinity had risen in sudden revolt and finally betrayed the town into the hands of the spaniards nemours thinking more of his own dignity which he imagined had been outraged in this revolt than of the real interests of his sovereign swore the most signal vengeance and marched his whole force north ward disregarding the representations of more experienced officers that it would be the height of folly to leave all calabria unguarded for the reduction of one paltry town the character of gonzalvo was too well known to admit a thought of his neglecting this opportunity of attack and la palice therefore on his part determined to be on the alert though he guessed not how soon or whence the attack would come there were many sad thoughts on the young neapolitans heart as he returned to his own chamber alas it little signified to naples who were her masters french or spaniards but he recalled that period of his countrys brief prosperity when the celebrated captain gonzalvo had been his monarchs guest and honoured friend and grieved that frederic had chosen france instead of spain for refuge perhaps his instinctive hatred to nemours as the encouraged aspirant to the hand of his constance increased these regrets but still to la palice he was bound by all the chivalric ties of military companionship and he determined if danger threatened to forget his nationality awhile and fight in his friends defence the night was peculiarly mild and lovely the soft silvery halo flung down from the full moon on the clustering olives and vineyards stretching beneath the young italians window over some miles of fertile country seemed to whisper tranquillity and peace that war had not yet disturbed and luigi looked forth lingeringly till the calm sank into his own soul and constance alone stood forth amid those troubled visions like a star gleaming through clouds on the trembling waves it was near daybreak ere he sought his couch and slept but not for long one pale streak of dawn alone was visible but there were sounds on the still air little in accordance with the lingering night a dull heavy monotonous roar as of a continued cannonade close at hand was accompanied by sharp vivid flashes of light playing athwart the casement then followed the roll of many drumsthe shout to arms the foe the foethe clash of the alarum bellthe heavy trampling of a hundred feetthe shrill shrieks of womans terror and other sounds of tumult and war vincenzio listened a moment as one still dreaming but then la palices warning flashing on his mind he sprang to his feet and glanced beneath him far far as his eye could reach trampling down that fair scene of fertility and peace there came band after band of armed men rolling onward in such dense masses that he felt at a glance resistance was in vain marvellous as it seemed gonzalvo de cordova himself was upon them and that name in its mighty eloquence was paralysing terror a very brief interval sufficed to banish every thought from luigis mind but fears for la palice by whose side he speedily was the noise waxed louder closer but there was no trace of disturbance or even anxiety on the governors open brow as he gaily marshalled his little band of three hundred lances to throw themselves into the first breach which gonzalvos unceasing cannonade was rapidly making in the walls ha welcome comrade mine he cried grasping vincenzios hand mark la palice as a true prophet and nemours the most egregious blockhead that ever wrote himself a man ha all compact there ready thats wellto the right forward and on they rushed through the town already every wall was manned and showers of arrows and stones galled the spaniards at every turn but had no power on the immense mass at work against the ramparts already the walls were tottering falling borne down by the heavy cannonade on the opposite side the walls had been scaled and spanish and french fought hand to hand on the summit a yell of triumph soon after proclaimed the formation of an immense breach into which gonzalvo himself and his choicest troops poured like a mountain torrent increasing swelling as it came as if utterly to overwhelm the compact little phalanx which la palice threw forward to oppose him a very brief struggle sufficed to show how fruitless was every effort of the french the immense odds speedily forced the breach but still hemmed in on all sides so closely that their swords had scarcely room for full play there was no word of surrender or defeat struggling only to preserve their honour in their death man after man fell without yielding an inch around his leader presently wilder and more deafening sounds arose mingling indiscriminately the roar of artillery the clang of steel the rush of a hundred chargers the shrill shrieks of women so that not one could be distinguished from another the town was forced and every street for a brief interval became the scene of combat another hour and the strife was at an end la palice who had striven as if his individual efforts could avert defeat had been overwhelmed with numbers and brought to the ground with the crushing blow of a battle axe yet even then with his own gay laugh he flung his sword over the heads of his captors that none should claim him as an individual prize vincenzio shared his fate the capture of his friend removing from him all inclination to prolong the fruitless combat and yet more exasperate the spaniards against his ill fated countrymen the close of that day beheld ruvo deserted the heavy banner of spain waving above the ruined ramparts alone marked what had been for the riches of ruvogold treasure horses and arms the french prisoners almost all of whom were badly wounded and the principal neapolitan citizens were conveyed under strong detachments to barletta the head quarters of the great captain and his troops ii twenty four hours after his daring reduction of ruvo gonzalvo de cordova was seated in one of the best furnished apartments of barletta bearing little trace either of the eager warrior or sagacious general all other emotions merged in that one which even in his glorious campaigns reigned uppermostlove for the lovely the transcendent being who in womans freshest most beautiful prime was seated at his feet her arm reclining caressingly on his knee and her dark splendid orbs all their flashing passion stilled in filial love fixed on his face as he narrated his last triumph it was his daughter elvira for whom so deep was the heros love that even in his foreign wars she was never known to be parted from his side trust me they shall be seen to my father she said in answer to his entreaty that her womans tenderness and care would look to the comfort of his wounded prisoners whom he had already luxuriously installed with his own surgeon to attend them la palice is in truth a champion to gain guerdon of womans care but not of womans heart my gentle one thine must not pass to the wardence of our foes nor shall it father it is thine all thine and the rich burning flush resting on her cheek as she spoke was deemed by her father but the glow of sunset which played around her he kissed her fondly vowing he would accept such devotedness only till another and a dearer sought it find but one deserving of thy love my child and no selfish pangs shall bid me keep thee by my side yet methinks thou as myself art difficult to please the noblest and the best have bowed to thee in vainthy heart was ice to all and selfish as i am i have rejoiced it was so her face was buried in his hand and he saw not how painfully its colour varied he did not feel the full quick throb of that maiden heart if her fond father penetrated not its secret how may we in obedience to gonzalvos command in those days no strange one elvira attended by her women herself visited the apartments of the wounded prisoners administered to their wants superintended the healing of their wounds speaking words of comfort and of hope tillveiled as she was her rank even her name often unknownthe sound of her voice the touch of her gentle hand were hailed by each sufferer with such feeling of devotion and gratitude as might have marked her indeed the angel visitant their fevered fancies deemed her and i have seen allthou art sure none other needs my tending she asked of an attendant methinks those rooms we have not visited there are no prisoners of moment there lady but one room tenanteda poor italianneapolitan i should saywho as he may bring little honour and less ransom to our leaders coffers scarce needs your gracious care he will do well enough peace slave it is well gonzalvo hears you not he crouched beneath her flashing scorn poorfriendless the more he needs his captors care lead on she was obeyed and the apartment gained a young man was reclining on a rude couchhis limbs stretched out his head bent forward resting on his arm in all the abandonment of complete repose his long jetty hair had fallen as partly to shade his face but there was just enough visible of his cheek and brow to startle by their ghastly whiteness gleaming out in fearful contrast with the crimson cloak he had drawn around him the opening of the door had not aroused him and a moment the intruders paused there was a start a quick and choking breath as if respiration had been suddenly impeded and the lady elvira stood beside the slumberer and lifted the damp curls from his brow why did she so pause so stand pale rigid breathlessfeared she to break those peaceful slumbersif so her caution was in vain the young man started looked wildly round then heavily and painfully arose as if conscious he was in the presence of rank and beauty and struggled to give them homage nay fair sir we come to thee as leech not queen and must refuse all homage but obedience the lady said calmly we must condemn thee to thy couch not to thy knee who is it that speaks lady that voice comes to my ear laden with happy memories bringing a vision of one whose faintest smile was chivalrys best fameaye een to naples sons and is it marvel signor vincenzio the daughter of gonzalvo should be with her father still though naples no longer calls him friend nay we have refused thine homage as little suited to thy weakness gentle sir resign thee for a brief while to the leechs art and take comfort gonzalvo wars with france not naples we will visit thee again luigi vincenzio rose from his knee where he had sunk simply in greeting to one whose resplendent gifts in happier days had excited his young imagination in no ordinary degree and the calm unimpassioned posture in which he stood till she departed betrayed no warmer feelings than reverence and admiration days passed merging into weeks but long before that period luigi vincenzio was not only convalescent but permitted and enabled to roam at large about barletta and its environs unguarded even by his parole whence came this extraordinary indulgence none knew but all supposed that as the great captain had repeatedly declared he warred not with the neapolitansnot at least with those who chose to accept his friendshipand own the supremacy of his sovereigns ferdinand and isabellathe young nobleman had accepted these conditions and had been thus received into favour again as had been the case before the capture of ruvo chivalric games agreeably diversified the dull routine of military duty nemours overcome with shame at the consequences of his own folly had retired to canosa and as gonzalvo had not received the expected reinforcements enabling him to change his mode of attack to the offensive his officers and many of the neapolitans friendly to his interests entered with spirit into all their generals plans for military recreation while the lady elvira resumed her station as queen of the revels crowning the victor with her own fair hand her influence had led vincenzio there she rallied him on his deep gloom playfully demanding why he alone should scorn the prize she gave he had professed such deep gratitude for the tender care she had so silently lavished on his sufferings soothing him by the charm of her voice to health more powerfully than the leechs art and yet he refused such trifling boon and he obeyed he joined the combatants received bright wreaths of glory from her hand and lingered by her side but the smile she sought was not upon his lips her step her voice however unexpected had no power to flush his cheek or light his eye with joy but his to herthe echo of his footstep the faintest whisper of his voice as the smouldering fire in the bosom of the volcano seeming so still so silent till roused to whelming might they lay upon her heart fiercely and terribly the thunder cloud of wrath had gathered on the brow of gonzalvo de cordova as with heavy strides he paced his private cabinet about a month after ruvos capture he chafed not at fair and open fight nay gloried in the heat the toil the press of war but conspiracy treachery or that which in the present excited state of his mind he deemed as such he could not brook a plot had been discoveredill formed ill digested but if correct in its details in the names of its principals involving many of those whom gonzalvo had treated and trusted as friendsamid the neapolitans to throw off the yoke of the spaniards to be free and preserve their liberty at the swords point till seconded by other cities and encouraged by nemours inactivity frederic himself might be recalled this seemed their object pledged to by the most solemn oaths gonzalvos name was found upon their lists of victims but all was dark and little tangible still warrants had been issued those supposed the principal conspirators arrested and secured and the great captain now chafed and fumed unwilling to believe the whole tale true from the heavy judgment it demanded yet feeling to the full the tremendous responsibility devolved upon himself my father god in heaven the tale is not false thenyetyet they have dared to connect the innocent luigivincenziohe is not he cannot be of these speakspeak in mercy and the proud the majestic daughter of spain whom it hath seemed no human power no human emotion could bow sunk in powerless agony on the earth grasping the robe of her father and gazing on his face as if her life depended on his answer startled amazed gonzalvo who had been unconscious that for several minutes she had been in his presence reading his brow ere she found words vainly sought to raise and soothe her she reiterated but those words her tone becoming wilder and shriller in its agony as the reply was evidently evaded aye even he at length it came and gonzalvo sternly pointed to the young noblemans name upon the list elvira gonzalvos daughter away with this engrossing weakness well is it for thee none but thy father marks it i have heard and in return for that kind confidence would had the fates decreed have sought fixed gloried in thy happiness though the choice had been other than mine own but nowwith this damning proof my child my child away with the unworthy weakness it shall not so debase thee weak debased who dares to say these words to meto me am i not still elvira she sprang to her feet standing erect in all her majesty but with cheeks of marble whiteness gleaming out from that night black hair as if their rich current had rushed back to her heart what is it they saidthat he was guiltyfalse tis false yet if tis notmisledmisguidedfather is there no pardonthere mustthere shall be what is his doom speak there is no weakness now death or the galleyswhat else befits the ingrate traitors in a deep concentrated voice the answer came ha holy virgin my child my child she had totteredfallenand lay without voice or motion at his feet iii luigi vincenzio denied none of the charges brought against him save that of the intended murder of the principal spaniards in italy such baseness he strenuously denied they had decoyed him into the conspiracy working on all his peculiar feelings of love of land and of his exiled king who was not alone regally but personally dear to him the conspiracy appeared to him but a noble effort of some few bold hearts to throw off the hated yoke of the foreigner and therefore he had joined it and even now in danger of death of worse than deaththe galleys he persisted in the glory the virtue of his cause it was rumoured that gonzalvo in his still continued desire to conciliate the neapolitan nobles had offered to vincenzio not alone pardon but riches and connection by marriage with one of the most powerful and noble families of castile though its name never transpired if he would take a solemn oath to be true to the interests of ferdinand of arragon and never seek naples again save in pursuance of that monarchs interests and these offers more than usually magnanimous even for gonzalvo were to the utter bewilderment of all refused scarcely a week after vincenzios arrest the unusually strict retirement of the lady elvira was disturbed by an earnest petition for a private interview on the part of a neapolitan boy who the attendant said had been so urgent and appeared so exhausted that he could not refuse him entrance he would not tell his business to any save the lady elvira permission was given and he was conducted to her presence clothed in a coarse folding cloak of neapolitan cloth with the red picturesque cap of the country slouched upon his brow he stood at the threshold of the apartment his arms folded in his mantle his head bent on his breast as if either physical or mental strength had for the moment utterly failed him retire was the first word that met his ear and he perceived the lady elvira addressed her attendants who still lingered retire all of you the boy asked a private audience and i have promised it treachery dangeri fear them notbegone and they obeyed one searching glance the boy cast around and ere the lady could address him he had darted across the room and flung himself at her feet clasping her knees with the convulsive grasp of agony struggling for words but so ineffectually that nought but quivering anguish convulsed those parched lips nought but agonized sobs found vent mantle and cap had both fallen in the quickness of the movement and though the inner dress was still the boys that exquisite face that swelling bosom told a different tale ha who art thou what wouldst thouspeak silly trembler and even at the moment that an indescribable thrill passed through the heart of gonzalvos daughter she struggled to speak playfully in sooth thou art too lovely to wander forth alone save in this strange guise speakwhat is thy boon a life a life they say is forfeited lady kind generous lady oh have mercy i thought i had words to plead his cause to beseech implore adjure thee but i have nonenone mercy oh have mercy mercy i am no sovereign to give life or death poor child how may i serve thee and whom is it thou wouldst save art thou not elviraart thou not gonzalvos daughterand will he not pardon at thy word oh seek him tell him constance princess of naples is in his power yields herself his prisoner to be dealt with as he lists let him but spare luigiluigi my own noble love give him but pardon life liberty lady lady plead for him let them hold me prisoner in his stead wherefore lookest thou thus mercy oh have mercysave him whom saidst thou girl whom wouldst thou savespeak i command thee exclaimed elvira in a voice so changed so unnatural that constance shuddered vainly endeavouring to shrink from the heavy hand that grasped her shoulders the eyes that flashed upon her as if fire had dwelt within their depths as thou hopest for mercy speak save whom but my own my plighted lord is there one in the wide world to love me now as luigiluigi vincenzio he who hath honoured constance with his troth oh save love thou darest not tell me that he loves theefalsefalsehe does not love thee she sprang up cheek lip brow flushing for a single instant crimson then fading into a white so ghastly it seemed as if life itself must have passed save for the mighty passion which held it chained thee one like thee poor foolish child art thou one to bid luigi vincenzio love to hold his heart enchained yet thou art lovely good god of heaven how exquisitely lovely poor child poor child i have appalled theedoes he so love thee she had sunk back on the cushion her hands convulsively pressed together as to conceal their trembling but the wild light of those eyes now still movelessly fixed on constance who had risen from that posture of entreaty as if the deep emotion of another had stilled her into composure love me yes as none but luigi can love daughter of a ruined a persecuted house with little to make me worthy of such love yet doth he love me as i in truth were all in all to him as he is all to melove me oh did they bid me die or wander forth an exile an outcast like all of my race yet queens might envy constance for luigi vincenzios love and thou wouldst save him aye with my lifewith all that they may deem precious constance of naples is no common prize tis said ferdinand would give a jewel from his coronet for all of frederics unhappy offspring placed within his power i am here bid gonzalvo send me a state prisoner as he so nobly did my brother ha lady noble lady forgive the word tis not for the captive the suppliant to arraign the captor and the judge grief makes the speech unwaryheed it not heed it not take my life my liberty for his constance of naples thou mayst save both gonzalvo wars not with women the princess threw herself at her feet with a wild cry of gratitude the strangeness of that voice the rigid expression of that face she heeded not knew not she only dreamed of hope aye but i have not said how girl pardon life liberty all have been offered to him for whom thou pleadest on the sole condition of swearing allegiance to ferdinand fealty to spain and he hath refused she interrupted oh give me entrance to himi will plead kneel move not from his feet till he hath done this he will submit for me he will hear me live for constancelet me but plead peace there is more he must be naturalized in spain wed one of her noblest daughters aye one that loves him let him do this and he shall have life riches honour all that can make life glad ha dost thou fail bid him do this and he shall live yes even this was the reply after one single moments pause and the quivering lip the ashy cheek the trembling frame alone betrayed that young hearts agony let luigi vincenzio be free be happyfor if she whom he must wed in truth thus love him the dream of his youth will fade beneath the glory of his manhood and he shall he must be blessedif such things be what recks it that constance droops alone i shall have saved him have given him back to life to his fellows to honour to glory and my death will be happy oh so happy lady i will do this death who spoke of death for thee bid luigi thus accept his life and thine is secured is free free speakest thou of love yet dreamest thou life could exist apart from himpeace peacelet me but save him let him but live give me but admission to his presence let me but speak with him lady lady wherefore tarry i will do this take me but to him thou wilt swear that low terrible whisper was a more fearful index of passionate agony in the speaker than even that which crushed her who stood in such meek mournful yet heroic suffering before her one only feeling prompted constance but in elvira it was the fierce contest of the evil and the good one whelming passion straggling for dominion over all that had been so fair so bright so beautiful before swear to sacrifice my all of selfish bliss for him aye without one moments pause oh lady thou knowest not love if thou deemest it needs oath to hallow that which i have said if thou doubtest me bid one thou mayst trust be witness of my truth but oh keep me no longer from him let me save his life without a word or notice in reply the lady elvira sat a moment in deep thought then rose and signed to the princess to follow her iv the prison of luigi vincenzio had been changed from the dark loathsome dungeon in which he had first been cast to a low roofed rambling apartment in that wing of the citadel of barletta which generally served as a barrack for infantry an iron grating however running in the centre from roof to floor cut the chamber in two one portion generally serving as a guardroom when any important prisoner demanded unusual care this annoyance had been spared vincenzio although the evening following the interview above described about ten soldiers were then assembled occupying the farthest corner of the chamber grouped in a circle enjoying their pipes and cups seasoned by many a jest which effectually turned their attention alike from their own officer and their prisoner the former closely muffled in a military cloak and cap with a heavy plume of black feathers stood leaning against the stone pillar to which the grating was affixed by thick iron rings parted only by that open railing from the prisoner and consequently enabled not alone to hear all that passed between him and the lovely being whom he was holding convulsively to his breast but to mark every change in the countenance of each what had already passed between those loving ones it is needless to record nor the deep suffocating emotion which had for several minutes utterly deprived vincenzio of voice when his constance so strangely so unexpectedly sprang into his arms what cared he now that his guards were present that she was not permitted to see him alone save to smile at gonzalvos idle fear that she could bring him means to escape he felt nothing but her presence drinking in for the first few moments the sweet faint accents of her beloved voice as if nothing of ill or misery could touch him more but soon oh how much too soon the sweet dream fled and but one truth remainedthat he was doomed to death to close his eyes on that beloved one and for ever a shudder had convulsed his frame a deep groan had been wrung from him by that thought and constance had heard and guessed its import she knew not at first what she said but one thought one feeling one stern necessity was distinct upon her mind all else was confused and painful as if a dark cloud had folded up her brain leaving nought clear but the letters of fire in which that one stern necessity was written and dost thou indeed in very deed so love me luigi oh then thou will grant my boon thou wilt not let thy constance plead to thee in vain said she after many many minutes had rolled by unheeded in that sad commune and she lifted up her pale and mournful face as the white rose that beat by some heavy storm droops its lovely head to earth ere one leaf had lost its freshness boonin vain constance mine own sweet love is there aught thou canst ask luigi will deny ah thou knowest not the weight of what i crave nor will i speak it on thy simple word thou must pledge it me my love aye by solemn oathby hallowed vowi claim it on thy love thy fealty and how mayst thou refuse me playfully he besought her to speak it first and then dreaming not her object unconscious even that the offered conditions were known to her he knelt at her feet and placing his hands between both hers which felt strangely and fearfully cold he solemnly swore to do her bidding whatever it might be the words were said and constance sank upon his bosom saved saved oh i have saved thee luigi thou wilt livebe freethou shalt not die he started to his feet the whole truth bursting on his mind and yet if so why did she so cling to him as if he were spared to her no no it could not be live constance my blessed one what canst thou mean my life is forfeited no no no she reiterated it is granted thee and on conditions easy to accept luigi thou hast sworn to grant my boonto do my bidding and i bid thee live live to be happy glorious as i know thou wilt be speak not hear me frederic is no longer a king naples no longer a kingdom she is parcelled out to others she hath no sonsno nameone hour acknowledging the rights of france the next bowed to the arms of spain to one or other of these mighty potentates she must belong my poor poor father can never claim her more luigi my own luigi banish the vain hope of her freedomher future influence were frederic here thou knowest he would say to thee as he did to all when he departed my children tis vain to struggle make peace with whom ye will frederic absolves you of your allegiance no oath of fealty restrains you hast thou forgotten this no no then wherefore shouldst thou pause many have bowed to louis why not to ferdinandluigi my own luigi thou shalt live constance he answered and he drew her closer to his bosom while his own frame shook constance were this the sole condition for thy sake beloved i had not pausedeven thus i would have lived for this poor unhappy country i feel will never rise again such oath reflects no shame upon her sons constance was this all they told thee luigi no there is anotherwe must partfor ever yetyet i bid thee live slowly every word fell but so distinctly so expressively that despite that low gasping tone he heard them all and not he alone ha thou knowest this part constance and thou bidst me live i choose death instead i will not lose thee i will not wed another thou wiltthou shalt luigi luigi twill be but a brief a brief pang followed by years of bliss oh do not think this moments agony will never never pass away the heros glorythe warriors famethe statesmans prideall all shall be thine own ambition with her hundred paths to immortality shall lure thee to forgetfulness and then to peace and sheshe who will be thy brideoh if she love thee as they say she does even she at length will woo thee into joy luigi my own my own why dost thou turn from me speak oh speak tell me thou wilt live she sunk on her knees before him as if that action should continue the entreaty for which voice for the moment had utterly failed constance constance dost thou urge me thouwilt thou give me to another is it thou who bidst me thus be happy no no thou knowest not how much i love thee do i not love thee luigioh it is only thus that i can save theeonly thus they will grant thy lifeand what care i for my happiness luigi if thou diest how mayst thou love meguard me as thou wouldst oh live live in my lonely convent cell let me think of thee as i know thou wilt behonoured lovedaye and in time so blessed let the bright thought be minethat i even i poor simple constance have saved thee luigi deny me not this turn not away thou canst not refuse methou darest notthou art sworn the countenance of vincenzio became more and more terribly agitatedhe struggled to break from her hold but the grasp of agony was upon his cloak and either held him with a giant strength or his every limb had lost its power and chained him there he sought to speak but only unintelligible murmurs came and again that voice of impassioned appeal came upon his heart crushing it almost to madness it bade him live she might need his friendship though denied his love when time permitted such intercourse innocently to both that tall form bowed as stricken by a mighty wind a moment and he had caught her to his bosom had murmured some inarticulate words and a burst of passionate weeping convulsed his frame ere the paroxysm passed he was alone soldiers officers constance all were gone v it was noon the brilliant sun of italy poured its golden flood through the high pointed casements of a small private chapel in the citadel of barletta which had been set apart for the sole use of gonzalvo de cordova his family and personal attendants it was lavishly decorated seeming in all points well suited to the establishment of the great captain heavy brocades worked in gold and silver hung from the walls shading many a shrine of the same precious metals where saints virgin and saviour were all blazing in gems a cloth of gold covered the altar which stood just beneath a gorgeously painted window that when lighted up as now with the sun of noon flung down the most brilliant colouring on floor and wall this day a rich carpet of superb genoa velvet covered the mosaic pavement at the foot of the altar and decorated cushions seemed to denote that some unusual ceremony was then to be performed while the number of sumptuously attired nobles spanish french and neapolitan already assembled and the private chaplain of gonzalvo missal in hand behind the altar with his priestly attendants proclaimed the hour at hand the great captain himself was present magnificently attired leaning on his jewel hilted sword wrapt it seemed by the fixed repose of his countenance in deep meditation which none present chose to interrupt the interest increased tenfold when attended or rather guardedfew could tell whichluigi vincenzio attired with some care but deadly pale bearing an expression of fearful internal agony on his countenance slowly advanced up the choir to the altar the gaze of gonzalvo moved not from him serious it was yet scarcely stern and the tone was calm in which he said we have heard signor vincenzio you accept the conditions proposedhave we heard aright luigi simply bowed his head in answer imagining the oath of fealty to ferdinand and denial of frederic would next be administered but it came not silence reigned again uninterrupted as before then came sounds along the corridor the folding doors at the base of the chapel were flung wide open and the lady elvira more than usually majestic in mien and carriage entered followed by several attendants her resplendent beauty was heightened by an expression of countenance none could define save that it affected the most indifferent spectator then present with a species of awe of veneration that could have bowed every knee in unfeigned homage stars of diamonds glittered in her raven hair and sparkled down the bodice and front of her dark velvet robe the first glance of all rested immovably seemingly fascinated on her the next turned on the slight figure she led forward but every curious effort to discover the strangers identity was rendered vain by the thick shrouding veil which completely enveloped her permitting nothing but the tiny foot and exquisitely turned ankle to be visible a strong shudder had convulsed the form of vincenzio he tried to step forward to speak but all power appeared to forsake him till a voice sweet clear and silvery uttered the simple words i will the customary rejoinder to the priests demand wilt thou accept this man as thy wedded lord and its attendant vows to love honour and obey the voice thrilled through him awakening him to consciousness he knew not how or why and he saw he was kneeling before the altar beside that veiled and shrouded form by whom gonzalvo and his daughter were both standing as if from their hands he received her gradually everything became distinct la palice was at his side his hand upon his shoulder as if rousing him from that deadening stupor he recognised his friends amidst the noble group standing around had the marriage vow been administered to him if so he must have replied or the ceremony could not have continued but he knew not he had spoken and what had in fact aroused hima voicewhose voiceto whom was he irrevocably joined not that one whom his fevered fancy had so wildly pictured for she stood there looking on the ceremony as calm and motionless as the most indifferent spectator it was over vincenzio and his nameless bride rose from their knees and then it was the hands of gonzalvo removed the veil and led her forward that the eyes of all might rest with admiration on the loveliness displayed a cry of astonishment burst simultaneously from the french prisoners and neapolitans around and the latter rushed forward and prostrated themselves before her clasping her robe her feet mid sobs and tears calling on heaven to bless the daughter of their king the being whom from her cradle they had well nigh worshippedthe princess constance but one alone stood speechless one alone had no power to go forward for all seemed to him a dream whose bewildering light and bliss would be for ever lost in darkness but as those eyes turned on him that radiant glance sought his there was one sob one choking cry and luigi had bounded forward had clasped her to his heart and then he would have flung himself at gonzalvos feet to pour out the burdening load of gratitude that almost crushed him with its magnitude but gonzalvo grasping his hand in the friendly pressure of sympathy forbade all speech till he had been heard it has been said he exclaimed that to the king of naples and his ill fated family gonzalvo de cordova is incapable of generosity or even of humanity because the stern mandate of his sovereign demanded the sacrifice of his own private sentiments of generosity and honour and compelled the captivity of frederics heir my friends i plead no excuse no offence for this dark deed but now that nought but gonzalvos own heart may dictate i bid ye absolve me of all undue severity all unjust dishonour the princess constance offered her liberty for that of the signor vincenzio but nobles of naples gonzalvo scorned it she is free as is her husband his ransom five thousand marks is discharged from my private coffers and settled as a marriage dowry on his bride both then are free unshackled by condition free as the winds of heaven to travel where they list we heard of a noble of france hostile to this union and on account of his birth approved of by king frederic and therefore it is we have been thus secret and would counsel signor vincenzio to accept the vessel lying at anchor ready for his use and convey his gentle bride to the court of her father without delay we will take all blame for the union as ye have all witnessed hath been without consent of the bridegroom for thee signor vincenzio thy fault is unconditionally pardoned a grace won for thee by the truth and glorious heroism of thy gentle bride no thanksto us they are not due we had been terrible in wrath resolute to demand the forfeit of rebellion even to the last save for one whose earnest pleadings we had no power to resist in your love your happiness think on gonzalvos daughter for to her ye owe it all it needed not the name ere that rich voice ceased vincenzio and his bride were kneeling at the feet of the lady elvira the former pouring forth with passionate eloquence his gratitude his veneration in words burning thrilling known only to italys impassioned clime she heard and a faint quivering smile was on those lips one hand she yielded to his respectful homage and laid the other caressingly fondly on the beautiful head of constance whose face was lifted up to hers beaming in all the blissful confidence of love of joy of devotion conscious that to her she owed all that made life dear bid constance tell thee how much elvira owes to her signor vincenzio and thou wilt learn i have yet more cause of gratitude than thou hast she said and not one word quivered to thee she hast given a life to mewhat is far more valuableelvira to herself unstained unscathed her soul of honour cloudless true when all methought had failed farewell be happy and may good angels guard ye both she raised the princess and folded her to her heart there was an eye thou knewest not upon thee in his prison she whispered ere she released her constance hadst thou failed we had both been lost for i had seen no stronger spirit than my own thou hast saved us both and must be blessed she printed a long kiss on that beautiful brow and placed her in her husbands arms a brief interval of congratulation of joyful conference followed and then all within that chapel was silent and deserted hours passed the chieftain of spain had returned from accompanying vincenzio and his bride to their vessel though he had tarried to watch them weigh anchor and disappear in the distance he inquired for his daughter sought her in all her haunts and lastly with a strange foreboding re entered the chapel no voice and at first no figure met his eye or ear he rushed forwards a beautiful form lay either lifeless or in a deep swoon at the altars foot her rich and luxuriant hair falling heavily and darkly around her it was the lady elvira the remainder of the lady elviras career is a matter of history with it the romancer interfereth no further the authoress i you surely do not intend acting such a fools part dudley as that our little world assigns you was the address of one friend to another as they drew their chairs more cosily together in the little sanctum to which they had retreated after a tte tte dinner and what may that be my good fellow why throw away yourself and your comfortable property on a person little likely to value either one or the other and certainly worthy of neitherclara stanley granville dudley coloured highly oblige me at least by speaking of that young lady with respect he said however you and your companions may mistake my intentions concerning her mistake my good fellow your face and tone are confirmation strong i am sorry for it though for i would rather see you happy than any man i know i believe you charles but what is there so terribly opposed to my happiness in an union with miss stanley granting for the moment that i desire it charles heyward sat silent and stirred the fire because she is not rich nay i believe rather the contrary i did not think you worldly granville thank you for doing me but justice i am perfectly indifferent as to wealth or poverty in a woman but what is your objection then she is not superlatively beautiful nor seemingly first rate in accomplishment but what then she is pleasing unaffected full of feeling very domestic for i seldom meet her out again were the poker and the blazing coals at variance and more noisily than before my good friend you have roused that fire and my curiosity to a most unbearable state of heat do speak out what is the matter with miss stanley that when i mention the words feeling and domestic you look unbelieving as a heretic can you say nay to any one thing i have said nay to them all granville dudley exclaimed heyward with vehemence it is because you need a most domestic woman for your happiness i tell you do not marry clara stanley she is a determined bluelight dark every imaginable shadea poet a philosopher a preacherwrites for every periodicallays down the law on all subjects of literature from a fairy tale to a philosophical treatise or ministerial sermon for heavens sake have nothing to do with her a literary woman is the very antipodes to domestic happiness fly before your peace is seriously at stake granville dudley looked and evidently felt disturbed at first startled and incredulous he compelled his friend to reiterate his charge and its proofs nothing loath charles heyward brought forward so many particulars so many facts concerning the lady in question which from his near relationship to the family with whom she lived he had been enabled easily to collect that granville unable to disapprove or even contradict one of them sank back on his chair almost with a groan why my dear sober minded philosophic friend you cannot surely have permitted your heart to escape your wise keeping so effectually in so short a space of time that you cannot call it back again with a word cheer up and be a man thank the fates that such a melancholy truth was discovered before it was too late i have heard you forswear literary women so often that i could not stand calmly by and see you run your head blindfold into such a noose she is a nice girl enough and if she were not so confoundedly clever might be very bearable but how is it i never discovered that she is so clever if it be displayed so broadly how can she hide it so completely before strangers she does not display it granville no one would imagine she was a whit cleverer than other people she has no pretension nor airs of superiority but she writes she writes theres the rub and she loves it toowhich is worse stilland a public literary character cannot be a domestic wife one who is ever pining for and receiving fame can never be content with the praise of one and one who is always creating imaginary feelings can have none for realities to speak more plainly those who love a thousand times in idea can never love once in reality and so i say clara stanley cannot value you sufficiently ever to possess the rich honour of being chosen as your wife do not be angry with my bluntness granville i only speak because i love you granville dudley was not angry perhaps it had been better for his happiness if he had been as then he would not have been so easily convinced by the specious reasoning of his friend the conversation lasted all that evening and when dudley retired to rest it was with a firm determination to watch clara stanley a few weeks longer and if it really were as heyward stated to dismiss her from his thoughts at once and even quit england for a time rather than permit a momentary fancy to make him miserable for life now though charles heyward had spoken in the language of the world he was not by any means a worldly man nor granville dudley though he had listened and been convinced unjust or capricious unfortunately for miss stanleys happiness granvilles mother had been one of those shallow pretenders of literature which throw such odium upon all its female professors from his earliest childhood dudley had been accustomed to regard literature and authorship as synonymous with domestic discord conjugal disputes and a complete neglect of all duties social or domestic as he grew older the excessive weakness of his mothers character her want of judgment and common sense andit appeared to his ardent dispositioneven of common feelings struck him more and more her descriptions of conjugal and maternal love were voted by her set of admirers as perfect but he could never remember that the practice was equal to the theory nay it did reach his ears though he banished the thought with horror that his fathers early death might have been averted had he received more judicious care and tender watchfulness from his literary wife mrs dudley however died before her sons strong affections had been entirely blunted through her apparent indifference and he therefore only permitted himself to remember her faults as being the necessary consequence of literature and genius encouraged in a woman he was neither old nor experienced enough at the time of her death to distinguish between real genius and true literary aspirings and their shallow representatives superficial knowledge and overbearing conceit as this was the case it was not in the least surprising that he should be so easily convinced of the truth and plausibility of heywards reasoning or that charles heyward aware of all which dudleys youth had endured from literature and authorship in a mother should be so very eager to save him from their repetition in the closer relationship of wife but clara stanley was no mere pretender to genius the wise and judicious training of affectionate parents had saved her from all the irregularities of temper indecision of purpose and inconstancy of pursuit which because they have characterised some wayward ones are regarded as peculiar to genius her earliest childhood had displayed more than common intellect and its constant companions keen sensibility and thoughtfulness a vivid imagination an intuitive perception of the beautiful the holy and the good an extraordinary memory and rapid comprehension of every variety of literature alike prose and poetry unfolded with her youth combined with most persevering efforts after improvement in every study which could assist her natural gifts it was impossible for her parents not to regard her with pride but it was pride mingled with trembling for they knew though she did not that even as she was set apart in the capability of mind from her fellows so she was in the capability of suffering knowing this their every wish their every effort was directed to providing her with a haven of refuge where that ever throbbing heart might find its only perfect rest taught to regard mental powers however varied as subordinate to her duties as a woman and an english and religious woman modesty gentleness and love marked every word and every action few there were except her own immediate circle and friends who knew the extent of her mental powers or the real energy and strength of her character but countless was the number of those that loved her it was not however till after her fathers death she saw and felt the necessity of making her talents a source of usefulness as well as of pleasure she was then little more than seventeen but under the fostering care of an influential literary friend she was introduced to the periodicals of the day her productions accepted and more requested from the same hand though a few years after mr stanleys death however their pecuniary affairs were so advantageously settled that clara had no longer any necessity to make literature a profession their income was moderate but it rendered them happily independent now now was claras ardent exclamation as she clasped her arms about her mothers neck i may concentrate my energies to a better and holier purpose than the mere literature of the day now i may indulge the dream of effecting good more than the mere amusement of the hour now i am no longer bound oh who in this world is happier or more blessed than i am and as long as she resided under her mothers roof in the pretty little village which had so long been her home she was truly happy encouraged by the popularity which through her literary friend she learned that she had acquired satisfied that he thought her capable of the work she had attempted and blessed with a mother for whose sake alone clara valued fame for she knew how sweet to maternal affection were the praises of a child but this might not last before she was one and twenty clara was an orphan and long long it was ere she could resume the employments she had so loved or look forward to anything but loneliness and misery every thought every task was associated with the departed and could filial love have preserved the vital spark the mother had yet been spared and had granville dudley known clara in that sad time he would have been compelled to abjure his belief in the incompatibility of literature with womans duties and affections but of such a trial both granville and heyward knew nothing nor when the latter said that she loved her profession did he imagine the struggle it had been for her to resume ithow completely at first it had been the voice of duty not of love fame had never been to her either incentive or further reward than the mere gratification of the moment and as a source of pleasure to her mother and how vain and hollow did fame seem now but hers was not a spirit to be conquered by deep sorrow she resumed her employments when health returned with a bursting heart indeed but they brought reward they drew her from herself for the time being and energy in seeking to accomplish good gradually followed the severity of her trial was however if possible heightened by the great change in her mode of life her only near relation was an uncle who lived and moved in one of those circles of high pretension and false merit with which the metropolis abounds his wife an ultra fashionist lived herself and educated her daughters for the world and its follies alone inculcating the necessity of attracting and gaining husbands but not of keeping them exterior accomplishment superficial conversation graceful carriage and fashionable manners were all that were considered needfuland all of feeling or of sentiment rubbed off as romance much too dreadful to be avowed to this family at the request of her uncle who actually made the exertion of fetching her himself clara removed eight months after her mothers death yearning for affection and knowing little of her relatives clara had given imagination vent and hoped happiness might again be dawning for her how greatly she was disappointed our readers may judge by the sketch we have given in their vocabulary authorship and learning were synonymous with romance and folly and worse still as dooming their possessors unavoidably to a state of single blessedness and therefore to be shunned as they would the plague itself that clara devoted to her literary pursuits but the same number of hours that one miss barclay did to music that is its mechanical not its mental part another to oriental or mezzotinting or another to the creation of wax work berlin wool etc was not of the least consequence their horror of blueism was such that to prevent all supposition of their approval of claras mode of life they never lost an opportunity of bewailing her unfortunate propensityand of so impressing all who visited at the house with the idea of her great learning and obtrusive wisdom that the gentle unpretending manners of the authoress could not weigh against it and she found herself universally shunned as something too terrible to be defined with all this i write on hope on she once wrote to an intimate friend struggling to feel that if indeed i accomplish good i shall not live in vain and my own personal loneliness and sorrow will be of little consequence but oh how different it is to write merely for the good of others to the same efforts to the same goal pursued under the influence of sympathy and affection because a woman has mind she is supposed to have no heart and has no occasion therefore for the sweet charities of life when by her if possible more than any other they are imperatively needed others may find pleasure or satisfaction in foreign excitement to her home is all in all if there be one to love her therebe it parent husband or friendshe needs no more the yearnings of her heart are stilled the mind provides her with unfading flowers and her lot is as inexpressibly happy as without such domestic ties it is inexpressibly sad do not wish me as you have sometimes done dear mary to love for it would be unreturned simply because it is the general belief that an authoress can have no time no capability of any emotion save for the creations of her own mind so wrote clara though at the time she knew not how soon her words would be verified as soon as the term of mourning had expired though little inclined for the exertion she conquered her own shrinking repugnance to asserting and adopting her own rights and to the astonishment of mr and mrs barclay she accepted some of the invitations which courtesy had sent her though entered into merely as a duty society gradually became a source of pleasure in the discovery that all her aunts circle were not of the same frivolous kind and then slowly but surely the pleasure deepened into intense enjoyment from the conversation and attentions of granville dudley whom she met constantly though he did not visit her uncle clara was so very unlike her cousins whose endeavours to gain husbands were somewhat too broadly marked that dudley had been irresistibly attracted towards her a fancy which every interview so strengthened that he began very seriously to question his own heart as to whether he really was in love as miss stanleys name was not generally known to the literary world and the lady at whose house granville mostly met her was herself scarcely aware that she was anything more than an amiable sensible and strongly feeling girl granville dudley knew nothing of her claims to literature and authorship till his conversation with charles heyward near the close of the season revealed them as we have said the very next time they met dudley half fearfully half resolutely led the subject to literature and literati and drew from claras own lips the avowal he dreaded in the happy state of feeling which his presence always created she at first imagined he thus spoke from interest and sympathy in all she did and enthusiastic as was her wont in conversation with those who she thought understood her she said more on the subject its enjoyment and resources than she had ever done in london granville said nothing in reply which could have chilled her at the time yet when the evening was over claras heart sunk within her she knew not wherefore save that a secret foreboding whispered within her that conversation had sealed her fate dudley would not trust his happiness with her at one other party she was to meet him ere the season closed and the veriest devotee to balls and soires could not have longed for it more than poor clara who looked forward to it as the confirmer or dispenser of her fears the morning of the day on which it was to take place little emily the youngest of the family was seized with a violent attack of fever which increased as evening advanced it so happened that all the barclay family who were out were engaged that evening mr and mrs barclay and their two elder daughters at a card and musical soire the other two and their brothers under the chaperonage of mrs smith the gouvernante at the ball to which clara looked forward with so much eagerness what was to be done the child could not be left and without mrs smith what was to become of her sisters it was impossible for them to go alone and equally impossible for mother father or either sister of the little sufferer to give up a fashionable party for the dreadful doom of sitting by a sick bed looks and hints of every variety were levelled at clara who with her usual benevolence had stationed herself close by her little cousin ever ready to administer kindness or relief at any other time she would not have hesitated a moment but with the restless craving to see granville dudley again the giving up her only chance for a time at least was so exquisitely painful she could not offer to remain mrs barclay however seeing hints of no avail at length directly entreated that as she was less fond of going out than any one else she might be glad of the excuse to give the time to her books and writing and it would really be doing her mrs barclay an especial favour if she would stay and nurse emily claras high spirit and strong sense of selfish indulgence obtained such unusual dominion that she had well nigh proudly refused but the little sufferer looked in her face so piteously and entreated her so pleadingly to remain that ever awake to the impulse of affection miss stanley consented the disappointment was a bitter one though claras strong sense of rectitude caused her to reproach herself for its keenness as uncalled for what did granville dudley care for her that she should so think of him but vain the question every backward glance on their intercourse convinced her that he had thought of her had singled her out to pay her those attentions that gentle and winning deference which from a man of honour such as the world designated him could not be misconstrued there was one comfort however in her not meeting him if he knew what kept her at home he would scarcely continue to believe that her only thoughts were of literature and authorship little did she know that before they departed on their several ways it was settled in the barclay parliament that nothing whatever was to be said of little emilys illness lest people should fancy it contagious and send them no more invitations so closing their chances of matrimony for that season before it was quite time if clara is asked for my dearswhich is not at all likelyyou can say you know that she could not leave her writing or correcting a proof or some such literary business i leave it to you matilda you are sharp enough particularly in framing excuses for a rival whom i know you are glad to get out of your way folks say granville dudley had a literary mother he is not likely to wish for a literary wife the young lady answered with a knowing nod and performed her mission so admirably that after that evening granville dudley disappeared power she certainly had to separate him from clara but to attach him to herself was not quite so easy the answer she had given to granvilles inquiries after her cousin was so carelessly naturalthat clara as an authoress a literary character had so many superior claims that parties and everything else must be secondary and this followed up by a high encomium on her great talent she should say genius but it was she thought almost a pity to be so gifted as it incapacitated her from common sympathies and dutiesthat it confirmed granvilles previous fears and while it made him almost turn sick with disappointment and anguish for it seemed only then he felt how completely she had become a part of himself he vowed to tear himself from her influence ere it was too late and the very next morning left london you were right heyward i suppose i shall be a happy man again some day or other but not now so do not try to philosophise me into being so but my good fellow perhaps after all we have been frightened at shadows and hang it but i am sorry i said so much at first that emily barclay has been very ill and was so that eventful night are facts and in my opinion clara stayed to nurse her because the others were all too selfish a sentimental excuse to obtain time for dear delightful solitary musings or some such thing it is too late heyward she is literary and so she cannot be domestic i will not think of her any more this was not quite so easy to do as to say but granville dudley was a man of the world far too proud and resolute to bow or seem to bow beneath feeling particularly when he believed himself on the point of loving one who was utterly incapacitated from giving him any heart in return he went abroad travelled during the remainder of the summer joined the first parisian circles in the autumn and before the year closed was a married man ii eight years have passed and clara stanley is still unmarried yet she is happy and contented for she is once more amid the scenes of her childhood once more the centre of a domestic circle who vie with each other who can love her best two years after she heard of granville dudleys marriage finding a london life less and less suited to her tastes and not conceiving any actual duty bound her to reside with her uncles family she resolved on making her home with an intimate friend of her mothers who was associated with all the happy memories of her own childhood and youth reduced circumstances had lately compelled mrs langley to take pupils a fact which had instantly determined claras plans she was the more desirous for retirement and domestic ties from the very notoriety which the constant success of her literary efforts had flung around her she did not disdain or undervalue fame but all of expressed admiration all public homage was so very much more pain than pleasure that she shrunk from it longing yet more for some kindly heart on which to rest her own let us not be mistaken it was not for love in the worlds adaptation of the word she needed it was a parents fostering carea brothers supporting friendshipa sisters sympathy or one friend to love her for herself for the qualities of heart not for the labours and capabilities of mind from the time she heard of dudleys marriage all thought of individual happiness as a wife faded from her imagination her only efforts were to rouse every energy to supply objects of interest and affection and so prevent the listlessness and despondency too often the fate of disappointed women this had at first been indeed a painfully difficult task for her heart had whispered it was because she was different from her fellows because she was what the world termed literary and learned granville had shunned her and a few words undesignedly and carelessly spoken by charles heyward relative to dudleys dislike to female literature from its effects on his mother confirmed the idea and made her shrink from her former favourite pursuits but she too had a character to sustain and once more she compelled herself to work believing that her talents were lent her to be instruments of good not to lie unused and yet to a character of strong affections and active energies mental resources however varied were not quite sufficient for happiness and therefore was it she formed and executed the plan we have named so seven years had sped and there was little variation in the life of our heroine for her biographer to record her constant prayer was heard her name had become a household word coupled with love from the pure high feelings and ennobling sympathies which her writings had called forth her works had made her beloved and revered though her person nay her very place of residence and all concerning her were as she desired utterly unknown this in itself was happiness inexpressibly heightened by her present domestic duties lightening mrs langleys household cares giving part of every day to that ladys pupils teaching them not only to be accomplished and domestic but to be thinkers training the heart even more than the mind making nature alike a temple and a school all the sweet charities of home were now hers and her heart was indeed happy and once more at rest and was granville dudley then forgotten when we say that clara might have married more than once and most happily but that she had refused simply because she could not permit an unloved reality to usurp the place of a still loved shadowall doubts we think are answered of granville dudley she could never hear all trace of him seemed lost within the last few years the newspapers had indeed often teemed with the praises and speeches of a sir dudley granville but though the conjunction of names had at first riveted her eye and made her heart turn strangely sick she banished the thought as folly it was a granville dudley not a dudley granville whom she had too fondly loved miss stanley had resided about seven years with mrs langley when application was made to the latter lady to receive the only child of sir dudley granville as her pupil the child was motherless and in such very precarious health that the milder climate of devonshire had been advised as combined with extreme care the only chance of rearing her to womanhood mrs langleys establishment was full six being her allotted number which no persuasion had as yet ever induced her to increase there was something however in the appearance of the little laura which so unconsciously won upon clara that she could not resist pleading in the childs behalf and as one of the pupils was to leave the next half year mrs langley acceded claras name however had not been mentioned in this transaction the lady who had the charge of laura had indeed conversed with her and had been charmed with her manner but little imagined she was enjoying the often coveted honour of conversing with an authoress and one so popular as clara stanley she said that laura though eight years old literally knew nothing lady granville had been the belle of her time but one who had the greatest horror of all learning in woman and in consequence possessing nothing of herself but showy accomplishment which told in society she had neglected the poor child wasted alike her own health and her husbands income in the sole pursuit of pleasure and hurried herself to an early grave lauras health had been so delicate since then that her father feared to commence her studies even while he was most anxious she should become a sensible and accomplished woman with resources for happiness within herself and she shall be if i can make her so was claras inward thought as she looked on the sweet face of the child and a new chord in her heart was touched she knew not wherefore it was impossible to analyse the feeling even to one long accustomed to analysing hearts and clara gave it up in despair but affection and interest alike clung round the child who gave back all she received her weak health prevented her entering into all the routine of the schoolroom and she became claras constant companion and pupil repeatedly the artless letters of the child to her doting father teemed with the goodness the gentleness the tenderness of miss stanley soon convincing sir dudley how quick and ready were her powers of comprehension and filling his heart with gratitude towards that kind friend whom he knew not guessed not was the authoress of the same name whose gentle eloquence in her sexs cause had even now his admiration laura granville had been with mrs langley about eight months when she became extremely ill from an epidemic that had suddenly broken out in the village all mrs langleys household were attacked by it in a greater or less degree but in laura alone did it threaten to be fatal careless of her own fatigue clara devoted herself day and night to the young sufferer her affections had never before been so warmly enlisted not one of her young friends had ever become so completely part of herself and as she watched and tended her morning prayers for her recovery it seemed as if the child must be something nearer to her than in reality she was an express had been sent off for sir dudley granville but from his having gone unexpectedly to visit a friend in germany it was unavoidably delayed on its way and nearly three weeks elapsed ere the baronet reached ashford from the haste with which he had travelled no account of her progress could reach him and it was in a state of agony and suspense no words can describe that the father flung himself from his carriage at mrs langleys gate and rushed into her presence your child lives is rapidly recoveringmay be stronger than she has been yet were the first words he heard for his look and manner were all sufficient introduction and the benevolent physician who had that instant quitted his little patient grasped sir dudleys hand with reassuring pressure the baronet tried to return it with a smile but his quivering lip could only gasp forth an ejaculation of thankfulness and sinking on a chair he covered his face with his hand let me see this incomparable young woman the preserver of my child he passionately exclaimed as dr bernard and mrs langley after describing the progress and crisis of lauras illness attributed her unexpected recovery under providence to the incessant care and watchfulness of miss stanley the physician declaring his utmost skill had been without it of no avail whatever being assured his appearance would not injure laura who was in truth daily expecting him he eagerly followed mrs langley to the room and paused a moment on the threshold unobserved laura was sitting up in her little bed supported by pillows looking pale and delicate indeed but smiling with that joyous animation which in childhood is so sure a sign of returning health and dressing with the greatest zest a beautiful doll which with its plentifully supplied wardrobe lay beside her near the bed and seated by a small table covered with books and writings was clara who by the rapid movement of her pen and her immovable attention was evidently deeply engrossed in her employment sir dudley could not see her face for it was bent down and even its profile turned from him but a strange thrill shot through him as he gazed oh look miss stanley how beautiful your work shows now she is dressed how kind you were to make her all these pretty things i can do it all but these buttons will you do them for me clara laid down her pen with a smile to comply with the childs request and as she did so laura laid her little head caressingly on her bosom saying fondly dear dear miss stanley i wish papa would come he would thank you for all your goodness much better than i can i wish he would come for your sake and his own dearestnot to thank me though i shall not love you the less for being so grateful laura was the reply in a voice whose low musical tones brought back as by a flash of light to sir dudleys heart feelings thoughts memories of past years which he thought were hushed for ever miss stanley clara inscrutable providenceis it to you i owe my child he exclaimed springing suddenly forward and clasping his little child to his heartone moment covering lauras upturned face with kisses the next turning his earnest grateful gaze on the astonished clara for an instant her heart grew faint for the fatigue of long continued nursing had weakened her nor could she realize in that agitating moment the lapse of ten years since she had last looked on his face or listened to its richly expressive voice time had passed over her heart leaving its early dream unchanged and vainly she strove to feel how long a period had flown all seemed a thick and traceless mist but when she succeeded in shaking off that prostrating weakness forcing herself to remember it was sir dudley granville not granville dudley who had thus addressed her still one fact was certain the object of her first her only affection was at her side once moreit was his child her care had saved day after day did clara stanley and sir dudley granville pass hours together by the couch of laura though conscious her secret was still her own and grateful that after the first burst of natural feeling granvilles manner to her was only that of an obliged and appreciating friend claras peculiarly delicate feelings would have kept her from lauras room during the visits of her father but the child was restless and uncomfortable whenever she was absent and granville so evidently entreated her continued presence that to keep away was impossible it was during these pleasant interviews sir dudley related the cause of his change of name he had become most unexpectedly the heir to his godfather sir william granville who had left him all his estates on the sole condition of his adopting for himself and his heirs the name of granvillesir granville granville he added with a smile was not sufficiently euphonious and so he had placed the dudley first instead of last he alluded in terms of the warmest admiration to her works and wondered at his own stupidity in never connecting the miss stanley of his lauras letters with the authoress he had once known a very peculiar smile beamed on the lips of clara as he thus spoke but she did not say its meaning one day some six or seven weeks after granvilles appearance at ashford clara had just comfortably seated herself at her desk after seeing laura ensconced in her little pony chaise when she was startled by hearing sir dudleys voice in accents of unusual seriousness close beside her will you tell me miss stanley how you can possibly contrive to unite so perfectly the literary with the domestic characters i have watched but cannot find you fail in eitherhow is this simply sir dudley because in my opinion it is impossible to divide them perfect in them indeed i am not but though i know it is possible for woman to be domestic without being literaryas we are all not equally endowed by providenceto my feelings it is not possible to be more than usually gifted without being domestic the appeal to the heart must come from the heart and the quick sensibility of the imaginative woman must make her feel for others and act for them more particularly for the loved of home to write we must think and if we think of duty we of all others must not fail in its performance or our own words are bitter with reproach it is from want of thought most failings spring alike in duty as in feeling from this want the literary and imaginative woman must be free granvilles eyes never moved from the fair expressive face of the gentle woman who thus spoke till she ceased and then he paced the room in silence till seating himself beside her he besought her to listen to him and pity and forgive him and prove that she forgave him and ere she could reply he poured forth the tale of his earlier lovehow truly he loved her even when his idle prejudices against literary women caused him to fly from her influence and enter into a hurried engagement with one beautiful indeed but from having no resources within herself the mere votaress of pleasure and outward excitement how bitterly he had repented through seven weary years the misery he had brought upon himselfhow constantly he had yearned for a companion of his home and of his mindand how repeatedly as he glanced over her pages where pure fresh feeling breathed in every line and the love of home and its sacred ties were so forcibly inculcated he had cursed his own folly how he had sought to drown thought in a public career but had still felt desolate and now that he looked on her again not only in her own character but as the preserver of his child how completely he felt that happiness was gone from him for ever unless she would give it in herself claras face was turned from him as he spoke but ere he concluded the quick bright tears were falling in her lap and when she tried to meet his glance and speak her lip so quivered that no words came it was an effort ere she could tell her tale but it was told at length though granvilles ardent gratitude was for the moment checked by her serious rejoinder it is no shame now dear granville to confess how deeply and constantly i have returned your affection but listen to me ere you proceed further i do not doubt what you say that your prejudices are all removed but are you certain quite certain that a woman who has resources of mind as well as of heart can make you happy as you believe at one and twenty you could have moulded me to what you pleased i doubt whether i should have written another line had you not approved of my doing it at one and thirty this cannot be my charactermy habits are formed i cannot draw back from my literary path for i feel it accomplishes good can i indeed make your happiness as i am dearest granville do not let feeling alone decide feeling sense reason claramy own claraall speak and have spoken long make my child but like yourself and with two such blessings i dare not picture what life would betoo too much joy and joy it was joy as it seemed granville has felt that for once imagination fell short of reality for his path is indeed one of sunshine and as lady granville the authoress continues her path of literary and domestic usefulness proving to the full how very possible it is for woman to unite the two and that our great poet is right when in contradiction to moores shallow theory of the unfitness of genius to domestic happiness he answeredit is not because they possess genius that they make unhappy homes but because they do not possess genius enough a higher order of mind would enable them to see and feel all the beauty of domestic ties footnote wordsworth helon a fragment from jewish history joy joy spring hath come bounding oer the earth laughing in the insects hum in the flowrets birth ere his spirit springs above summers wreath to twine oh what joy for me my love then thou wilt be mine joy joy though awhile dearest we must part warmly will thy sunny smile rest upon my heart spring the earth is greeting love with a crown of flowers for the hour of meeting love sweeter hopes are ours so sung in a rich mellow though somewhat subdued voice a young man as he stood beneath the window of a grim old mansion the sun had but just risen and sky and earth seemed still bathed in his soft rosy glow flowers of delicate form and many a brilliant tint were gemming the greensward which looked fresh and bright as emerald fringed with hoary rocks and thick dark woods lay the deep blue waters of the lovely rhine seeming as if the spirits of the early morning had flung on them a rich robe of golden sheen even the black forest in the far distance and the old apparently half ruinous mansion itself all but laughed in the glowing light hailing as they did the new birth of nature as well as that of the day spring had within the last few days leaped from the arms of winter and flowers and birds and earth and sky welcomed his birth as with a very jubilee of gladness the deep seclusion of the scene however was remarkable castles and towns convents and monasteries generally studded the banks of the rhine even as early as the close of the eleventh century the period of our narrative but here there was not a habitation of any kind visible save this one old house and its out door offices it was a hebrew school or college the origin of which was so far removed into the past as to be involved in mystery from its extreme seclusion it had remained undisturbed when elsewhere every trace of israels locality had been washed out in blood century after century beheld it occupied by a succession of venerable teachers learned in all the mysteries of their law and faithful to its every ordinance by some few hebrew families who from being pupils loved its peaceful seclusion too well to exchange it for the dangers of towns and by some youths brought there by anxious parents or there own will to learn such lessons as would bid them live to glorify their faith or die to seal its truth with blood the young minstrel whose song we have given had been one of these pupils since the age of ten and was about returning to worms his native city to see his widowed mother from whom he had been parted fourteen years obtain her blessing on his choice the daughter of one of his teachers and then return for his betrothed either to dwell in this safe retreat or elsewhere as circumstances might be a knapsack was on his shoulder and in his eager look upward as he sung his cap had fallen off and one of those countenances which once seen rivet themselves upon the heart was fully displayed it was purely spiritually noble expressive of every emotion which can elevate and rejoice and utterly devoid of that abject mien and fearful glance the brand which persecution laid on the israelites of towns a sweet face appeared for a minute at the window as the song ceased a smile whose sunny warmth the poet had not too glowingly described a fond wave of the hand and then the window was tenantless again and the young man turned away still humming for the hour of meeting love sweeter hopes are ours when he was joined by the companion for whom he had waited a man some ten years his senior dark and stern in aspect as if every human emotion had been battled with and conquered joyhope have such words meaning for an israelite he said bitterly art thou of the doomed and outcast race and canst yet sing in the vain dream of joy knowest thou not the fate of israel when once looked on by man the rack cord death hast thou not heard that in this new war of the accursed nazarene their holy war the signal for marching is the death shriek of the slaughtered jews spires metz cologne treves presbourg prague ask them the fate of israel and sing if thou canst ask yonder river from whose kindly waters those who had sought their calm repose rather than wait the cruelty of man were drawn forth and butchered on the blood reeking land ask yon river the fate of the hundreds who threw themselves within itand then sing of joy i do know these things arodi was the calm reply though the flushed cheek denoted some feeling of pain i know that for israel there is only such joy as may be resigned at a moments call only such hope as looks beyond this world for perfection and fulfilment think you because with a grateful heart and joyful song i breathed forth a dream of earthly happiness that i am less fitted than yourself to give up all of joy hope and love if such be the will of god it cannot be you love you are joyful you have woven sweet dreams whose destruction will bow you to the dust human affections fetter your soul to earth how can it give itself to god through the blessings he has given blessings which so fill my heart with love for him that without one murmur i would resign them at his call you think so now beware lest this too prove a dream for me hope and joy are as far from me as yon blue arch from the cold earth on which i see but my brethrens blood look beyond it then answered helon fervently why should there not be joy for israel dark as is his present so bright will be his future as both have been prophesied so both will be fulfilled he spoke in vain as well might he have striven to pour forth sunshine on the dark bosom of night as infuse his spirit in the heart of his companion their way being long and travelling tedious from the trackless forests and mountain torrents which they were repeatedly compelled to cross they found they had miscalculated their time and that the solemn festival of the passover which they had hoped to celebrate in worms would fall some few days before they reached it remembering that a kind of hostelry kept by one of their brethren lay but a few roods out of their way they determined on abiding there till the festival was over it was on the fourth day that a man rushed into the court covered with dust and mud and so exhausted as barely to be able to tell his horrible tale massacre and outrage again menaced the hapless jews he stated that on the first day of passover as the procession of the host had passed down the jewish quarter of worms a cry arose that it had been insulted by two jews who had vanished directly afterwards that were not the real criminals given up the whole jewish population should be exterminated without regard to age sex or rank seven days were allowed them to determine their own fate a useless delay for when all were innocent who could avow guilt the city gates were closed not a jew allowed egress from the town and at the imminent risk of his own life the bearer of these horrible tidings had alone escaped darker and sterner grew the countenance of arodi as he heard he had neither relative nor friend amid the doomed but once more the curse had fallen on his people and he burst forth in fearful execration ye sang of joy he exclaimed turning fiercely towards helon on whose face though pale as marble a strange yet beautiful light had fallen sing on a joyous song to greet a mouldering home and murdered parent ye dared hopeye dared be joyfultis the wrathful voice of the avenger peace arodi they shall yet be saved saved bid the ravening wolf release the lamb the hungry lion his fought for prey helons sole answer was so thrilling in its low brief words that arodi started several paces back gazing on him as if he had doubted or understood not the meaning of his words canst thouwouldst thouwhat resign all he rather permitted to fall from his lips than said i do not resign themtis but their exchange for bliss which is unfading and admahhelon hast thou thought of her thought of her and the strong convulsion passing over helons face and frame was indeed sufficient answer yet he added calmly after some minutes pause for this she too would resign me her spirit speaks within me bidding me do what my full soul prompts what is the happiness of one compared with the lives of hundreds the soul of the dark stern man shook within him he battled with emotion for the first time in vain falling on helons neck these words broke forth in sobs forgive me oh forgive me brother i despised contemned thee yet from thee i learn my duty whither thou goest i will go what thou doest i will do brother make me as thyself but one night intervened and the wretched jews of worms in the stern stillness of utter despair awaited their fearful doom the festive rejoicing which even in the darkest era of persecution ever attended the passover was changed into deepest mourning not one ray of human hope illumined this horrible darkness the similar fate of hundreds aye thousands even millions yet rung in their ears he who alone could save had turned his face in wrath from his afflicted people they had but one consolation and mothers clasped closer their unconscious babes and husbands their trembling wives in the one glad thought that none would be left to lament the otherthey should die together night fell calmly and softly oh who that looked up on those radiant heavens losing all of earth in the thoughts of the hundreds and hundreds of unknown worlds filling the vast courts of trackless space can imagine without a shudder the mighty mass of human passion and human suffering which one little corner of the globe contains who that feels for one brief minute the pressure of infinity upon his soul speaking as it will in the solemn stillness of spiritual night can come back to earthly things without shuddering at the awful amount of countless cruelties worked by insect man without feeling that we have indeed need of patient faith below to clear away the mysteries of such woe there was one lone watcher of the silent night but he thought not of these things for above an hour a tall muffled figure had been standing without the window of a lowly jewish dwelling gazing within and wrapt up in the strong emotions which the gaze called forth a lamp was burning on a table round which a mother and her children sat years had passed long years since the lone watcher had been among those loved ones save in dreams and now while his whole heart yearned to fling himself upon that mothers neck and feel her kiss and claim her blessingto clasp hands once more with those loved companions of his childhood now sprung into sweet blooming youthhe dared not follow feelings impulse better his own heartsick yearning the agonized throb of human love and human fear than the momentary bliss of meeting to part again for ever he had seen the burst of terror of the wild clinging to life even such life as theirs natural to youth soothed by a mothers prayer he had seen them twine hand in hand with hers and lift their bright heads to heaven in that meek enduring constancy the undying attribute of persecuted israel and then the mother was alone and the watcher beheld the calm a brief while give way and natural anguish take its place my god thou wilt spare one fell on the hushed air my firstborn first loved my beautiful helon i had thought to look on him again but i bless thee that thou hast refused my prayer bless him oh bless him father my own bright boy was it her own low sob she heard or its echo that she so started even from so much grief and looked fearfully round there seemed a shadow between the window and the faint moonlight but ere she could trace it to a human form it had gone the morning was clothed in dull leaden clouds and flocking from their dwellings as was their wont on the seventh day of passover in holiday attire and with composed appearance every jewish family sought the synagogue divine service commenced proceeded and was concluded without interruption scarcely however had they reached the outer court to return to their homes than fearful shouts smote the ear waxing louder hoarser more terrible with every passing moment on came the infuriated crowd a dark impenetrable phalanx increasing in every street and fearfully illumined with blazing torches held aloft blades gleaming in the red flame clubs axes pitchforks every weapon that first came to hand on they came wrought into yet wilder frenzy yet deeper thirst for human blood by their own mad shouts and the lurid flames that as they rushed down the jewish quarter marked their progress and how stood their victims so firm so motionless in the shadow of their house of prayer that even the wild mob when they first beheld them fell back a moment powerless formed in a compact square woman children and tottering age in the centre youth and manhood stood around with arms folded and head erect not a limb not a muscle moved not a sound broke forth even when their fiendish foes poured down and faced them it was an awful pause lasting not a minute yet seeming to be hours and then with brandished arms and wilder cries they rushed on to the work of death back exclaimed a voice not loud nor stern but so thrillingly distinct and sweet that it was heard by every individual of both parties and involuntarily compelled obedience backtouch not the innocent ye have demanded the criminals behold them ye have sworn their lives shall sufficetake them torture them as ye list but touch not on your peril touch not these two strangers stood suddenly between the murderers and the victims as the unknown voice spake the one in the loveliest bloom of youth the other in manhoods prime with an appalling yell of disappointed malice hate and aggravated wrath the fierce crowd rushed forwards and closed round the voluntary martyrs and here we pause for how may the pen linger on the horrible tortures the agonizing death inflicted on these noble men or the horror of the stunned yet liberated israelites in being forced by their tormentors to witness the fate of their preservers yet no groan escaped the victims to glut the long pent up fury of their foes no word to reveal to their brethren whence they came or who they were or that they had spoken but to save the poets prophecy was fulfilled ere spring had changed to summer helon and his faithful admah had met again where hope was lost in fulfilment temporal joy in an eternity of bliss the summer flowers had twined their clinging tendrils round a lowly tomb of pure white marble in the grave yard of that old mansion helons home so long and half hiding the single word admah with their radiant clusters whispered in sweet breath to the passing breeze the bliss of a pure spirit so early freed from the detaining fetters of a broken heart to this day the names of the martyrs rest unknown but the two lamps still kept burning to their memory in the synagogue of worms testify the truth of this fearful tale and bear witness to a faith a self devotedness in scorned and hated israel unsurpassed in the annals of the world lucy an autumn walk it was a lovely afternoon in the fall of the year that season by many deemed the most melancholy of them all the fallen leaves the decay of vegetation the absence of flowers the trees shorn of their summer glory are to some such painful emblems of mans estate that they shrink in strange and melancholy trembling from the calm and pensive aspect of autumn as if the death of nature whispered of their own yet it is not so autumn even in its sadness looks beyond the grave and breathes of immortality the shorn tree will put on its gala dress again the withered hedge will send forth the loveliest flowers earth burdened now in seeming with its emblems of decay in reality derives thence her nourishment and strength and will spring up again bright and beautiful strong and smiling in her reawakened joy and shall man alone amid the creation of omnific love pass hence for ever no oh no as a flower to bloom and be cut down so as a flower will he burst forth again in a lovelier world and never ending spring the day was well suited for such consoling musing there was a balmy freshness in the air a clearness in the atmosphere in the cloudless expanse of azure stretching above and around a warmth and glow in the sun even as he approached the west unusual to the season and there was beauty too in the landscape or the fountain of enjoyment which nature had unsealed in our hearts bathed the scene in its own bright colouring as in those exquisite lines of coleridge we receive but what we give and in our hearts alone does nature live ours her wedding garment and ours her shroud and would we ought receive of higher worth than that inanimate cold world allowd to the poor loveless ever anxious crowd ah from the soul itself must issue forth a light a glory a fair luminous cloud enveloping the earth the trees lifted up their graceful heads to the circling heaven every branch and every spray clearly defined against the blue so still so moveless they looked like pencil sketches of exquisite delicacy and softness then often as in beautiful relief started up a gigantic holly every leaf green and glossy as in the richness of summer with clusters of its bright scarlet berries standing out against the dark leaf like sprays of coral ever and anon a break in the hedge displayed towering hills and far stretching meadows green and glistening from the late rains while bold crags chained by the grey lichen and golden stonecrop and patches of gloomy firs frowning like grim shadows in the sunshine proclaimed the mountainous district to which we were approaching and heightened by contrast the beauty all around there was something in the whole aspect of nature so calm so cheerful bereft as she was of every flower and leaf and all her rich summer hoards that made us compare her to one on whom affliction has fallen with a heavy hand whose flowers of life are withered but who can yet lift up heart and brow with serene and placid faith to that heaven where the vanished flowers wait her smile again the very sounds too were in unison with the scene the sweet note of many an english bird not in full chorus of melody as in the warmth and luxury of summer but one or two together answered by others as they floated to and fro in the field of azure or paused a moment on the quivering spray then came the twinkling gush of a silvery stream seeming by its blithesome voice to rejoice in its increase of waters from previous heavy rains then sparkling and leaping in the glittering rays like a shower of silver a rustic watermill became visible through the trees the music of its splash and foam bringing forth the voice of memory yet more thrillingly than before for it was a sound of home we paused when suddenly another sound floated on the air of more mournful meaning it was the solemn toll of a church bell distinct though distant possessing all that simple sanctity peculiar to the countrythat voice of wailing which comes upon the heart as if the departed whom it mourns had had its dwelling there claiming kindred alike with our sorrows and our joys we hurried on and just as we neared the ivy mantled church the solemn chanting of a psalm by several young and most sweet voices sounded in the dim distance and becoming nearer and more near proclaimed the approach of the funeral train the peculiar mode of tolling the bell as is customary in those primitive districts of the north of england had already betrayed the sex of the departed and with foreboding spirits we listened for the age we counted twenty one of those mournful chimes and then they sunk in silence solemn as their sound the church was situated midway on the ascent of a hill or rather mount guarded by a thick grove of yews and firs their sad and pensive foliage assimilating well with the olden shrine the ivy had clambered over the slender buttress clustering round the old square belfry decking age with beauty and moss and lichen pressed forth in fantastic patches on the roof the green earth was filled with lowly graves thickly twined with evergreen shrubs and hardy flowering plants headstones and marble tombs there were some so crusted over by the cold finger of time that even the briefest record of those who slept beneath was lost for ever and others gleaming pure and white in the declining sun seeming to whisper hope and faith in the very midst of desolation and death the clergyman stood at the churchyard gate waiting the arrival of the corpse he was leaning against the stone pillar which held the hinges of the gate his head buried in his hands and his bowed and drooping aspect breathing a more than common love his figure was so peculiarly youthful we wondered at his full canonical costume the psalm continued now low as mourning the departednow in solemn rejoicing that a ransomed soul was free the snow white pall which covered the coffin the white dresses and hoods of the bearers and the young girls who to the number of eight or ten headed the train confirmed the mournful tale which the bell had already told a young girl of one and twenty summers was passing to her last long home there were but few chief mourners and these seemed struggling to subdue their grief to the composed and holy stillness meet for such an hour as the train entered the last winding path of the ascent the bell began again to toll and the sound seemed to rouse the young minister from his all absorbing grief he started with a visible shudder and the expression of agony that his face revealed haunted us for many a long day there was a strong effort at control and he turned to meet the corpse repeating as he did so in low impressive tones part of the burial service he walked at the head of the train to the place appointedthe centre of a little cluster of yews and there in silent awe we watched the ceremony of the interment an aged minister had been among the train of mourners and as they entered the churchyard had approached the officiating clergyman evidently entreating to perform the melancholy office in his stead the reply was merely a strong grasp of the hand and a mournful shake of the head and the old man fell back to his place his eyes still fixed on his young brother and gradually they filled with large tears which fell unconsciously and seemed more for the living than the dead once only the service was wholly inarticulate and the old man drew near hurriedly as fearing the calm of mental torture must at length give way but still he struggled on though the tone in which the awful wordsearth to earth and dust to dust now at length pronounced was as if the very spirit had been wrung to give them voice never did the sound of filling in the grave fall with such cold and heavy weight on our hearts as at that moment yet still spell bound we lingered the early twilight of autumn had deepened the beautiful blue of the heavens as the service concluded and with low subdued chant the mourning train departed the slender forms of the young girls in their snowy robes gleaming strangely and fitfully through the darkening shadows of the winding paths their sweet young voices sounding almost like spirit music as they faded fainter and more faint in the far distance still the young clergyman remained pale rigid moveless gazing on the newly turned earth till he fancied he was alone with the homes of the dead and then with a low smothered groan of anguish he flung himself on the damp grave clasping it with his outstretched arms pressing his cold lips upon it his whole frame quivering with the effort to restrain his bursting sobs the old man hurried forwards and laid his trembling hand on his arm the tears streaming down his furrowed face the while and with faltering accents conjured him to take comfort for his poor mothers sake i will i will was the agonized reply leave me leave me to my god he will bring peace i see but the cold grave now but faith will come again she is free rejoicing she will know now how much how faithfullybut leave me leave me now and the old man turned sorrowingly away and softly and sadly for such grief might not bear a witness we departed alsoour last lingering glance revealing the youthful mourner kneeling in voiceless supplication on the sod to the aged minister so often mentioned we were indebted for that true english hospitality still so warmly proffered in these nooks of the world and in listening to the following sad and simple story the evening hours sped on lucy lethvyn was the daughter of a rich merchant in one of our large commercial cities of the north of england the village of elmsford had been the site alike of her childhood and happy school days and so associated was it with hours of peace and joyance far removed from the strife and confusion around her city home that her wonted summer visit to its shades and flowers was ever welcomed with delight at the vicarage of elmsford then occupied by our venerable host mr evelyn mrs lethvyn and her daughters were constant visitors and there it was that nevil herbert the young clergyman who had so deeply interested us again met lucy after a lapse of seven years formerly they had been frequent companions from the near relationship of their parents and nevil had been accustomed to think of lucy as the gentle artless affectionate little girl of ten summers he had last beheld her her occasional letters breathing the same fresh child like spirit increased this illusion she had called him brother and often wished he had indeed been such and he had laughingly acknowledged and promised to value the relationship in those seven years of separation however nevils lot had changed at eighteen he lost his father and the same stroke cast him and his mother penniless on the cold world a rich relation promised to give him a collegiate education preparatory to his taking orders a living being in his gift the offer benevolently made as it was might not be rejected though to nevil the parting with his mother for her also to endure the miseries of dependence was fraught with such anguish that he would willingly have worked for her in the meanest capacity so that she might still feel free mrs herbert was however much too unselfish to permit this she soothed urged and in part comforted him by the anticipation of the time when they might be once again together assuring him that to contribute to that joyful end much more painful alternatives could be borne than the one that she had chosen on all that nevil herbert had to endure in college we have no space to linger suffice it he was poorhe was dependent and however lavish may be the kindness and benevolence bestowed it will not take away the sting contained in these two words or permit the taking that station in the world for which such spirits pine it is strange how often poverty will change to reserve and bitterness and pride dispositions which in affluence would have been humble and loving and open as the day and sad oh how bitterly sad it is that the cold heartless world should fling such scorn and contempt upon that word and shrink from the children of poverty noble gifted though they be as they would from crime and by a thousand nameless slights and petty provocations add a hundred fold to the misery already theirs philosophy may preach and religion soothe but while such things are poverty must ever be regarded as a doom of horror and of dread nevil herberts peculiarly sensitive nature caused him to feel these evils even more keenly than the multitude so situated and therefore the rest and peace of the vicarage of elmsford was indeed to him almost heaven upon earth there nothing ever galled him but all around breathed the balm of that true sympathy and appreciation which raising the drooping spirit to its proper level restores its self esteem and consequently its happiness nevil was just two and twenty when his ideal of female loveliness and innocence burst upon him in most exquisite reality through the child like loveliness and artlessness of lucy alike the favourites of the vicar he rejoiced to see them together and never dreamed that to his petted nevil danger might thence accrue to him lucy was still a child as so she was to herself and all around her but to one and that one unhappily was nevil he guessed not her influence till he returned to his solitary studies and then he felt too keenly that despite his every resolution he lovedand loved in vain not only from their different stations but that it was still only as a brother she regarded him the next recess found them again together more closely than before for lucy was the old mans guest equally with himself but a change had come upon hernot towards nevil but in herself the child had sprung into the womanthe incipient germs of thought and feeling burst into the full blossomed flowers there was a deeper tone in her sweet voice a more intense light in her radiant eye a fuller sentiment in her bright smile yet to nevils eye alone these things were visible none other even of those who loved her best saw the change but nevil read by the light of his own feelings and they told him she too lovedand loved another it was even so and from her own lips the artless tale was poured into his ear she called and felt him brother and claimed his sympathy as such feeling that did she conceal anything which concerned her happiness from one so true and kind and good as nevil herbert she wronged him and deserved to lose his friendship altogether and even at such a moment nevils martyr spirit did not forsake him the hand indeed was cold and damp which pressed the fairy one held out to him as she spoke but the lip did not quiver nor the voice falter in which he assured her that her confidence was not misplacedthat her happiness and interest were dear to him as his own a few weeks brought mr and mrs lethvyn and mordaunt lyndsey to the vicarage handsome intelligent and animated there was much in the latter to possess and win he had been lucys partner at her first ball and by the magic charm of his varied conversation the magnetic power which fascinates at a first interview and calling forth the yearning to know more gradually changes into earnest and lasting love fixed that evening indelibly on her mind and heart it is in vain to argue either on the birth the nature or the duration of love it may spring into existence unconsciously becoming so completely part of our being that it remains unknown until some sudden shock of joy or grief awakens us from our rest and dooms us to an almost overpowering sense of joy or an equal intensity of grief or one little hour may reveal depths within the human heart whose existence was never known beforewill awaken restless baseless imaginings that linger strengthening with every interview till the earthly fate is fixed for ever and how may we argue on this how seek its explanation yet who that hath once opened the wide mysterious volume of the human heart will deny that so it is it was so with lucy she who had remained free and child like in her intercourse with nevil herbert though her character assimilated with his far more than with lyndseys was chained and bound for ever beneath the magic of mordaunt lyndseys voice and smile the spell of their first interview lingered to the second and each day each week strengthened lucys love mordaunt lyndsey was an orphan and not rich enough to wed a portionless bride but unlike nevil as he knew not the privation and bitterness of dependence so was he utterly ignorant of those finely organized feelings which could debar his association with the wealthier than himself he made his way in the world for he had good connections well sounding friends and so was courted and received it was some little time before mr lethvyn could give his consent to their union his ambition looking higher for his lucy but his paternal affection was stronger than his ambition and perceiving how completely her happiness was bound up with mordaunts for whom he himself felt prepossessed he not only gave unqualified approval but settled on his darling a portion almost startling in its profuseness and promised his influence to get mordaunt entered as partner in the firm lucy was still so young that her parents prevailed on lyndsey though very much against his inclination to wait six months and celebrate their nuptials with the completion of her eighteenth year it had been with perfect sincerity that nevil herbert had promised lucy to comply with her artless entreaty and like mordaunt not only for her dear sake but from the same honourable and religious principles which actuated all his conduct why he asked himself should he hate and shun a fellow creature because he was happier than himself and could he have esteemed as he wished and hoped to do young lyndsey this principle would have been followed by a friendship as disinterested as was felt by man but this could not be rendered watchful and penetrative by his pure and most unselfish affection a very very brief interval of intimate association convinced him that mordaunt was not a character worthy of one like lucy she would need as a wife tenderness as unvarying as it was exclusive sympathy in all her high pure feelings as in detestation of all worldliness and art encouragement in her simple duties and tastes in a word love as faithful as clinging as constant as her own and this nevil saw mordaunt could not give even now lucy was not the world to him as he was to her and herbert could not argue that such difference was but in nature that man could not love as woman for his own aching spirit told him the creed was false time passed the lethvyns and mordaunt returned to their city homes and nevil to his solitary studies weeks sped on to months the eventful day was near at hand and lucys bridal attire nearing its completion the nuptials were to be on a scale almost princely for as princes did lethvyns ambitious spirit regard the merchants of england forgetting in his vast schemes and golden visions that the wealth of yesterday may be poverty the morrow the expected bridal was the talk of the city anxiety for her childs happiness the only thought of the mother love for mordaunt the sole existence of lucy and therefore it was not very strange that by these severally interested parties lethvyns unusually harassed countenance and excited manner were unnoticed ten days before that appointed for the bridal however the blow fellthe firm failed lethvyn was utterly and irretrievably ruined unable by the dishonest conduct of one of the partners even to pay one shilling in the pound the usual excitement which such events in provincial cities always create was heightened by the universal sympathy for the principal sufferers lethvyns profuse benevolence and affability having made him generally beloved many pressed forward eager to prove what they felt but the unfortunate man turned from them with a heart sickness a loathing of himself and the whole world which no human consolation could remove that her father should be so prostrated by his failure was a matter of grief but scarcely of surprise to lucy but that it could in any way affect mordaunt was a mystery she could not solve loving him and him alone with such love that she cared not how lowly was their dwellingnay rejoicing that she could now prove her love in a hundred little caressing ways which in a wealthier and more influential station would be denied herhow could the thought enter her pure mind that in his affection her wealth had equal resting with herselfthat his ardent desire for the speedy celebration of their marriage originated as much to possess her dowry as herself the insecure tenure of merchants wealth never having for one instant faded from his mind to elmsford at the earnest entreaty of mr evelyn the ruined family retired but vain were all exertions of his friends to rouse mr lethvyn from his despondency he drooped and drooped and there were times when he would fix his eyes on his lucy with such an expression of intense suffering of foreboding misery that she would fly to him fold her arms about his neck and weep and then conjure him to tell her what he feared and then he would fold her closer and closer the big tears rolling down cheeks on which the furrows of age had been hollowed in a single week but the cause of such emotion never found a voice too soon however did the cause reveal itself with every manifestation of strong feeling and real affection mordaunt lyndsey confessed that to give lucy the home and comforts which he felt she so deserved and needed he had not the adequate means they were both still young and he would go abroad seek his fortune in india where a lucrative situation had been offered him and if indeed his lucy would love him still through absence and distance and time he would in a few brief years either send for her to join him or return for her himself as circumstances would permit pale rigid almost breathless lucy sat while her lover spoke her hands pressed tightly one over the other and every feature still almost to sternness but as he fixed the full glance of his eyes on hersand they seemed to glisten in tears as he called her name in that accent of love which ever thrilled through her heart and frameshe fell upon his bosom and with a passionate burst of weeping besought him not to leave her were there not some sweet spots in englandoh surely there werewhere they might live even with his moderate means in comparative affluence solitude privationall more welcome rather than part with him and so sacrifice your first bloom your glowing youth my lucy and struggle on through life wasting your best years buried in a wild amid rude boors who could neither understand nor love you what care i for others have i not you dearest mordaunt do i seek ask for need aught else for that very love i would not so sacrifice you sweet one andandoh lucy forgive meman is different to woman my spirit is restless and ambitious i could not live in the retirement of an english cottage and restlessness might seem like irritability and thenthen lucy you wouldyou must cease to love me she lifted up her sweet face and oh the expression of unutterable sadness upon it a chill had fallen on her yearning heart stagnating its every bounding pulsea sickness and dread more agonizing than partings self for for the first time she felt he does not love as i love but she spoke no word she uttered no sighit was but the shadow on that lovely face which betrayed the cloud that had buried the sunshine of her heart and when with words of repentant agony almost in tears mordaunt flung himself on his knees before her covering her cold hand with kisses and imploring her not to doubt his love his truth because he had thus spoken she tried to smile to forget herself for him drawing from him with such sweet gentleness his plans and wishes that his spirits returned and he forgot even the fancy that he had given her pain or that the word of a moment could break the fond dream of months mordaunt lyndsey went to india we may not linger on that bitter parting or on the feelings of either save to say that with mordaunt sorrow was so transient that ere the long voyage was completed new scenes new hopes new wishes had obtained such dominion there was scarcely a void remaining with lucy could this be alas she was a young and loving woman and in those words we have our answer nor was she one who had ever so sought outward excitement and enjoyments as to find in them relief from anxiety or rest from sorrow the simple trusting religion of her own heartthe refreshing and soothing influences of naturethe calm repose of seeking the happiness of others of devotion to all who gave her the sweet meed of affection these were her consolations and enabled her to meet her hearts deep loneliness with cheerfulness and smiles and when mr lethvyn sunk gradually away it seemed not only with individual and present sorrows but with dim forebodings of his childs future it was lucy who soothed and comforted her mother and by her meek and gentle influence restored peace and serenity to their lowly cottage and robbed even the memory of death of its lingering sting and towards mordaunt what were her feelings though the conviction that his love was not as hers never left her mind her affection was too pure and true to know the shadow of a change she thought it was but the diverse nature of man and woman that the varied pursuits the very strength of the one prevented the exclusiveness the devotedness of the other and her gentle spirit turned longingly to the time when she should be all his own and when perhaps tired of excitement and ambition his heart would turn to his home and to herself for rest and peace and she would be to him indeed almost as he had ever been to her his truth she never doubted deception fickleness or caprice unkindness or neglect were things unknown to her and how then could she associate them with the earthly idol her soul enshrined she had carried the guilelessness the innocence the freshness of the child into the deeper feelings the clinging devotedness of the woman her being was wrapt in the beautiful halo her fancy had flung round another and did a storm disperse that halo it would have crushed her in the same destroying blast it was this child like confiding spirit the rays of her own heart which shed such warmth and glow over mordaunts letters for by spirits more exacting and suspicious the vital spark from the heart giving life to the words of the head would have been found wanting in the second year of their separation mr evelyn was raised to a deanery in one of the adjoining counties and his former living became the property of nevil herbert who had just received his ordination again therefore was this noble hearted young man thrown into the closest intimacy with the gentle object of his ill fated attachment and in circumstances which could not fail to strengthen its endurance and its force the barrier between wealth and poverty had been shiveredlucy was now but his equal nay circumstances had rather placed him above her an unexpected legacy and some recovered debts of his late father had given him not only independence but competence and he could now have offered her the home the simple comforts and enjoyments which the more he knew her the more he felt were all she needed for her happiness her friendship the regard of her poor widowed mother the delight with which ever the young margaret welcomed his visits the consciousness that he was of use to them all prevented his keeping aloof as perhaps would have been better for his peace besides how could he do so without some causehe whose adversity their prosperity had soothed and blessed no better the torture of lingering in her presence feeling she was the property of another and that other one who loved not valued not as he did than be even in seeming one of the butterfly crowd who sport in the sunshine to fly from the storm and though repeatedly alone together though thrown in constant association intimate and affectionate in very truth as a brother with a sister never once in those eighteen months did nevil herbert by sign or word betray to lucy or to any other even to his much loved mother the dread secret which bowed his heart and paled his cheek and dashed his youth with the calm seriousnessthe quiet hush of age it was three years after mordaunt lyndseys departure that the longed for summons came he could not return for her himself his situation would not permit his absence for so long a time but if indeed she loved him still sufficiently to encounter the miseries of a long voyage of a life in india the banishment from mother sister friendsall for him alone the sooner their term of suffering and separation closed the happier for them both but if time had cooled the enthusiasm of her loveif one feeling of regret however faint bound her to englandone emotion of dread accompanied the idea of the voyage or the thought of dwelling in a strange and dangerous landhe released her from her engagement she was free he besought her to think well ere she decided that he could not dared not urge her to make such a weighty sacrifice for him he did not dilate on his own feelings but if lucy marked the omission she believed he had done so purposely that no thought of him should bias her decision yet even what appeared to her guileless spirit his unselfish resignation of personal happiness for her sake could not remove the bitter anguish it was to feel that even now tried as she had been through absence and time he did not could not understand the might the devotedness of her love i will go to himhe shall learn how much i love him if he know it not now was her inward ejaculation and at that moment nevil herbert entered the room she welcomed him gladly for she needed him even more than usual and in agitated accents entered at once on the subject which engrossed her pausing in sudden fear as she beheld nevils very lips grow white and the damp drops standing like beads on his high forehead nevil deardear nevil you are ill and i selfish as i am prevent your going home to rest you are more than tired pray let me get something for you she laid both hands on his arms as she spoke looking up in his agitated face with an expression of such anxious affection that it was with difficulty nevil could restrain himself from snatching her to his bosom and pouring forth the agony which at that moment well nigh prostrated mind and frame but he did not even at that moment religion and virtue were triumphant he conquered the wild impulse of passion assured her it was but passing faintness which a glass of water would remove and when she flew to fetch it he bowed his head upon his hands in prayer and on her return received it with his own meek soul felt smile with all the artless confidence of her nature lucy imparted every feeling which that letter caused except its pain for that would seem reproach on mordaunt she would depart herself for answerto write first would be but waste of time the term of parting known it was better for her mother as for herself to be spared the suffering of anticipation besides her uncle only waited for her to set sail for indiahis wife went with him and such an opportunity might not occur again and what could nevil herbert answer could he reiterate mordaunts own counsel and beseech her to ponder well ere her final decision a chill for her had fallen on his heart he bade her repeat again and again that part of lyndseys letter which she had confided to him and each time confirmed the dread conviction that it was in no spirit of self sacrifice mordaunt had written but that the engagement hung upon him as a weight and chain from which he longed to be released yet shrunk from the dishonour of breaking it himself in vain nevil struggled with the idea it would force itself upon his mind regard it which way he would could he but have believed she was going to happiness he would not have paused till all in his power was done to forward it but as it was the chaos of that fond and faithful heart no words are adequate to describe he felt she was going to misery which he was denied all power all possibility of avertingnay which he was compelled by a stern peremptory destiny to advise and forward a few words must suffice to narrate lucys departure from her native shores and uneventful voyage doting as she did upon her mother yet so strong so omnipotent was that young girls love for her betrothed that even this pang was assuaged by the intense delight which even to think of gazing on his face of listening to his voice again never never more on earth to be divided emanated over her whole being the long weary months of the voyage were beguiled by such fond visions they told of dangers of hovering storms and she smiled as if love could guard her even from these and the fond fancy was realized for she reached india in safety to mrs lethvyn and margaret lucys departure was indeed desolation and as nevil tried to soothe and comfort by the anticipation of her happinessoh what a storm of contending feelings crushed his very heart he heard her mother bewail that love had not sprung up between her lucy and himself that two beings each so fitted to form the happiness of the other fate had so divided and though his very spirit trembled he smiled and with gentle monition soothed the momentary irritability by a reference to that wiser kinder providence from whom all things even the darkest have their source in love from a return ship which had met the syren about two hundred miles from her destined port the anxious friends of lucy received intelligence of her safety thus far and nevil nerved his heart and frame to receive without any visible emotion the intelligence expected in her nexther arrival and her marriage the time seemed unusually long before the indian mail came in and when he saw by the papers that it had and the postman passed the vicarage evidently on his way to the widows cottage nevil felt as if all physical power had departed from him how long he thus sat he knew notthe papers on which he had been writing notes for his next sermon were before him and his mother fancied he was still busied with them a hurried step aroused him and margaret lethvyn rushed into the parlour every feature betraying agitation oh mr herbert comepray come with me to poor mamma lucy our own dear injured lucy that wretchthat villain mordaunt oh that i were but a man that i could but seek revenge margaret exclaimed nevil springing from his seat and convulsively grasping her arm his face livid as death while that of the young high spirited margaret glowed like crimson revenge for what on whomwhat ofofspeak for gods sake he has deceived has dealt falsely and foully with herour own lucy who left friends homeall all for him and loved him with such love oh mr herbert do not chide me for the sinful feelings but i must hate himmust pray for vengeance on him he has deceived her even when he sent for her he was marriedmarried to another nevil herbert sunk back on his seat with a groan so deep a shudder so convulsive that his mother and margaret flew to his side in terror it was long ere he could rouse himself his forebodings all were realized the blow had fallen and for lucywho may tell the agony of nevils heart when he thought of its effect on her it was but too true incapable of any strong or enduring emotion still seeking and loving worldly aggrandizement above all other consideration mordaunt lyndsey had not been a year in india before he felt his engagement with lucy as a heavy chain which he longed to cast aside he found himself courted and followed and could he but have stifled the voice of conscience would have married before the termination of eighteen months a nature heartless as his own could neither appreciate nor understand the depth of lucys he purposely became colder and colder in his letters but the warmth and trust of her own heart prevented her perceiving it he magnified the miseries the dangers of an indian life particularly to a female so thoroughly english as lucy but all was in vainevery post brought him letters full of love and confidence as at first his feeble affections had been transferred to a wealthy heiress caught by the diamonds which had sparkled in her ball costume dazzled into forgetfulness of all the past conscience became drowned in the mad excitement and hilarity with which he pursued his advantage and not till he was irretrievably engaged did he remember he was the betrothed of another in one part of her statement margaret was wrong mordaunt was not actually married when he last wrote to lucy in vain even his heartless nature struggled to write those words which could separate her from him for ever for the first time the full extent of her love seemed to rush upon him and he started up and cursed his evil stars for making him such a wretch for a moment the idea of dissolving his present engagement entered his mind but ere he reached the door a vision of gold and gems of untold wealth came upon him and the demon triumphed his better angel fled and he wrote to lucy as we have seen believing with pertinacious self delusion that his meaning would be so evident that she would break off the engagement herselfshe must read that he was changed at least she would write again ere she decided on leaving england and then it would be easy for him to prevent it and confiding in this not a month after his letter had been despatched the heiress became mordaunt lyndseys wife our tale is well nigh done for to breathe one word of lucys feelings would be profanation in vain her aunt and uncle conjured her to remain with them in india and prove how little mordaunts baseness had affected her by a speedy marriage with another above him alike in birth wealth and station for such unions in india were easily accomplished by some perhaps the proposal would have been seized with avidity and a broken heart effectually concealed beneath an outward show of prosperity and pride with lucy this could not be the storm had burst the halo was dissipated its beauty and its sunshine its purity and truth vanished like falling stars in the dark abyss of fathomless space and the gentle spirit folded in the glowing halo lay shrined neath the shock her yearnings were now for home for a mothers tenderness a sisters caressing love a brothers supporting friendship which would lead her failing heart up to the only fount of peace and after a long and weary intervala voyage whose many dangers delays and all but shipwreck were it seemed as unfelt as unnoticedthose yearnings were at length fulfilled again was lucy lethvyn an inmate of her mothers lowly roof but oh how unspeakably changed yet still so exquisitely so radiantly lovely that the eye turned again and again upon her first in delight and then with such a strange quivering of the lip and eyelid betraying that tears were nigh the smileoh what a history gleamed from it of a womans heart broken yet even from its every shivered fragment reflecting the quickness and confidenceaye and deep heavenly love which had descended on it from above not a bitter word not an unkind reflection not a selfish murmur ever escaped those lips those who loved and tended her alone occupied her thoughts and deeds there were times indeed when a paroxysm of mental agony came upon her bowing her fragile frame even to the dust but of these intervals no earthly eye was witness they were only marked by a rapid increase of exhaustion and all the fatal evidences of decline and death and so months passed and nevil may we write of him as day by day he watched over the fading form of one so long so secretly so unchangeably beloved alas for him even as for lucy silence is the most eloquent we do not give such feelings words autumn had come with a mildness and beauty unusual and most soothing lucys couch had been drawn to the window at her own request and her eyes wandered over the landscape with a pleased and quiet smile nevil herbert was alone beside her he had been reading from that blessed book which had given comfort and strength to both but had paused seeing her inclined to speak yes she exclaimed the fervour of her spirit flushing her cheek with sudden crimson yes his words and works alike proclaim him love oh nevil god has heard my prayer he has spared me till i could realize the beauty and goodness and the glory of this world there was a time when outward and inwardall was dark not a ray illumined the sluggish depths of misery and despair beauty had vanished with truth i prayed for death and once as i stood alone upon the deck the dread temptation was upon me to end misery and life together it was but one plunge one little moments resolution and all would be over all oh what a flash of bewildering and awful light burst upon my mental darkness sent as an angel of mercy to my soul i had loved a mortal and not god the world was beautiful with human lovenot with his from whom it sprangand the light of human love was quenched to teach me other things and then it was i prayed in the deep agony of remorse my god would spare me even in suffering till even this world were lovely to my heart once more till i could feel his love more deep more precious than the love of man and he has done this nevil dearest nevil a few a very few hours and i shall be with him whose all is joy and loveliness and love for ever and ever there was no answer and lucy turned with difficulty towards him his face was buried in his hands and his whole frame shaken as with convulsion nevil she said softly dearest nevil you are in sorrow and i can do nothing to relieve it ito whom you have been such a true consoling friend i have long feared you had some secret grief not in the selfishness of my joy but sincesince i have returned oh that i could be to you what you have been to me it was too much for nevil in the passionate emotion of that moment he flung himself on his knees beside the couch poured forth the torrent of that overwhelming lovehow it had lingered with him through years of hopelessness and misery and he besought her in agony to say that she would livelive to bless him yet and as he spoke the pious the strong hearted nevil herbert wept till as an infant his very soul seemed powerless within him and you have loved me thusyou the good the noble the exalted oh i thought human love was all an idle dreama vain delusion but it is notit is not even this may be beautiful and true murmured lucy raising herself with difficulty till her head rested on the bosom of nevil do notdo not weep nevil our father will bring peace and love and oh if the pure and ransomed spirits may hover beside those still lingering on this earth be it mine the blessed task of bringing you the comfort i would give you now i was never worthy of such loveand from you dearest nevilhow much less worthy now that even were life granted i could give but a broken heart whose all of life and energy had been devoted to another you must not weep for me nevil you must not let my memory blight your path of holiness and good think of all you have been to me have done for me andand if that will comfort you oh believe allall of love this aching heart may yet give to earth nevil dearest nevil is your own she raised that sweet face which had become suddenly pale and dim as if a shadow had stolen over it nevil clasped her convulsively to his heart and struggled vainly to speak his white and quivering lips pressed hers with a long lingering kiss and she shrunk not from them it was his first and last for sleep stole upon her and bowed her head more heavily more caressingly upon his bosom and nevil stilled his hearts full beating and hushed his very breath lest that calm slumber should be broken he yearned to look once more in those lovely eyes to drink in once but once again the gushing music of that thrilling voice but vain those mortal yearnings human love the purest mightiest has no power to chain the heaven born spirit from its soaring flight she never woke again and mordaunt lyndseywas there no vengeance no retribution for him did justice indeed so slumber long years rolled on ere aught could be distinguished to mark his prosperous path from that of his fellows but some twenty years after our autumn walk in the lovely vales of westmoreland we learned that the hand of heaven had dashed his lot with poison a blooming family had sprung up around him but each more or less touched by the malady of their mother he had wedded madness the spirits entreaty founded on a hebrew apologue there was a pause in the courts of heaven seven times had the voice of the eternal resounded through the vast realms of space and from the very centre of chaotic darkness a world of beauty had sprung forth thousands of angelic spirits floated round and round the new born globe tending the innumerable sources of loveliness and life which had burst at once into perfected being at the all creating word with every new creation an increased effulgence flashed over the angelic hosts and richer tones of mighty harmony proclaimed the power and the glory and the mercy of their god deep in the unfathomable abyss of formless space hung the new formed world suspended from its parent heaven by chains of diamond light visible only to the pure spirits who on them ascended and descended in performance of their newly assigned employments myriads of celestial beings stood in dazzling files without the veil which in unapproachable and indescribable splendour concealed the throne of the creator whence issued that eternal voice which spake and creation was none not even the highest and the purest the most etherealized amidst those spiritual ranks could gaze on the ineffable glory piercing through the effulgent veil nor dared approach it without covering his face with his glittering pinions and falling low in prostrate adoration in their several ranks they stood the glorious archangels to whom the ways clearly as the works of the eternal were revealed hierarchs who had penetrated deeper and deeper the mysteries of infinity and by longed tried obedience and faithfulness and love had won the glorious privilege of commune with the ineffable majesty of the supreme even to the young seraph commencing his heavenly career satisfied to labour and to love till he should pass through the intermediate ranks and rising higher and higher in angelic intellect and the beatified nature of his tasks at length attain the archangelic goal seven times had gone forth the omnific word and seven times had the eternal pronounced it good and each time of that approving word had the resplendent pinions of the hosts of heaven fluttered in irrepressible rejoicing till space itself seemed lost in one vast flood of glistening and iris coloured light and music soft spiritual and thrilling marked every movement of the radiant wings and filled up each pause of song and then midst the deep stillness which succeeded again spake the eternal voice let us make man and the mandate with the velocity of light rushed through the angelic peopled courts and every spirit of every rank and every host caught up the omnific word and in the full song of adoration testified their joy but suddenly a hush sunk on the rejoicing myriads for darting at the same instant from their respective ranks nearest the eternals throne three glorious spirits met together before the resplendent veil and prostrated themselves in supplication they were of the highest order of the archangels each intrusted with an attribute of his creator to uphold its glory and its beauty amidst the celestial and spiritual worlds and one spake and his wings of sapphire his dazzling brow his radiant eye before whose single look the mists of error passed his crystal spear before whose slightest touch falsehood fled trembling and self abhorred alike proclaimed the gift of which he was the guardian the spirit of truth implored father create him notlife will be overshadowed by deceit and the spirit bowed his effulgent brow upon his wings in grief and then the second spirit spakeakin to truth but sterner his glorious brow was shaded by a glittering helm and his right hand grasped an unsheathed sword a raiment resembling an hauberk of golden light clothed his graceful limbs and the rich full voice in its entreaty breathed his name father and lord create him not he will destroy yon beautiful world by his unrighteousness and i unto whom thou hast entrusted thine attribute of justice will seem to him in his darkened light as the avenger father create him not and then spake the third archangelhis pure white pinions fluttered tremulously around him and the exquisite beauty of his youthful face seemed disturbed by the intense ardour of his supplication a wreath of amaranths bound back his flowing hair from a brow of such transcendent loveliness that one look upon it filled the soul with balm he held a bough of emerald resembling the olive leaf but radiant with a liquid lustre unknown to the plants of earth create him not oh father implored the spirit and the brightness of his meekly expressive orbs was dimmed create him not he will chase me from the earth peace will be but a name amidst the awful scenes of internal and external war with which mans passions will devastate yon beautiful world father create him not the spirit ceased and hushed to a solemn stillness the listening myriads waited the answering word the effulgence piercing through the veil appeared slightly shadowed as if the almighty presence had withdrawn his immediate glory and the entreaty of his favoured angels would be granted but far far in the unfathomable distance a resplendent star seemed floating towards the veil and faint yet thrilling melody proclaimed the rapid advance of angel wings on onand the semblance of a star gave place to the form of a beatified spirit whose dazzling loveliness irradiated space itself and heightened the glory all around and every rank he passed hailed him even in that awful hour with an irrepressible burst of song and drew closer and closer round and watched him with such love as only angels feel and he smiled on them but paused not in his rapid course and the smile kindled hope anew and confidence and joy banished the momentary shade it was the spirit of love the best beloved of the eternal the guardian essence of the whole angelic hosts angels and archangels heirarchs and seraphs alike acknowledged him and bowed before his sway as the representative of the supreme and on he floated in his indescribable beauty and every court of heaven sent forth increased effulgence as he passed he neared the veil and bowed down before it and then he spake and his low soft tone penetrated the farthest limit of that immeasurable space create him oh father he prayed create him to love and be beloved what if he err what if he sin thou wilt pardon him for thy love is greater than his sin a burst of bewildering glory flashed through the veil upon him as he knelt and darted its dazzling rays through the thousand ranks of heaven at the same moment it was the assenting sign of the eternal and again the omnific word went forth let us make man and millions and millions of voices swelled the glad chorus that another and yet mightier creation should bear witness to the loving mercy of their god and truth and justice and peace joined in the thrilling strain for the spirit of love had touched them with his quivering breath and they felt his words were true man might still err but created in love the immortal spirit breathed into the shell of clay the angelic hosts gave vent to the full song of rejoicing for the spirit of love hovered over the new born world as over theirs endowed by the measureless compassion of the eternal to purify and pardon illustration idalie the story of a picture no place is more calculated to call forth all the vagaries of the imagination than an old half ruined castle surrounded by wood and mount hoar from many centuries and lying in such deep seclusion as to be unseen by the mere casual traveller on such a spot completely circled by a branch of the cevennes in the ancient district of auvergne it was once my hap to light trees of such gigantic growth that they appeared bending beneath the weight of ages frowning rocks and overgrown brushwood formed so close a fortification that the building might have been passed and repassed within a mile of its vicinity undiscovered it was a gothic chateau of the olden time just sufficiently ruinous to give it the interest of age yet containing costly tapestried chambers panelled halls long rambling galleries secret rooms and those deep dark dungeons where many a brave man has languished and died unknown save by his ruthless captor all still in sufficient preservation to fill the mind with visions of the past as with the breathing realities of the present there was a small chapel in the building which had once been evidently richly adorned but whose shrines and hangings were now all crumbling to decay it was a melancholy visionary place yet infused with a charm impossible to be resisted and day after day my wanderings turned to the chateau contented at first with rambling over chamber hall and gallery imagination feasting on the thoughts of what had been the life the stir the pageantry where all was now the solitude of silence and neglect there were still some pictures hanging from the walls but seemingly so resigned to the cobweb and the dust that i had heeded them little till one day the sun gleaming upon an antique frame unobserved before attracted me to the picture it enshrined and in a moment heart mind and fancy were irresistibly enchained to attempt description of that face to say why it haunted me for days and nights as something almost unearthly would be a hopeless task yet turn from it as i would or seek amusement in other objects still it rose before me pale shadowy yet so lovely baffling every effort to dismiss it from my mind stars and braids of diamonds seemed still literally to glisten in the long jetty tresses falling as a veil around her hands small thin and delicately white were crossed upon her bosom the large dark eyes were raised and the pale lips parted as in prayer she seemed standing near an ancient altar but every other object in the picture time had rendered wholly indistinct that i could obtain any information from the half blind wholly deaf guardian of the chateau was little probable but the old man to my astonishment volunteered the tradition of the portrait even before i had sufficiently rallied from its effect to look into its past this tale when separated from the garrulous annotations of his age and office was simple and brief enough yet to resist its spell was impossible the beings of whom i heard seemed to breathe and move around me the old castle to resume the state and order which had characterised it nearly three centuries ago the very woods to lose their wild appearance and blending in beautiful keeping with mount and rock and richly cultured lands seemed to teem with the innumerable retainers of the proud nobles to whom they had once belonged under the influence of such dreamy visions the following papers were hastily written pretensions to a connected romance they have none they tell but the story of a picture which i would fain bring before the minds eye of the reader even as its remembrance still so vividly lingers on my own i it was the third day of the brilliant show yet was there no relaxation of chivalric ardour nor semblance that lords and gentles were wearied with martial sports or that the galaxy of beauty which the ornamented galleries presented had in aught diminished of loveliness and grace never had the fair sun of paris looked down on a scene of more spirit stirring interest never had the blue arch of heaven re echoed more martial sounds than on the day which witnessed the last tournament of france the lists extending through the most central parts of paris flanked on one side by the terrific towers of the bastile were adorned by pavilions and tents of every variety of colouring and material heavy brocades velvets and silks adorned with the devices of their owners betrayed the names and bearings of well nigh all the nobility of france over one whose silver covering glittered so resplendently in the july sun that the aching eye turned from its lustre hung the heavy folds of frances banner the fleur de lis which combined with the splendid accoutrements of esquires and pages lingering around proved that majesty itself was amongst the combatants the light breeze sporting with the many standards at times gave their devices to view at others laid them idly by their staves streamers and pennons in gay relief stood forth against the clear blue sky while the brilliant armour the glittering spears and stainless blades so multiplied the dazzling rays there seemed a hundred suns france and scotland spain and savoy in the honour of which last these jousts were given were all marshalled in the lists for none chose to remain mere spectators of games in which their chivalric spirits so heartily sympathised the princes of the lordly house of guise vying in richness of apparel and number of retinue with royalty itself montmorenci coligny andelot cond nemoursnames bearing with them such undying memories their mention is sufficientall were this day present for the blood red standard of intolerance and persecution as yet remained unfurled the very sounds that stirred the air added to the excitement of the scene there were the proud neighings the hurried snort of eager chargers impatient for the onset the pealing shouts of welcome as each knight was recognised marching at the head of well trained bands to his pavilion the answering cheers of the men at arms the trampling of many steeds the frequent clash of steel as the knights passed and repassed in the lists ere they formed into bands now and then the loud voice of the herald or the shrill prolonged blast of the trumpet and ever and anon a thrilling burst of martial music lingering awhile in its own rude tones then subsiding gently into the softer song of minstrelsy and love more fitted to the ears of beauty than the wilder notes of war and beauty was indeed assembled in the many galleries erected round the lists even had there been no catherine de medicis whose character was not yet fully known and who now as the queen consort claimed and received universal homage no fair and gentle elizabeth the youthful bride of spain whose child like form and diminutive though most expressive features accorded little with the heavy gorgeousness of her jewelled robes no retiring yet much loved margaret the sister of henri and bride of savoy no anne of este whose regal beauty and majestic mien would have done honour to a diademhad there been none of these there was yet one in the royal group who though girlhood had barely reached its prime fascinated the gaze of every eye and fixed the homage of every heart the diamond coronet of fleur de lis entwining the sterner thistle that lightly wreathed her noble brow betrayed her rank and the simple mention of mary of scotland the queen dauphine is all sufficient to bring before the reader a fair bright vision of loveliness and grace that imagination only can portray she sate the centre of a fair bevy of young girls indiscriminately of france and scotland all bearing on the smooth brow the smiling lip the unpaled cheek true tokens of those fresh unsullied feelings found only in early youth the trumpets breathed forth a prolonged flourish echoed on every side by the silver clarion and rolling drum and henri himself entered the lists clothed in the richest armour mounted on a beautiful arabian and still wearing across his breast the black and white scarf in homage to diana the chivalric monarch challenged one by one the bravest warriors and the first nobles of his kingdom excited by the presence of his distinguished guests he appeared this day urged on by an ardour and impetuosity which while it endeared him to his subjects caused many a female heart to tremble has thy knight turned truant idalie or is he so wearied from the exertions of the last two days he has no strength or will for more asked the queen dauphine of one beside her whose large dark eye and soul speaking beauty betrayed a birth more southern than scotias colder shores he enters not the lists royal madam she answered in a lowered voice for he fears the challenge of the kingfears not defeat but conquest the king has skill as yet unrivalled courage none dare question but the practice of a soldier brings these things to greater perfection than monarchs ever may obtain our gracious sovereign challenges the bravest knights to day and therefore does the count avoid the lists perhaps he does well but see how gallantly thy father bears himself disease hath worked him but little or rusted his sword within its scabbard i would trust myself to the men of montemar idalie with better faith than to many of those more courtly seeming bands and who is yon gallant bearing thy colours is the young esquire of thy father a rival to the goodly count not so gracious lady louis de montemar and i are cousins in kindred friends in affection and playfellows from infancy i broidered him the scarf he wears as token of my love when he doffed the pages garb and donned the squires when he hath won his spur perchance my scarf will be of little value thinkest thou so methought the lowly homage that he tendered spoke humbler greeting than that of a brother but there is some stir below the trumpets sound the king again as challenger a long flourish of trumpets again riveted the attention of the spectators and the heralds in set phrase challenged on the part of their liege lord and gracious sovereign henri of france gabriel de lorges comte de montgomeri to run three courses with the lance or spear and do battle with the same thrice was the count challenged according to form but there was no answer a deadly pallor spread over the flushed cheek of idalie de montemar and clinging to the dauphines seat she exclaimed lady dearest lady oh do not let this be in mercy speak to her grace the queen implore her to avert this combat thou silly trembler what evil can accrue nay an thou lookest thus i must do thy bidding and mary hastily approached the seat of catherine de medicis whom however she found already agitated and alarmed and in the very act of despatching an esquire to implore the king to leave the lists somewhat infected with the terror she witnessed yet unable to define it the dauphine returned to her seat seeking to reassure the trembling idalie and watch with her the effect of the queens solicitation at the moment of the esquires joining the knightly ring the comte de montgomeri unarmed and bareheaded had flung himself at the kings feet imploring him in earnest accents to withdraw his challenge and not expose him to the misery and danger of meeting his sovereign even in a friendly joust it was no common fear no casual emotion impressed on the striking countenance of montgomeri he was not one to bend his knee in entreaty even to his sovereign for a mere trivial cause the princes and nobles round were themselves struck by his earnestness knowing too well his great valour and extraordinary skill in every martial deed to doubt them now the king alone remained unmoved tush man he said joyously what more harm will your good lance do our sacred person than those whose blows yet tingle on our flesh we have run many a gallant course to day and how shall we be the worse for a tilt with thee marry thou art over bold sir knight we will not do thy courage such dishonour as to tax it now yet by our lady such presumption needs a check come rouse thee from this folly and don thine armour as thou wouldst were our foes in paris my chaplet is not perfect till it hath a leaf from thee it may not be my liege i do beseech your grace to pardon me and seek some opponent more worthy of this honour i know of none replied the king so frankly and feelingly that the warriors head bent even to the ground and montgomeri will obey his sovereign if he will not oblige his friend sir count we command your acceptance of our challenge sadly and slowly the count rose from his knee and was reluctantly withdrawing when the king again spoke we would not good my lord that you should prepare to accept our challenge even as a criminal for execution therefore mark you lords and gentles and bear witness to our wordswhatever ill or scathe may chance to us in our intended course we hold and pronounce gabriel de lorges comte de montgomeri guiltless of all malice absolving him from all intentional evil even if he work us harm how now sir squire what would our royal consort that ye seek us thus rudely the esquire bent his knee and delivered his message the king laughed loud and lightly by our lady this is good he said heard ye ever the like of this my lords what spell doth our brave montgomeri bear about him that we may not meet him even as others in friendly combat back to your royal mistress conrad commend us in all love and duty to her grace and say we will break this lance unto her honour would she have our noble guests proclaim montgomeri so brave and skilful that henri dared not meet him even after his challenge had gone forth shame shame on such advisers the esquire withdrew and the king taking a new lance and mounting a fresh charger slowly proceeded round the lists attended by pages and esquires and managing his fiery steed so gracefully as to rivet on him many admiring glances he paused beneath the queens gallery doffing his deep plumed helmet a moment in the respectful greeting of a faithful chevalier then looking up he smiled proudly and undauntedly at that moment the trumpets proclaimed the entrance of the challenged and the king hastily replacing his helmet clasped it but slightly and galloped to his post a loud shout of welcome greeted the appearance of montgomeri and as the spectators marked the pink and white scarf across his shoulder and the opal clasp that secured the deep plumes of his helmet all eyes involuntarily turned to see the fair being to whom those colours proclaimed him vowed nor when they traced the bandeau of opals on the pale high brow of idalie de montemar her flowing robes secured by a girdle of the same precious stones and discovered it was to her service the knight was pledged did they marvel that at length the cold stern unbending gabriel de lorges had bowed beneath the spell of love the lists were cleared and deep silence reigned amidst the assembled thousands the combatants ere the signal sounded slowly traversed the lists meeting at both extremities and greeting each other in all solemn and chivalric fashion montgomeris lance sank as he saluted the queens pavilion but it was to idalie his lowest homage was tendered she sought to smile in answer but her lip only quivered for her eye awakened by love could trace his deep reluctance to accept the challenge the signal was given and with a shock and sound as of thunder the knights met in the centre of the course the lances of both shivered a loud and ringing shout echoed far and wide forming a deep bass to the military music bursting forth at the same moment but then the sound changed and so suddenly that the shout of triumph seemed turned by the very breeze which bore it along to the cries of wailing and despair the horses of both combatants were seen careering wildly and with empty saddles round the lists princes nobles and knights crowded so swiftly and in such numbers to the spot where the combatants had met that the eager populace could trace nothing but that one warrior was down and seemingly senseless the which no one could assert order and restraint gave place to the wildest tumult the people en masse rushed indiscriminately into the lists heedless of the efforts of the men at arms to keep them back and scarcely restrained even by the rapid and agitated approach of the queen consort and the princesses towards the principal group words of terrific import were whispered one to another till the whisper grew loud and rumour became certainty the music ceased save the solitary flourish of trumpets proclaiming the warlike sports concluded as if by magic the lists were cleared the tents struck and every trace of the tournament removed but even then the popular ferment continued there were men hurrying to and fro little knots of persons assembling in the street speaking in anxious whispers or hastening in silence to their homes ever and anon the muffled tone of heavy bells came borne on the air and then the dead silence ever the shapeless herald of some dread calamity ere night all trace of the mornings glittering splendour and animated life had disappeared and paris seemed changed into a very desert of solitude and gloom ii eleven days had passed since the sudden termination of the fatal tournament and henri of france still lay speechless and insensible as he had fallen in the lists when from the insecure fastening of his helmet it had given way before the lance of montgomeri and caused him to receive the full force of the blow on his eyebrow thence fatally injuring the brain still life was not extinct and though against all reason hopes were still entertained by many for his eventual recovery in one of the apartments of the louvre forming the suite of the queen dauphine sat the unfortunate comte de montgomeri and his betrothed bride sometimes sanguine that henri would nay must recover at others plunged in the depth of despairhad been the alternate moods of the count during these eleven days his friends conjured him to lose no time in retiring from france at least for a time and idalie herself though she shrunk from the idea of parting with an indefinable feeling of foreboding dread yet so trembled for his safety if he remained as to add her solicitations to those of others still the count lingered the very thought of his having been the ill fated hand to give the death blow to the monarch he revered and the friend he loved was too horrible to be realized he could not believe that such would be yet so dark was his despair so agonizing his self accusations that even his interviews with idalie had lost their soothing sweetness and he did but deplore that her pure love had been given to one so darkly fated as himself it was after one of these bursts of misery that the comte de montemar who had been engaged with papers at the further end of the apartment approached and sought to comfort him by an appeal to those holier feelings which montgomeri possessed in a much higher degree than most of his countrymen it is not well my friend de montemar said to poison thus the brief moments we may yet pass together remember thou wert no willing agent of that higher power by whose mandate alone it was that our monarch fell all may seem dark yet even out of darkness he brought forth lightout of a very chaos the most unwavering order and does he not do so still abide by the advice of those who urge thee to quit france till order is restored and our gracious sovereigns last words remembered and acted upon italian blood is hot and eager to avenge but fear not we shall meet again in happier days and oh embitter not thus the few moments still left my poor child softened and subdued more than he had been yet montgomeri folded his arm round the weeping idalie kissed the tears from her pale cheek conjured her forgiveness and promised to battle with the despondency that almost crushed him and wilt thou indeed do this she rejoined imploringly oh bless thee for such promise yet i fear thee montgomeri and when apart from me and these troubled thoughts regain ascendency thou wilt rush on danger on death to escape them think then dearest that it is not your own life alone which you risk that one is bound up in it which cannot rest alone will the ivy blossom and smile when the oak has fallen and as the oak is to the lowly yet clinging ivy so art thou to me folding her still closer montgomeri in his turn sought to reassure and soothe but with less success than usual every look and tone of idalie betrayed that heavy weight which had increased with each day that brought the hour of parting nearer breathed to none and battled with as it had been still it seemed to hold every faculty chained and at length caused her head to sink on the bosom of de lorges with such a burst of irrepressible anguish as to excite his alarm and tenderly he conjured her to reveal its cause i know it is a weakness a folly gabriel unworthy of the woman whom thou lovest but scorn it not upbraid it not bid it go from me is there not woe enough in parting that before the hope of meeting ever rises a dim and shapeless darkness impossible to be defined yet so folding round my future as to bury all of hope of trust of every feeling save that we shall not meet as we have parted is it change in me thou fearest love no then heed it not tis but a baseless fancy which will come when the frame is weakened by the anguish of the mind believe me he was interrupted the hangings over the door leading by a private passage to the dauphines own rooms were suddenly drawn aside and closely muffled mary of scotland stood before them with anxiety and haste visibly imprinted on her features this is no time for ceremony my lord or we would apologize for our intrusion she said turning towards the count de montemar our business is too weighty for an indifferent messenger count de lorges she added addressing him abruptly and pausing not for montemars courtly words tarry not another night in paris you have been unwise to loiter here so long pause for no thought no marvel fly at once put the broad seas between you and france and there may be happiness in store for you yet dearest idalie for thy sake even as for montgomeris i am here do not look upon me thus now must we partnow your highness means not now exclaimed idalie as her cold hands convulsively closed round the counts arm what has he done that he should fly nothing to call the blush of shame to his cheek or thine dear child the words i have heard may mean nothing may be but wrung from womans agony for the grief of catherine de medicis is of no softening nature yet ought montgomeri to leave paris without delay for there may be some to act on broken words even as on an imperial mandate detain him not idalie we shall visit scotland perchance ere long and there no grief shall damp a bridal stay but one moment more royal lady entreated de lorges as the dauphine turned to go one word for mercy how fares the king is there no more hope does he still lay as he has done ever since that fatal stroke mary looked at him somewhat surprised and very sorrowfully no montgomeri no she said after a pause of much feeling the soul has escaped the shattered prison and henri is at rest montgomeri staggered back with a heavy almost convulsive groan he knew not till that moment how powerfully hope had sustained him the shock was almost as fearful as if he had never thought of death and yet the horrible conviction that he was a regicide had scarcely for one instant left his mind montemar let not this be for the sake of thy poor child of both part them ere long whispered the queen dauphine no more as the count knelt before her in involuntary homage think not of us now would to god we were still dauphine of france and not her queen montgomeris danger i fear is imminent let him not linger and may our lady guard him still she departed as she spoke and montemar infected with her evident anxiety hesitated not to obey rouse thee montgomeri he said earnestly fly for the sake of this poor drooping flower let not our idalie weep for a darker doom than even this sad parting come to thy fathers heart awhile my child have i no claim upon thy love gently he drew her from montgomeris still detaining arm almost relieved to find her insensible to any further suffering his beseeching words to fly ere idalie again awoke to consciousness moved the count to action still he lingered to kiss again and again the pale cheek and lips of his beloved then convulsively wringing the counts hand rushed from the room and from the palace at the very moment that voices shouted long live francis the second god preserve the king iii eighteen months had passed and still was the count de montgomeri an exile from his country and so virulent was catherine against him so determinately forgetful of henris last words absolving the count of all intentional evil whatever might ensue that even his best friends dared not wish him back for idalie this interval was indeed heavy with anxiety and sorrow and all the bitter sickness of hope deferred no doubt of his affection ever entered her heart she knew him fond and faithful as herself but there seemed no end no term to the long long interval of absence her future was bounded by the hour of meeting and a very void of interest and hope and pleasure seemed the space which stretched between yet for her fathers sake her ever unselfish nature struggled with the stagnating gloom the court was loathsome to them both for even the friendship of the young queen could not remove from idalie the horror which catherine de medicis inspired in the chateau de montemar then these eighteen months had mostly been passed and idalie compelled herself to seek and feel interest in the families of her fathers vassals and in the many lessons of feudal government and policy which as the heiress of all his large estates and of his proud unsullied name her father delighted to pour into her heart one other subject engrossed the count de montemar and of which he spoke so often and so solemnly to his daughter that his feelings on the subject became hers it was the wide spreading over france of the new religion deemed by all orthodox catholics as a heresy which if not checked would entirely subvert and destroy their ancient faith and in consequence bring incalculable mischief to the country both temporally and spiritually de montemar was no bigot looking only to violent measures for the extermination of this far spreading evil but it grieved and affected him in no common degree he spent hours and hours with his confessor and his daughter in commune on this one engrossing subject and from the sincere and earnest lessons of the priest a true and zealous though humble follower of his own church he became more and more convinced of the truth of the olden creed and what he deemed the foul and awful apostasy of the new yet no violence of party spirit mingled in these discussions and therefore it was that idalie felt the conviction of the truth and beauty of her long cherished religion sink into her soul like balm saddened by her individual sorrow shrinking in consequence from all the exciting amusements then reigning in france her fathers favourite subject became equally a resource and comfort to her thus unconsciously fitting her for the martyr part which she was only too soon called upon to play the count de montemar had been a soldier from his youth and was still suffering from the serious wounds received in his last campaign within the last three months he had gradually become weaker and weaker till at length idalie watched beside the couch from which she had been told that her beloved and loving parent would never rise again she had heard it with an agony of sorrow which it was long ere the kindly sympathy of the benevolent priest and of her cousin louis could in any degree assuage motherless from early childhood a more than common tie bound her to her father and so deep was the darkness which those cruel tidings seemed to gather round her that even love itself succumbed beneath it and the strange wild yearning rose that she too might flee away and be at rest unable to endure any longer these sad thoughts idalie arose from the seat where she had kept vigil for many weary nights and days and looked forth upon the night the moon was at the full and shed such clear and silvery light around that even the rugged crags and stunted pines seemed softened into beauty the vale beneath slumbered in shadow save where here and there a solitary tree stood forth seemingly bathed in liquid silver sweet odours from the flowers of the night lingered on the breeze and the rippling gush of a streamlet reflecting every star and ray upon its bosom was the only sound that broke the silence the holy calm of nature touched a responding chord in the heart of the watcher and even grief felt for the moment stilled a few minutes afterwards the voice of the count recalled her to his side is it a fancy or was louis here but now my child he asked feebly is he from the court and did he not bring news wherefore came he because he heard that i was in sorrow my dear father and he sought as he ever does to soothe or at least to share it bless him for his faithful love he has in truth been to me a son and will be to thee a brother mine own love but tell me is it indeed truth or have my thoughts again wandered has my young sovereign gone before me to the grave alas my father tis even so an expression of deep sorrow escaped the lips of the dying man and for several minutes he was silent when again he spoke his voice was firmer idalie my child i shall soon follow my royal master and it is well for the regency of catherine de medicis can bring with it but misery listen to me beloved one i leave thee sole heiress of our olden heritage of a glorious name which from age to age hath descended in a line so pure so stainless that the name of de montemar hath become a very proverb for all honourable and knightly deeds there have been times when daughters not sons succeeded and yet did its lustre not diminish nor its power decrease thou knowest this my child i know not wherefore i recall it now dost thou doubt me father replied idalie sadly and somewhat reproachfully thinkest thou my heart is so engrossed with selfish sorrows that i feel no pride no love for mine ancient race that its glory and its power shall decrease with me no no my noble child forgive me i have pained thee yet i meant it not pausing a moment he continued hurriedly idalie our faith our blessed faith is tottering falling in this land each month each week the heretics gain ground nor will all the bloody acts of catherine and the princes of guise arrest their progress were health and life renewed i would neither raise sword nor kindle brand for their destruction but my whole soul trembles for my native land idalie my child i know thy heart beats true as mine to our ancient creed i know thou wilt never turn aside thyself from the one true path but oh for thy dead fathers sake let not a heretic be master of these fair lands and tempt thy vassals to embrace his soul destroying creed thou wilt not wed with heresy my child never my father i can pity and pray for these misguided ones but never shall my hand be given to one unfaithful to his god yet wherefore this fear am i not the plighted bride of one who would rather die than lead me astray or turn aside himself the fading eyes of the dying lit suddenly up with feverish radiance his cheek burned and his mind evidently so far wandered as to prevent either his hearing or understanding his daughters last words and thou wilt promise this he said in a voice at once alarmingly hollow yet strangely excited thou wilt solemnly promise never to give thyself and thy fair heritage to the heretic thou wilt not let the foul spot blacken our noble line promise me this my child alarmed at the change in his appearance and convinced that montgomeri who when he left her had been as true and zealous a catholic as herself was not of a nature to change idalie knelt down beside the couch and in distinct and solemn accents made the vow required the count de montemar raised himself with sudden strength and laid both his hands on the bent head of his child now blessings blessings on thee for this my sainted one he said distinctly thou hast removed all doubt all fear death has no terror now no sting gods blessing be upon thee love and give his voice sunk but his lips still warmly pressed her brow and minutes thus passed a cloud had come before the moon and when her light broke forth again idalie knelt by the couch of the dead iv idalie de montemar was not long permitted to indulge her grief in solitude scarcely two months after her loss an express arrived from paris and she was compelled to prepare her chateau and vassals for the reception of the young king the queen mother and court who in their progress to the south passed through auvergne idalie roused herself from the sorrow which weighed so heavily on her spirits although chivalry had lost much of the enthusiasm and warmth which had characterised it not half a century previous its memory still lingered in the minds of men and something of this feeling actuated the men of montemar as they looked on their youthful countess shrinking and timid as she had been while her parent lived a new spirit now seemed her own and it was with all the proud consciousness that she was now sole representative of one of the most ancient and most noble families of france that idalie de montemar at the head of her loyal vassals received her royal guests and knelt in homage to the youthful charles but amid all that royal group only one had power over the heart of idalie and she grieved to see the saddened brow and anxious glance which had usurped the place of the radiant smiles and sparkling eye which had never before failed to beam forth from the lovely countenance of mary queen of scots robed so completely in white the costume of royal widows as to receive the designation of la reine blanche her beauty rather increased than diminished by its softened tone she was to many an object of still deeper interest now than she had been hitherto but it was very soon evident to idalie that the petty mortifications springing from rooted envy and dislike to which she was daily almost hourly subjected by catherine were poisoning all youthful enjoyment and that even while she clave with her whole soul to france she felt it must not be her home much longer feeling deeply as she did that it was to marys faithful friendship her betrothed husband owed his life idalies high spirit rose indignant at this treatment that the marked respect with which she treated her the constant deference to her wishes during the royal sojourn exposed her to catherines fatal malice she cared not for soothed by her affection roused to a sense of her own dignity as sovereign of scotland if no longer of france it was during her sojourn at the chateau de montemar mary resolved on her return to her native land and by earnest persuasions prevailed on the young countess to sue for the royal permission to accompany her it was granted ungraciously enough for her engagement with the count de montgomeri was known and the hatred borne by catherine de medicis towards that unfortunate nobleman had in no way diminished by time will the good count gabriel de lorges accompany his young bride on her return know ye my lords if so we will give him welcome the queen mother soon after inquired in the hearing of idalie and in a voice so peculiarly sweet and gracious as to cause the countesss heart for the moment to bound up with sudden hope of his permitted even welcomed return and then as suddenly sink down she knew not wherefore save that catherines deadliest purposes ever breathed through smiles a few months after her visit to the chateau mary quitted france attended by idalie de montemar and some other youthful friends to whom she clung as the sole memories left her of that beautiful and happy land which her foreboding spirit whispered she should never look on more intent on soothing the grief of her royal friend idalie had but little time to think of her own feelings but when she did seek to define them she became conscious that they were not all joy again did the same dim shadow envelope every thought every hope directed towards the hour of meeting every day that brought it nearer seemed to throw a chilling weight on her hearts ecstatic bound her very love felt too intense too twined with her being to find rest even in the thought of looking on him listening to him again she strove with the baseless shadow but it clung pertinaciously to every mental image and weighed upon her spirits like lead scotland was reached at last the heavy pomp and ceremony attending the sovereigns landing and progress to holyrood at length at an end and idalie had retired to the chamber appointed for the use of herself and suite seeking calmness and rest from the opposing emotions at one and the same time engrossing her why should she not be joyful the morrow montgomeri would be at her side once more and all unchanged to her not a doubt had stolen on the bright vision of his love not a shade darkened the pure thoughts of his constancywhat then did she dread a summons to the chamber of the queen startled her for she had been dismissed she thought for the night hastily obeying she ran lightly along the private gallery pointed out as her nearest way and without pausing drew aside the arras and entered a cry of astonishment of bliss at the same moment escaped her lips and clasped to the heart of the count de montgomeri all darkness and dread faded for the time in a burst of happy tears upon his bosom v nay chide me not that my cheek is paler than when we parted dearest said idalie after long and earnest commune as they sat together the following day in an olden chamber of holyrood far removed from the sovereign and the court thou too art changed and if in thee a soldier and a man absence can have wrought furrows on thy brow pallor on thy cheek and even touched thy hair with grey is it strange that i a poor weak girl should suffer too i scarce had loved thee gabriel had there been no change i would not have taxed thy love even had it left less touching impress on thy cheek replied the count but for me harsh storms and ruffled thoughts have joined with the yearning thoughts for thee to make me as thou seest why look upon me thus canst doubt me dearest oh no no thy love is not changed save that it may be dearer still but thine eyes looked not thus the day we parted there are deeper sterner feelings in thy soul than heretofore the change is there the storms of which thou speakest have not been outward onlyglory ambition love are not the sole occupants of thy spirit now and what if thou hast read aright sweet one wilt thou not love thy soldier still oh yes for nought could enter the heart of de lorges his idalie may not revere but tell me these inward stormswhy is thy look save when it is turned on me so strangely stern it was not always thus call it not stern my love tis but the shadow of my spirits change i did not think thou wouldst so soon have marked it yet tis not sternness or if it be tis only towards myself when we parted dearest i lived for earth and earthly things but with sorrow came thoughts of that higher world which must banish the idle smile and idler jest tis thus that i am changed and is this all faltered idalie looking fearfully in his face is this enough to cause the struggle of which thy cheek and brow bear such true witness the thought of heaven brings with it but balm and restnot strife and pain gabriel this is not all it is not all my own i would not have a thought concealed from thee and yet i pause fearing to give thee pain listen to me beloved one and oh believe montgomeri would not lightly turn aside from the path his fathers trod yet hadst thou seen as i have the gross crimes the awful passions which have crept into the bosom of our holy church the fearful darkness of ignorance and bigotry over spreading the pure light marking the path of jesus thou wouldst feel with me and acknowledge that i could not think of god and heaven and yet be other than i am idalie speak to me wherefore art thou thus he ceased in terror her features had become contracted her lip and check blanched almost as death her large eyes distended in their terrible gaze upon himself and the hands which had convulsively closed on his were cold and rigid as stone it cannot cannot be she murmured in a low shuddering tone montgomeri could not be other than true no no why will you speak thus love she added somewhat less unnaturally what can such strange words mean save that thy sword like my fathers will never be unsheathed in persecuting warsanswer me gabriel is it not so alas my love i may not rest in quiet when the weapon of every true man is needed to protect the creed which conviction has embraced in these dark times this badge of protestantism and the sword of defence must ever be raised together idalie the world may term me heretic but thou thou art no heretic no noit cannot be burst from the wrung heart of idalie as she wildly sprang from his embrace montgomeri thou art deceiving methou wouldst try the love i bear thee oh not thus not thus say thou art no heretic thou art still the man my father loved trusted blessed him to whom he gave his child speak to me answer mebut one word i will i will mine own let me but see thee calm am i not thine own art thou not mine come to my heart sweet one thou wilt find no change towards thee answer me she reiterated gabriel thou hast not answered by the love thou bearest me by the vow unto my fatherto love and cherish me till deathby thine own truthi charge thee answer me thou art no heretic if to raise my voice against the gross abuses fostered by the pope and his pampered minions in every land to deny to them all allegiance to refuse all belief in the intervention of saints and martyrs or that absolution bought and sold can bring pardon and peace if to read and believe the holy scriptures and follow as they teachif this is to be a heretic idalie even for thy dear sake i may not deny it yes dearest i am a heretic in all save love for thee a low despairing cry broke from those blanched lips and idalie fell forward at his feet it seemed long ere montgomeri could restore her to life though he used a tenderness and skill strange in a rough warrior like himself but no fond look returned his anxious gaze she struggled to withdraw herself from his embrace but the tone of reproachful agony with which he pronounced her name rendered the struggle vain and clinging to him she sobbed i thought not of this dreamed not of this even in the dark foreboding haze clinging round the hour of meeting gabriel in mercy leave me or i shall forget my vow and hurl down on me the wrath of the dead leave theevowwrath of the dead he repeated oh do not talk so wildly love reproach upbraid me as thou wilt but tell me not to leave thee wherefore should we part gabriel it must be i have no strength when i gaze on thee let not perjury darken this deep misery leave me perjury what hast thou sworn demanded montgomeri hoarse and choked with strong emotion never to wed with heresy to retain the faith of my ancestors pure and unsullied as i received it my father from his bed of death demanded this vow and i pledged it unhesitatingly for could i doubt thee she had spoken with unnatural composure but there was such a sudden and agonized change on the features of the count that it not only banished calmness but reawakened hope oh say thou wert deceiving me gabriel dearest gabriel have i not judged thee wrongly that still we may pray together as we have prayed thou hast not turned aside from our old and sainted creed say but this grief is causeless that i may still love thee without sin that there is no need to part part he passionately exclaimed and from thee oh no no then thou art in truth no heretic it has all been a dark and terrible dream and we shall be happy yet love she answered in a voice of such trusting joyance that montgomeri started from her side and hurriedly paced the room she laid her hand gently on his arm and looked up confidingly in his face but its expression was enough shrinking from him she implored gabriel gabriel look not on me thus or that fearful dream will come again would would to god it were a dream he exclaimed and his hands clasped both hers with convulsive pressure idalie i am no catholic i dare not again kneel as i have knelt or pray as i have prayed no not even to retain thy precious love to claim thee minethee dearer than life than happiness than all save eternityi dare not deny my faith but oh is there no other way can it be that for this a firm conviction of truth an honest avowal of that which my soul believes for this that we must part idalie canst thou sentence me to this i have sworn she said her white lips quivering with the effort my vow is registered in heavensworn unto the dead by death only to be absolved to retain the line of montemar unsullied in its ancient faith idalie oh hear me let me plead now give to louis de montemar the government of thine ancestral lands the control of thy vassals thou shalt seek them when thou wilt unaccompanied by thy husband unshackled by his counsels i ask but for thee and here far removed from the blood and misery deluging unhappy france we may live for each other still may not this be love and yet thy vow remain unbroken montgomeri it may not be she said in a low yet collected tone for it seemed as if the noble spirit of her race returned to give her strength for that harrowing hour tempt me not by such words as thesethe love i bear thee is trial all sufficient my oath was pledged that i would never wed with heresynever give my hand to one unfaithful to our old and sainted creed perchance that oath alone may save me from a like perdition and if so then is it well and doth thou scorn me for thisdespise and loathe me oh idalie thou knowest not all i have endured in mercy add not to the anguish of this hour by scorn of the change which imperious conscience alone had power to impel scorn thee montgomeri no if thou the good the wise can thus decide and so find peace is it for me to judge thee harshly no idalie can never blame thee gabriel he caught her to his heart and she resisted not the impassionate kisses he pressed on check and brow she felt his hot tears fall fast upon her face for in that suffering hour it was the iron souled warrior that wept not the pale slight girl he held this must not be beloved she whispered in low soothing tones montgomeri my noble lovefor in this last hour i may still call thee sooh rouse thee from this womans weakness this is no mood for thee thou must forget me gabriel or so think of me as to be once again the brave the high souled warrior thou hast ever been for my sake rouse thee love the god we part to serve will hear my prayers and bless thee and thou burst passionately from the lips of the count oh what shall comfort thee and fill for thee the void of everlasting absence in the rush of battle the warrior may find forgetfulness in death but no no not death gabriel for my sake live though not for me add not this pang to a heart already tried enough promise me to live and for me leave me to my god montgomeri and he will give me peace he could not answer and minutesmany minutesrolled away and neither moved from the detaining arms of the other fortunately perhaps for both a page entered with a summons to the count from the queen idalie lifted up her head and while her very blood seemed turned to ice a smile circled that pale lip thou must leave me dearest mary loves not to wait indulgent as she is but we shall meet again sweet love there was no answer but montgomeri would not understand that silence he strained her once more to his heart and turned away another minute the arras fell and he was gone idalie made one bound forward as if to detain him and with a low shuddering cry dropped senseless on the ground vi it was in a lordly chamber of the chateau de montemar about three months after the event narrated in our last chapter that the only remaining scions of that noble house were seated in earnest and evidently sorrowful converse the beams of the sun rendered gorgeous by the richly stained glass of the antique windows through which they passed fantastically tinged the oaken floor and walls the furniture was of ebony inlaid with silver interspersed with couches and cushions of tapestry ancient as the days of matilda of flanders which though somewhat heavy in themselves accorded well with the aspect of solemn grandeur pervading the whole apartment do not refuse me louis pleaded idalie after a long and painful discussion relative to her papers and parchments which strewed the table had passed between them do not thus entreat me to retain my heritage is a broken heart a sinking frame fit chief for montemar i have borne much suffered much sought even the court of charles which my whole soul loathes to obtain the transferment to thee of all my earthly possessions and now do not refuse to relieve me of their heavy charge but only wait awhile sweet cousin he replied sorrow has had as yet no time to expend its force do not act so soon on the resolution of a moments agony wait but one brief year and think well on all you would resign has earth no spell to fright away thy purpose none it is but the casket whence the jewel has departed nay more it is filled with hopes i dare not hope and thoughts i dare not think i would fly from these and will a convent aid thee so to do i know not yet there at least temptation which i have no strength to meet will not assail me more no strength to meet dearest idalie the martyr at the stake might envy thee thy strength not now louis it has all gone from me and for the first time her voice quivered and she buried her face in her clasped hands a fierce malediction on montgomeri was bursting from the lips of louis as he looked on the faded form and seemed to feel for the first time the full extent of his cousins agony young buoyant and ever joyous himself idalies perfect calmness since her return had deceived him but the tone in which those few words were said strangely and suddenly revealed the whole and the young mans whole heart spoke in his half uttered curse no no curse him not louis passionately implored idalie promise me by the sweet memories of our childhood still to be his friend in these awful times when the poisoned draught and midnight dagger are ever near these persecuted men be near him to warn shield save i will i will for thy sweet sake he replied earnestly yet why fear such danger for him he never will be rash enough to return to france louis he is even now in france and therefore is it i so conjure you to be his friend he is here may be near me still even as he hovered close beside me in my passage home he thought to be unknown even to me me whom he was there to guard protect to the last speaking not one word to betray himself or give me again the torture of farewell i knew him close beside me i heard the disguised accents of his voice and yet we were as if the grave had parted us oh louis louis the strength which then upheld me has departed from me i dare not look upon his face and listen to his voice again only the convent walls can shield me from a broken vow a dead fathers curse and wilt thou keep me from their refuge no no relieve me from this fearful heritage and let me be at peace one week after louis de montemar had been acknowledged by all the vassals of his cousin as their suzerain or feudal lord to whom and to his heirs they had sworn undying allegiance idalie stood within the convent church of our lady of montemar preparing to take those awful vows which severed her from earth and all its cares and joys and hopes and woes for ever it was midnight but the large waxen tapers burning on the high altar and many shrines completely illuminated the main body of the church while the deep shadows of the aisles and more distant arches of the nave heightened the effect of light and rendered the building larger in appearance than in reality clouds of incense floated on the air from the rich silver censers held by six beautiful boys clothed in white standing on either side the altar behind and exquisitely illuminated by a peculiarly softened light falling full upon it hung a picture of the saviour kneeling in the garden of gethsemane his countenance powerfully expressive of the words nevertheless not what i will but what thou wilt the church was crowded in the nave and aisles the choir and chancel being left for the relations of the novice and those of higher rank as idalie had but few of the former and had particularly wished the ceremony to be as private as possible these parts of the building were comparatively unoccupied except by monks and priests clothed with unwonted gorgeousness idalie stood beside the altar a rich robe of grey genoa velvet descended to her feet sweeping the marble ground in heavy folds girded round the waist with a broad belt of large rubies and opals glittering stars of the same clasped down the stomacher and looped the wide sleeve of richest lace and braids of diamonds glistened in the dark tresses of her hair and sparkled on the high pure brow which marble pale seemed all unfitted for their weight her eyes were raised her lips slightly parted her thin white hands crossed upon her bosom as in the heartfelt utterance of voiceless prayer silence deep as the grave had succeeded the priests prayer lasting but a moment for idalie sinking noiselessly on the ground the black pall was thrown over her and the distant discharge of cannon mingled with the muffled toll of the convent bell proclaimed far and near that idalie de montemar was now an inmate of the tomb a groan so deep and hollow at that instant reverberated through the building that all present started and shudderingly drew nearer each other unable to trace whence or from whom it came until a tall shrouded figure was discovered leaning against one of the pillars supporting the arched roof of the choir his face was buried in his cloak but he was seen to shiver as by some rudely passing wind the organ swelled forth in thrilling tones the requiem for the dead sweet childish voices prolonged the solemn strain till it faded softer and softer in the distance swelling falling then dying all away removing the pall the priests waited for idalie to rise and kneel before the altar that the ceremony might continue they waited but there was no movement she lay even as she had fallen a cry of terror burst from the aged priest and at the same instant heedless of the personal danger inseparable from discovery bareheaded and unshroudedheedless of all save one agonizing feargabriel de lorges rushed forward and knelt beside her idalie loveliest dearest speak to me answer me say that i have not murdered thee answer me in mercy but one word he spoke in vain louis de montemar priests and many others crowded round him they sought to withdraw her from montgomeris convulsive hold to wake her from the seeming trance but all was useless she had passed to heaven in that music swell the broken hearted was at rest footnote the after fate of the unfortunate but guiltless regicide belongs to history lady greshams fte a tale of the day it was near the end of may beautiful may that month of strange contrarieties in our lovely land in the haunts of nature robed with such gorgeous beauty bringing such a lavish garniture of tree and shrub and flowers such fresh and dewy mornings such glorious sunsets and those soft sweet hours of twilight so fraught with spiritual musings and those lovely nights when the mind loses itself in the infinitude of thought in the vain yearning to grasp something beyond our present being in itself evidence of immortality in the city in the proud metropolis seat of empire and wealth fashion and beauty luxury and pleasure crime and famine misery and desolation clothed as may still is with her natural beauty we know her not save as the season and in that word what a host of thoughts spring upenjoyment luxury ftes balls dinners these were once and but a few years back its sole association but now a mighty spirit is abroad and over the festal halls a dim cloud is hovering breathing of oppression born in that very thoughtless joyance through the gay music the silvery laugh the murmur of glad voicesaye through every tone that tells of luxurious pleasure onlya thrilling cry is sounding the voice of suffering thousands claiming brotherhood with joy demanding a portion of that which a beneficent father ordained for allrest recreation homes in the drawing room of one of the smaller mansions of the aristocratic west a young lady was sitting near an open window inhaling the delicious scent of the beautiful flowers which filled the balcony in such profusion that shaded in the background as they were by the magnificent trees of the park they looked as if the goddess may had brought a garden from her most sylvan haunts to mark her presence even there lucy neville the sole inmate of this pleasant room was neither very young nor very beautiful yet she had charms enough to occasion some degree of wonderment that she should have passed through four london seasons and attained the venerable age of three and twenty and was lucy neville still she had the advantage of mingling with some of the most highly gifted and most learned patriots of the age for her brother lord valery of whose house she was sole mistress was one of the most influential men of his day she went into society also continually and altogether it was a constant marvel to all those who had nothing to do but to talk of their neighbours why she had never married lucy neville might not have had regular beauty but she had something bettershe had mind and a heart so full of good and kindly feeling that she was an exception to the general idea that we must know sorrow ourselves before we can feel for others she was indeed only just putting off mourning for a young and darling brother but she had begun to think years before that and the six months of quietude had only deepened not created the principles on which she acted visitors so late why it is just six oclock passed through her mind as a loud impetuous ring announced a carriage and a party of young ladies of ultra fashionable exterior hurried into the drawing room all talking at once and of something so very delightful that miss neville had great difficulty in comprehending their meaning now lucy dont look so bewildered you are quick enough at comprehension sometimes and i really want you to understand me with a word now for i am in a terrible hurry i ought to have come to you by eleven this morning but really this short invitation has given me so many things to think about i could not but what am i to understand charlotte replied miss neville laughing so good humouredly that it was difficult to discover why those of her own age and standing so often kept aloof from her as having so little in common lauramaryhave pity on my obtuseness why lady greshams long talked of fte is fixed at last and of course you will go your invitation was enclosed in mammas last night absolutely her ladyship condescends to entreat her to introduce you i cannot imagine the reason of this sudden empressementshe could have visited you long ago had she wished it she did wish it individually i believe but an unfortunate misunderstanding between her brother and mine prevented it edward has long wished the estrangement to cease so i shall be very happy to meet her half way and accept the invitation when is it next monday monday why to day is friday you must mean monday week indeed i do not how she will manage i cannot tell except that when people have more wealth than they know what to do with they can do what they please her villa at richmond too is just the place for a fte champtre and the novel shortness of the invitation and being the day before a drawing room will crowd her rooms depend upon it it is something unusually exciting the very bustle of the thing but i thought it was not to be until until herbert gresham returned nor will it he arrives to morrow night or some time on sunday quite suddenly not having been expected for several weeks yet what with his foreign honours his promised baronetcy and last not least his distinguished appearance he will be sought and fted by all the money loving mammas and husband seeking daughters for the remainder of the season the worst of its being a fte champtre is that we must have complete new dresses rejoined laura and how to coax papa for the necessary help i know not my last quarter was all gone before i received it and my debts actually frighten me but what is to be done go i must and then the shortness of the notice continued mary really lady gresham might have given us more time who can decide what to wear or even what colour in three days come lucy decide but of course you will go exclaimed charlotte impatiently it will be your first appearance in public this season and so you can have nothing to think about in the way of expense nothing but the trouble of seeing about a new dress which will prevent my going much as i might wish it replied miss neville very quietly though the faint tinge rising to her cheek and the quiver of the lip might have betrayed some degree of internal emotion prevent your going what can you possibly mean exclaimed her guests together that as it is now six oclock on friday and you tell me lady greshams fte is three oclock on monday i have not sufficient time to procure all i want for having been so long in mourning i have literally nothing that will do without breaking a resolution and sacrificing a principle which i do not feel at all inclined to do sacrificing a principle lucy you are perfectly ridiculous what has principle to do with a fte champtre your head is turned with the stupid cant of oppressing and the people as if we had not annoyances and vexations and pressure too when we want more money than we happen to have and as for time what is to prevent your sending to mrs smith to night by the bye how can you employ an english artiste and get all you want by ten oclock on monday morning why i cannot even give an order till after the post comes in to morrow i must wait to know what was worn at the duchesse de nemours fte champtre the other day one feels just out of the ark in england and i am sure i cannot decide what to wear till then languidly remarked mary and as for me i am in a worse predicament than either of you laughed laura but her laugh was not a gay one raise the wind i must but it requires time to think how we have no space to follow this conversation further persuasions reproaches and taunts assailed miss neville on all sides but she did not waver charlotte left her in high dudgeon mary marvelled at her unfortunate delusion quite convinced that she was on the verge of insanity and laura wishing that she could be but as firm not that she comprehended or allowed the necessity of the principle on which she acted but only as it would save her the disagreeable task of thinking how to get the necessary costume when both modiste and jeweller had refused to trust her any more for nearly half an hour lucy remained sitting where her visitors had left her her hands pressed on her eyes and her whole posture denoting a painful intensity of thought herbert gresham returning his mothers unexpected and pressing invitation could it be that the bar between the families was indeed so entirely removed that she might hope as she had never dared hope before sir sydneys hatred to her brother from some political opposition had been such it was whispered at the time that he had obtained his nephew some honourable appointment abroad only because he feared that he not only loved lucy but leaned towards lord valerys political opinions four years had passed since then and herbert gresham was no longer a cipher in anothers hands he had formed his own principles marked out his own course and lucy heard his name so often and so admiringly from her brothers lips that the dream of her first season could not pass away strive against it as she might for she knew not whether she claimed more than a passing thought from him who held her being so enchained and now he was returning and to the fte to welcome him she was invited with such an evident desire for her presence that her heart bounded beneath the thronging fancies that would come seeming to whisper it was at his instigation and why could she not go was it not indeed a quixotic and uncalled for sacrifice how could the resolution of one feeble individual aid in removing the heavy pressure of over work from the thousands of her fellow creatures there was time full time for all she required if she saw about it at once it was but adding an atom to the weight of oppression which whether added or withheld could be of no moment and surely surely for such a temptation there was enough excuse how would herbert construe her absence if indeed it was at his wish the invitation came why might she not lucy seven oclock and not ready for dinner why what are you so engrossed about exclaimed her brother half jestingly half anxiously the latter feeling prevailing as she hastily looked up a few a very few words and he understood it all and yet i know even under such circumstances you will not fail he said and how powerful is the voice of affectionate confidence in the dangerous moment of hesitation between right and wrong you may indeed be but one where there needs the aid of hundreds but if all hold back because they are but one how shall we gain the necessary muster to check this thoughtless waste of human life this in many unconscious crushing of all that makes existence is womans work man may legislate may theorise but he looks to his female relatives for its practical fulfilment dearest do you choose the right and trust me useless as the sacrifice now seems you will yet thank god that it was made lady greshams fte was brilliant recherchcrowded as anticipated the weather was lovely the gardens magnificent the arrangements in the best taste that an ultra fashionist of some thirty years experience could devise youth beauty rank wealth all were there and the female portion set off to the best advantage by an elegance of costume and an extreme carefulness of attire without which all knew an entrance into lady greshams select coterie could never be obtained a despot in the empire of dress and appearance she little knew and still less cared for all the petty miseries alas that such a word should be spoken in the same breath with dress which her invitations usually excited the resolve to outviethe utter carelessness of expenditure while the excitement lastedthe depression almost despair at the accumulated debts which followedthe rivalry of a first fashionthe petty manuvres not to give a hint of the intended costume and the equally petty manuvres to discover itthe mortification when after all the lavish expense all the mysteries others appeared more fashionable more recherchthe disgust with which in consequence the previously considered perfect dress was henceforth regardedthese and a hundred other similar emotions had been during the season called forth again and again and in beings destined for immortality was it marvel they had no thought for other than themselves that this fte was in commemoration of herbert greshams return and that he was present the hero of the day not a little increased its excitement and importance but he moved amongst his mothers guests with native and winning courtesy indeed but as if his mind were engrossed with other and deeper things in the four years of his absence many changes powerful in themselves but still only invisibly working had taken place in the political aspect of his country by means of private correspondence with the most influential men of the day and through the public journals he had felt the deepest interest in these changes and from the very fact of his looking on from a distance and not mingling with the contending waves of party he had formed clearer views concerning them than many on the spot he had returned determined to devote the whole energies of his powerful mind to removing invisible oppression so lessening labour that mind might resume her supremacy and create for every position its own immortal joys he was no leveller of ranks no believer in that vain dream equality he had travelled and thought much and felt to his hearts core the superiority of england as a nation both for constitution and morality but this conviction instead of blinding him to her faults quickened his perceptions not only regarding the evils but their causes and increased the intensity of his desire to remove them it was not however only the habitude of thought which on this occasion had given him a look of abstraction he was disappointed his mother had told him that in compliance with his desire all foolish coolness between his family and that of lord valery should ceaseshe had condescended to make advances to miss neville which were coldly rejected she did not tell him that these advances had been merely an invitation to her fte of whose sudden arrangement herbert was himself unconscious and did not know herself and certainly would never have imagined the real reason of lucys refusal before the day closed however her son was destined to be enlightened he was standing near a group of very gay young ladies and gentlemen conversing at first on grave topics with a friend when his quick ear was irresistibly attracted by the mention of miss nevilles name coupled with much satirical laughter she will become a second mrs fry depend upon it was the observation of one i should not be at all surprised that at last we shall find her making pilgrimages through the streets of london to see if all the shops are closed at a certain hour and the released apprentices properly employed she should set up an evening school for drapers assistants and milliners apprentices why dont you propose it to her miss balfour charlotte whose superb parisian costume gave her the triumph of being almost universally envied laughed and declared it was too much trouble you stand in rather too much awe of both her and lord valery was her brothers rejoinder it is a pity though that miss neville has imbibed such outr notions otherwise she would be a nice girl enough and did she really refuse to come only because the notice was too short for her to get a proper costume without injuring or oppressingas the cant of the day has itthe poor milliners how perfectly ridiculous i am sure the artistes who come for our orders are in the finest condition both as to health and wealth and the shopmenthey are sleek gay care nothing looking fellows as for their needing greater rest more recreation opportunities to cultivate the mind one has only to look at them to feel the pure romance of the thing what are some people born for but to work and just imagine how dull london would be if all the shops were closed by seven or eight oclock i should lose half my enjoyment in walking to my club i should like to know what good miss neville and her party of philanthropists think they will accomplish by giving so much liberty and leisure we shall have to build double the number of taverns for such will be their only resort what can such people know of intellectual amusement and if they did what do they want with it we should have a cessation of all labour and then what is to become of us or the country either it is pure folly some people must have a hobby to make a noise about and so now nothing is heard but oppression internal slavery broken hearted milliners apprentices and maimed drapers assistants really for so much eloquence it is a pity they do not choose a higher subject illustration and i wish the present subject may never drop till the work is done interposed herbert gresham joining the conversation with a suddenness and speaking with such startling eloquence that it caused a general retreat of individual opinion he would have been amused had he felt less interested to see the effect on both sexes of his unexpected interference he spoke very briefly for he was too disgusted with the littleness the selfishness of all he had heard to attempt anything like argument and the effort to excuse former sentimentsto dare say he was right but they had not reflected much about itthought it a pity to alter things which had been going on so longcould not understand even granting there was a good deal of misery how could it be helped but if herbert gresham thought it might be no doubt there was more in it than they believed and very many other similar speeches only excited his contempt we must change the scene for our space will not allow us more than a slight sketch a momentary glance as it were on things passing daily hourly around and yet seen known of by how few four or five days after lady greshams fte miss neville might have been seen entering one of those small close back streets found even in the aristocratic west and whose dilapidated dwellings present almost as great a contrast with the proud mansions which surround and conceal them as the inhabitants themselves it was a poor old needlewoman whom lucy was visiting and surprised at finding her usual sitting room empty and fearing she was illfor there was no sign of work about and mrs miller was infirm and ailingshe gently entered her sleeping apartment the rough bed was occupied indeed but not by its usual inmate who was sitting by its side tears rolling down her withered cheeks and her attention so fixed that she did not perceive miss nevilles entrance she was watching the painful restless movements of a girl who in a high state of delirium and fever was lying on the pallet she was very young and had been beautiful but suffering had scarcely left any trace but its own earnestly and pityingly lucy entered into the sad but only too common tale her inquiries elicited but the old womans narration being garrulous and unfinished we will give it in our own words fanny roberts and harry merton born and nurtured in the same village had been playmates schoolfellows friends and at last loversnot only faithful and affectionate but prudent and thoughtful the parents of both were poor even in their humble village but the wishes and interests of their children were their first object and to see them somewhat higher in the world than themselves their sole ambition to set up an establishment in the neighbouring town combining linen draper dressmaker and milliner had been their day dream from the time they had conned their school lessons and taken long walks together instead of joining their playmates on the green and to fulfil this earnest wish their parents by many sacrifices which measured by their love seemed absolutely nothing gathered together sufficient to send them to london and apprentice them there harry was then nineteen and fanny two years younger hope was bright for both their only drawback seemed the impossibility of meeting more than once a week and six days of entire separation was a weary interval to those accustomed to exchange affections kindly words and looks each day only too soon however did the oppressive reality of the present absorb the rosy hues of the future on the daily routine of unmitigated work the exhausting labour the deadened energies the absorption of every faculty in the depressing weariness we need not touch it was no distaste for work for both had set to their respective duties with hearts burning to conquer every difficultyto do even more than was required of them the sooner to gain the longed for goal and had it not been for the fearful burden of over work the absence of sufficient rest of all wholesome recreation how brightly and nobly might these young loving beings have walked the path of life by mutual exertion creating a home and all the joys which in england that one word speaks alas ere eighteen months elapsed every thought of buoyancy and joy seemed strangely to have deserted fanny she could not tell why for outward things seemed exactly the same as they had been at first harry was still faithful still fond her heart intuitively felt that he was altered why she would often ask herself could she no longer feel happy why should every thought of her own dear home cause such a sickly longing for fresh air and green fields that the hysteric sob would often rise choking in her throat and more than once nothing but a timely burst of incomprehensible tears had saved her from fainting as she sat she could not satisfy herself but in reality it was the silent workings of insidious disease seeming mental because impossible to be traced as physical save by the constant sensation of weariness which she attributed merely to sitting so long in close and crowded rooms but though happiness seemed gone she retained the power of endurance woman can and will endure but in nine cases out of ten men cannot in the one suffering often purifies in the other it but too often deteriorates harry merton had entered on his work joyfully and buoyantly determined to make the best of everything and be good friends with everybody naturally lively with the power of very quick acquirement and a restless activity of mind as well as body a very few months trial convinced him that if he had not entirely mistaken his vocation he certainly must do something to make it more endurable he had heard of institutions for the people in london of amusements open even to the most economical he had pictured enjoying them with his fanny and gaining improvement likewise he found it all a dream there were indeed such things but not for him or her the hour of his release found not only every wholesome amusement closed but himself so weary that mental recreation was impossible and yet with the yearning for some pleasure some relief from wearisome work so natural in youth stronger than ever his convivial unsuspecting disposition led him to join the most seemingly attractive but in reality the most dangerous of his companions the consequences need scarcely be narrated he became intemperate gay reckless looking back on the pure fresh feelings of his early youth with wonder and retaining but one of their memories his love for fanny but even that was no longer the glad hopeful feeling which it had been he was constantly told and he saw that it must be years before they could marry he was laughed at for imagining that either he or she would retain their early feelings he heard her beauty admired and then pitied as a most dangerous gift which must eventually and most fearfully separate her from him and the most furious but most unfounded jealousy took possession of him and so darkened every hour of meeting that poor fanny at length anticipated them with more dread than pleasure it was long indeed nearly three years before things came to such a crisis but the gradual conviction of the deterioration of her lovers character was to fanny the heaviest suffering of all that she still loved him surely we need not say she saw the circumstances of this miserable change not the change itself her womans heart clung to him the more from the very anxiety he inspired so intensely did she mourn for his long wearisome hours of joyless toil that she scarcely felt her own though when he was released at ten or eleven she was often working unceasingly till two in the morning the choking cough the shortened breath the aching spine she scarcely felt in the one absorbing thought of him whenever she could be spared which in the season was very seldom it was fannys custom to go to mrs miller her only friend in london saturday night and remain till sunday evening two or three days before the invitations were out for lady greshams fte a note was given to her from harry the perusal of which occasioned deeper suffering than anything she had yet endured snatching half an hour from the scanty time allowed for sleep the following was her reply harry harry this from you when you so fondly promised you would never doubt me more yes he did seek me that saturday night or rather sunday morning for it was one oclock and i would not have gone there had you not made me promise that i would not disappoint you and that you would take me home why were you not there why did you leave me to the chance of such a meeting and then upbraid me with putting myself in that bad mans way oh harry harry by the memories of our early home our early love spare me such unjust suspicion you tell me writing will not satisfy you you must see me hear from my own lips my version of this cruel and most false tale how can i see you till saturday night the earliest if then sunday if i can only crawl to mrs millers indeed i will come pain as it is now to move only trust me till then dearest dearest harry do not add to your burden and mine by thoughts like these you know that i am innocent that i never have loved never can love any one but you the sunday came but fanny was unable to keep her engagement madame malin was so overwhelmed with orders for lady greshams fte that even the sabbath day was compelled to be sacrificed the peculiar trimmings which it was absolutely necessary for miss balfour to have to complete the parisian costume the details of which never arrived till eleven oclock saturday and then all the materials had to be purchased were fannys work and from her delicate taste she of all the assistants could the least be spared in fact extra hands were hired for to complete twenty or thirty full dresses from the noon of saturday to ten oclock monday in addition to those already in hand for the drawing room the following day was an unusual undertaking even for the indefatigable madame malin hour after hour those poor girls workedthrough saturday night the yearned for sabbath again late into the night till many fainted on their seats and the miserable toil was continued in a recumbent posture by those unable to sit upright a dead weight was on poor fannys heart a foreboding misery but the sufferings of the frame were such as almost to deaden the agony of mind the hour of release came at length inasmuch that ill as she was she craved permission to take home some of the dresses that she might call at mrs millers on her way back and learn some news of harry and beseech her old friend to seek him and tell him the reason of her forced absence exhausted and most wretched as she was she had to wait till the dresses were tried onthe capricious humour of the young ladies proved by altering realtering and final arrangement as they were originallyto bear with petty fault findinguntil her whole frame seemed one mass of nerve and so detained that she only entered the street leading to her old friends abode as the carriages whirled off their elegantly attired inmates to lady greshams fte what a tale awaited her harry restless miserablealmost maddened by the false reports against herand from the great pressure of business in his masters shop from the innumerable visits of modistes assistants to procure the necessary materials so needed for the costumes of mrs greshams fte not released till past one oclock sunday morning had perambulated the streets all night in the vain hope of meeting fanny encountering one of his jovial companions who half intoxicated swore he had seen her entering a coach withmerton knew whomand when collared and shaken by the infuriated lover till he recovered his more sober senses declared he could not tell exactly but he thought it was her at all events harry would know to morrow if she had gone as usual to mrs millers there she was not never before had six oclock on sunday evening come without her presence and really anxious mrs miller though not believing a syllable against her conjured the unhappy young man to call himself at madame malins and inquire if she were ill or detained he did so the well instructed lacquey declared the family were all at evening service and if the apprentices were not with their friends he supposed they were there also he knew nothing about them but he was quite sure his mistress never permitted them to work on sundays harry was in no state coolly to consider his words he rushed back like a madman to mrs miller uttered a few incoherent sentences and darted away before she had time or thought even to reply that very evening he enlisted and the monday found him marching to southampton with other troops about to embark for india a few lines to mrs miller told her this and accompanied a parcel directed to fanny in case she should ever see or hear of her again the poor girl had just strength to tear it open to discover all her letters and formerly treasured gifts even to some withered flowers returned with a few words of stinging reproach bidding her farewell for ever and dropped lifeless at the old womans feet one or two intervals of coherency enabled her by a few broken phrases to explain the reason of her absence but brain fever followed and even when miss neville saw her all hope was over vain was the skill of the gifted and benevolent physician lucy called in disease had been too long and too deeply rooted for resistance to a shock which in its agony would have prostrated even a healthy constitution a few a very few days of intense suffering and the crushed heart ceased to beat the blighted frame to feel and misery for her was over but for poor harryfor the parents of bothwhat might comfort them we have seen the deterioration of harrys character there were many to mark and condemn the faults but none to perceive their cause and when he absconded from his apprenticeship it did but bring conviction as to his determined depravity who may tell the agony of those two humble english homes when the post brought the miserable news of death to the one and of sin and utter separation to the other they had not even the poor comfort of knowing the cause of their sons change their own bold free happy loving harryhow could his parents associate him with sinor fanny the healthy rosy graceful fanny with suffering and death and what caused these fearful evils amongst which our tale is but one amongst ten thousand lucy neville buried her face in her hands as she sat by the lowly pallet where lay the faded form whence life had only half an hour before departed and thanked god that the temptation had been indeed resisted and that she had not made one at lady greshams fte it had not indeed been the primary or even the secondary cause it did but strike the last blow and shiver to atoms the last lingering dream of hope and joy which despite of oppression misery despair will rest invisibly in the youthful heart till driven thence by death lucy exclaimed lord valery that same day stopping the carriage unexpectedly as it was about to drive off from that part of st jamess where it usually waited for her she shrunk from the notice which a noblemans carriage seen in such localities as mrs millers would inevitably producelucy an old friend wishes to recall himself to your memory will you give him a seat in your carriage and take me on the box we both pine for fresh air and a drive in the park will revive us for dinner which whether he will or no i intend this gentleman to partake the words were the lightest but the tone which spoke them betrayed the truth at once it was herbert gresham by his side herbert gresham whose earnest eyes were fixed on hers with an expression in their dark depths needing no words to tell her that his early dream even as her own was unchangedthat the first action of his now unshackled will was to seek her requiring no renewal of acquaintance again to love and trust her and though the suddenness of the meeting the rapid transition from sorrowing sympathy to individual joy did so flush and pale her cheek that her brother looked at her with some alarm there was neither hesitation nor idle reserve her hand was extended at once and the pressure which clasped it was sufficient response whether they continued so silent when herbert did spring into the carriage and took his seat by her side indeed we know not certain it is that had it not been for lord valery the footman might have waited long enough for orders to drive home and equally certain that no day had ever seemed so short to lucyshort in its fullness of present enjoyment in its retrospect could it have been but one brief day and that poor girl is really gone inquired lord valery just as herbert gresham was about taking his departure most reluctantly warned to do so by a neighbouring clock striking midnight another victim to that hateful system desecrating our lovely and most noble land dear edward hush interposed lucy gently as her eye rested on her lover do not check him dearest though i prize that fond thought for me i know the whole talethat the fte welcoming my return by misdirected zeal and thoughtless folly has added incalculably to the general burden and to individuals brought death and a life long despair the past alas we cannot remedythe future and his arm was fondly thrown round lucy and his lip pressed her browdearest let us hope next season there will be another lady greshams fte fraught with happiness for all the group of sculpture i i have no hope in loving thee i only ask to love i brood upon my silent heart as on its nest the dove but little have i been beloved sad silent and alone and yet i feel in loving thee the wide world is my own thine is the name i breathe to heaven thy face is on my sleep i only ask that love like this may pray for thee and weep l e l we know not love till those we love depart l e l why will you sing that old fashioned song dear annie when you have so many much better suited to your voice expostulated reginald de vere as he led the young songstress from her harp to a more retired seat i do not like your throwing away so much power and sweetness on a song which of all others i hate the most do not say so reginald you are not usually fastidious or i would say had that sweet melody italian words instead of english you would acknowledge its beauty and feel it too perhaps so as it is not the melody but the words i quarrel withhome sweet home what charm has home ever had for me change the words dear annie english or italian i care not only remove all association of home and i will learn to love it more nay reginald to banish such association would be to banish its greatest charm one day you too may feel its truth never never he answered passionately there is a blighting curse around me which it were worse than folly to resist i must toil on lonely and unblessed by one sweet tie of homeseeking for no love and receiving noneisolated in a world there are many others whose destiny is the same bound by the iron chain of fate he is but a madman who would seek to break it destinyfate i thought you had long ere this banished their baneful influence said annie in a tone of mild reproach from your ear my gentle friend because i saw you loved not their expression but not from my own heart yet you too believe all things to be pre ordained that not a sparrow falls to the ground unmarked then why so start at meis not our creed the same it cannot be reginald i am not wise enough to know wherein the difference lies i can only judge from effects and when they are so opposed i fancy the cause must be so also i do believe that all things are ordained but yet i am no fatalist will you try and explain the distinction for your words seem somewhat contradictory i fear they do she replied simply and i am over bold to speak on this weighty subject at all your creed appears to me to consist in this that before your birth your path was laid downyour destiny fixed that you are in consequence bound in chains enclosed in walls from which no effort of your own will can enable you to escape that you must stand the bursting of the thunder cloudfor you have no force or energy to seek shelter no free will to chooseswayed by an irresistible impulse and consequently not a responsible being such seems to me the creed of a fatalist and you are right now then for yours less difficult i should imagine to explain than that in which you have no interest i differ from you reginald it is comparatively easy to define the subject of a passing thought or an hours study but that which we feel feel to our inmost soul is not so easily clothed in words i believe that an eye of love is ever watching over mea guiding arm is ever round me that nothing can happen to me unless willed for my good by my father in heaven but i do not believe my lot in life marked out before i saw the light such a creed at once changes the law of love into a dark and iron bound necessity from which my whole soul revolts where would be the comfort of prayer in such a casethe blessedness of pouring forth ones whole soul in the hour of affliction for how could prayer avail us were our lot marked out and do you think prayer ever does do you believe that you are answered i do indeed dear reginald not always as our own will would dictate but as a loving father knows it best i was not answered as my heart implored when my only parent was taken from me but i was answered in the strength that was granted me to feel that he was happy and gods will kinder and better than my own i am not here because it is my destiny but because it is better for me than the calm and quiet life i have hitherto enjoyed your creed is indeed that of a gentle loving woman annie said her companion more playfully but he smiled not for he knew how chillingly a smile will fall on young enthusiasm but it is too visionary too ethereal for cold hearted man perhaps not for some but for me there are no such dreams my heart was once full of hope and faith and all things bright and fond and beautiful but now crushed blighted trampled on how may it dream again but this is folly and with a strong effort he subdued emotion and spoke more calmly let us talk of something else you alluded but now to your change of life and i thought sadly are you not happy i shall be in time reginald answered annie on whose fair sweet face a shade had flitted at her companions bitter words all are kind to me my mother was lord ennerdales favourite niece and he loves me for her sake and so pets me that i cannot but love him most dearly and lady emily i shall learn to love as soon as she will let me i fancy she thinks me but a simple romantic girl and i have not courage to undeceive herthat i can love and reverence other things besides poetry but it is the change of circumstances that sometimes makes me sad clair abbey is so far removed from luscombe cottage that time has not yet reconciled me to the great change time is slow in effecting changes in you annie yet ere we meet again trust me you will have learned to love clair abbey or changed it for another home as high in sounding and yet more dear changed it ere we meet again what can you mean reginald said annie startled yet more by his tone than by his words but she was not answered for reginald turned away directly he had spoken his attention called by lord ennerdale and another quadrille being formed her hand was claimed and she was led off almost unconsciouslyso strangely was she preoccupiedto join it there had been nothing in the quiet yet earnest conversation of reginald de vere and annie grey to cause remark amongst the light hearted group who were that night assembled in lord ennerdales hospitable halls they had been intimate from childhood and as annie was almost a stranger to all present and merely regarded as a simple country girl hardly emerged from childhood no one was surprised that she should prefer reginalds society though there were some young men who attracted by the timid yet intelligent style of her beauty half envied de vere the privileges of intimacy which he so evidently enjoyed annies place seemed not amidst the followers of fashion the long rich chesnut hair owned no law but that of nature and flowed at will from her pale high brow over a neck and shoulders whose exquisite form and whiteness were displayed to advantage by the simple fashion of her plain black dress the eye so darkly deeply beautifully blue the fair soft cheek ever varying in colour revealed every thought and feeling that stirred within the worlds lesson of concealment and reserve she had not yet learned for living in perfect retirement with a kind and judicious father of whom she was the idol her enthusiasm had been regulated not chilled and every high and poetic sentiment raised up to and purified in the only rest for such mindsthe religion of the bible and of nature her life had passed in a small cottage on the banks of windermere diversified only by occasional visits to an old relation in scotland where in fact the first six months of her mourning had been passed and there had it not been for one cogent reason she would have preferred remaining as more congenial to her taste and feelings than the form and grandeur which she imagined must surround the dwelling of an earl lord ennerdale and his family had often sought to draw sir edward grey from his seclusion anxious to notice his child but fearing to disturb annies tranquil happiness by an introduction to a mode of life and pleasures which her very limited fortune must prohibit her enjoying he had invariably declined these solicitations yet when lord ennerdale notwithstanding his age and infirmities made a rapid journey from london to luscombe cottage purposely to soothe his dying hours by the assurance that his annie was amply even richly provided for and therefore there could be no objection to her making clair abbey her future home sir edward placed his weeping child in the arms of her aged uncle and died with a prayer for both upon his lips but much as annie loved and venerated her father it was scarcely so much his last wish as the restlessness of her own heart which even while she preferred the simple mode of living at kelmuir yet reconciled her to a residence at clair abbey she was restless because her quondam playmate and chosen friend reginald de vere was far away in his own most wretched home with none to sing or smile him into peace or cautiously and gently argue away his fits of morbid sensitiveness or overwhelming gloom that lord ennerdale not only sympathised in the young mans causes of depression but loved his better qualities admired his talents and regretted his failings was sufficient to excite the warm affections of his great niece towards him no spell is so powerful in opening the heart as sympathy with regard to the character of those we love clair abbeys great attraction then to annie grey was that there she should constantly see reginald his concluding words therefore had both startled and pained her but she vainly waited for their solution she looked earnestly for reginald to return to her but he was constantly engaged in apparently earnest conversation with one or other of lord ennerdales guests she was too guileless to believe he shunned her merely because he failed in courage to tell her more the evening closed at length and passing along the corridor leading from the library to the stairs a well known step suddenly sounded behind her and the voice of reginald de vere called her by name i thought you intended to retire without even wishing me good night she said playfully her spirit rallying with his appearance what do you mean sir by such treatment be better behaved to morrow and i will be merciful and forgive you must forgive me to night dearest annie for to morrow will see me many miles on my road to portsmouth thence speedily to embark for spain portsmouthspain repeated the bewildered girl and her hand so trembled that the lamp she held dropped from it and was instantly extinguished yes annie to spain he answered struggling for calmness i am of age now poor but not so utterly dependent as i have been my fathers house i will never enter more you start annie but do notdo not condemn me judge me by no reasoning but that of your own kind gentle heart i can bear no more than that which i have borne boyhood must submit to a parents tyranny but manhood owns no such law you know how i would have loved my father and how he has spurned me still i lingered vainly striving to elicit one softer feeling hopingidiot that i wasthat he would yet love me but the dream is over he drew the reins still tighter and so snapped them there is a measure to endurance even in a son do not weep thus annie he continued conquering his own emotion to soothe hers and passing his arm round her as he had so often done in earlier years when as a brother he had soothed her griefs and shared her joys i will not burden you with the final cause of my present resolution i have neither means nor influence to tread the path to which my inmost soul aspires and to toil for lingering years behind a merchants desk or tradesmans counter my spirit will not bear i have obtained a commission amongst the brave fellows now about to join general mina in his gallant defence of the young queen and with him these restless yearnings may be stilled in the activity of martial service or the quiet of the grave and who will mourn for me he continued rapidly and bitterly who in the wide world will think of me or shed one tear for me save thine own sweet self oh annie speak to me tell me you will think of me sometimes i know there will be many very many to supply my place to you but oh who will ever be to me as you have been and yet you have decided on this plan endured more than ever and told me not a word reginald was this kind she said struggling with the tears that nearly suffocated her you were in grief already annie how might i ask your sympathy in mine i know it never was refused me i know it would not be even in your own sorrow but oh annie i felt if i waited to look on you again i should fail in courage to leave england yet why should i linger changed as your prospects are loved as you will be by those so much more deserving what could i be to you reginald murmured poor annie wholly unconscious of the nature of her own feelings yet unable to utter another word i know you will not forget me annie dearest annie your nature is too good too kind too truthful for such change but fated as i am how dare i ask for hope for more than a sisters love say you will sometimes think of me love me asas a brother annie darling and life will not be so wholly desolate her reply was almost inarticulate and passionate words rose to reginalds lips but they were not spoken he led her to the door of her apartment without another word wrung both her hands in his bade god bless her and was gone annie stood for a few minutes as if stunned mechanically she loosed the wreath of white rosebuds from her hair the fastening of her dress which seemed to stifle her very breath and then she sunk on her knees beside the bed and the hot tears gushed forth and long long she wept as that young guileless girl had never wept before reginald de vere was the youngest son of a private gentleman of moderate fortune residing in a populous city in the north of yorkshire it is not necessary to dilate on feelings which reginalds own words but too painfully portrayed the iron rule of tyranny is best described in the effect which it produces the calvinistic principles of the elder de vere found no softening of their natural austerity in the acidity and moroseness of his temper the evil had been increased by his union with a young spaniardlively frivolous and a roman catholic how this marriage had ever come about nobody succeeded in discovering strange unions there are but seldom between such antipodes in character and feeling as were mr and mrs de vere their large family grew up amidst all the evils of domestic dissension and its subsequent miserya fathers unjustifiable tyranny and a mothers as blamable weakness basil de vere sought to instil his peculiarly stern doctrines in the minds of his children his wife prayed in their hearing that they might be saved from such cold comfortless belief they shrunk from the one and learned no religion from the other to shield them from the fathers tyranny the mother taught them deceit lavished on them weak indulgences which were to be forfeited if ever revealed ever witnessing and suffering the effects of dissension what affection what harmony could exist between themselves the ill effects of this training were more discernible in some of their matured characters than in others some pursued an honest course as soon as their departure from their fathers house permitted the influence of their better qualities but these were mostly dwelling in foreign lands some had married with some without his consent and in his old age basil de vere found himself master of a deserted hearth with none of his once blooming family beside him but one and that one was reginald the weak indulgence of his mother had never softened for reginald the tyranny of his father she died in giving him birth and he had to battle through his unhappy childhood alone shrinking almost in agony from his fathers voice yearning with all the clinging confidence of childhood for love but finding none he turned in loathing from the continued scenes of discord which characterised his home he spurned with contemptuous indignation offers of indulgence and concealment to act as he saw others do and thus constantly drew upon himself the enmity of his more wily brothers and sisters he shrunk in consequence more and more within himself striving to keep peace with his father but in vain for de vere often raged at his children without knowing wherefore and the calm dignified bearing of his youngest son would chafe him into greater fury than palpable offence but there were seeds of virtue aye of the nobility of genius in the disposition of reginald that bloomed and flourished despite the unhealthy soil and blighting atmosphere in which he moved perhaps the kindly notice of sir edward grey assisted their development the pale silent suffering boy had appealed irresistibly to his kind heart and for reginalds sake he condescended to make acquaintance with his father as long as they remained in yorkshire sir edward permitted reginald to share much of the instruction which he himself bestowed upon his annie a kindness so delicately and feelingly bestowed that reginald by slow degrees permitted his whole character to display itself to sir edward and allowed himself to feel that with so kind a friend and so sweet a companion he was not utterly alone even when sir edward removed to windermere their intercourse continued for there was ever a room prepared and a warm welcome for reginald who turned to that cottage as a very eden of peace and love as reginald increased in years felt more fully his own powers and through sir edwards friendly introductions associated with other families his morbid feelings did not as the baronet had fondly hoped decrease but rather strengthened in the supposition that his fate alone was desolate he saw happy homes and kindly hearts no exertion no effort no sacrifice could make such his and he believed an iron chain of fate was round him dooming him to misery the kindness of sir edward of lord ennerdale and others only deepened the vain wild yearnings for home affectionsthe peace the confidence of home a peculiarly fine organization of mind and an acute perception of character caused him to shrink with pain from general notice the talented and gifted he admired at a distance feeling intuitively that such would be his chosen friends yet from a sense of inferiority refusing to come forward and permit his fine talents to be known at the same time shrinking from the common herd convinced that amongst them he should meet with neither sympathy nor appreciation a happy home would have been all in all for reginald there the incipient stirrings of genius would have been fostered into bloom and the morbid feelings too often their accompaniment regulated into peace the death of sir edward grey and the future destination of his daughter were however the final cause of his determination to leave england he knew it not himself and if a light did flash upon the darkness it only deepened the gloom around him by the conviction that his doom was ever to love alone more and more earnestly he sought to soften his fathers temper even to conquer his own repugnance to the path of life his parent might assign him but in vain to enumerate all the petty miseries this struggle cost him would be impossible the mind rises purified and spiritualized from great sorrows but there is no relief from the trial of an unhappy home no cure for the wounds of words if domestic love and peace be ours we can go forth with a firm heart and serene mind to meet the trials of the world alas alas for those who have no such haven no such stay never did reginald de vere make a greater mistake than in the supposition that a military life would bring him the happiness for which his parched soul so thirsted he could not associate the favourite pastime of his childhood carving in wood stone or whatever material came first to hand with the feverish yearning for exertion and excitement which possessed his whole being he could not feel that the one sprang from the other or rather that the power which urged the former was secretly working in his mind and causing an utter distaste for all mechanical employment he was too unhappy to examine the source of his restlessness and knew no one who could explain it for him lord ennerdale and his sons were all men of worth and talent and firm encouragers of art and literature but not themselves children of genius they failed in the subtle penetration which could discover its embryo existence had sir edward lived he would have seen further but still all his friends had dissuaded reginald from entering on a military career but he was firm and in less than a week after his agitated parting with annie a fair wind was rapidly bearing him to the shores of spain days and weeks passed and annie grey sought with persevering effort to regain her former calm and happy temperament and she succeeded so far as to conceal from her relatives the secret of her heart the agony of that parting moment had transformed her as by some incomprehensible spell from the child to the woman and so sudden had been the transition that she felt for days a stranger to herself reginald had always been dear to her but she knew not imagined not how dear until that never to be forgotten evening his words returned to her again and again and sad desponding as they were she would not have lost one of them she who had been so constantly active flitting like a spirit from one favourite employment to another now seemed to live but on one feeling but her mind was too well regulated to permit its unrestrained indulgence young as she was dependent on herself alone for guidance in this new and absorbing state of being thrown in quite a new position for luxury and wealth as a cherished member of her uncles family yet her character instead of deteriorating matured uniting all the outward playfulness of the child with the inward graces of the woman lord ennerdales domestic circle formed a happy contrast to that of the ascetic basil de vere his children were all married except his eldest son lord st clair and eldest daughter lady emily but the ties of family had never been broken and happy youth and blooming childhood were almost always round the earl with all these annie was speedily a favourite and easily susceptible of kindness and affection clair abbey soon became endeared to her as home by a strange contradiction annies interest and affection were however excited the strongest towards the only member of lord ennerdales family who retained reserve towards her what there was in lady emily st clair to attract a young and lively girl annie herself might have found it difficult to define for not only her appearance but her manners were against her stiff cold even severe she usually appeared and when she would at times relax and seem about to enter with warmth and kindness into annies studies or pursuits she would suddenly relapse into coldness and reserve sometimes when eagerly conversing with lord st clair on the exquisite beauty of nature or of some favourite poem when the spirit of poetry breathed alike from her eyes and from her lips annie would catch the eye of lady emily fixed upon her sadly and pityingly or if she smiled the smile was peculiar it might be even satirical yet she was never satirical in words nor did it seem in charactertoo feelingly alive to the dictates of kindness ever willingly to inflict a wound to discover her real character was difficult annie judged more by her habits than her words lady emily never said that her love of flowers amounted to a passion that to have them around her in their freshness to seek them alike from the garden and the wild to collect dry and arrange them in such tasteful groups and such brilliancy of colouring that the choicest paintings looked dim beside them was her favourite pleasure but annie was ever ready with some newly discovered plant or the moss and weed she neededever the first to remove the dying buds and supply their place around her boudoir with the freshest and fairest she could select lady emily never spoke of poetry never acknowledged that she could either admire or enter into it but there were extracts in her writing attached sometimes to drawings sometimes to her books of flowers that betrayed such a refinement of taste and acute perception of the pure the beautiful and the spiritual in nature and in man that annie suspected she was herself a poet but yet how could she reconcile the unimpassioned coldness of her usual mood with the light and life of poetry yet though fairly puzzled annie so judiciously assisted her researches that lady emily often wondered how a mark could come so exactly in the place she wished when the thought for whose echo she looked had been breathed to none but even had these attentions escaped her notice it must indeed have been an icy heart to withstand the sweetness of annies manner whenever her cousins mood was irritable her temper somewhat ruffled there seemed a magic around annie not only to bear with irritation but to reconcile the subject of that irritation to herself and all around her and when so languid and weak as really to be ill though she would never allow it who so active as annie to prevent all annoyance to the invalid or interfere with the only pursuits she could enjoy yet no show of affection acknowledged these attentions but by very slow degrees the miss grey changed into anne and finally into the pretty denomination by which she was always addressed and the smile and tone with which she spoke to her satisfied the orphan that she had not worked in vain even if annies conduct had failed to rivet the notice of lady emily it had gained for her the interest and sincere affection of another lord st clair was devotedly attached to his sister and all who had the good sense to appreciate her were sure to obtain his esteem then in the prime of life he foresaw no danger in his intimate association with and admiration of his young cousin a girl but just seventeen and it was a pleasure to him to draw her out and repay by every kindness on his part her attention to his sister a disappointment when very young had caused him to remain single i do not say i shall never marry he often said in answer to his fathers solicitations on the subject for then i should consider myself bound not to do so however my heart might dictate but it is unlikely annie grey had not however been domiciled many months in clair abbey before lord st clairs sentiments on this subject underwent some change from the time of reginalds departure the public journals became suddenly endowed with an interest to annie equal to that of the most ardent politician the disturbed state of spain the constant marchings and counter marchings of general minas army prevented any regular communication from reginald once or twice she had heard from him direct and treasured indeed were those letters honourably as the young man kept to his resolution never by one word to draw annie into an engagement or even an avowal that she returned his love in the papers she often read his name among the bravest and most daring of the british soldiers one anecdote officially reported and communicated to lord ennerdale afforded her still dearer food for fancy the service in which he was engaged was exposed to all the horrors of civil warfare slaughter and desolation followed in the train of both armies young de vere at the head of a picked band had thrown himself in the very midst of a mle determined on saving the unoffending women and children and aged peasants of the opposing party all of whom were about to be sacrificed to the misguided rage of the royal troops the village was in flames and the peasants neutral before swore to be avenged the exertions of the young englishman however worked on both parties he calmed the excited spirits of his own men and promised protection and safety to the oppressed one group particularly attracted him a young mother clasping an infant tightly to her breast and two fine boys twining their arms round her as to protect her with their own lives reginald did not know that it was her infant he had saved from a brutal death but his look was arrested by the intense feeling glistening in her large dark eyes and by the impotent passion of her eldest boy who clenching a huge stick vowed he would join his father who was a carlist soldier and revenge the insults offered to his mother de vere jestingly laid his hand on the striplings shoulder declaring he was a young rebel and his prisoner the agonized scream of the poor mother changing on the instant into the wildest accents of gratitude as she recognised in reginald her babys preserver and to the earnest supplication that he would send them on in safety removed all feelings of mere jest reginald soothed her fears and selecting a guard of his own countrymen on whom he could depend sent her and her children under their care to the outposts of the carlist camp general mina smiled sadly when this anecdote was told him the age of chivalry is over my young friend he said mournfully your act was kind and generous but i fear of little service the carlists are not likely to check their career of devastating warfare because we have spared one insignificant village nor will you have any demand upon their favour should you unfortunately fall into their hands chivalry and its romance may be over thought annie as again and again her mind reverted to its one fond theme but my father once told me a deed can never die and even if indeed it were to do no good surely his motives will meet with the appreciation and admiration they deserve there must be some among the good and noble to do him justice how the young heart revels in every proof however trifling on the worth of him it loves the restlessness of a scarcely acknowledged passion merged into a species of glowing happiness the basis of which annie might have found it difficult to define in its indulgence she forgot the distance between them the darkening aspect of his future the despondency breathing in his last farewellforgot all but the passionate words who will be to me as you have been and what will so elevate the character and purify the heart and shed such sweet rosy flowers over every thought and act and feeling as the first fresh feelings of all hoping all believing love annies beauty matured beneath the magic of such dreams excited universal admiration but the young girl knew it not no breakfast for loiterers exclaimed lord st clair playfully holding up his hand as annie sprang through an open french window into the breakfast room one lovely summer morning her cottage bonnet thrown back her luxuriant hair somewhat disordered her cheek and eye bright with health and animation and laughing gaily at lord st clairs threat here has emily been looking starch and prim for the last half hour thinking unutterable things of the folly and romance which can be the only reason of young ladies early wanderings in the lonely districts about keswick lake ah you little fox prepared with a bribe to ward off the weight of her displeasure he said as annie laid the fruit of her researches a rare and exquisite plant on the table by her cousin and lady emily half smiled and theres my father in a complete fever fearing that his blooming little niece had been carried off or eaten up by one of the wild men or monsters of the mountains and threatening to search for her himself directly after breakfast thank you my dear kind uncle replied annie gaily bending over lord ennerdale to kiss his forehead never be anxious about me i have suffered no further inconvenience than extreme hunger which i satisfied at nannys cottage by a slice of her brown bread and a cup of warm milk no romance in that lord st clair at least a fortunate occurrence for you as it may save you from a lecture on the impropriety of indulging love lorn dreams in solitude why annie you are actually blushing if it were not an utter impossibility for romantic young ladies to feel hungry i should say your very looks pleaded guilty look at her emilyyou had better begin no i thank you henry i never give lectures even when deserved in public was his sisters quiet reply well the offence brings with it its own punishment for here come the contents of the postmans bag and so a truce to our sage converse and you miss annie must eat your breakfast in meditative silence or in perusing what she likes better here my little politician your eyes are pleading though your lips are silent said lord ennerdale gaily throwing to her a packet of newspapers without opening them you are much too young to be a politician besides i hate women to dabble in politics so give me a better reason for being the first reader of all the papers or you shall not have them interposed lord st clair keeping firm hold of the packet which he had caught on my honour i never read a word of politics replied annie half playfully half eagerly but blushing deeply as she met lord st clairs penetrative glance he relinquished them with a half sigh and bent over his despatches silence ensued for several minutes each seemingly engrossed with his occupation lady emily was the first to move and after carefully sorting and arranging the flowers annie had brought her was about to leave the room annie my dear child what is the matter she exclaimed in a tone which electrified her father and brother so utterly was it unlike her usually measured accents and startled out of all stiffness and dignity she was at the poor girls side in an instant annies cheek lips and brow were cold and colourless as marble and there was such rigid agony imprinted on every feature that lady emily well nigh shuddered as she gazed speak to me annie love what is it try and speak dearest do not look at me with such a gaze she continued as annie slowly raised her eyes which were bloodshot and distended and fixed them on her face she evidently tried to speak but only a gasping cry escaped and that terrible agony was lost for a time in an unconsciousness so deep that it almost seemed of death lord st clair stood paralysed but then he snatched up the fatal paper and one glance sufficed to tell him all all that he had suspected all that for his own happiness he had feared but he could only think of annie then and perceiving how ineffectual were all the usual efforts to restore animation he threw himself on horseback and never rested till he had found and dragged back with him the medical attendant of the family whose skill was finally successful annie woke from that blessed relief of insensibility to a consciousness of such fearful suffering that as she lay in the perfect stillness enjoined by the physician she felt as if her brain must reel and fail beneath it it was not alone the death of him she loved that the idol of her young affections was lost to her for ever but it was the horrid nature of his fate which had so appalled her in the gallant defence of a royal fort he had been left almost alone all his companions falling around him severely wounded and overpowered by numbers he was taken by the carlists dragged to their camp and twenty four hours afterwards shot with other ill fated men literally murdered in cold blood three times annies eyes had glared on the paragraph reading again and again the list of the unfortunate men who had thus perished as if reginalds name could not be amongst them alas it was there pre eminent from the courage the youth and the official rank of the bearer and in that dreadful stillness the whole scene rose before her vivid as realityghastly figures flitted before her and then she saw reginald as they parted and then full of life and excitement in the field and then covered with blood and wounds she seemed to see him bound and kneeling for the fatal stroke and the shot rung in her ears clear sharp and strangely loud till she could have shrieked from the bewildering agony she tried to banish the vision to escape its influence but it gained strength and force and colouring and before midnight lady emily watched in grief and awe beside the couch where her young cousin lay and raved in the fearful delirium of a brain fever many weeks elapsed ere annie could again take her place amongst her family alternate fever and exhaustion had so prostrated her that her life was more than once despaired of had she been aware who it was so constantly and gently tended her teaching her voice to forget its coldness her manners its reserve to soothe and comfort those hours of agony she would have felt that some simple deeds indeed could never die and that to her own sweetness of temper and forbearing and active kindness she owed the blessings of a sympathy and tenderness almost equalling a mothers but it was long before she was conscious of anything or even capable of rousing herself from the lethargic stupor which still lingered even when sense and strength returned that she sought earnestly to appear the same as usualto evince how gratefully she felt the kindness lavished on herto return to her employments was very evident but it seemed as if bodily weakness prevented all mental exertion she shrunk in anguish from the thought that she had betrayed her love though by neither word nor hint did her companions ever allude to the immediate occasion of her illness would she but shed tearsbut speak her grief exclaimed lord st clair to his sister one day after vainly endeavouring to excite a smile she would suffer less then but she has never wept since and before the most trifling emotion even of pleasure would draw tears could you but draw forth her confidencebut make her weep is there no possible way i fear none she shrinks from the slightest approach to the subject i feel as if i dared not speak poor reginalds name chance however did that for which even lady emilys courage failed annie was reclining one morning in a favourite boudoir her eyes languidly wandering over the beautiful landscape which stretched from the window when last she had noticed it the trees were bending beneath the weight of their glorious summer dress and the gayest and brightest flowers were flinging their lavish beauties on the banks of the small but picturesque lake the scene was still lovely but it had changed the trees which still retained foliage were all in the sere and yellow leaf the ground was strewed with fallen leaves the flowers were all gone and nature herself seemed emblematical of the change in annies heart lady emily watched her some time in silence and then gently drew her attention to some beautiful groups of flowers which she had lately arranged annie turned from the window with a heavy sigh and bent over the flowers while lady emily continued her employments without further notice she forgot that amongst those groups there was the plant to find which annie had rambled over hill and dale that fatal morning from its extreme rarity and beauty she had placed it alone upon the page and as annie gazed upon it a rush of feeling of the bright sweet memories which had thronged her mind during that solitary ramble came back upon herthe dreams of hope and joy and lovewith the force the intensity of actual presence as if they might still be realized and the intervening time had been but a dark and troubled blank she pushed the flower from her and her head sunk on her clasped hands my poor child i forgot that flower was amongst them exclaimed lady emily in a tone at once of such self reproach and earnest sympathy that annie with an uncontrollable impulse suddenly sprung up and folding her arms round her neck burst into a passion of tears all her cousins previous kindness she had attributed to pity for bodily suffering that she could sympathise in her mental affliction she had fanciedas the young are too prone to do of the colder and more experiencedwas impossible but the tone the allusion to that little flower betrayed that she too could believe in and understand the association of the material with the immaterial world and annie now wept upon her bosom in the consoling consciousness that cold as that heart seemed it could yet feel and weep for her lady emily trembled for the deep emotion she beheld recalled passages of equal suffering in her own life which she had thought buried and at rest for ever she trembled lest in this appeal to her inmost soul her long striven for calmness should fail and her weakness should increase rather than soothe annies anguish her hand shook and her lip so quivered that it was some minutes ere she could speak we need not linger on the words which followed the ice which had seemed to close round annies heart dissolvedreginalds name was spokenthe fond secret of her life revealed and from that day she found more strength to struggle with depressionto leave no effort untried to regain serenity and conquer that worse foe to happiness indifference which the human heart contains once convinced by the representations of affection and experience that it was her duty actively to do as well as passively to endureto prove her resignation to the blow which though heavy was still dealt by a fathers hand she did not fail a yet more earnest desire to seek the happiness of others and complete disregard of selfa calm and still serenity of word and look were now her outward characteristics while within though her spirit had gained new strength in its upward flightnew clinging love for that world where all is peace the thought of the departed yet remained gaining it seemed increase of power with every passing month it had lost its absorbing anguish but not its memories too truly did she feel with that sweet chronicler of womans heart we dream not of loves might till death has robed with soft and solemn light the image we enshrine before that hour we have but glimpses of the overmastering power within us laid there were times when the thought would come and so vividly she could scarcely believe it only a thought that reginald might yet live the public records be deceivers but lady emilys assurances that her father and brothers had made every inquiry but that all the information obtained only confirmed the first statement proved the utter fallacy of the dream ii ah let the heart that worships thee by evry change be proved l e l i could forgive the miserable hours his falsehood and his only taught my heart but i can not forgive that for his sake my faith in good is shaken and my hopes are pale and cold for they have looked on death why should i love him he no longer is that which i loved l e l thou livest thou livest i knew thou couldst not die de chatillonmrs hemans nearly two years had elapsed since the death of reginald de vere ere any event of sufficient importance occurred in annies life for us to resume the thread of our narrative a shock like that and on such a disposition could never be forgotten though time the softener of all ills had restored her to some degree of her wonted animation and though the elastic spirits of the young girl had given way the woman had become yet more attractive and lovable the first london season after reginalds death she had not accompanied her uncles family to the great metropolis but spent the period of their absence quietly in scotland the second she did not refuse to join them but scenes of festivity were so evidently distasteful that her friends did not urge her entering more into society than her own inclinations prompted but in her uncles house she was seen and known only to be admired and loved receiving to her extreme astonishment an unexceptionable offer of marriage before she had been two months in london it was declined gratefully but so decidedly as to give no hope some weeks afterwards lord st clair one morning entered annies room she was alone so intently engaged in drawing as not to observe the very peculiar expression of countenance with which he regarded her some minutes without speaking i would give something to read your thoughts cousin mine she said playfully at length raising her eyes to his face which instantly resumed its usual kind and open expression i could hardly believe you were in the room you were so silent i was thinking how very wise the world is annie it knows and vouches for so many things concerning individuals of which they are utterly ignorant themselves why what is the report now only he paused for a second then rallied so quickly that the huskiness of his first words was unperceived that you and i are engaged in marriage and that i only wait till you are of age that the disparity of years may seem less the world must think much too highly of me for such a report to gain credence replied annie simply yet gravely though she did start at the intelligence what can you mean that they must hold me in much greater respect than i deserve to unite my name even in thought with yours my dear annie can you mean that you are undeserving of the regard of any man however high his worth how little do you know yourself believe me it is i who should feel proud that the world should believe this so strongly that not even the disparity of years between us is considered an objection do not talk so dear henry or i shall fear i am losing one of the truest friends i have you have always treated me with such regard as never to flatter me pray do not begin now indeed you do me injustice annie might i not return the charge and accuse you of flattering me no dear cousin how can i do otherwise than look up to and venerate your worth associating with you at home as i have done for nearly three years and receiving such constant kindness that had i been your own young sister you could not have shown more do i not see you as a son and brother and if i did not venerate you should i not be the only one either at home or in the world who did not do you the justice you deserve and may i not equally have learnt to know and love you yes as a child a sister but not as the wife you need is the disparity of years then in your mind so great an obstacle do you think it quite impossible a man of eight and thirty can love a girl of twenty no not impossible but impossible that a girl of twenty could love a man of eight and thirty is that it far less unlikely than the other case replied annie half smiling for her complete unconsciousness caused her to be amused at her companions pertinacity then why should the worlds report be so utterly without foundation dearest annie inquired lord st clair with such a sudden change of countenance and tone that it startled her almost into consciousness the arch and playful look vanished her cheek paled and the tears started to her eyes and laying her hand confidingly on his arm she said with quivering lip dearest henry do not let me lose the kind brother the true friend i have so long believed you you shall not annie he answered fervently even if to retain such appellatives makes me more miserable than you imagine do not do not say so my thoughts are all memories and were the worlds report indeed true would be faithless every hour could this make your happiness but must this always be is devotion to the departed a higher duty than giving happiness to the living so purely unselfish as you are would you not in time better secure your own peace by giving inexpressible happiness as the beloved and cherished wife of the living who would never expect you to love as you have loved than by indulging in the luxury of memory and devotedness to one who is in heaven is not this a question worth considering annie not now not now oh do not urge me now she implored bursting into tears and her companion on the instant banished every word and thought of self to soothe and calm her a month or two afterwards lord st clair to the astonishment of his friends by whom he was regarded as a particularly quiet stay at home sort of person accepted a diplomatic embassy to the courts of germany and russia likely to detain him twelve or eighteen months he had besought and received annies permission to correspond with her letters from a mind and heart like his could not be otherwise than interesting his words returned repeatedly to her thoughts she loved him sufficiently to feel a degree of pleasure in the idea of adding to his happiness and six months after he had left england her answer to a letter from him in which generalities had merged into personalities contained the following words if dearest henry the gratitude and reverence of one whose best affections still linger with the dead are indeed of sufficient worth to give you the happiness which you tell me rests with me i will not refuse to become yours if a twelvemonth hence you still desire it give me that time the painful feelings with which i now look to marriage as almost faithlessness to one who though the actual words never passed his lips i do believe loved me most truly will then perhaps in some degree at least have subsided and i may be able to give you all that your wife should bestow i know and feel that time is the comforter as well as the destroyer and that though it is actual agony to think that my heart will ever so change as to feel less acutely the loss i have sustained i know it will and must and that it is right and best it should do so give me but time then dearest henrylet the memories of the dead be so softened that i may do my duty lovingly as well as faithfully to the living and till that may be let us continue as we have been to the world and to each other lord st clair did not hesitate to accede to this request even his letters did not change their tone he was still the friend more than the lover but he contrived to shorten the period of his voluntary banishment and eleven months after he had quitted england beheld his return there was a change in annie however which alarmed and pained him she was pale and thin and strangely and feverishly restless lady emily from being constantly with her had not remarked the great alteration but acknowledged in answer to st clairs anxious queries that she had seemed more unhappy the last four months that the calm and tranquil cheerfulness which had characterised her had given place to alternations of fitful gaiety and more frequent depression but what had occasioned it she could not tell she thought it might be physical as she had had a slight cough hanging about her for weeks which nothing she took seemed to remove four months previous was it possible that she might regret the promises she had so ingenuously given lord st clair more than once caught her glance fixed with a degree of pleading earnestness upon him as if she failed in courage to speak and as he was not one to encourage painful doubts where a word might solve them he took an opportunity of kindly and affectionately inquiring why she was so changed the cause was soon revealed about ten days after she had written to him as we related she had seen amongst other despatches directed to lord st clair which were lying on the library table waiting to be arranged and forwarded a single letter the writing of the direction of which had caused such a sudden thrill and subsequent faintness that it had been with difficulty she refrained from involuntarily tearing it open to know from whom it came she said that she had endeavoured to conquer the strange fancy to reason with herself that the resemblance to a writing she but too well remembered was mere accident yet so powerful had been its effect that even when she recalled the superscription the same feelings of heart sickness returned as had overpowered her when it first met her eye it had been put up with other public despatchesthe family having before its arrival closed and sent more private letters that as he had never alluded to it she had struggled to believe it could have been nothing of interest to her and yet the subject would not leave her mind allowing her neither sleep at night nor rest by day she knew it folly she said but conquer it she could not and that fearful state of internal restlessness was fated to continue for most unfortunately the packet of despatches in which that was had been lost in the overflow of a river which the messenger who bore it had to ford and lord st clair had never alluded to it for his letters to annie had been shorter than he liked from the annoyance and increase of trouble which the loss of this very packet had occasioned him in his political employment that the post mark seemed italian was all she could tell him and his anxiety became as great as hers though that it could really be what it was easy to discover annie really imagined it he believed impossible meanwhile the poor girls healthunder a suspicion which however imaginary was very fearfuldid not improve and her relatives rested not till a skilful physician had been consulted his opinion instantly decided them and despite of annies resistance a tour on the continent was resolved on lord ennerdale desiring her not to let him see her again till she could bring back her own rosy smiling self the party consisted of only lord st clair lady emily and annie and making only a brief stay at paris they proceeded in a south easterly direction crossed the jura and fixed their residence for some weeks in the vicinity of geneva the complete change of air and scene seemed so to renovate annie that physical strength gradually returned and with it more apparent calm of mind congeniality of taste in our companions is indispensable for the real enjoyment of travelling and this annie fully possessed those three years of intimate association with the apparently cold and passionless lady emily had deepened annies regard but not altered her cousins chilling manner but this delicious commune with nature uninterrupted by intercourse with the world caused her more than once so to relax as to excite even annies surprise and convince her more than ever that lady emily had not always been what she then was they were sitting one evening under the projecting roof of a jutting gallery belonging to a cottage in the beautiful valley of chamouni lord st clair had that day left them to join a party of excursionists in an expedition somewhat too fatiguing for his companions the cottage situated on a projecting mount or cliff commanded a more extensive view than the parish of prieur itself permits the rich luxuriance of the vale stretched beneath them intersected with cliffs covered with foliage and large patches of emerald moss and variously tinted lichen clothing the grey stones here and there a true alpine cottage peeped through dark woods of fir and larch and the blue and sparkling arve glided noiselessly along still more lovely in the evening hour as the glowing rays of sunset are contrasted with the deep shadows falling all around above them towered mountains of every form blending their separate charms in a whole so sublime and extensive that height and breadth were lost in distance misty vapours or light fleecy clouds were ever wreathing their snow capped brows while mont blanc itself stood alone in its sublime grandeur and in the unsullied purity of its snowy robe the sun itself was invisible but its glowing rays were shed upon the mountain dyeing it with a deep rosy flood of light peculiar to that locality and only to be described by its thrilling resemblance to that fearfully brilliant flush sometimes traced on the countenance of mortal beauty when life is fading imperceptibly away and the strange yet perfect loveliness rivets not alone the eye but the imagination with a species of fascination which we have no power to resist the period of its continuance might have been from fifteen to twenty minutes when it suddenly changed into a pale greyish tinge of a shade and appearance so peculiar that it affected the heart and mind with the same species of awe as that with which we regard the sudden change from brilliant life to the ashy hues of death an exclamation of admiration even of delight broke so naturally from the lips of lady emily st clair that her young companion looked up in her face with astonishment have i not surprised you annie she said with a quiet smile are you still amongst those who believe that one so cold and silent as i am now can have no feeling for enjoyment can see no beauty in nature no poetry in the universe no replied annie earnestly i know so much of you that mere superficial observers can never know that i can well believe there is still more which my inexperienced eye can never reach i wish she added after a short pause and with some hesitation that i were worthy to know you as you are that you loved me sufficiently to unveil sometimes that which is so studiously concealed do not do me such wrong dearest annie as to doubt that i love you because i am to you in general as to indifferent persons i cannot change the manner acquired by months nay whole years of suffering even to those whose affections i would do much to win there is little of interest and much of suffering in my past life but you shall hear it if you will not if it give you pain my kind friend said annie but she looked inquiringly as she seated herself on a cushion at her companions feet and rested her arm on her knee lady emily paused as if collecting firmness for the task then briefly spoke as follows few who have only known me the last fifteen or sixteen years would believe that i was once annie far more enthusiastic and dreamy and what the world calls romantic than you were when i first knew you an ardent love for the exalted and the beautiful alike in man and nature a restless craving for the pure and spiritual an almost loathing for all that was mean and earthly these were the elements of my romance but carried to an excess that instead of being beneficial as they might have been became indeed the height of folly which is the worlds meaning for such feelings i was a poet a visionary an enthusiast feeding a naturally vivid imagination on the burning dreams of minds whose wings soared even higher than my own by my family i was regarded with admiration and love as one whose talents would raise me far higher than my rank i had the advantage of association with the genius and the student and their opinion of my powers their sympathy urged me on till i was astonished at myself but there was a blank in the midst of pleasure i soared too high in the moments of excitement my mind unable to sustain itself in the airy realms of an ill regulated imagination was fraught on its return to earth with a gloom and void even more exquisitely painful than its precious mood had been joyful yet had poetry been my only gift its pains and pleasures might have been confined to my own breast but the powers of satire mine in no ordinary degree were far more dangerous to myself in their baneful influence upon others i indulged in the most cutting irony careless whom i might wound regardless of any feeling but my own pleasure i knew religion only as a name whose every ordinance was fulfilled by attending public service once a week i heard and read that to some minds poetry vitalizes religion for every throb unanswered upon earth lifted up the whole soul to that world where all was love and all was joy i laughed at such romance as i termed it for i could not understand it in the gloom and void occasionally felt pride and triumph at my own superiority to my fellows were the constant occupants of my heart urging me but too often to level the dart of venomed satire on those whose more worldly sentiments and coarser minds excited my contempt even the young and gentle often bled beneath that cruel lash if in the merest trifle of word or manner they differed from my idea of excellence my own family loved me too indulgently to be aware of the dreadful extent of this vice henry the only one whose noble nature and judicious feeling would have guided me aright was a student in germany and i had no one whose counsels might have spared me in some measure at least the bitter self reproach which heightened the chastisement preparing for me but i am lingering amongst the numerous guests at my fathers was one combining noble birth genius light and ready wit with all the fascination of sparkling features graceful form and a manner whose elegance i have never yet seen equalled he courted my society he did not flatter for that i ever scorned but he appreciated his manner always evinced respect for me and pleasure at having found one to whom he could converse on nobler subjects than the mere chit chat of a fashionable world it needs not to enlarge upon our intimacy or the means he took to make me believe without in the least committing himself that i was to him the object not of esteem or admiration alone why should i hesitate to speak that which is now as if it had never been i loved him annie how deeply and passionately till my whole soul was wrapped in his image and my very nature so changed that i looked on this world with gentler feelings and believed that the earth which contained him could not be as little worth as i had deemed it all this would be useless to repeat the blank in my heart was filled up my womans soul which neither fame nor talent could satisfy was at rest the actual words had not passed his lips indeed but yet i did not could not doubt him that is not love in which a doubt can enter i was visiting a mutual friend and daily in expectation of his arrival to relieve the yearning restlessness of anticipation i had taken my tablets to a concealed nook in the garden and was pouring out my whole soul in burning words when his voice arrested me the remark preceding his words i had not heard but all which followed is written on my brain propose to emily st clair he said in a tone which while it retained its beautiful harmony was so changed in expression that i only knew it his by the agony thrilling through my whole being at the words percy you are mocking me marry a bluea wit worse still a poet pray procure me an admission into a lunatic asylum the very hour i make the proposal for at least were i sufficiently mad to say will you have me certain as i am of being accepted i should escape being rendered more so no my good fellow the lady is agreeable enough as long as i am unchained but once fettered her folly and romance would send me to heaven much sooner than i have the least inclination for why were i in such a predicament as marriage with her how do you suppose i could live for ever the actor i am now when conversing with her drawing her out as it were to afford me amusement afterwards the very idea is exhaustion it is well her brothers have not seen the progress of your attentions was the reply you might have to answer for such species of amusement nonsense man were the courts of love in vogue as they were once she could allege nothing against me to make me her prisoner for life why it was the very effort to keep up the liaison and yet not say one word which her romantic fancy could construe into an offer that was so fatiguing her delight in my society was so evident that i was obliged to be on my guard words meaningless to others would have misericordia out upon your consummate self conceit she never forgot her self respect was the reply and the voices faded in the distance and you heard this exclaimed annie indignation compelling the interruption gracious heaven can there be such men be thankful you can still ask such a question dearest annie i did hearand more remained outwardly calm at that moment i believe i was conscious but of one feeling not indignation no he might have spoken yet more cruelly more contemptuously i heard but one felt but one truththat he did not love methat the deep whelming passion he had excited was unreturnedthat he scorned those gifts which i had lately only valued as i believed them valued by him my brain reeled for the moment but sense and energy returned as gradually but with fearful distinctness his every word and tone resounded in my ear anguish which had been the first feeling was as nothing literally nothing to that chaos of misery which followedto disrobe the idol my heart had so madly worshipped of the bright colouring of honour and worth to teach myself he was unworthy had deceived wilfully deceived what was the suffering of unrequited love compared with this he had said too that my preference was so evident i would have grasped the faintest whisper of an offer i knew the charge was false as himself but that he should have believed it added its bitter pang how was i to act my brow was burning my pulses throbbing yet return to my own home i would not i would not feign illness though god knows it would have been little feigned i would meet him pass in his company the period i had promised to my friend and then i cared not and you did this asked annie clasping lady emilys hand in both hers and almost startled at its coldnessthe only proof that the narrator told not her tale unmoved i did more my child though poetry and satire were now to me but fearful spectres from which a tortured spirit shrankthough that very hour i burned every fragment of composition once so precious yet during three long weary weeks i was to him and to all around me as i had always been perhaps even more sparkling more animated and far more joyous without any visible effort i so far changed in bearing towards him that instead of finding in his conversation as before an echo to my own i questioned i doubted and more than once i saw him quail beneath my glance or tone compelled ere we parted to doubt the influence which he had boasted he possessed but what availed all this it did not could not quench the burning fever within and when i returned to the quiet of my fathers roof the tight strung cord was snapped and overwrought energies so gave way that for months nay years the effects of that struggle were visible in a state of health so precarious so exhausted that i have seen my poor father pace my chamber hour by hour in silent agony without the power to address him for many months all was to me a blank yet i believe i was not wholly insensible nor always under the influence of fever ere i recovered sufficiently again to mingle with the world he who had so deceived me became the husband of another and that other one who had been my dearest friend and who has shunned me since as if she too had deceived and had courted me from policy not love i have had no proof that this really was the case but my faith in all that was good and beautiful and true was so shaken i believed it as a thing that must be for such was human nature this marriage sufficiently accounted to my family for my mysterious illness indignation was so generally felt that had i been awake to outward things my mind might have been perfectly at rest that i had given him no undue encouragement and his manner had indeed been such as to give not alone to myself but to all who had observed no doubt of his apparent meaning but i knew nothing of all this while chained to my couch by bodily exhaustion memories of my past life rose to appal me and to add the bitter agony of unmitigated self reproach to that of unrequited affection precious gifts had been intrusted to me and what account could i render of them at that awful throne before which daily almost hourly i expected to be summoned they had estranged me from my god and from his creatures i learned to feel his words were true unguided by either religion or reason what could i have been but the idle follower of folly and romance no throb of kindness or of gentle feeling had interfered to check the contempt i felt for and breathed in cutting satire upon others i had wilfully trampled on many a young kind heart and it was but just that i should have been thus trampled on myself presumption and self conceit caused me to smile to scorn the censure of the world and in all probability my manner had been too unguarded this bitter self humiliation only increased the struggle to forget that i had loved in reproaching myself i ceased to reproach him the pride that had supported me was gone these thoughts continually pressing on heart and brain were i am well aware the sole sources of my long and incurable disease but i had no power to shake them off and fearfully as i suffered i have never ceased to bless the gracious hand that sent the chastening and recalled me ere it was too late unto himself lady emily paused the quivering of her voice and lip betraying emotion which she evidently struggled to suppress annies tears were falling on her hand and ere she spoke again she bent down and kissed her forehead you now know dearest annie more of me than i ever breathed to mortal ear she resumed in her usual calm and quiet tone more than i ever thought could pass my lips but do not weep for me my child i am happier safer now than i could have been had the wild misguided feelings of earlier life continued it was no small portion of my suffering so to control myself as never to give vent to the satirical bitterness that when i rejoined the world tinged my words and thoughts more darkly than ever the determination never to use that dangerous gift gave to my words and manner a stiffness and cold reserve which have banished from me all those whose regard i would have done much to win many young loving hearts have shrunk from me perceiving no sympathy in their warm imaginations and glowing feelings and i dared not undeceive them for i felt no confidence in myself and feared again to avow sentiments i had buried so deeply in my own heart others again shunned me because terrified at a semblance of austerity which they could not know was exercised only towards myself and frequently have i wept in secret at the loneliness which seemed to characterise my path on earth even you my annie gentle and forbearing as you were till i could not but love you have often checked your animated words beneath the cold withering influence of my glance or smile do not call it cold and withering my dear kind friend replied annie warmly i learned to love you long before i dared hope to win your regard but could i doubt you in my hour of anguish though even then i did you wrong for i thought i was alone in my miseryand you had suffered doubly more you needed not such awful chastisement my love i brought it on myself but you are right fearful as is the death of a beloved one it is happiness compared to the death of love to the blasting of our belief in the good and true the disrobing an idol till we ask what it is we have loved my dearest annie bless god that this you have been spared annie was silent several minutes and then raising her head she abruptly and strangely asked aye this but there are other trials oh lady emily what must be the agony of that heart who sacrificing for the sake of the living the memories of the supposed dead finds too late that circumstances not death have come between her and the object of her first affections that they love each other still yet must be strangers parted more completely than by death what must be her duty then you ask me a difficult question my dear child if the heart clings to such a thought better never wed a bright gleam as of relief flitted over annies features but changing the subject as abruptly as she had entered upon it she asked with hesitation and that poetic talent to which you have alluded do you never exercise it now never replied lady emily taking her companions arm and entering the house on my first recovery i dared not for my sinful abuse of the power had been too recent though i do believe that as my taste had completely changed in the poets which i read so too would my writings have done but year after year passed gradually i destroyed every memorial of my passed life and found peace and happiness in the employment which you have seen and aided until at length even the inclination to write passed away and i forgot even as you must dear girl she added with a smile that i had been a poet and one of no mean grade the silent pressure of annies hand was sufficient guarantee for lady emily that her confidence had not been misplaced and she was happier for she no longer feared that misunderstanding annie would at length shrink from her we will not linger with our travellers while en route they visited all of interest in naples and rome and resolved on passing the winter at florence many weeks had passed in their delightful tour annies health was decidedly renovated but there were still times when her spirits seemed to sink beneath a weight of depression for which neither of her relatives could account each month that passed diminished the time specified by annie as the term of mourning and yet lord st clair vainly tried to rejoice he saw that instead of decreasing the memory of reginald became strongerthat the extraordinary impression made by the superscription of the letter would remainand ardently he wished that annie had followed her impulse and opened it ere it was sent on he never spoke of love he never recalled her promise and annie so blessed him for his forbearance that could she but have realized the universal belief in the death of reginald she would at once have given him her hand glad to exchange the torturing doubts which engrossed her for the tranquil calm which must she thought attend devotion to one who so nobly proved the love he bore herself the many interesting works of ancient art in florence so riveted the attention and occupied the time of our english travellers that the one subject engrossing the whole attention of the florentines was for some little time unheeded the town was full of the unrivalled success of a young sculptor who had burst into fame no one knew how or where he had been studying the last two years amidst the superb specimens of art in the galleries of florence but so silently so unassumingly that he was only known as famous his copies of canova and other celebrated sculptors had been pronounced perfect by able judges but it was not till he had completed an original group that he at all seemed to sue for notice and when that did appear the easily excited italians received it with such universal admiration that the unknown artist was sought for on all sides courted flattered and better far appreciated by those whose opinions were of value italy is indeed the country where talent may rise to eminence fostered and cherished by the encouragement for which it so thirsts in this case however the interest excited originally by genius was heightened by the reserved manners of the young sculptor who rather shrunk from than courted notice except from the italians themselves it was rarely an english soire could obtain the favour of his presence his appearance and name declared him spanish a supposition which as he never contradicted it gained universal belief that he spoke english french and italian as fluently as spanish and was intimately acquainted with their literature only proved that his mental capabilities were not confined merely to his art how he found time to execute all the orders for busts ornamental groups etc which he received was a mystery to the idler and a wonder even to the brethren of his craft greatly heightened when his first original group appeared it was not alone the execution but the daring boldness of his subject which had occasioned such universal notice boldly leaving the beaten path of classic subjects his group though consisting only of three figures embodied a striking incident in the earliest stage of the french revolution a young and beautiful girl had flung herself before an aged parent clasping his neck with one hand and by the attitude of the other combined with the expression of the face was evidently imploring life for him even by the sacrifice of her own on the touching and to the italian eye somewhat peculiar beauty of the face the matchless grace of the attitude and exquisitely modelled limbs the sculptor appeared to have lingered till he had out done himself the countenance of the father breathed but admiring love for the heroic being whom his arm encircled as if every thought centred in her to the total exclusion of all terror for himself before them in a crouching attitude as in the act of filling a goblet with the loathsome fluid which deluged the streets was a half naked form whose ruffian features and muscular limbs contrasted well with the graceful beauty and nobleness of form in the other figures the head was upraised a withering sneer upon the lips a combination of triumph and barbarity on the whole countenance which so explained the tale it recorded that as an animated italian told lord st clair the heart of the gazers throbbed and the cheek paled as if life itself were before them it stood in an apartment of the palazzo vecchio where he entreated his english friends to go and see it i will not only see this wonderful group but make acquaintance with its artist he replied for after hearing all this know him i will that you will find some difficulty in doing was the rejoinder he shrinks from all you english besides he is i believe now at bologna and his return is uncertain never mind trust me for making acquaintance with this lion shy though he be there is but one fault in his female figure observed a gentleman who had joined the group and was greeted with much warmth by lord st clair a fault which we english ought to consider a virtue but yet is in contradiction to signor castellans apparent reserve towards our countrymen the beauty of the female is too english for a french incident and purely french characters it is very lovely i grant but the loveliness is our own the observation naturally produced a warm discussion which ended as most discussions do in each party retaining his own opinion and lord st clair taking his newly found old friend home with him introduced him to lady emily and annie and are you settled down at last kenrich tired of wanderings and adventures though last time i heard of you you were actually enjoying the wars and cabals of madrid i am not very sober yet st clair but i was fool enough to join the carlists three or four years ago and their barbarity to my own countrymen so sickened me of war that i threw up my commission and have never drawn sword since what barbarity asked lord st clair catching almost by instinct more than look the expression of annies face why you must have heardthe english papers were full of itthat fine fellow captain de vere was amongst them he and eight or ten others were taken prisoners and were all murderedfor it was nothing else but are you sure he was amongst them we all knew and loved de vere and long hoped he might have escaped and only been reported amongst the killed escaped my dear fellow how was that possible besides he was so terribly wounded that he could not have survived even had they not so cruelly dealt with him i could not save him but i saw him decently interred and from that moment loathed military service and left spain it was full time i think quietly rejoined lady emily annie will you try if you can match this shade for me among the chenilles in my room i cannot finish this leaf without it and your eyes are better than mine annie took the chenille designated from the frame over which her cousin was bending so intently in seeming that she did not even look up as she addressed her and quietly left the room the moment she did so edward kenrich burst into lavish praises of her beauty declaring that was the exact style of castellans figure and therefore he was right and it must be too english for perfect art so running on in his usual wild strain that lord st clair had great difficulty in bringing him back to the point from which he had started and gathering from him every particular of the death of reginald de vere annie did not reappear and lady emilys great desire to finish her leaf seemed to have subsided with her absence for she made no effort to recall her just before dinner however lord st clair noticing the flutter of her white dress between the orange trees which almost concealed the balcony leading from the drawing room hastily rejoined her she looked up in his face without a word but he answered her thoughts tenderly and gently repeating all the information he had gained there could be no doubt and for one brief minute the poor girls head sunk on his arm with a sudden burst of tears i know it is all folly henry i had no right to hope forgive me i do but distress you and yet that writingthat strange writing whom could it have been from not from reginald dearest or it would have been to you not to me has that never struck you annie it had not till that moment and it convinced her she remained alone that evening in deep meditation and earnest prayer and the result was a firm conviction that nothing but a new and solemn duty would restore her to the calm of mind for which she yearnedthat devotion to another well worthy of it must draw her from herself a sleepless night confirmed this resolution and the very next day the promise passed her lips to be the wife of lord st clair within a week of their return to england a few days afterwards they went to the celebrated church of santa croce during vesper service the magnificent interior heightened in its effect by the light and shadow flung by huge waxen tapers the superb monuments the white stoled monks and dark dresses of the officiating priests the kneeling and standing groups silent and motionless as the marble monuments aroundthe deep toned organ and swelling voices of the choristers completely enchained the imagination of our travellers it was strange excited almost to pain as she was that annie at length found her whole attention unconsciously fixed on a single figure who was leaning against the tomb of michael angelo his face was turned from her but there was something in his bearing and his attitude which riveted her as by a spell and the longing to look on his face became strangely and indefinably intense the soft light of a taper burning over the tomb brought out in good relief the strangers uncovered head whose small and classic shape was shaded by clustering hair of glossy black there he is there is our sculptor renaud castellan whispered one of the italians who had accompanied them directing lord st clairs attention to the very figure on whom annies gaze was so strangely fixed but even as he spoke the young man moved his position and disappeared in one of the aisles leaving annies desire to see his face ungratified and only permitting lord st clair to catch the outline of his figure was not mrs de veres maiden name castellan st clair asked of annie as they walked together from the church to the house of their italian friend who had claimed them for a petit souper and some music the answer was in the affirmative and lord st clair remarked it would be strange if this young spaniard proved to be of the same family i must seek him out see his group first was the rejoinder of one of the party while to annie the words seemed to disperse the miserable doubts again thronging round herbeing of the same family might account for a casual resemblance it was with some little difficulty annie was prevailed upon to sing but when once seated at her harp timidity gave place to her real love of the art and the simple purity the touching pathos of her style charmed all who heard the entrance of a guest had not interrupted her nor disturbed the listeners lord st clair was amused at the look of admiring perplexity with which he regarded annie not himself perceiving that where the italian stood the light fell upon her countenance so as to give it a different appearance and expression to that which was generally perceivable approaching her as soon as the buzz of admiration had somewhat subsided he engaged her in animated conversation nor was lord st clairs curiosity lessened by hearing him inquire if the signorina were not acquainted with the young sculptor of whom all florence raved much surprised she answered in the negative but surely you have been introduced to him have you not no replied annie smiling at his earnestness i never even heard of him till i came here and he has been at bologna till this evening ever since then he has seen you signora either in his sleeping or waking dreams was the rejoinder in so animated a tone that it arrested the attention of the whole party for never did marble and life so resemble each other as the beauty of your face and of his creation surely you must all see it he continued turning to his friends with the sparkling vivacity peculiar to his countrymen when excited why it is not feature alone but the character the grace the similarity is perfect i told you so but you would not believe me bluntly answered kenrich i told you it was an english face and english character but you all denied it i am glad my lovely countrywoman has opened your eyes why this is better and better annie do not blush so prettily about it whispered lord st clair as attention once aroused the similarity was universally acknowledged if the resemblance be chance it is something to marvel at if intentional why i shall be jealous of the sculptor you need not henry was the reply in a tone so sad that it pained him well well we will go and see it at least love and judge of its merit with our own eyes the next day accordingly they went and the most convincing proof of the perfection of the work were not disappointed neither its beauty nor its eloquence had been exaggerated and the resemblance to annie was so extraordinary that the eyes of all the spectators within the room were attracted towards her but the expression of the countenance of the father in the group riveted her attention far more than the female figure it was with a heavy sigh she turned from it and was pale and silent during their way home but st clair was so engrossed by the beauty of the work the strange resemblance and his resolution to leave no stone unturned to gain the acquaintance of the young artist that it passed unnoticed even by him why what ails you annie are you not well dear kindly inquired lady emily some hours later wondering why her young companion did not join her as usual she had sought her in her own room and found her with her face buried in her hands and her whole attitude denoting suffering henry has gone to seek out this signor castellan to find out if he can in what this strange similarity originated and who and what he is shall i tell you answered annie in a tone so strange that it startled almost as much as the whiteness of her face reginald castellan de vere was not his mothers name castellan and has he not often and often boasted his descent from spanish heroes and from this feeling fought for spain in preference to any other country did he not always love the art of sculpture can it be chance that has marked the father and daughter of that group with the characteristics of the revered friend and favourite companion of his youth no no no oh lady emily you bade me once thank god that i had never been deceived teach me how to bear this bear what my poor child replied her companion soothingly as annie threw herself on her neck in fearful agitation if this be indeed as you say what can there be but happiness for you it is for another we must feel happiness for me and he has never even so far thought of me as to tell me the report of his death was false and he still livednever recalled himself to one whom when he departed he so lovedloved how know i that he never said it why should i believe him different to others my dearest annie this is not like yourself why if he have ceased to love you should the work of his handa work which must have employed his mind and heart long days and nightsbear the impress of your face and form memory association mere casualtythe days of his boyhood may be dear to his mind but how can affection even a brothers have inspired that group whenwhen he has allowed me so long to believe him dead it is all a mystery my dear child but i feel convinced it will be solved if we can really prove his identity may he not have written and the letter miscarried annie wildly raised her head may he not have been deceived perhapsfor we can never trace rumoursbut may he not have heard that of you which to a mind like his would cause him to shrink from recalling himself he left you such a child how might he build on having so won your regard that you would remain single for his sake dearest annie if this indeed be not all imagination and reginald really lives trust me you will be happy yet how will a few judicious words change the whole current of thoughts and feeling before lady emily ceased to speak annie was weeping such blessed tears the proud cold mood which had her companion spoken as her own experience of mans nature must have dictated might have been retained and made her miserable for life dissolved before returning trust and hope she dared not define what it was she hoped but it was not till she heard lord st clairs voice and she tried to spring forwards to meet him and know the truth that a sudden revulsion of feeling so completely overpowered her that she sunk back upon the couch how dared she rejoice even if reginald lived what could he be to her who was the promised bride of another emily exclaimed lord st clair in utter astonishment as on his entering the drawing room his cold and dignified sister hastily met him and taking both his hands tried to speak but failed and leaning her head against him he felt that she was in tears what is the matter love something very dreadful for you to weep she controlled herself with a strong effort and entered at once into the recital of the scene between her and annie could it possibly be as she supposed it may be was the reply in a calm firm tone there is nothing impossible in it i went to his lodgings but as i supposed he was either out or too much engaged to be seen but i am to meet him to night at the contessa corsinis and this strange mystery will be unravelled and you dear henry she could say no more so holy seemed his feelings and i my dear sister will act as that man should whose aim is not the gratification of his own desires but the happiness of one far dearer than himself i do not tell you i shall not feel and deeply but does the warrior shrink from the battle before him because he may be wounded you may love me more my emily if you will he continued fondly passing his arm round her and kissing her cheek for affection is always balm but i will have no tearsthey are only for the unworthy where is annie poor child she must be overwrought from many causes let me see her she will be calmer then he was right what passed between them it needs not to relate our readers can little enter into the high character of lord st clair if they cannot satisfy themselves as to the manner as well the nature and extent of the sacrifice he made he was not one to wring the gentle heart he so unselfishly resigned by the betrayal of personal suffering he coveted the continuance nay the increase of her regard and nobly he earned it it was a brilliant scene on which a few hours later he entered introduced by the same italian signor lanzi who had been the first to trace the resemblance between annie and the female figure of the group but neither loveliness nor talent both of which thronged the halls had at that moment attraction for lord st clair his glance had singled out a tall slight form leaning against a marble pillar and half shaded by the drapery of a curtain his head was bent down he seemed in the act of listening and replying to the smiling jests of the countess who was sitting near him the cheek and brow were very pale and the mouth when still somewhat stern in expression but it was a fine face bearing the stamp of genius too visibly ever to be passed unremarked you may smile and look incredulous signor were the words that first met the ears of the english nobleman from the young countess in italys sweetest tone but since you deserted us for bologna a living likeness has appeared of your beautiful amle mademoiselle de sombreuil herself perhaps he replied half smiling fancy would indeed have served me well had such a chance occurred you are quite wrong i doubt whether mademoiselle de sombreuil would herself resemble your fancy statue as much as la bella inglese does la bella inglese who may she be inquired the young sculptor somewhat agitated a lovely girl who only appeared in florence as you left it lanzi informed me the resemblance was so perfect he imagined she must know you but she had never even heard of you till she came here and what may be her name as you seem so interested i regret that i cannot tell you it is so truly english that it will bear no italian accent therefore i cannot remember it but find lanzi i expect him here to night and he will tell you all about her the arrival of new guests and the attention of the countess called for from himself the sculptor hastily turned as in the act of seeking the individual she had named he had not advanced many yards when he started violently and with a sudden impulse retreated into a small withdrawing room near which he had stood why shun me signor castellan inquired a frank kind voice in english and lord st clairs hand was extended and after a moments visible hesitation accepted and almost convulsively pressed why this long mysterious concealment my young friend were there none think you to rejoice that you were still amongst the living was not your lordship aware of my existence insignificant as it is more than a twelvemonth since my own hand and signature were surely sufficient guarantee he answered in a cold proud tone then you did write and annie was not deceived little did i know the precious intelligence contained in the packet lost on its way to me in russia and the want of which in a political view caused me such annoyance but why wait so long my dear fellow to give us tidings so many would have rejoiced to hear so many there were more then to mourn me dead than to love me living but forgive me he continued less bitterly your family would have been my friends and therefore was it i wrote to tell you that i lived but was there not one reginald who deserved an earlier notice at your hands why leave her so long to mourn you as dead and then to learn such joyful tidings from others than yourself the ties of early youth of fond associations i should have thought sufficient of themselves alone to prevent such wrong reginalds very lip grew white as he replied was not her husband the fittest person to give lady st clair such tidings her husband reginald you speak enigmas how gasped the young man as he laid his cold and trembling hand on his companions arm is not annie grey your wife no replied lord st clair the peculiar expression clouding his noble countenance for the moment passing unnoticed her heart was with the dead reginald de vere struggled with bursting emotion but his trembling limbs refused to support him and sinking powerlessly on a sofa he covered his face with his hands and wept such tears as only spring from manhoods unutterable joy it still wanted an hour to midnight and lady emily was in vain endeavouring to prevail on annie to retire to rest you are feverish and worn out already annie how will you be able to support the excitement of to morrow without rest to night it would be no rest if i lie down i cannot sleep only let me know he lives and she twined her arms round lady emilys neck and looked so appealingly so mournfully no heart could have urged more there was a pause of several minutes and then annie started up it is henrys step she exclaimed and would have sprung forward but her feet felt rooted to the ground another moment lord st clair was at her side promise me to bear the shock of joy better than you did the shock of grief or i can tell you nothing he said gently but there was no need for another word faint as she was every object in the room seeming to swim before her eyes every word to be indistinct yet one figure was visible one voice calling her his own own anniebeseeching her to forgive and bless him reached her heart and loosed its icy chains till she could breathe again she felt not that strength had entirely deserted her for she was clasped to the heart of reginald de vere and the deadly faintness passed in the gushing tears that fell upon his bosom mysterious as was reginald de veres silence its causes may be summed up in a few words to his own generous deed recorded in the early part of our tale he owed the preservation of his life when bleeding and exhausted he was led a prisoner to the carlist camp he was instantly recognised by the poor woman whose child he had saved and whom he had sent on to her husband the tale of his kindness his generosity his bravery had been repeated again and again by the happy wife and created amongst the common soldiery a complete sensation in his favour so that very many were found eager and willing to aid juan pacheco in his resolution to return the good conferred and save his wifes benefactor at the hazard of his own life he had already been disgusted with his life in the camp the beauty of his young wife had exposed him and her to insults which as he had no power to retaliate urged him to seize the first opportunity to desert one by one the prisoners had been led to execution and one by one had fallen reginald unable to support himself from wounds and exhaustion though quite conscious he was placed there to die was loosely bound to a post as a better mark to the soldiers who fronted him they firedthe girthings which bound him gave way and a dead faint succeeded but they had fired with harmless weapons and when reginald awoke from what he fancied death he found himself in a covered cart carefully watched and tended by the young mother and her boy whom he recognised at once his captains uniform placed on the body of a young spaniard who had fallen in battle and whose features were not unlike those of de vere no doubt causing edward kenrichs belief in his being really reginald and his having been in consequence honourably interred juan pachecos knowledge of the wilds and intricate windings of his native country enabled him ably to elude the pursuit to which as a deserter he was liable but de vere suffered so dreadfully from alternate fever and exhaustion during the journey that many times his kind preservers feared their care would be in vain and death would release him ere earthly rest and shelter were obtained but at length the goal was gaineda small cottage belonging to a monastery of saint iago situated in so retired a pass of the pyrenees that none but mountaineers knew of its existence under the skilful medical aid of one of the fathers reginald slowly regained health but it was not till nearly a year after his supposed death that he regained the elasticity and entire use of his limbs such as he had previously enjoyed the severity of monastic discipline did not characterise the monks of saint iago they were but few in number old and respectable men who had turned from the distracting turmoils of their unhappy country and sought peace in study and deeds of kindness in one of these aged men reginald discovered an uncle of his motherone who had always mourned her departure to another land and union with a heretic but who had loved her to the end and was willing to receive with affection any of her children the fearful sufferings and deep melancholy of the young englishman had attracted him even before the picture of his mother which reginald constantly wore discovered the relationship between them for nearly two years de vere remained in this solitude the fear of drawing down ruin and misery on his preservers prevented his writing to his commanding officer to state his escapepadre felipo alleging the state of the country was such that his letter might not only be seized and himself retaken but pacheco exposed to the danger of execution as a deserter and abettor of his escape after the first year he made many attempts to communicate with his friends in englandannie grey amongst the numberbut he never heard in return therefore concluded and with justice that his letters had never reached a post but the two years of solitude instead of being a mental blank was the hinge of circumstances on which his whole after career turned to amuse his confinement and please the children he resumed the favourite amusement of his boyhood carving in wood and stone and with such success as to astonish himself he found an admirer and instructor where he little expected it in one of the monks and under his guidance and emboldened by encouragement made such rapid progress that his whole soul became wrapt in the desire to visit italy and study there his pantings for fame were now defineda flash of light seemed to have irradiated his whole being and to burst the chains of destiny which still cramped energy and life it was the consciousness of genius the proud conviction that he might indeed win the object of his love win and be worthy of her and give her a name proud as those of the men of genius whose lives they had read and venerated together the days when all the fortunes of the monks were devoted to their abbeys or to a patron saint were over and padre felipo rejoiced at possessing the means effectually to aid his young relative he settled on him a sum more than sufficient to gratify all his desires and reginald hesitated no longer to concentrate all his energies on this one pursuit he went to italy adopting the name of his benefactor which was also that of his mother and the wish not to be known in england until he had perfected himself in his art caused him to retain it even when no danger was attached to the acknowledgment of his existence but once in italy the yearning to hear of his family and friends became intense while a strange feeling of dread withheld him from again addressing annie it was two years and a half since they had parted two since he had been reported dead what might not have occurred in that interval he had left her free and so child like so simple in character that how could he how dared he indulge the hope that she had so returned his love as to remain single for his sake he had never spoken of love to her his affection was so pure and true that it had withheld him from linking by a too impetuous avowal her fate with one so gloomy as his own his genius seemed now to promise a fairer destiny but his heart still darkened by the fearful creed of fatalism believed that his very promise would be dashed with gloom and from the ascendency of this unhappy feeling failing in courage to address annie herself he wrote to one of his sisters beseeching a speedy reply with information of his father and all she could learn of miss grey the reply was many weeks before it came pleading the usual excuse for unjustifiable silencestress of occupation and dislike to letter writing basil de vere was in america and miss grey on the eve of marriage with lord st clair the whole london world was full of it on account of the disparity of years between the parties and because lord st clair had never seemed a marrying man but that it was a settled affair there was not the smallest doubt she wrote as if it could concern reginald but little but the pang was such as to confirm his fearful creed of an inexorable fate and plunge him into a despondency that genius itself seemed unable to remove at first he worked at his art mechanically but gradually his mind became aroused and he tried to forget the hearts anguish in such persevering labour that though to mere observers its effects were marvellous in so speedy a perfection it was in fact but the natural consequence of unceasing mental and manucipal work he constantly reproached himself for the agony he felt what right had he to suppose he had had any hold upon her why could he not rejoice in her happy prospects and write to tell her so but weeks merged into months ere he could do this and then he could not address herself but wrote to lord st clair revealing his escape his concealment and finally the promised success of his art with a calm affectionate message to annie the letter cost him a bitter struggle and with feverish restlessness he awaited the reply but when none came bitter thoughts possessed him he believed himself entirely forgotten and uncared for by his friends and every energy cramped save for his art by his spiritless belief he determined to remain so and shun alike england and her sons it was his fate he inwardly declared and he must bend to it and thus as is ever the case with these dark dreamers he created for himself the lonely doom he imagined his destiny marked out the death of his aged relative in the monastery of st iago placed a moderate fortune at his disposal and enabled him still more successfully and earnestly to pursue his art for a time the excitement attendant on the creation of his group roused him from himself but the reaction was plunging him still deeper into the dark abyss of misanthropy and gloom when his discovery through his own beautiful work the sudden and almost overwhelming happiness bursting through the darkness of his spirit in the consciousness that annie was free that she had ever loved him completely changed the current of his thoughts and permitted him a realization of joy before which the dark creed of destiny fled for ever it is in a cheerful sitting room of a picturesque dwelling on the banks of keswick lake that our readers may once more look on annie grey ere they bid her farewellannie grey indeed she was not but there was little change visible save that her fair cheek bore the rose and her beautiful form the roundness of more perfect health than when we last beheld her the large french windows opened on a small but beautiful garden where the taste of england and italy was so combined as to render its flowers and statues the admiration of every beholder the opposite window opened on a conservatory of beautiful exotics and exquisite specimens of painting and sculpture adorned the room itself an uncovered harp filled one corner on which the evening sun shining full from the stained glass of the western window flung tints as bright and changing as those of the kaleidoscope a hortus siccus opened on a group half arranged was on a table at which lady emily st clair was seated and annie was standing at her side with a volume of poems in her hand you idle girl you would have found what i wanted in five minutes a few years ago what are you thinking about ah reginald you are just in time or annies restlessness would have invaded your sanctum depend upon it and had i not cause a whole hour nearly two after your promised time and your cheek pale and your brow burning dearest do not let your art be dearer than your wife what jealous of all my marble figures love for shame replied her husband playfully twining his arm round her and kissing her cheek but i will plead guilty to fatigue to night and you shall cure me by my favourite song annie flew to her harp and de vere flinging himself on an easy chair drank in the sounds with an intensity of delight which he never believed that song could have had the power to produce yes he exclaimed as her sweet voice ceased what are palaces and their pleasures compared to an hour like this there is indeed no place like home what oh what would the artist and the student be without it why how is this signor rinaldo what extraordinary spell has been flung over you so to change your opinion of a song that once you would not even hear laughingly exclaimed lord st clair springing from the balcony into the room good evening mrs de vere i have some inclination to arrest you for using unlawful witchcraft on this gentleman even as i once thought of seizing him for allowing you to die of grief for his loss when he was all the time in life guilty guilty we both plead guilty replied reginald in the same tone but my guilt is of far deeper dye my annies witchery has but thrown such a halo over my home that all which speaks of its charm is as sweet to my ear as to my heart i am changed st clair and not merely in loving a song i once despised he added with much feeling but in being enabled to trace a hand of love where once i beheld but remorseless fate and my wife has done this so gently so silently that i guessed not her influence until i found myself joining her own lowly prayers and believing in the same sustaining faith and has she explained its mystery inquired lady emily with earnest interest no dear friend nor do i need it now the belief that a god of infinite love and compassion ordains all things yet leaves us the perfect exercise of our free will and in that freedom and the acts thence ensuing works out his divine decrees constraining no man yet bringing our most adverse wills to work out his heavenly rulethis is a belief that must be felt it cannot be explained and thrice blessed are they on whom its unspeakable comfort is bestowed the spirit of night founded on a hebrew apologue let there be light the omnific word had spoken and light was over the newly created world the pure element rushed from the spiritual courts of the high empyrean where it had reigned from everlasting in its subtle essence its ethereal exhalations fit only for the atmosphere of those angelic spirits who at the word of the highest took their appointed stations in the new formed world radiance too glorious too resplendent for mortal view filled the illimitable space uniting earth with heaven as by a cloud of glory where had been chaos circled with shapeless darkness now revolved in its vast flood of irradiating lustre the new work of the eternal thousands of radiant spirits floated to and fro on the refulgent flood the dazzling iris of their wings the music of their movements filling space with beauty and with sound while up from the lowest heaven to the high empyreanfrom the young seraph to the mighty spirits nighest the invisible throne whose resplendent presence dazzled even the purified orbs of their angelic brethrenup through every heaven and every rank sounded the glad hallelujahs of love and praise at every word of the highest creation sprung darkness borne back by the mighty torrent of effulgent light would have passed annihilated from the face of the new born world but shielded by angelic ministers it lingered in its new appointed sphere to do its destined bidding a firmament of sapphire stretched between the waters and the waters veiling the glory of the spiritual heavens from the grosser earth land rose from the liquid deep the rolling waters rushed impetuously to their destined boundaries held there by the omnific will and over the land the creating word went forth and at once the mountains raised their stupendous forms crowned with imperishable verdure the valleys and woods and glens rose and sunk in their appointed rest and flowers and trees and streams and thousand other charms of sight and sound and sense burst forth into perfected being myriads of angels hovered round visible then in their beauty but now heard only in the sweet breath of the gentle flowers in the varied sounds of the forest trees as the wind floats by in the summer breeze or the wintry storm in the musical gush of the silvery rill aye and in the deep hush and calm of the evening hour when nature herself as conscious of their ministering presence sinks into deep and spiritual repose but not for the abode of angelic spirits was this lovely world a new creation was to raise the voice of love and adoration and for such the spiritual light enveloping the infant globe was too ethereal too resplendent nought but the purified orbs of the angelic and archangelic hosts could gaze on its refined effulgence and therefore from the council of the eternal went forth the decree let there be two great lights to rule the earth the one by day and the one by night and they shall rule times and seasons and as he spake it was instantaneously the minute particles of the ethereal essence formed into an orb of splendour fraught with such power and glory that the lustrous flood rushed back into the heavenly fountearth needing it no morecircled by a diadem of many coloured light extending in resplendent rays over the new born world infusing its golden glory over the azure heavens clouds dyed with the brilliant tints of amethyst and rose and ruby formed before him and faded into glory as he passed earth through her ministering spirits of mount and wood and stream and flower sent up her thrilling song of thanksgiving echoed and re echoed by the myriads and myriads of angels peopling the spiritual courts heaven and earth rejoiced increased and dazzling beauty enveloped the new creation luscious fragrance issued from the flowers their petals adorned by their guardian seraphs expanded to the glorious orb and shone in his rays like gems the spirit of day selected from the highest and purest order of angels to renew and tend the beauteous work ascended his throne in the burning centre whence the effulgent rays emanate on earth but on which no mortal eye can look and proudly and rejoicingly as a bridegroom coming forth from his chamber as a youthful hero from his victorious career he guided the glorious luminary on its resplendent course joining his voice to the hallelujahs pealing around and in varied but equal beauty rose the second light but its guardian spirit selected from the same pure and exalted ranks looked on the effulgence of the orb of day and beheld his brother spirit circled by glory more dazzling than his own his invisible throne was within the silver radiance of his orb light ethereal and pure as the heavenly essence of which both sun and moon had been formed enriched him less glittering but equally resplendent but a deep shadow stole over the exquisite colouring of the spirits wings his voice of music refused to join the pealing hallelujahs wherefore he exclaimed and the troubled accents sounded through space strangely and darkly falling on the full tide of song wherefore do two monarchs occupy one throne wherefore to me is given less than to my brother i have loved i have served as faithfully as he why then should i be second and he the first earth rejoices when he comes heaven greets him with songs of love what need is there for me unless to me the same is given the hallelujahs ceased a sudden silence awful in its profoundness sunk on the rejoicing myriads the pure founts of ever living light became obscured thunder rolled over the illimitable expanse the superb radiance of the effulgent moon vanished and spreading far into the empyrean became the glorious host of stars each with its attendant spirit as it formed darkness clothed the complaining angel the beautiful luminary given to his charge seemed quivering and fading into space while still strong and rejoicing the orb of day held on his victorious career prostrate and convulsed with remorseful anguish the spirit sunk before the celestial hosts he who had been of that favoured class to whom the ways as well as the works of the highest were revealed had fallen lower in intellect and love than the youthful seraph whose task was only to worship and adore where could he hide himself from their searching orbs where fly from the flashing light that as the thunder rolled played round him marking him disgraced and criminal but him whom he had offended he loved as only angels love and so he welcomed that remorseful agony and prayed have mercy father of all beings my father have mercy on me and out of that awful stillness issued a thrilling strain of gushing musiclow soft spiritualthe murmured prayer from countless myriads for pardon for an erring brother the dimness fled from the founts of light the thunder ceased the scorching lightnings blazed no longer a mild effulgence circled the sorrowing spirit as he lay burying his refulgent brow in the darkened iris of his wings from the invisible throne of the highest the mightiest the best beloved most favoured messenger of the eternal the spirit of love winged his downward flight and on the instant space became irradiated new lustre spread over the vast courts of heaven the richest harmonies attended every movement of his wings angels and archangels seraphs and ministers pressed forwards as he passed to bask in the wondrous beauty of his lustrous face and raise anew the irrepressible burst of song spirit of night arise he said and the repentant angel lifted up his brow once more in returning hope so thrillingly that voice of liquid music fell arise and list the irrevocable decree of the eternal because thou hast envied the resplendence of the spirit of day the radiance of thine orb will henceforth be borrowed from his lustre and when yonder earth passes thee thou wilt stand as now thou dost deprived of thy glory and eclipsed either wholly or in part thou hast dared arraign the wisdom and the goodness of the highest and though he pardons yet must he chastise lest others sin yet more yet weep not repentant brother thy repining is forgiven and thou too shalt reign a monarch in thy radiance queen of the lovely night will thine orb be hailed the tears of thy repentance shall be a reviving balm to all that languish imparting consolation to the mourner rest to the weary soothing to the careworn strength to the exhausted peace shall be thy whisper and in thy kingdom of stillness and repose breathe thrillingly the promise of heaven and its rest go forth then on thy mild and vivifying career the orb of day will do his work and be hailed with rejoicing mirth but many a one shall turn to thee from him and in the radiance of thy tears find consolation he spake and behold the pale but lovely lustre in which the orb of night still shines flowed round her the spirit of night resumed his silvery throne and in the profound submissiveness of most perfect love entered upon his silent and beautiful career circled by the glittering radiance of the attendant stars soon was revealed the benignant mercy of his sentence even ere sin darkened the lovely earth his beauteous orb was hailed by all creation with rejoicing and when man fell when labour and weariness sickness and woe obtained dominion how soothing the consolation whispered by the spirit of night weeping oft at the remembrance of his own fault the spirit commiserates the tears of others floating over the earth invisible save through the exquisite beauty of his orb and the thrilling thoughts of heaven and immortality awakening in the soul which formed of kindred essence becomes thus conscious of his presence the spirit sends his soft rays formed from the liquid lustre of his tears on all who need his pity and repose by the couch of the suffererthe side of the sorrowingby the kneeling penitentby the wakeful mournerby the careworn and the wearyto the hut of the beggar as the palace of the kinghe sends pity and peace and consolation nor does he sympathise with sorrow alone the joy which in the sunshine and midst the turmoil of the world has agitated the soul even to pain he softens into such deep calm as to whisper of that heaven whence alone the full bliss comes love shrinking from the garish day finds in his presence eloquence and voice the poet oppressed and suffering in the rich blaze of day at night pours out his full soul in stirring words for conscious of a spirits presence the pressure of infinity is then less painful to be borne the artist does he dream of giving life to the vacant canvas the senseless marble or voice and sound to the rich harmonics for ever breathing in his earlabours in toil often in despondency during the day for earth only is present then but when alone with his own soul and the holy night when the spirit visible either through his silvery tears or in the rich beauty of his starry zone penetrates his whole being with his heavenly presence then life is strong once more the dream of immortality on earth even as in heaven dashes down all earthly fears the spark of the deity in every soul is rekindled by the touch of its kindred essence and hope and truth and beauty start into enduring glory beneath the vivifying flash beautiful spirit such hast been and is and will still be thy task over the earth thou floatest and man be he in gloom or gladness aspiring or desponding hails thee with rejoicing and even as the pale flowers drooping beneath the noontide heat and the parched and languishing earth so does he turn to thee for coolness and repose beautiful spirit thou hast sinned and been forgiventherefore we rest on thee illustration recollections of a rambler it was on a beautiful morning in quite the beginning of may that leaving the globe hotel on the beacon hill exmouth i strolled forth at a very early hour determining to ramble wherever chance might lead there was no fear of my missing any particularly lovely spot in following this determination the very watering places combine all the charms of sea and country to an extent peculiar to this lovely county ten minutes suffice to bear the wanderer to such seeming solitude of hill and dale and glen and woodwill scatter around him such a profusion of ever varying yet ever beautiful scenery that it is difficult to believe that all those artificial luxuries and pleasures necessary to the trifler and the fashionest would we seek them are close at hand every season has its own charm in england even winter in its stern rude aspect its brawling voice of winds and storms has in the deep still haunts of nature its own peculiar beauty spring with its young fresh joyousness its sparkling glory of earth and skyits gushing atmosphere for as the breeze comes laughing and dancing along we can give it no other term summer with its still and deeper feeling as if the dancing light and glittering love of the youthful year had sobered into a being deeper stronger more fervid and intense then autumn decking decay with such bright beauty shedding a parting halo on the fading year concentrating all of loveliness in that sweet dreamy pensiveness which while it lingers almost mournfully on earths parting glories looks through their passing light into their renovated being reading in the death and resurrection of nature the spirits immortality one charm indeed spring possesses beyond those of the other seasons it is that almost every hour of the day is equally delicious in the morning noon afternoon or evening we may come forth and make acquaintance with her in every variety of aspect each one as lovely as the other evening indeed is the hour of that delicious musing which in the very blessedness of the present unconsciously recalls the loveliest images of the past and adumbrates the future by the thrilling whisper of our immortal goal it is then that as wordsworth says we are laid asleep in body and become a living soul but these are not the sensations of the morning then life is infused with the present alone we can neither recall nor think nor hope we do but believe and love and feel conscious only of the blessing of existence of the omnipotence of love it was with all the elastic joyousness of such sensations i hastened up the beacon hill pausing involuntarily on the top to gaze beneath me there lay old ocean slumbering in the early sunshine as a lake of molten gold tinged here and there with the shadow of overhanging rocks and ever and anon fringed with a snowy crest as a passing breeze rocked the waves into heavier swell the broad and graceful river rushing boldly and proudly into its parent sea its undulating course visible for miles up the land its shores skirted with towns half buried in foliage churches towers and villages coming forth in the glowing light from their background of hills dark with verdure headlands bold rugged and broken into every diversity of form powder hams castellated mansion glancing through magnificent plantations with their glades and lawns of emerald issuing from the deeper shadows as jewels of the sunshine mamhead just visible through its dark dense woods and farther still in the distance woody uplands and barren rocks towering above the broken summits of the headlands taking every grotesque form from the clouds lingering above them and at length fading into ether changing like phantasmagoria beneath the magic influence of light and shade and mist and sun my path now lay across one or two fields inlaid with a perfect mosaic of gold and white and green formed by the patches of grass kingcup and daisy leading into those narrow luxuriant lanes with their gurgling streamlets and clustering flowers which mark at once the county of devon the hedges rose high above my head and from them sprung forth the oak and elm and beech and ash bearing the weight of centuries on their lofty trunks and far spreading branches the hawthorn with its blossoms just tipping its rich green as with a shower of snow and the holly standing forth dark and stern amid the more tender foliage of the early spring every field gate or occasional break in the hedge disclosed a complete mass of hill and wood and orchard on one side bounded by sea and sky on the other stretching farther and farther inland till hills met the sky and seemed to close around the landscape every shade of green from the darkest to the lightest was visible in the tender foliagesome as if already clothed in the intenser hues of summer others so lightly so delicately shaded that their exquisite tracery was distinctly marked against the clear blue sky the orchards already lay as patches of snow in their verdant dells and primroses and violets by thousands clustered on the banks of the clear trickling streamlet which skirted the deep green hedge as a fringe of silver i do so love the primrose there is something so sad and pensive in her meek pale flowers gleaming forth as silent stars from their darkly closing leaves and bending over the laughing waters as if their very mirth were sad to her and the deep purple violet shrouding itself in silence yet seeming in its very scent to smile and whisper joy and the speedwell with its full blue petals and delicate stems which literally bend beneath their weight of blossom light and fragile as they are the deep red campion with its gorgeous clusters looking proudly down on its humbler brethren rejoicing in its lofty home that it may fade unplucked upon its stem these and countless other flowers gemmed the hedge a very garniture of love there was no sound save the delicious music of the fresh springy breeze as it wantoned with the glistening leaves or played with the gushing waters inciting them to break in tiny waves against the hedge and the rich thrilling melody of the happy birds calling to each other from tree to tree or sending forth such a gush of song such a trilling flow of rapture that their slender throats seemed quivering with the effort then would come silence as startled and hushed by their own joy and then a low twittering with perhaps the distant call of the lonely cuckoo and a burst of melody again after rambling amid such scenes and sounds for about two miles a thick grove of lofty trees interspersed with thatched roofs ivy clad and smoke dyed walls and chimneys of every architecture marked its termination the lane narrowed and hastening onwards a rustic gate opened into an old churchyard surrounding a village church of such extreme old age and so picturesque that it sent me back in fancy centuries at once there was the low square belfry indented and fractured with lichen and moss and flowering weeds springing from every crevice the long and rambling choir roofed with copper the slender buttresses the small paned windows some of saxon some of tudor architecture the large square porch or entrance with its grotesque carvings that could only belong to the middle ages the very trees massive alike in root and trunk and branch yews so dark and thick they seemed in the distance more as solid masonry than treeslooked as if they had stood there grim guardians of the holy dead for centuries and grassy graves and quaint old tombs so battered with age and atmosphere as wholly to obliterate their inscriptionsthough some bore date as far back as strewed the ground so closely congregated that there was no space for a foot between the very birds seemed imbued with the spirit of the place for they were silent either flying noiselessly over the graves or winging their way to less sacred groves a sudden sound awoke me from my musing and transported me at once from past to present a joyous peal burst forth from the old belfry and a kindly voice accosted me withmaybe youd like to walk in sir and see the old place youd ha time to look round ye afore the wedding party comes and if not therell be time enow during the service the offer was accepted so eagerly as to delight my old guide for if one place in the country be more interesting to me than any other it is an old village church so buried in its own beautiful site that the roar of the railroad can never reach it where we can stand still and breathe apart from the rush and the turmoil and the haste still pressing onwardonward in the vain strife for mans intellect to keep pace with the giant he has raised which is now the constant accompaniment of the neighbourhood of towns the interior betrayed still greater age than the exterior the windows were painted rudely but gaudily throwing streams of coloured light where the early sunshine fell and leaving the remainder of the interior in that dim twilight so in unison with holiness and age an antique shrine adorned with most grotesque and to me incomprehensible carvings ran between the nave and chancel the nave fitted up as a protestant place of worship with pews and seats looked more modern than the chancel though the very black oak of its furniture gave it a venerable appearance and seemed to mark its date as among the earliest of the reformed churches while the dilapidated pavement and crumbling seats of the chancel spoke of an age still further back the font was roughly hewn out of a single stone i was intently engaged in endeavouring to decipher the inscriptions and dates on the stone flooring which appeared entirely made up of graves when the entreaty of the old clerk that i would withdraw into a pew as the wedding party was approaching most abruptly scared away all my antiquarian lore and transported me very unwillingly if the truth must be told to the contemplation of that common every day occurrence a modern wedding but one glance at the group consisting of only six or seven persons riveted my interest in my whole london career i had never seen such a face of intellect and soul and beauty as that of the bride whether it was the contrast of such youthful grace and loveliness with the stern old shrine around or the excessive agitation of the bridegroom and the almost extraordinary self possession of the bride i know not but no marriage ceremony ever affected me as this self possessed as she was there was no absence of feeling her cheek was perfectly colourless and at times there seemed a slight tremulous motion of the lips as if the effort to retain her composure was too painful to be continued and only persevered in for him his responses were wholly inaudible hers so distinct and thrilling they affected me almost to tears the clergyman himself though young and by his gay careless face and manner the only one who did not well assimilate with the scene became gradually impressed with its unusual solemnity the embrace with which at the conclusion of the ceremony the bridegroom folded the bride to his heart was so full of passionate feeling of such suppressed yet intense emotion even i could scarcely witness it unmoved and it completely checked the customary joyous greetings of their companions i followed them almost unconsciously from the church saw them enter the two carriages waiting for them outside the little gate and remained leaning on a tombstone overlooking the road long after they had disappeared my reverie was interrupted by a courteous address from the young clergyman who having noticed my attendance in the church volunteered the information which i so much desired pierre laval the only son of a very rich planter in martinique having received the best education which an alternate residence in france and england could bestow returned to his father only to feel that a residence in martinique was about the most miserable thing that could happen to him and so again made his appearance in england he sought no profession because he had no need to do so his fathers possessions being immense joining in the very best society in which a handsome face elegant address and highly cultivated mind gave him many advantages he became acquainted with the reigning beauty of the season helen campbell now pierre had a decided aversion to cried up beauties and so he resolved that however she might conquer others she should never obtain any power over him it is one thing to make a wise resolution and another to keep it it so happened that helen campbell possessed none of the repulsive attributes of an acknowledged beauty she was in truth much more lovely than he had anticipated but it was the intellectuality of her sweet face which was its peculiar charm she was frank truthful gaynay almost wild in her joyousness and moreover possessed the spell of one of the sweetest voices either in speech or song which he had ever heard pierre struggled a long time but it would not do he was fairly conquered and then for the first time he imagined himself wanting in every quality likely to make that love reciprocal and by sudden silence and reserve was in a fair way of actually creating the evil he dreaded had not a mutual friend opened his eyes and with sudden desperation he urged his suit and discovered to his inexpressible happiness that his love was returned for a brief period all was joy pierre had written to his father and did not harbour a single doubt as to his residence being permanently fixed in england although helen had made no such condition to his acceptance anxiously the arrival of the packet was anticipated but instead of the answer expected it brought news so overwhelming that the unfortunate pierre was at first verging on distraction monsieur laval was almost irretrievably ruined a revolt in the slave population of the island had taken place and his extensive plantations were burnt to ashes other heavy losses had congregated round him and what with these misfortunes and having been severely wounded in the revolt his health appeared rapidly failing panic and confusion still reigned but the friend who wrote expressed the hope that when all was quiet again the laval losses might not involve such utter ruin as at present appeared nothing was so earnestly desired in fact so indispensable as the immediate presence of pierre for some time the young man strove in vain to reduce his thoughts to order and at length hardly knowing what he did he sought his betrothed told her all and with a desperate effort offered to resign all his pretensions to her hand he was a ruined manmust labour for years in martinique how could he ask his helen to leave her luxurious home country friends all to bear with poverty and misery in a distant colony for him she heard him quietly to the end and then clasping his hand vowed nothing should part them she was his by the most holy of all tiesmutual love and truth and no persuasion no effort could turn her from his side in vain her mother and all her friends seconded lavals appeal urging the madness of the sacrifice helens only reply was had the voice of man united us would you thus persuade me would you not bid me follow my husband through weal and through woe and shall i do less now because freedom is in my power i could desert him if i chose no no mother you have other children who will be to you all i have been pierre has but me and no subsequent persuasion had power to shake her resolution it was however thought advisable that pierre should seek martinique alone and that when affairs were a little quiet he should either return for her or she should go to him but how could she join him an unprotected girl in a strange land she saw that he hesitated to speak the only means and so spoke them for him give me the sanctity the protection of your name my pierre and then what tongue dare cast aspersions on a wife who joins her husband if the day which unites us must also bid us part let it be so but save me as your wife from attentions and notice and persuasions which may be forced upon me pierres first answer was a wild and passionate embrace his next as passionate a burst of sorrow that it should be his doom to banish her to a home so little congenial to her taste as the burning climate would be to her health and it was long ere she could soothe or chide him into composure for the more brightly shone forth her unselfish love the more bitterly he felt the extent of sacrifice she made helen had to endure a very tempest of opposition and upbraiding as to her romantic far fetched folly but hers was not a mind to change or waver when feeling and principle had alike dictated her resolution pierre was to join his ship at falmouth and yearning for the quiet only found amid the repose of nature helen prevailed on her mother to reside for the next few months in devonshire their bridal i had witnessed and when i heard that the afternoon of that same day pierre laval was to part from his helen for an indefinite period that when united by the holiest of ties made one for ever but a few troubled hours were left them together i no longer wondered at the emotion i had beheld often and often has the vision of that morning haunted me with the vain longing to know if indeed that unworldly love had been blessed as it deserved and when those loving and aching hearts did meet again for years that olden shrine returned to me as a dream of the far past in itself blended with all the griefs and hopes of human hearts in the present and never can i recall the old altar to my mind without beholding in fancy the sweet shadowy form of helen campbell and the suppressed but terrible emotion of her pierre cast thy bread upon the waters thou shalt find it after many days why willie what is the matter inquired edward langley entering his fathers office one evening after business hours and finding its sole tenant a boy of fourteen or fifteen leaning both arms on one of the high desks and hiding his face within them whilst his slight figure shook with uncontrollable sobs and how came that drawer open he continued more sternly perceiving a bureau drawer half open so as to display its glittering contents which looked disturbed i hope you have not been doing anything wrong willie oh sir indeedindeed i have not count the money mr edward pray count it see that it is all right or i can never hold up my head again the temptation was misery enough returned the boy as well as his sobs would permit and displaying such a countenance of suffering as to enlist all edwards sympathy at once but my good boy what could have tempted you you seem so to feel the enormity of the sin that i cannot imagine what thought came into your head i only thought of my poor father sir oh mr edward he is in prison and my mother is too ill to work and she and my poor little sisters are starving he replied bursting again into tears i did not know what to do to help them i give them all i earn but that is so very little it only gives them a meal now and then and then when i saw that drawer accidently left open and remembered twelve pounds only twelve pounds would get my father out of prison and he could work for us again the horrid thought came into my head to take them they would never be missed out of so many and i had them in my hand but then i thought what could i tell them at home it would break my poor mothers heart to think her willie was dishonest she could better bear hunger and grief than that sir and i knew i could not hide it from her and so i dashed them back they seemed to scorch me oh mr edward indeed indeed i speak the truth edward did believe him and he told him so there was little need to speak harshly the boys own conscience had been his judge to satisfy him however he counted the money found it correct and after talking to him a little while kindly yet impressively promised to do what he could for his father and left him indelibly impressing that evening upon willies mind by never reverting to it again the tale which his inquiries elicited was a very common one willies father had been an artificer in one of the manufacturing towns but too eager for advancement he imprudently threw up his situation and tried independent business matters grew worse and worse his family increased and his means diminished hearing of an excellent opening at new york for an artificer like himself he worked day and night to obtain sufficient means to transport himself and family across the atlantic and support them till a business could be established his wife ably aided him when unhappily he was tempted to embark all his little savings in one of the bubbles of the day which he was confidently assured would be so successful as to permit his embarking for america at once and so seize the opening offered few speculators had perhaps a better excuse but fortune did not favour him more than others it failed and he was ruined three months afterwards he was thrown into prison for the only debt he had ever incurred and though he had friends to persuade him to his ruin he had none to liquidate his debt his wifes health already overworked sunk under privation and sorrow and though she toiled even from her fevered pallet her feeble earnings were not sufficient to give her children bread edward langley was a creature of impulse but in him impulse was the offspring of high principle and therefore though the following it often caused him unlooked for annoyance it never led him wrong and willies tale called forth sympathies impossible to be withstood edward said one of his numerous sisters one evening about three weeks afterwards as they were sitting at teaa meal which bringing them all together was universally enjoyed what have you done with grandpapas birthday present you were to do so many things with that money and i have not heard you speak of it since my return because wonderful things have occurred since you left fanny said another slily he is going to accompany mr morisons family to italy and paris and bring us such splendid presents his fair julia cannot go without him and he has promised to join them wrong miss ellen i am not going was the reply with rather more brusquerie than usual why have you quarrelled not exactly but she will be offended ned i am sure i should be no you would not annie if you knew my reasons what are they edward dear do tell me i am so curious of course or you would not be a woman against this all his sisters expostulated at once and even his mother expressed curiosity adding that he had talked of this continental trip so long and with so much glee it must be a disappointment to give it up it is but i do not regret it but you must have a reason the very best of all reasons i cannot afford it come to me for the needful edward said his father i cannot give you luxuries but this is for your improvement thank you most heartily my dear father but i am rather i was richer than any of you know i earned so much for my last engraving and you never told us said his mother and sisters reproachfully i did not because it was already appropriated i wanted exactly that sum to add to my grandfathers gift and that was what i worked so hard for to purchase some bridal gift said fanny archly no fan i never mean to purchase love but if the lady requires to be so conciliated then she is not worth having of course not rejoined annie but come edward you have never kept anything from us before what is this mystery out with it laughingly pursued ellen julia morison will not thank you for preferring anything to accompanying her i can tell you so as annie says what is this mystery no mystery at all girls you will all be disappointed when i tell you so you had better let it alone but beset on all sides even by his father and mother edward told the simple truth which our readers no doubt have already guessed his money had been applied in releasing willies father from prison restoring his mother to health by giving her and her children nourishing food securing a passage for them all to new york and investing the trifling surplus for their use on their arrival he told his tale hurriedly as if he feared to be accused of folly and his father did somewhat blame him he was provoked that the little scheme of pleasure and improvement which edward had anticipated so many weeks should be frustrated and annoyed that he should be disappointed though the disappointment was perfectly voluntary how could he tell that the mans story was true how was he sure the money would produce the good effect he hoped he must say he thought it a pity a very great pity a visit to paris would be so improving mr morisons family such a desirable connectionand other regrets which without being a very worldly parent were not perhaps unnatural my dear father was edwards earnest and affectionate rejoinder do not be vexed for my sake a visit to the continent would no doubt have been improving but i will work doubly hard in dear old england and that though it may not be as much pleasure will be just as serviceable with regard to miss morison his cheek slightly flushed if her affections are only to be secured by being constantly at her side and always playing the lover there could be no happiness in a nearer connection for either a separation for three or four months can surely have no effect on real regard and i am quite willing to subject both myself and julia to the ordeal as to not being sure of doing the good i hopewho can be i do believe that poor fellows story i confess and strongly believe he will do well but i do not mean to give the subject another thought except to work the harder the money is as much gone as freely given and i expect as little reward as if i had thrown it on the waters where thou shall find it after many days continued his mother so affectionately and approvingly that edward threw his arm round her and kissed her tenderly you have done right my dear boy and if julia morison does not think so she is not worthy of your love how quick is womans above all a mothers penetration from the first allusion to miss morison in the preceding conversation she knew that something had occurred between them to annoy if it did not wound her son and the moment she heard the story she guessed the actual fact perhaps her penetration in this instance was aided by previous observation she had never liked miss morison desirable as from worldly motives the connection might be edward youth like had been captivated by her beauty and vivacity and gratified by her very marked preference for himself his complete unconsciousness that he really was the handsomest and most engaging young man of the town of l by depriving him of all conceit increased miss julias fascination mr morison was member for the county and had made himself universally popular and certainly took marked notice of edward the good people of l were too simple minded to discover that their members attractions were merely graces of manner and that he noticed edward only because he was perfectly secure that his daughter would never do such a foolish thing as to promise her hand to the son of a country attorney however agreeable he might be edwards wish to accompany them to the continent met with decided approval mr morison thought the young man would save him a great deal of trouble as a kind of gentleman valet without a salary and miss julia was delighted at this unequivocal proof of his devotion and at the amusement she promised herself in playing off her country beau on the continent his simplicity being the shield to cover her manuvres besides he would be such an excellent pis aller that she need never be without a worshipper that such a person could appreciate edwards real character or enter into his motives for and his disappointment in not accompanying her was impossible for regret even for anger he had prepared himself nay might have been disappointed had she evinced no emotion but for the cold sneer first of doubt then of unequivocal contempt which was her sole rejoinder to his agitated confession he was not prepared and it chilled his very heart still he tried to deceive himself and believe that all she said of benevolence disinterestedness and a long et cetera was the sympathy he yearned for but the tone and manner with which she informed her father in his presence of his change of purpose and its praiseworthy cause could not even by a lover more infatuated than edward have been misunderstood his spirit rose and with it his self respect he said very little but that little convinced both julia and her father that he was not quite the simpleton which they had supposed him he left them wounded to the core to his warm generous nature worldliness was abhorrent even in a man and in a woman it seemed to him something so unnatural so revolting that it dispersed at once the bright creation of his enthusiastic fancy and displayed miss morison almost in her true character still notwithstanding all this pain and disappointment edward never once regretted the impulse he had followed and when about six or seven months afterwards he received the most grateful letters from willie and his father informing him that the opening offered though attended with many difficulties promised fair he felt the sacrifice was more than recompensed and from that hour never thought of it himself again but his assertion that he would work the harder to make up for those continental advantages which he had lost was no idle boast he did so well that even his father forgot his vexation and his industry united with great personal economy enabled him to give his sisters richer and more useful presents than the bijouterie which he had laughingly promised to bring them from france the marriage of miss julia morison with some foreign count before six months elapsed had happily no effect on edwards equanimity it might nay it did cause a transient pang but he recovered it much sooner than his father did the loss of so desirable a connection never mind it sir was edwards laughing entreaty i would rather earn my own independence and make a connection through my own exertions than by the richest marriage i could make thats just like your mother boy said his father somewhat pettishly as if all depended on ones self thank you for the likeness father when i can bring you a daughter to be to me what my mother is to you i shall have formed a desirable connection though my wife be not set in gold and this even his father acknowledged when two years afterwards edward married the daughter of their vicar who proved in his own person that influence is not always inseparable from wealth but may be found with worth as well time rolled on twenty thirty years in the multitude of great and trifling events which make up the sum of human life during those years edward langley had so entirely forgotten the generous deed of his early youth that he would have found it difficult to recall even the name of willies parents his perseverance and talent had been crowned with such success that when only eight and twenty he was taken into partnership by one of the first engravers of the metropolis for twenty more years the business so flourished as to make all the principals very wealthy men and edward looked forward in two or three more years to resign in favour of his son and retire himself from active business he had never been ambitious and a series of domestic trials in the loss of six children out of nine all of that most interesting age when childhood is giving place to youth caused him to turn with clinging love to those who remained longing more to enjoy an englishmans home than to continue amassing wealth greatly against his wishes and advice engagements and speculations had been entered into by the firm to an immense extent more especially with establishments abroad the dishonesty of distant agents and the careless supineness if not equal dishonour of one of the principals at home occasioned ruin to all of course including langley though he had been most unjustifiably kept in ignorance of the real extent of their speculating schemes yet his high integrity enabled him to bear up against this sudden change of circumstances with more fortitude than any of his companions his wifes little property had never been touched and he was therefore enabled to retire to a very small cottage in cheshire which soon displayed the refined taste and artistic skill of its gentle minded inmates to an extent that completely concealed their very humble means not that they were ashamed of their poverty but the same self respect that prompted their horror of all pretension and resolution to live strictly within their means threw a comfort and refinement around and within their lowly home which the wealthiest might have envied for himself edward langley would have been as happy as in the height of his prosperity but he could not help feeling a very pardonable pang at this sad change in the prospects of his children his son emulating his firmness sought and obtained an excellent situation in a thriving engraving establishment in edinburgh where his fathers name and character spoke for him more forcibly than the highest premium it was on helen langley the blow had fallen heaviest the only one of his daughters who had reached the age of nineteen for fanny was still a child frail delicate in seeming as a beautiful flower she had been nursed in luxury and affection and guarded from even the approach of a storm the deserved darling of all who knew her rich and poor her parents love for her amounted almost to idolatry engaged to the son of one of her fathers partners then studying as a physician a bright and happy future shone before them when the thunderbolt fell before either had seen a cloud george ashley was summoned from paris just as his diploma was obtained and he was weaving fairy dreams of a speedy union with his helen recalled not as he believed still to study and gradually attain eminence but to give up all ambitious dreams and work as a general practitioner for actual subsistence to marry before he had even the prospect of a connection and employment was absolute madness to live any distance from helen he felt was quite as impossible so he settled himself in the old town of chester about three miles from her home and for her sake exerted himself more than he had once believed was in his nature at first youth and excitement beheld only the brighter side but after six months trial so endless and little remunerating seemed his toil that he sunk into the deepest despondency which neither mr and mrs langleys kind advice nor helens sweet counsels could remove fearfully would mr langley look on his darling dreading that this constant pressure of anxiety and suspense would be as fatal to her as disease had been to her sisters but though more serious than had been her disposition before it was not the seriousness of gloom but rather of a firm yet gentle spirit forming internally some resolution which required thought and time for development her smile was as joyous her voice as gleeful as in happier years her pursuits continued with the same zeal if not with deeper earnestness to persuade her to annul her engagement never entered either parents mind but the long vista of dreary years which they believed must intervene ere it could be fulfilled was literally their only thought of anxious and unmitigated gloom give me up helen i have no right to fetter your young life with an engagement which heaven only knows when we shall fulfil passionately exclaimed young ashley about seven months after their misfortunes your sweet face and sweeter temper and lovely mind must win you a position in life far higher than i can ever offer you were only seen at the ball the other night to be admired that unfortunate ball i only went to gratify papa and you are jealous george that your poor helen was admired no helen no i gloried in it for i knew you were mine mine in heart faith all but name but then i thought how selfish how utterly selfish i was still to claim you to behold you wearing out your young life in all the sickness of hope deferred when by resigning you you might be rich admired followed occupy the station you deserve and be very happy dearest george this is a strange mood she said half reproachfully half playfully come send it away for it is not like you i am very sorry i cannot oblige you but as i consider myself as much yours as if the sacred words had actually been said you may divorce me if you will but i will never give you up helen darling helen forgive me he replied his repentance as impetuous as all his other feelings oh if you would but be mine at once i am sure i should succeed with such a comforter such a cheerer work would be welcome i would never despond again dearest loving as we do why should we not wed at once we must then do well must do well because we love george yes and so we shall but not if we wed now ah now you look reproachfully again dearest you know i would not shrink from any hardship shared with you i will work with you work for you if needed but young as we both are is it not better to work apart a few years that we may rest together think what five years may do for both it may be less i put it only to the extent you are succeeding and will succeed still more the more you are known but had you a wife and an establishment to support now even with my very hardest exertions we could not keep free from debt and love potent as it is could not then guard sorrow from our dwelling when wedded if unlooked for misfortunes come we will bear them and comfort and strengthen each other but would it be right would it be wise to invite them by a too early marriage my own dear george let us work while we have youth and hope and trust me we shall be very happy yet it was scarcely possible to remain unconvinced by such fond reasoning but still ashley referred with deep despondency to the long long interval which must elapse ere that happiness could be obtained not so long as you fancy george i never mean to be a rich mans wife though you invited me to be so just now i do not even intend to wait for comforts but only just for that competency which will prevent those evil spirits care and irritation from entering our home and to forward this listen to my plan dearest george and with some little tremour for she dreaded his disapproval she told him that she had accepted an engagement as governess in a family at manchester a dr murray who was a widower with four or five children she had been mentioned by a mutual friend and the doctor was so pleased with mrs nortons account that he agreed even to give the high salary helen required without seeing her he had said that his mother who lived with him was too infirm to bear his children much with her and he therefore wanted more from his governess than merely to teach he was quite willing to pay for it but a lady he must have to bear with all his whims and fancies to be tormented with spoiled children put up with the old womans infirmities be insulted by pampered servants helen you shall not go exclaimed george now george dont be foolish i do not expect one of these evils and if i meet with them i can bear them with such a hope before me she continued fondly looking in his face but governesses are so insulted so degraded not insulted if they respect themselves not degraded if those they love do not think so but perhaps george you are too proud to marry a governess a passionate reproach was his reply well then love listen to me a little longer mamma still means to allow me enough for my quiet dress so that i can put by every shilling that i earn and only think what that may come to in a few years then i have a reason for choosing manchester as a temporary home you know i can draw but do you not know that i can designwilliam took so much pleasure in teaching meand in a manufacturing town like manchester i may not only be able to use this knowledge but perhaps gradually get introductions which will allow my successful pursuit of the art even asas your wife dearest george and then what with our mutual economy and mutual savings beforehand and mutual work afterwardsoh our future will shine as bright as it did before this storm god for ever bless you helen my own darling you are indeed my best hope my best comforter already murmured george half choked with strong emotion which he tried to conceal by pressing her to his bosom and kissing her cheek how can your parents part with you and what will drive away my fits of gloom when i cannot come to you for comfort hope was her instant reply in a tone so glad so thrilling that it pervaded his whole being ever afterwards like a spell think dearest george of the hundreds who have to labour on through lonely years uncheered by either love or hope who must work wearily and unceasingly only for means of existence we have health and youth and love and above all mutual faith to sustain us and therefore we must be happy you do not know how powerful is a womans will not more so than mans replied ashley more cheerfully than he had yet spoken helen you have shamed me i will become more worthy of such love helen looked very much as if she thought that was impossible but she did not say so it was no light task this gentle girl had undertaken hopefully as she had spoken and felt her resolution had neither been formed nor matured without suffering nor had it been the least portion of the trial to win over her parents to her wishes but the wisdom of her plan was so evident that they conquered all selfish feeling for their childs sake and tried to be comforted by mrs nortons assurance that in dr murrays family helen would be as comfortable as she could be away from home and so she was in fact so kindly was she welcomed and treated that she could scarcely understand it dr murray was a man in reality under fifty but looking much older from a life of some hardship and much labour the fruits of which he now enjoyed in the possession of a comfortable income his manner in general blunt and rough always softened towards helen whom he ever addressed with such respect as well as kindness that all georges terror of her encountering insolence very speedily dispersed mrs murray had evidently not been born a lady but her regard for helen was shown in such a multiplicity of little kindnesses that no feeling could be excited towards her but gratitude and love constantly as she was occupied with her pupils helens careful economy of time yet enabled her actually to accomplish the purpose she had in her mind when she chose manchester for her residence the idle nay even the less energetic would have declared it was impossible for any one person to do what she did but not even the doctor or his mother knew how her moments of made leisure were employed so nearly three years glided by helens health instead of failing as her friends had feared actually improved and george declared there must have been some spell in her words or her example for his prospects were brightening every year helen only smiled and told him that the spell was simply in his own more hopeful exertions dr murrays house was the frequent resort not only of men of talent from the higher ranks but frequently of clever manufacturers and artificers in whose works the doctor and his mother were always particularly interested it happened that helen was present one evening when one of these gentlemen was regretting his inability to procure an appropriate design for some window curtains of a new material which he had invented being no artist himself he could not perhaps define his wishes with sufficient technicality but all which he had seen were either so small as to have no effect or so large as to look coarse and common before he departed the conversation changed and dr murray thought no more about it until at a very early hour the next morning helen entered his study with a roll of paper which she asked him to examine and tell her if he thought it the kind of thing mr grey required his astonishment that she should remember any thing about it was only equalled by his admiration of her work so great was his delight that he declared he would convey it to mr grey himself and get her something handsome for it he was not disappointed mr grey seized it with rapture declared it was the very thing he meant offered to pay any sum for it and was struck dumb with astonishment when told it was designed by the elegant young lady to whom he had been introduced the previous night and whom he had scarcely deigned to notice believing her the same as most young ladiesa very pretty but a very useless piece of goods one of his young men who had been eagerly examining it said he was sure it was by the same hand as several other elegant designs which they had been in the habit of purchasing the last two years but the name of whose inventor they had never been able to discover he brought some and compared them and even the doctors unpractised eye could discern the same hand throughout but how could miss langley have accomplished all this and yet so done her duty to his children it was incomprehensible and the good doctor hurried home to have the mystery solved helen speedily explained it adding ingenuously that she had worked in secret only because she feared the doctor or his friends might think she must neglect her duty to her charge to pursue this employment but since he had expressed such perfect satisfaction she had resolved on taking the first opportunity to tell him all but my good young lady you must have some very strong incentive for all this exertion blushing deeply helen acknowledged that she had is it a secret my dear child for a minute she hesitated then frankly told her story the doctor was so much affected by it as to surprise her and expressed the most unfeigned regret that he had not known it before not a fortnight afterwards mr grey sought an interview with miss langley he wished he said to monopolize her talents and offered in consequence with sufficient liberality as to tempt her to adhere to his employment instead of taking the chance of larger remuneration for occasional designs it was for this helen had worked and prayed and hopedthis which she had looked to to follow even as a wife and in her husbands house and therefore we leave to our readers imagination the gratitude with which it was accepted the joy with which she wrote to her parents to george to whom her womans heart so yearned in that moment of rejoicing that for the first time since she had loved him she could scarcely write for tears but the letters she received in reply sadly alloyed this dawning happiness her sister fanny was dangerously ill the same age the same disease which had been so fatal to her family all georges skill and it was great had been ineffectual nothing could save her the distracted father wrote she was doomed like all the rest but to helen there was no such word as doom she flew to the doctor repeated to him as well as she could the symptoms and the remedies applied conjuring him to think of something which would alleviate if it could not cure what could she write write my dear child that will be of little use we will go together and though there were no railroads in that direction mans omnipotent will carried helen and the doctor to mr langleys cottage in so short a space that it seemed to helen like the transfigurations of a dream for four days fearful were the alternations of hope and dread the fifth hope predominated and by the end of the week promptness and skill in the adoption of an entirely new mode of treatment were so successful that dr murray was blessed again and again by the enraptured parents as under heaven the preserver of their child but though all danger was over the doctor did not offer to quit the cottage for another week which time he spent mostly in his patients room and in earnest conversation with young ashley helen had intended to remain in his family till he could meet with some one to supply her place but this he now declared should not be she must be wanted at home at least till she could finish her preparations for entering another for if he were george he would not wait another month she had had her own will too long already and the future was bright enough now to permit him to have his helens hand was clasped in her young sisters as the good doctor spoke but georges arm was round her and her reply seemed to satisfy all parties all mr langleys attempts to obtain a private interview with his guest were ineffectual until the day of his intended departure when with trembling hands and swimming eyes he tried to press a pocket book into the doctors hand it is inadequate wholly inadequate he said with emotion you have saved my child so restored her that she is better than she has been since her birth you have given us your time your skill and you shrink even from my thanks were i a rich man i should feel as i do now that a fortune could not repay you but as a poor man do not insult me by refusing the fee i can bestow mr langley was the reply i tell you truth when i assure you that you owe me nothing i am in your debt far more far more than my professional skill ever could repay in my debt doctor ah you mean my helens services but those you have so liberally remunerated and treated her with such kindness that you have made me your debtor even there no no i cannot allow helen precious as she is to come between me and justice i do not allude to miss langley sir and the doctor spoke as if addressing a superior her inestimable services to me and mine indeed nothing can repay but it was not for her sake i came to you the debt i allude to is of more than thirty years standing and is due to you alone on my first return to england your position was higher your fortune far superior to mine and had i then sought you it might still have been to receive benefits at your hand in your noble endurance of misfortune it would have been an insult to have discharged my debt and therefore i waited and prayed for some opportunity not only to do justice but to evince gratitude if i have made your child happy and shortened the term of her heroic exertions you owe it to yourself i could not take from you even the full amount of this visit regarding it merely as professional for i owe you in actual money more than that mr langley looked and expressed bewilderment the doctors manner was too earnest to permit a doubt but he tried in vain to recall to what he could allude have you so completely forgotten willie murray mr edward continued his companion much agitated willie murray the poor boy you not only saved from sin but made so happy by your generous kindness to his family mr langley i am that boy my character my success i owe to you how can such a debt ever be repaid mr langleys astonishment was so great as literally to deprive him for the moment of words he only remembered willie murray as a pale thin intellectual boy of fifteen to recognise him in the tall stout somewhat aged looking man before him required more imagination than he chanced to possess but to doubt the identity was impossible he grasped his hand warmly and insisted on his giving him that very hour the history of his life our readers however must be contented with a very brief sketch of these details suffice it that neither willie nor his father rose to independence without constant toil and unwearying perseverance profiting by the trials of earlier years the elder murray laboured with an energy and skill which until his timely release from prison had appeared foreign to his character many difficulties he had to encounter but once the manufactory established competence was secured and as his labour rather increased than slackened fortune followed his sons marked preference for the medical profession grieved him at first but he lived long enough to see that he had chosen wisely and at his death left all his children comfortably provided for each possessing a share in the manufactory which his energy had established willie had always yearned to return to england and did so directly he became a widower his mother gladly accompanying him he had finished his medical education in france had a large practice in america and from his general intelligence proved skill and wide handed benevolence very speedily became popular in england but amid all the chances and changes of his busy life neither the fearful temptation of his boyhood nor edward langleys generous kindness had ever been forgotten joyous indeed and full of hope was helen langleys bridal morn though neither pomp nor fashion attended it such as might have been the case some few years before on retiring to change her dress helen found a heavy packet directed to mrs george ashley on her table it was a purse containing three hundred sovereigns with the following brief lines this is your fathers gift though it comes through me i do but return a sum lent by him to me and mine with the accumulated interest of three and thirty years it is now added to the store earned by helen langleys meritorious exertions william murray mother exclaimed mr langley after perusing this note and turning to his now aged parent with some emotion do you remember your words when i told you the money was as freely given and i expected as little reward as if i had thrown it on the waters that i should find it after many days you were right i have found it indeed the triumph of love millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth unseen both when we sleep and when we wake milton i it was a scene of unrivalled beauty yet might some marvel wherefore it was thus created so far removed from mortal ken so severed from the habitations of sin and death that foot of man had never sullied the pure fresh green of the velvet grass mortal hand had never culled the brilliant flowers gemming each silvery stream corporeal sense had never been regaled by their fragrant breath or lulled by the sweet music of the waters the leafy branches of the ancient trees stretched forth their deep green shadows and hill and stream and valley each clothed in its own peculiar beauty derived fresh charms as the seasons softly and silently sped by leaving bright tokens as they sped the stars still smiled at their own sparkling rays gleaming up from the gushing water the pensive moon still touched the glossy leaves with her diamond pencil still lingered on the verdant mount leaving rich shadows on the luxuriant vales the sun still sent forth its bright beams to revive and cherish the glistening flowers to whisper of his unfailing love still did he bid them drink up the dewdrops which trembling beneath his earnest gaze yet sprung up from their homes at his first call eager to lose themselves in him day in his mirth and light gave place to silent and shadowy night and night again to day yet man was not there and wherefore had such loveliness birthwherefore was it so continually renewed man would joy in the contemplation of beauty such as this scene presented yet his imperfect vision would see no further than mount and vale and trees and shrubs and streams and flowers he would hear nought but the rustle of the leaf the murmur of the breeze the music of the brook the luscious scents floating on the breeze would be but indistinctly distinguished and his fancy perchance yearn towards them and long for perfume more defined even as we sometimes seek to unite into sweet melody the thrilling notes which one by one at dreamy intervals linger on the distant air and these things he would hear and feel and see and dream not there were sights and sounds hovering around him too pure too spiritual for earthly sense there were glorious spiritsangelic beings floating on the ambient air and lingering beside the waters and sporting with the jewelled buds there were rich tones lingering on the breezesweet thrilling voices mingling with golden harps and silvery flutes there were luscious scents ascending to the arching heaven even as if guided by ministering spirits each floweret sent up her grateful incense to the throne of her creator as the dazzling flash of the diamond the softer gleam of the emerald the radiant beam of the sapphire the intense rays of the ruby so shone these beautiful beings as they fleeted to and fro on their respective tasks some replenishing the brooks with living waters from vases which seemed moulded from precious gems some tending the flowers inhaling and bestowing fragrance or whispering those sweet memories with which man ever finds the flowers of the desert filled some lingering in groups upon the mount crowning its flowery brow as with a circlet of living rays some flying downwards agitating the valley with soft delicious winds and others freshening the rich tints of the far spreading foliage and far and near their voices sounded in one rich hymn of praise whose theme was love and the golden harps prolonged the hallelujahs sounding up through the blue realms of space till they mingled with the deeper mightier harmonies around the eternals throne bearing along its thrilling echo joined by innumerable voices till the whole air seemed filled with song and still that song was love beautiful as were these celestial spiritsbeautiful and blessed above all conception of finite manyet they were not of the highest class of angels incapable of sin unconscious of pain or sorrow but not yet admitted to hover over the dwelling of man to minister unto the afflicted to tend the couch of the dying to whisper of rest to the weary hope to the desponding joy to the mourner sensible of the eternals presence their bliss made perfect in his glory their task was to watch and tend inanimate creationto sing his praises amidst the glorious shrines of nature till his works proclaimed him unto man activity and obedience were the sole virtues demanded of these celestial beings in the tasks above enumerated and when these had been sufficiently exercised they graduated to a higher order of angels nearer the eternals throne who were permitted to receive his will and make it known to man the desire to obtain this privilege was lively in all but far removed from that grosser passion known to man as ambition in them it did but add zest to enjoyment give energy to love inspiration to obedience faith they needed not for to them the eternal was revealed anticipation was lost in fulfilmenthope in completion their nature was not susceptible of a deeper sense of bliss but as they ascended higher and higher in the scale of angels the deeper fuller more glorious blessedness was met by a nature yet more purified spiritualized exalted fitted for its reception and strengthened to retain it ii reposing on a sunbeam lingering on the brow of a hill a spirit lay apart from his fellows his brow was wreathed with the opal emerald and ruby so blending their several rays that they seemed but as a circlet of ever changing light his long flowing hair shone as if each clustering ringlet had been bathed in the liquid diamond his downy wings woven of every shade gently waved in air wafting the richest perfume and dyeing the sunbeam on which he lay in every brilliant tint a light mist enveloped his angelic formsoftening not lessening his resplendent loveliness his eye shone as the midnight star a bloom softer lovelier purer than the earliest rose played on his cheek sparkling smiles wreathed his lips he spoke and his voice was music though his golden harp lay silent by his side love love he murmured hallelujah to the lord of love let the full choirs of heaven chant forth the immortal theme proclaim proclaim him love earth air ocean shout with your hundred tongues send up your echo to the voice of heaven man art thou insensiblehearest thou not these living tonescan doubt be thine as i have heard whispered in the celestial courts created by loveplaced in a world of lovedistant as thou art yet cherished and beloved by love destined for immortal union with the love that gave thee beingcanst thou be faithless canst thou be senselesswhen above below around within soundeth the deep eternal voice of love oh insensates if such things be immortal glory bliss unfading can it be for ye awhile he paused a slight shadow passed athwart the brilliant rays with which he was encircled he folded his wings around him and laid his brow upon them my thought has been rebuked he said i have done ill enough for me the consciousness of love wherefore should i condemn as yet unworthy to look on man let the hallelujahs sound forth again glory to the eternalhis works are wisdom his thoughts are love he swept his hand across his harpthe shadow had departed from his wingshis chaplet shot forth again its living light celestial music flowed forth from his voice and handthe spirit smiled once more suddenly the hallelujahs ceased to the eye of man twilight had descended the stars began to light up the dark blue heavens mortal vision might trace the semblance of a falling meteor of unwonted brilliance dropping into space the purified orbs of the seraph crowd knew that one of the highest class of angels was departing from his resplendent seat and winging his flight towards them instantly they rose up from their several resting places forming in files of unutterable brilliance increased happiness shed a new lustre on their brows and heightened the glowing iris of their wings one alone felt penetrated with an awe which slightly lessened the feelings of joy which the visit of an angel ever caused he feared it was to him the celestial mission came that his condemnation of beings whose nature and whose trials he knew not had exposed him to censure perhaps to a longer banishment from the higher spheres of glory and while his brother spirits thronged round the favoured minister to bask in the resplendent brightness of his smiles to list to the words of melody flowing from his lips to gaze on the mild yet thrilling softness of his celestial features zephon stood aloof for the first time shrinking from the glance and voice he loved he saw not that the glittering helm and dazzling sword were laid aside that his brow was wreathed with the softly gleaming pearl his shining wings glistening through silvery radiance bespeaking tenderness and mercy and not now the wrath and chastisement of which at his makers will he was at times the minister his voice melodious and thrilling as the silver trumpets of the empyreal heavens sounded through space as it called zephon the seraph paused not a moment but darting through the incensed air prostrated himself at the archangels feet arise and fear not youthful brother spake the messenger of the eternal departing not from the grave majesty of his demeanour but smiling with such ineffable sweetness the seraph felt its reviving influence and spread forth his silken pinions rejoicingly again i come the harbinger of peace and love thine impassioned zeal was checked ere it became a faultchecked ere it led thee to desire forbidden knowledge charged with a message of love and mercy from the most high i have besought and obtained permission to take thee as my companion to thine imperfect vision it seemeth strange that man so especially the beloved the cherished of the eternal framed to display to uphold his stupendous power to proclaim his mighthis loveshould ever fail either in obedience or adoration thou hast heard that such has been for where sin hath so fearfully prevailed that an immortal spirit has been excluded from these glorious realms a dim shadow hath spread over heavens resplendent courts and the celestial spirits of every rank have prostrated themselves before the invisible yet terrible presence adoring justice while they supplicated mercy zephon not yet may be revealed to thee the glorious mystery of the eternals secret ways thou mayst gaze with me on the earthly beings i have charge to tend but it is forbidden thee to ask or seek the wherefore of what thou seest thou wilt behold even in this limited glance enough to prove that even if the human heart refuseth to send up its thrilling echo to the theme of love which thy zeal demandeth the unfathomable love of its benignant creator will receive and bless its faintest sigh for to him and to him alone is known the extent of its trialthe bitterness of its griefthe difficulty of its belief in an ever acting love zephon if still thou wilt thou shalt look on the human heart yet pause awhileis thy love sufficiently strong to uphold thee in the contemplation of decrees whose motives thou art not yet permitted to conceive in thy blissful dwelling thou hast no need of faith thou knowest not even its name but if with me thou goest faith must be thy safeguard here thine eye seeth thine ear heareth nought but love there it may be darkly hidden from thee yet if thy faith or thy love should fail if thou demandest the wherefore of what thou seest it is of our fathers will that thou shalt be banished unto earthbanished from this glorious abode condemned to struggle with the ills and sorrows of mortality till pure and perfect faith shine forth and fit thee once again for heaven speak then my brother wilt thou depart with me or still linger here the choice is now thine own awhile the seraph paused the face of the archangel beamed on him with compassionating tenderness and redoubled love the looks of his brother spirits the soft fluttering of their wings seemed to woo him to remain to entreat him not to tempt the fate threatened if his love should fail and therefore did he pause no no wherefore should i fear he cried i will go with thee minister of love i will look upon my fathers dearest work and despite of mystery and gloomof sorrowof pain i will love and bless him still a fuller richer burst of melody filled the realms of air thousands and thousands of voices swelled forth in triumphant harmony a starry cloud descended and folded in its spangled robe the departing spirits vanished into space iii thy wish is fulfilled the peculiar treasure of our father is revealed zephon behold the angel spake as the shrouding cloud rolled away towards the fields of ether and the celestial spirits hovered over the abode of man a sudden an indescribable consciousness of increased powers of heightened intellect shot from the starry eyes of the youthful seraph man in his majesty his beautybearing in his every movement his exquisitely formed frame his complicated economy of being yet more impressive more startling evidence of the might the wisdom the benevolence of his glorious maker than even the source of the river the structure of the flower the growth of the tree over which the seraph had presided finding even in such things ample scope for the soaring intellect which characterised his race man proceeding from destined for immortalitythe beloved the peculiar care and treasure of the eternalman beautiful man stood revealed before him yet amidst the thronging multitude on which he gazed but one heart in all its varied impulses its hidden throbs and incongruous thoughts and ever changing fanciesbut one beautiful intellect in all its secret powers and extent was open to his inspection and lovely even to the eyes of a spirit was the being in whom such glorious things were shrined she was a young and noble maiden perfect in form and face her virtues scarce sullied by a stain of earth although from the spirit of poetry the living fount of genius dwelling within open to grief and trial even from the faintest breath too rudely jarring on the heavenly strung chords with which her heart was filled a deep lowly clinging piety was ever ready to check the first impulse of impatience to turn to the sweet joys of sympathy and universal love the too vivid sense of sorrow either for herself or others humility was there to lift up that young spirit in thankfulness to its creator and to devote that powerful intellect ever seeming to bear all difficulties before it to his service in the good of her fellow creatures zephon saw that the praise of man was a source of pure inspiring pleasure but instead of filling her soul with pride it ever bore it up in increased devotion to its god he marked her graceful form sporting to and fro amid the stately domains of her lordly ancestors he marked the love of parents brothers friends that ever thronged around her and the fulness of joy that love bestowed he saw too the impassionate longings for yet stronger love the yearnings for fame appreciation not alone from the noble and the gay but from the gifted and the good the desire to awake by the magic touch of genius the same thrilling chords in other hearts as the spell of others had revealed in hers the seraph looked long and earnestly suddenly he saw her standing in the centre of a lordly room and loving and admiring friends around her her lip her eye her heart breathed joy well nigh as full and shadowless as the blessedness of heaven after awhile the angel spake there is nought here to call for faith he said yon favourite child of genius but awakens deeper yet more adoring love her lot is blessedness her heart so pure earth hath scarce power to stain that bliss but now look yonder zephon seest thou amidst the multitude a being equally though differently lovelyequally powerful in intellect equally the child of genius as richly gifted alike in wisdom as in virtue as fully susceptible of joy and sorrow the same feelings the same desires the same deep yearnings for love on which to rest for appreciation fame the same strung heart thrilling to melody as keenly as to neglect mark well young brother and thou wilt trace these things anxiously the seraph gazed and again he was conscious of sufficient power to read the human heart again amidst the multitude one gentle being stood unveiled before him and save for the difference in form and face he had thought perchance it was the same on whom he had gazed before so similar were their virtues powers temperament and geniussimilar in all things save that the sense of bliss in the one already appeared more chastened more timid than in the other he looked then turned inquiringly towards his companion the will of the eternal he said in answer produced at the same instant these lovely beings and breathed into both the spirit which thou seest their souls are twin borntwin born in sensation in power in beauty formed of the highest most ethereal essence and thus creating that which earth terms genius destined at the same moment to animate the beautiful habitation formed for each and at the same moment depart from it until now their fate hath been with little variation the same differing only according to their station the one standing amidst the highest and noblest of her land findeth fit companions for that nobleness and refinement indivisible from genius the other already feeleth there is that within her incomprehensible to those around her yet is the consciousness of little moment for freely and joyously she roams amid the varied scenes of nature she mingles but with those eager and anxious to enhance her innocent pleasuresto give to her exalted mind and gentle virtues the homage naturally their due she looks on the world from a distance and hath peopled it with all things fond and bright and beautiful which take their exquisite colouring from her own lovely and loving mind she yearns for appreciation as thou seestfor the praise of the multitude won by her talents but she asks not to mingle with them she seeks but the love of one and the proud consciousness of doing good to many she demands not a statelier home a prouder station thus then thou seest the earthly fate of these twin born spirits hath rolled on the same but now it is the will of the all wise all merciful all just that a shadowy change should pass over the one and bliss fuller dearer perfect as earth may feel be dawning for the other thou hast marked the quick throb of joy now playing on the heart of the noble child of genius she beholds her first triumph in the book she clasps the thoughts that breathe the words that burn have found their echo in the multitude and loving friends throng around to proclaim her dawning fame there are tears in those lovely eyes but tis a mothers voice of love of tenderness that calls them there see clasped to a parents bosom the swelling fulness of the spirit finds vent in tears for joy that pure stainless joy which is sent as the dim whisperings of heaven ever turns to pain on earth and had it not relief in tears would bear the soul away to that world of which it speaks she hath flown from the detaining throng and harkhearest thou not the hymn of thanksgiving ascending upon high till the tumultuous joy subsides and peace is gained once more he ceased a brighter radiance passed over his benignant brow and the voice of the seraph spontaneously flowed forth in kindred harmony with the hymn of earth bearing it on the wings of melody to the realms of song twas hushed and the hierarch again spake behold he said the music of his voice subdued and softened behold yet murmur not it is the will of the eternal and therefore it is well the seraph gazed on a changed and darkened sceneas deep as full as was the bliss from which his eye had that moment turned so deep so intense was the anguish he now beheld the gentle being in whom that twin born spirit breathed knelt beside the couch of the dead he marked the wrung and bleeding heart he read its utter loneliness its agonized despair he read it was a mothers loss she mourneda more than mother for by her by her alone her childs ethereal soul her fond imaginings her strong affections had been known and loved and fostered to her her beautiful had ever come to seek and find that sympathy which she found not in anotherand she was gone and the dark troubled strivings of that desolate heart not yet could deem it love she weeps and shall we condemn young brother that not yet her voice may join in the universal hymn she weeps yet knows not all her woe the stability the honour the strength of her father were derived from the mild counsels the gentle unobtrusive virtues of her mother in him they have no stay that moral evil too darkly prevalent on earth once more will gain dominion and the joys of the innocent the helpless are blighted neath its poison on earth she stands aloneyet hark what means that burst of triumph in the skies ineffably brilliant was the smile on the countenance of the angel and zephon startled yet entranced looked again on that bleeding heart the dark and troubled waves within were stilled there was no voiceno sign but the lamp of faith was lit her soul had murmured love and bowed adoring and resigned iv again did the youthful spirit gaze down on earthly joy chastened in its fulness yet ecstatic in its nature love pure perfect faithful love had twined around that fair and gifted child of earth and filled the blank which yet remained though fame appreciation triumph sympathy affection all were hers she had found a kindred soul round which to weave the clinging tendrils of her own virtues to revere piety to support uphold and cherish the soarings of her own she had found one whose praise might still those passionate yearnings the which to satisfy she had vainly looked to fameone from whose lips how sweet became the praise of the worldone to give new zest to her exalted genius for by him it was most valued most beloved zephon looked on the beautiful blossoming of genius the expansion of intellect the flowering of every budding hope and he saw too the chastened humility the unwavering love which traced these rich gifts to their source and lifted up her heart in universal love and grateful adoration and again his voice joined hers in thanksgiving once more at the voice of the archangel he sought and found the kindred essence and love was on that heart deep mighty whelming love bearing before it for awhile even the sere and withered leaves with which its depths were strewed he looked on the wreck of that which he had seen so lovelythe wreck of all save the gentle virtues the meek submission which had characterised her youth the rosy dreams the glowing visions presented but a crushed and broken mass their bright fragments seeking ever to unite but ever rudely severed genius in its deep wild burnings its impassioned breathing feeding as a smothered fire upon her own young heart seeking ever to find a vent an echoto be known acknowledged loved but falling back with every effort till even genius seemed increase of sorrowand hope yet glimmered there pale sickly shadowy in its faint rays emitting but increase of light to be immersed in deeper gloom and love was there intense all mighty yet it brought no joy she lovesshe was beloved again spake the angelic voice but the sin of the father is visited upon the child a little while he appeared devoted unto her and to the memory of the departed and though he led her from the scenes she loved to mingle more closely with the world his affection soothed his hopes inspired but he knew not the ethereal nature of that soul and the scenes which earth terms gay and joyous touched no answering chord in her and led him once again astray yet for a brief while happiness was hers banishing those vain yearnings ever proceeding from a soul too sensitive for earth but the same hour which awoke her to a consciousness of love given and returned turned back that fountain of bliss upon her seared and withered heart and changed it into gall the child of a dishonoured parent was no fit mate for nobleness and honour and earth is lone once more tears the sweet bright tears that angels weep bedewed the eyes of the seraph yet riveted their gaze on that one sad child of earth as if in its dark and troubled chaos there was yet more to read he saw too the slight and beautiful shell in which that spirit was enshrined quivering beneath the tempest till at length it lay prostrate and unhinged and intense bodily suffering heightened mental ill tis the struggle for submission and resignation that hath done this continued the angel seest thou no dream of unbelief no murmur of complaint hath entered that heart anguish may wither up the swelling hymn may check the voice of love but faith is there and mark though in his unquestionable wisdom the eternals will is to afflict though in impenetrable darkness save to those beside his throne he hideth the secret wherefore of that will invisibly his ministers are charged to hover round his favoured child to comfort and sustain though lone and desolate on earth behold bright beautiful spirits robed in light and glory hovered round the couch of sorrow yet earth hid them from their kindred essence she saw them not felt not the mild reviving influence of their spiritual presence save that gradually and slowly the chains which bound those beautiful limbs were loosed the whirlwind sweeping over that heart subsided into partial calm and strength was given her to struggle on and live zephon looked on the child of sorrow and a faint shadow stole over the brilliant iris of his wings the living rays on his brow grew dim v again did the seraph look down on earth again did he gaze on the favoured child of joy the ecstatic sense of bliss he had marked before had subsided into happiness as full as pure as thrilling yet chastened in its fulness there were young and lovely forms around her a mothers love has added its unutterable sweetness to her lot he looked on her heart and marked how sweetly and beautifully its every dream its every hope had bloomed to full maturity how softly its light cares were soothed by sympathy and love on earth and trust and hope in heaven how earnestly it sought to pour back its every gift into the gracious hand from which it sprung and lead her children as herself to the threshold of eternal joy he looked on that unveiled heart as wandering with those she loved amid the glorious shrines of nature she found in every leaf and stream and bird and flower somewhat to bid her children love and add to the inexhaustible spring of poesie and genius which rested still within and gave new zest new brightness to her simplest joy he gazed on her alone amidst the books she loved the studies her genius craved he read the deep pure shadowless joy it was to feel that gift had done its work and sent its pure and lucid flame amidst the unthinking crowd and carried blessings with it that its rich music had left its impression on many a thoughtless heart had shed sweet balm over hours of sad lonely sickness had spoken its soft sympathy to the diseased and sorrowing mind and sent new brighter purer joyance to the young eager and imaginative soul it had done these things and was it marvel she rejoiced zephon gazed but the shadow passed not from his wings and hastily and silently he turned once more to seek the kindred essence the whelming woe had given place to a strangely complicated mass of cross and twisted strings which tightly fettered down each glorious gift each cherished hope each fond aspiring yet gave them space to throb and live and whisper still the bright undying flame of genius never seemed to burn with mere oer sweeping power yet the flashes that it sent but scorched the heart that held them hope still was there sending forth her lovely blossoms but to be nipped and blighted neath the close and icy strings that stretched above them there were chains upon that spirit binding it to earth when most it longed to spring on high and the shell the lovely shell which held it was dwindling neath its withering spell the seraph marked the tension of each vein and nerve and pulse till it seemed as if the very next breath of emotion however faint would snap them in twain the painful effort to restrain the irritation of bodily and mental suffering the agony of remorse which the slightest ebullition of impatience caused he beheld her hour by hour the centre of a noisy group of children possessing not one attribute to call forth that torrent of love and tenderness with which her soul was filled he marked the starting of each nerve the hounding of each pulse at every shout of rude and noisy revelry the inward fever attending every effort to restrain and instruct he saw her when midnight enwrapped the earth alone for a brief space in a poor and comfortless room the bright visions of genius thronging tumultuously on mind and brain incongruous and wild from there having been so long pent up in darkness and woe he beheld the effort to give the burning fancies vent the utter failing of the mortal frame the prostration of all power save that which yet would lift up heart and hands in the low cry father it is thy will i know not wherefore yet oh yet if thou willest it it is it must be well and he heard unnumbered harps bear up that voice of faith in melody overpowering in its deep rich tones he marked the spirits of light and loveliness still hovering around moulding those burning tears into precious gems changing each quivering sigh to songs of glory yet still his sight seemed strangely dim the shadow passed not from his wings and man her brother man hath he no love no tenderness no thoughts for sorrow such as hers the seraph asked knows he not of the precious gifts the gentle virtues that frail shell enfolds wherefore is she thus lonehath man no answering chord man sees not the interior of that heart as thou dost rejoined the hierarch when through disobedience sin entered yon beautiful world mans eyes became darkened towards his fellows and but too often his rebellious and perverted mind wilfully refuses knowledge of his brother lest sympathy should bid him share the griefs of others in some envy foul envy the base passions which first darkened earth with death wilfully blinds lest the genius and the virtue of the poor should be exalted above the rich in others it is ignorance contempt neglect spring from that rank poison selfishness or the loathsome weed indifference which flings a thick veil over others woe and so confines the gazeit sees no farther than itself to mortal vision yon gentle being is composed and calm man marks but the outward frame love alone might trace the decline of strength the failing of bodily power but there is none near to love poverty hath flung those chains upon the heart confining the ethereal spirit dragging it down to earth yet deadening not its power poverty privation have thrown her amongst those whose grosser more material natures are incapable of appreciating the heavenly rays of genius of comprehending its effect upon the temperament and the frame they deem her lot a happy one for they cannot know how much more she needswhat cause she has for sorrow they would laugh in bitter scorn at those griefs which have their birth in feeling whose intensity whose depth of suffering are to them utterly unknown no man may not alleviate woes like hers in the dark circle her fate is fixed earth mortal fading earth is all they have no time for dreams and thoughts of heaven a spirit like to hers bearing on its brow a stamp of glory not its own alas my brother man will not mark such things sin foul sin hath dimmed its gaze the seraph folded his beautiful wings around him there was a strange dim sense of pain upon him undefined yet sad as the first clouding of mortal visions unto man ere sight departs for ever when he looked forth again the scene was changed and it was bright and beautiful though death was there the blessed the loved the cherishedshe lay there calm yet rejoicingthough the loved around her wept recalled to its native home ere age or sorrow dimmed the spirits glory joyfully willingly she heard the call for death had no pang for her she knew she parted from her beloved to meet again where never sounds farewell she knew she was departing to that blissful bourne whose glorious light had beamed so softly and beautifully on her earthly course gilding mortal happiness with immortal glory to that goal where each bright gift would be made perfect her finite wisdom find completion in infinity still still the comfort of her voice consoled the hearts that wept around her lip yet sent forth gentle words to soothe and bless when she was gone the mind the beautiful mind yet shone in all its living lightdeath had no power to dim its lustre brighter and brighter gleamed the departing soul and thoughts sweet thoughts came thronging on that heart of duties done of life that sought but good of universal love benevolence and peace and blessings of the poor the needy and the sorrowing hovered round her as angels robed in light joy joy oh still was that gentle spirit wreathed in joythe grave had lost its sting and death was swallowed up in victory irresistibly and rapidly the seraph sought the twin born spiritwhich at the same hour was to wing her flight from earth there were none to weep around her couch of loneliness and pain but one a kind and lowly hireling was near to mark that spirits parting pangto smooth the pillow and whisper of repose no sign of luxury was there no gentle hand with luscious fruit or cooling draught to tempt the fevered lip the parched and tasteless tongue dark close confined the chamber of the dyingbut a few pale flowers children of field and brook alone stood beside her to whisper twas a poets dying home save that perchance the treasured volumes still around disclosed that the mind was bright and strong and lovely still her thin hand still clasped a book her eyes lit up as they gazed upon the page and for a brief space her cheek shone with a bloom that scarce could seem of death zephon looked within the heart and started hope gleamed up amidst its crushed and broken chords hope aye and one bright flash of joy darting forth as a sunbeam midst the shrouding mass of clouds and momentary coeval with that joy the wish fond wish to live start not my brother the thrilling accents of the angel once more spake she gazes on her own fond dreams her own pure visions she clasps their record in the volume that she holds acknowledged sought appreciated her genius hast burst through the veil of obscurity and woe and fame undying fame hath wreathed his laurels to adorn the dead man will weep upon her grave will wreath her name with glory will reverence too late the genius that hath gone and therefore would she live it is the last struggle the last pangthe spirit is too pure too free to fold too long the chain which earth holds forth even though its links are joy behold the seraph looked once more there had been a strugglea brief and anguished pang joy and hope lay crushed for ever beneath the sickening consciousness twas all too late and she must die there came one murmuring doubt one painful questionwherefore she was thus called away when earth gave promise of such sweet reviving flowers and darkness spread forth her pall and shrouded up that heart but speedily it passed a soft and mellowed light gleamed up the blackened shade rolled up and fled the ruin and its chains were gone and peace and faith and joy twined hand in hand together vi zephon looked not on the abodes of man the hierarch alone stood before him surrounded by a blaze of glory ineffable brilliance shone forth from his brow and wings yet softened into compassionating tenderness was his radiant look his thrilling voice a trembling awe spread over the seraph and involuntarily he bowed before him thy will is accomplished youthful brother thou hast glanced on man spake the angelic voice yet know that which thou hast seen is but as a single grain amid the spreading sands of the boundless desert as a single spark of earthly fire amid the countless stars and blazing suns of heaven compared with the scenes of woe yon world of beauty holds when sin entered joy fled trembling up to the heaven whence he came twined as he was with purity and innocence without them earth could have for him no stay no restingman reaps the fruit he sowsfor not in a guilty world may the eternal mark the distinction between the righteous and the wicked in that which thou hast seen there was no guilt no sin twin born in purity as in their high ethereal essence yet from the imperfection of earth so widely severed their mortal fates so strangely parted if such things are ist marvel that the hymn of love of praise from lips of man should be so faint and weak zephon thou hast looked on earth thou hast marked the dealings of our father with his children speak then my brother oh speak will the song of joy of adoration still flow from thy lipsstill still canst thou proclaim him love the harps of heaven were stilled the invisible choirs hushed their full tide of song darker and darker for a brief space became the shadow around the youthful seraph and his radiant brow was buried in its shrouding folds deep awful was that momentary pause for it seemed as if the hosts of heaven themselves were hushed in sympathy and dread a sudden flood of dazzling effulgence burst through the gloomy shade dispersing it as a thin vapour on either side beams of living lustre illumined that glorious brow and in liquid music his voice flowed forth shall i be less than mortali who serve my father amidst his chosen choirs who knew him unobstructed by the veil of earth let the full song burst forth let the bright seraphim strike the bold harps again let the rich hymn swell out in deeper glory hallelujah to our father and our king his ways are dark but his will is love praise him ye
