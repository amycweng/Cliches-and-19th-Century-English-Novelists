as these pages have passed through the press mingled feelings of pain and pleasure have actuated my heart who shall speak the regret that she to whom its composition was a work of love cannot participate in the joy which its publication would have occasionedwho shall tell of that anxious pleasure which i feel in witnessing the success of each and all the efforts of her pen the days of bruce must be considered as an endeavor to place before the reader an interesting narrative of a period of history in itself a romance and one perhaps as delightful as could well have been selected in combination with the story of scotlands brave deliverer it must be viewed as an illustration of female character and descriptive of much that its author considered excellent in woman in the high minded isabella of buchan is traced the resignation of a heart wounded in its best affections yet trustful midst accumulated misery in isoline may be seen the selfinflicted unhappiness of a too confident and self reliant nature while in agnes is delineated the overwhelming of a mind too much akin to heaven in purity and innocence to battle with the stern and bitter sorrows with which her life is strewn how far the merits of this work may be perceived becomes not me to judge i only know and feel that on me has devolved the endearing task of publishing the writings of my lamented childthat i am fulfilling the desire of her life sarah aguilar may the days of bruce chapter i the month of march rough and stormy as it is in england would perhaps be deemed mild and beautiful as may by those accustomed to meet and brave its fury in the eastern highlands nor would the evening on which our tale commences bely its wild and fitful character the wind howled round the ancient tower of buchan in alternate gusts of wailing and of fury so mingled with the deep heavy roll of the lashing waves that it was impossible to distinguish the roar of the one element from the howl of the other neither tree hill nor wood intercepted the rushing gale to change the dull monotony of its gloomy tone the ythan indeed darted by swollen and turbid from continued storms threatening to overflow the barren plain it watered but its voice was undistinguishable amidst the louder wail of wind and ocean pinetrees dark ragged and stunted and scattered so widely apart that each one seemed monarch of some thirty acres were the only traces of vegetation for miles round nor were human habitations more abundant indeed few dwellings save those of such solid masonry as the tower of buchan could hope to stand scathless amidst the storms that in winter ever swept along the moor no architectural beauty distinguished the residence of the earls of buchan none of that tasteful decoration peculiar to the saxon nor of the more sombre yet more imposing style introduced by the norman and known as the gothic architecture originally a huntinglodge it had been continually enlarged by succeeding lords without any regard either to symmetry or proportion elegance or convenience and now early in the year appeared within its outer walls as a most heterogeneous mass of illshaped turrets courts offices and galleries huddled together in illsorted confusion though presenting to the distant view a massive square building remarkable only for a strength and solidity capable of resisting alike the war of elements and of man without all seemed a dreary wilderness but within existed indisputable signs of active life the warlike inhabitants of the tower though comparatively few in number were continually passing to and fro in the courts and galleries or congregating in little knots in eager converse some cleansing their armor or arranging banners others young and active practising the various manoeuvres of mimic war each and all bearing on their brow that indescribable expression of anticipation and excitement which seems ever on the expectant of it knows not what the condition of scotland was indeed such as to keep her sons constantly on the alert preparing for defence or attack as the insurging efforts of the english or the commands of their lords should determine from the richest noble to the veriest serf the aged man to the little child however contrary their politics and feelings one spirit actuated all and that spirit was warwar in all its deadliest evils its unmitigated horrors for it was native blood which deluged the rich plains the smiling vales and fertile hills of scotland although the castle of buchan resembled more a citadel intended for the accommodation of armed vassals than the commodious dwelling of feudal lords one turret gave evidence by its internal arrangement of a degree of refinement and a nearer approach to comfort than its fellows and seeming to proclaim that within its massive walls the lords of the castle were accustomed to reside the apartments were either hung with heavy tapestry which displayed in gigantic proportions the combats of the scots and danes or panelled with polished oak rivalling ebony in its glossy blackness inlaid with solid silver heavy draperies of damask fell from the ceiling to the floor at every window a pleasant guard indeed from the constant winds which found entrance through many creaks and corners of the gothic casements but imparting a dingy aspect to apartments lordly in their dimensions and somewhat rich in decoration the deep embrasures of the casements were thus in a manner severed from the main apartment for even when the curtains were completely lowered there was space enough to contain a chair or two and a table the furniture corresponded in solidity and proportion to the panelling or tapestry of the walls nor was there any approach even at those doubtful comforts already introduced in the more luxurious norman castles of south britain the group however assembled in one of these ancient rooms needed not the aid of adventitious ornament to betray the nobility of birth and those exalted and chivalric feelings inherent to their rank the sun whose stormy radiance during the day had alternately deluged earth and sky with fitful yet glorious brilliance and then burying itself in the dark masses of overhanging clouds robed every object in deepest gloom now seemed to concentrate his departing rays in one living flood of splendor and darting within the chamber lingered in crimson glory around the youthful form of a gentle girl dyeing her long and clustering curls with gold slightly bending over a large and cumbrous frame which supported her embroidery her attitude could no more conceal the grace and lightness of her childlike form than the glossy ringlets the soft and radiant features which they shaded there was archness lurking in those dark blue eyes to which tears seemed yet a stranger the clear and snowy forehead the full red lip and healthbespeaking cheek had surely seen but smiles and mirrored but the joyous light which filled her gentle heart her figure seemed to speak a child but there was a something in that face bright glowing as it was which yet would tell of somewhat more than childhoodthat seventeen summers had done their work and taught that guileless heart a sterner tale than gladness a young man but three or four years her senior occupied an embroidered settle at her feet in complexion as in the color of his hair and eyes there was similarity between them but the likeness went no further nor would the most casual observer have looked on them as kindred fair and lovely as the maiden would even have been pronounced it was perhaps more the expression the sweet innocence that characterized her features which gave to them their charm but in the young man there was infinitely more than this though effeminate as was his complexion and the bright sunny curls which floated over his throat he was eminently and indescribably beautiful for it was the mind the glorious mind the kindling spirit which threw their radiance over his perfect features the spirit and mind which that noble form enshrined stood apart and though he knew it not himself found not their equal in that dark period of warfare and of woe the sword and lance were the only instruments of the feudal aristocracy ambition power warlike fame the principal occupants of their thoughts the chase the tourney or the foray the relaxation of their spirits but unless that face deceived there was more much more which charactered the elder youth within that chamber a large and antique volume of norse legends rested on his knee which in a rich manly voice he was reading aloud to his companion diversifying his lecture with remarks and explanations which from the happy smiles and earnest attention of the maiden appeared to impart the pleasure intended by the speaker the other visible inhabitant of the apartment was a noblelooking boy of about fifteen far less steadily employed than his companions for at one time he was poising a heavy lance and throwing himself into the various attitudes of a finished warrior at others brandished a twohanded sword somewhat taller than himself then glancing over the shoulder of his sisterfor so nearly was he connected with the maiden though the raven curls the bright flashing eye of jet and darker skin appeared to forswear such near relationshipcriticising her embroidery and then transferring his scrutiny to the strange figures on the gorgeouslyilluminated manuscript and then for a longer period listening as it were irresistibly to the wild legends which that deep voice was so melodiously pouring forth it will never do agnes you cannot embroider the coronation of kenneth macalpine and listen to these wild tales at one and the same time look at your clever pupil sir nigel she is placing a heavy iron buckler on the poor kings head instead of his golden crown the boy laughed long and merrily as he spoke and even sir nigel smiled while agnes blushing and confused replied half jestingly and half earnestly and why not tell me of it before alan you must have seen it long ago and so i did sweet sister mine but i wished to see the effect of such marvellous abstraction and whether in case of necessity an iron shield would serve our purpose as well as a jewelled diadem never fear my boy let but the king stand forth and there will be scottish men enow and willing to convert an iron buckler into a goodly crown and as sir nigel spoke his eyes flashed and his whole countenance irradiated with a spirit that might not have been suspected when in the act of reading but which evidently only slept till awakened by an allsufficient call let the tyrant edward exult in the possession of our countrys crown and sceptrehe may find we need not them to make a king aye and a king to snatch the regal diadem from the proud usurpers browthe scottish sceptre from his bloodstained hands thou talkest wildly nigel answered the lad sorrowfully his features assuming an expression of judgment and feeling beyond his years who is there in scotland will do this thing who will dare again the tyrants rage is not this unhappy country divided within itself and how may it resist the foreign foe wallace think of wallace did he not wellnigh wrest our country from the tyrants hands and is there not one to follow in the path he trodno noble heart to do what he hath done nigel yes let but the rightful king stand forth and were there none other ieven i stripling as i am with my good sword and single arm even with the dark blood of comyn in my veins alan of buchan would join him aye and die for him there spoke the blood of duff and not of comyn burst impetuously from the lips of nigel as he grasped the striplings ready hand and doubt not noble boy there are other hearts in scotland bold and true as thine and even as wallace one will yet arise to wake them from their stagnant sleep and give them freedom wallace said the maiden fearfully ye talk of wallace of his bold deeds and bolder heart but bethink ye of his fate oh were it not better to be still than follow in his steps unto the scaffold dearest no better the scaffold and the axe aye even the iron chains and hangmans cord than the gilded fetters of a tyrants yoke shame on thee sweet agnes to counsel thoughts as these and thou a scottish maiden yet even as he spoke chidingly the voice of nigel became soft and thrilling even as it had before been bold and daring i fear me nigel i have but little of my mothers blood within my veins i cannot bid them throb and bound as hers with patriotic love and warrior fire a lowly cot with him i loved were happiness for me but that cot must rest upon a soil unchained sweet agnes or joy could have no resting there wherefore did scotland rise against her tyrantwhy struggle as she hath to fling aside her chains was it her noble sons alas alas degenerate and base they sought chivalric fame forgetful of their country they asked for knighthood from proud edwards hand regardless that that hand had crowded fetters on their fatherland and would enslave their sons not to them did scotland owe the transient gleam of glorious light which though extinguished in the patriots blood hath left its trace behind with the bold the hardy lowly scot that gleam had birth they would be free to them what mattered that their tyrant was a valiant knight a worthy son of chivalry they saw but an usurper an enslaver and they rose and spurned his smilesaye and they will rise again and wert thou one of them sweet girl a cotters wife thou too wouldst pine for freedom yes scotland will bethink her of her warriors fate and shout aloud revenge for wallace either his argument was unanswerable or the energy of his voice and manner carried conviction with them but a brighter glow mantled the maidens cheek and with it stole the momentary shamethe wish the simple words that she had spoken could be recalled give us but a king for whom to fighta king to love revere obeya king from whose hand knighthood were an honor precious as life itself and there are noble hearts enough to swear fealty to him and bright swords ready to defend his throne said the young heir of buchan as he brandished his own weapon above his head and then rested his arms upon its broad hilt despondingly but where is that king men speak of my most gentle kinsman sir john comyn called the redbah the sceptre were the same jewelled bauble in his impotent hand as in his sapient uncles a gem a toy forsooth the loan of crafty edward no the red comyn is no king for scotland and who is there besides the rightful heira cold dullblooded neutrala wild and wavering changeling i pray thee be not angered nigel it cannot be gainsaid een though he is thy brother i know it alan know it but too well answered nigel sadly though the dark glow rushed up to cheek and brow yet roberts blood is hot enough his deeds are plunged in mysteryhis words not less so yet i cannot look on him as thou dost as alas too many do it may be that i love him all too well that dearer even than edward than all the rest has robert ever been to me he knows it not for sixteen years my senior he has ever held me as a child taking little heed of his wayward course and yet my heart has throbbed beneath his word his look as if he were not what he seemed but wouldbut must be something more i ever thought thee but a wild enthusiast gentle nigel and this confirms it mystery aye such mystery as ever springs from actions at variance with reason judgment valorwith all that frames the patriot would that thou wert the representative of thy royal line wert thou in earl roberts place thus thus would alan kneel to thee and hail thee king peace peace thou foolish boy the crown and sceptre have no charm for me let me but see my country free the tyrant humbled my brother as my trusting spirit whispers he shall be and nigel asks no more art thou indeed so modest gentle nigelis thy happiness so distinct from self thine eyes tell other tales sometimes and speak they false fair sir timidly yet irresistibly the maiden glanced up from her embroidery but the gaze that met hers caused those bright eyes to fall more quickly than they were raised and vainly for a few seconds did she endeavor so to steady her hand as to resume her task nigel was however spared reply for a sharp and sudden bugleblast reverberated through the tower and with an exclamation of wondering inquiry alan bounded from the chamber there was one other inmate of that apartment whose presence although known and felt had as was evident been no restraint either to the employments or the sentiments of the two youths and their companion their conversation had not passed unheeded although it had elicited no comment or rejoinder the countess of buchan stood within one of those deep embrasures we have noticed at times glancing towards the youthful group with an earnestness of sorrowing affection that seemed to have no measure in its depth no shrinking in its might at others fixing a long unmeaning yet somewhat anxious gaze on the wide plain and distant ocean which the casement overlooked it was impossible to look once on the countenance of isabella of buchan and yet forbear to look again the calm dignity the graceful majesty of her figure seemed to mark her as one born to command to hold in willing homage the minds and inclinations of men her pure pale brow and marble cheekfor the rich rose seemed a stranger therethe long silky lash of jet the large full black eye in its repose so soft that few would guess how it could flash fire and light up those classic features with power to stir the stagnant souls of thousands and guide them with a word she looked in feature as in form a queen fitted to be beloved formed to be obeyed her heavy robe of dark brocade wrought with thick threads of gold seemed well suited to her majestic form its long loose folds detracting naught from the graceful ease of her carriage her thick glossy hair vying in its rich blackness with the ravens wing was laid in smooth bands upon her stately brow and gathered up behind in a careless knot confined with a bodkin of massive gold the hood or coif formed of curiously twisted black and golden threads which she wore in compliance with the scottish custom that thus made the distinction between the matron and the maiden took not from the peculiarly graceful form of the head nor in any part concealed the richness of the hair calm and pensive as was the general expression of her countenance few could look upon it without that peculiar sensation of respect approaching to awe which restrained and conquered sorrow ever calls for perchance the cause of such emotion was all too delicate too deeply veiled to be defined by those rude hearts who were yet conscious of its existence and for them it was enough to own her power bow before it and fear her as a being set apart musingly she had stood looking forth on the wide waste the distant ocean whose tumbling waves one moment gleamed in living light at others immersed in inky blackness were barely distinguished from the lowering sky the moaning winds swept by bearing the stormcloud on their wings patches of blue gleamed strangely and brightly forth and far in the west crimson and amber and pink and green inlaid in beautiful mosaic the departing luminarys place of rest alas my gentle one she had internally responded to her daughters words if thy mothers patriot heart could find no shield for woe nor her warrior fire as thou deemest it guard her from womans trials what will be thy fate this is no time for happy love for peaceful joys returned as it may be formay i doubt that truthful brow that knightly soul her glance was fixed on nigelyet not now may the scottish knight find rest and peace in womans love and better is it thusthe land of the slave is no home for love a faint yet a beautiful smile dispersing as a momentary beam the anxiety stamped on her features awoke at the enthusiastic reply of nigel then she turned again to the casement for her quick eye had discerned a party of about ten horsemen approaching in the direction of the tower and on the summons of the bugle she advanced from her retreat to the centre of the apartment why surely thou art but a degenerate descendant of the brave macduff mine agnes that a bugle blast should thus send back every drop of blood to thy little heart she said playfully for shame for shame how art thou fitted to be a warriors bride they are but scottish men and true methinks if i recognize their leader rightly and it is even so sir robert keith right welcome she added as marshalled by young alan the knight appeared bearing his plumed helmet in his hand and displaying haste and eagerness alike in his flushed features and soiled armor ye have ridden long and hastily bid them hasten our evening meal my son or stay perchance sir robert needs thine aid to rid him of this garb of war thou canst not serve one nobler nay noble lady knights must don not doff their armor now i bring ye news great glorious news which will not brook delay a royal messenger i come charged by his grace my kingmy countrys kingwith missives to his friends calling on all who spurn a tyrants yokewho love their land their homes their freedomon all who wish for wallaceto awake arise and join their patriot king of whom speakest thou sir robert keith i charge thee speak exclaimed nigel starting from the posture of dignified reserve with which he had welcomed the knight and springing towards him the patriot and the kingof whom canst thou speak said alan at the same instant thine are in very truth marvellous tidings sir knight an thou canst call up one to unite such names and worthy of them he shall not call on me in vain is he not worthy alan of buchan who thus flings down the gauntlet who thus dares the fury of a mighty sovereign and with a handful of brave men prepares to follow in the steps of wallace to the throne or to the scaffold heed not my reckless boy sir robert said the countess earnestly as the eyes of her son fell beneath the knights glance of fiery reproach no heart is truer to his country no arm more eager to rise in her defence the king the king gasped nigel some strange overmastering emotion checking his utterance who is it that has thus dared thus and canst thou too ask young sir returned the knight with a smile of peculiar meaning is thy sovereigns name unknown to thee is robert bruce a name unknown unheard unloved that thou too breathest it not my brother my brave my noble brotheri saw it i knew it thou wert no changeling no slavish neutral but even as i felt thou art thou wilt be my brother my brother i may live and die for thee and the young enthusiast raised his clasped hands above his head as in speechless thanksgiving for these strange exciting news his flushed cheek his quivering lip his moistened eye betraying an emotion which seemed for the space of a moment to sink on the hearts of all who witnessed it and hush each feeling into silence a shout from the court below broke that momentary pause god save king robert then say i vociferated alan eagerly grasping the knights hand sit sit sir knight and for the love of heaven speak more of this most wondrous tale erewhile we hear of this goodly earl of carrick at edwards court doing him homage serving him as his own english knight and now in scotlandaye and scotlands king how may we reconcile these contradictions rather how did he vanish from the tyrants hundred eyes and leave the court of england inquired nigel at the same instant as the countess of buchan demanded somewhat anxiously and sir john comyn recognizes he our sovereigns claim is he amongst the bruces slender train a dark cloud gathered on the noble brow of the knight replacing the chivalric courtesy with which he had hitherto responded to his interrogators he paused ere he answered in a stern deep voice sir john comyn lived and died a traitor lady he hath received the meed of his base treachery his traitorous design for the renewed slavery of his countrythe imprisonment and death of the only one that stood forth in her need and by whom did the traitor die fiercely demanded the young heir of buchan mother thy cheek is blanched yet wherefore comyn as i am shall we claim kindred with a traitor and turn away from the good cause because forsooth a traitorous comyn dies no were the bruces own right hand red with the recreants bloodhe only is the comyns king thou hast said it youthful lord said the knight impressively alan of buchan bear that bold heart and patriot sword unto the bruces throne and comyns traitorous name shall be forgotten in the scion of macduff thy mothers loyal blood runs reddest in thy veins young sir too pure for comyns base alloy know then the bruces hand is red with the traitors blood and yet fearless and firm in the holy justice of his cause he calls on his nobles and their vassals for their homage and their aidhe calls on them to awake from their long sleep and shake off the iron yoke from their necks to prove that scotlandthe free the dauntless the unconquered soil which once spurned the roman power to which all other kingdoms bowedis free undaunted and unconquered still he calls aloud aye even on ye wife and son of comyn of buchan to snap the link that binds ye to a traitors house and provethough darkly basely flows the blood of macduff in one descendants veins that the earl of fife refuses homage and allegiance to his sovereignin ye it rushes free and bold and loyal still and he shall find it so mother why do ye not speak you from whose lips my heart first learnt to beat for scotland my lips to pray that one might come to save her from the yoke of tyranny you who taught me to forget all private feud to merge all feeling every claim in the one great hope of scotlands freedom now that the time is come wherefore art thou thus mother my own noble mother let me go forth with thy blessing on my path and ill and woe can come not near me speak to thy son the undaunted boy flung himself on his knee before the countess as he spoke there was a dark and fearfully troubled expression on her noble features she had clasped her hands together as if to still or hide their unwonted trembling but when she looked on those bright and glowing features there came a dark dread vision of blood and the axe and cord and she folded her arms around his neck and sobbed in all a mothers irrepressible agony my own my beautiful to what have i doomed thee she cried to death to woe aye perchance to that heaviest woea fathers curse exposing thee to death to the ills of all who dare to strike for freedom alan alan how can i bid thee forth to death and yet it is i have taught thee to love it better than the safety of a slave longed prayed for this momentdeemed that for my country i could even give my childand now nowoh god of mercy give me strength she bent down her head on his clasping him to her heart as thus to still the tempest which had whelmed it there is something terrible in that strong emotion which sometimes suddenly and unexpectedly overpowers the calmest and most controlled natures it speaks of an agony so measureless so beyond the relief of sympathy that it falls like an electric spell on the hearts of all witnesses sweeping all minor passions into dust before it little accustomed as was sir robert keith to sympathize in such emotions he now turned hastily aside and as if fearing to trust himself in silence commenced a hurried detail to nigel bruce of the earl of carricks escape from london and his present position the young nobleman endeavored to confine his attention to the subject but his eyes would wander in the direction of agnes who terrified at emotions which in her mother she had never witnessed before was kneeling in tears beside her brother a strong convulsive shuddering passed over the bowed frame of isabella of buchan then she lifted up her head and all traces of emotion had passed from her features silently she pressed her lips on the fair brows of her children alternately and her voice faltered not as she bade them rise and heed her not we will speak further of this anon sir robert she said so calmly that the knight started hurried and important as i deem your mission the day is too far spent to permit of your departure until the morrow you will honor our evening meal and this true scottish tower for a nights lodging and then we can have leisure for discourse on the weighty matters you have touched upon she bowed courteously as she turned with a slow unfaltering step to leave the room her resumed dignity recalled the bewildered senses of her son and with graceful courtesy he invited the knight to follow him and choose his lodging for the night agnes mine own agnes now indeed may i win thee whispered nigel as tenderly he folded his arm round her and looked fondly in her face scotland shall be free her tyrants banished by her patriot king and then then may not nigel bruce look to this little hand as his reward shall not may not the thought of thy pure gentle love be mine in the tented field and battles roar urging me on even should all other voice be hushed forgettest thou i am a comyn nigel that the dark stain of traitor of disloyalty is withering on our line and wider and wider grows the barrier between us and the bruce the voice of the maiden was choked her bright eyes dim with tears all all i do forget save that thou art mine own sweet love and though thy name is comyn thy heart is all macduff weep not my agnes thine eyes were never framed for tears bright times for us and scotland are yet in store chapter ii for the better comprehension of the events related in the preceding chapter it will be necessary to cast a summary glance on matters of historical and domestic import no way irrelevant to our subject save and except their having taken place some few years previous to the commencement of our tale the early years of isabella of buchan had been passed in happiness the only daughter indeed for seven years the only child of malcolm earl of fife deprived of her mother on the birth of her brother her youth had been nursed in a tenderness and care uncommon in those rude ages and yet from being constantly with her father she imbibed those higher qualities of mind which so ably fitted her for the part which in after years it was her lot to play the last words of his devoted wife imploring him to educate her child himself and not to sever the tie between them by following the example of his compeers and sending her either to england france or norway had been zealously observed by the earl the prosperous calm which was the happy portion of scotland during the latter years of alexander iii whose favorite minister he was enabled him to adhere to her wishes far more successfully than could have been the case had he been called forth to war in her fathers castle then were the first thirteen years of the lady isabella spent varied only by occasional visits to the court of alexander where her beauty and vivacity rendered her a universal favorite descended from one of the most ancient scottish families whose race it was their boast had never been adulterated by the blood of a foreigner no norman prejudice intermingled with the education of isabella to tarnish in any degree those principles of loyalty and patriotism which her father the earl of fife so zealously inculcated she was a more true devoted scottish woman at fourteen than many of her own rank whose years might double hers ready even then to sacrifice even life itself were it called for in defence of her sovereign or the freedom of her country and when on the death of alexander clouds began to darken the horizon of scotland her father scrupled not to impart to her child though she seemed those fears and anxieties which clouded his brow and filled his spirit with foreboding gloom it was then that in her flashing eye and lofty soul in the undaunted spirit which bore a while even his colder and more foreseeing mood along with it that he traced the fruit whose seed he had so carefully sown why should you fear for scotland my father she would urge is it because her queen is but a child and now far distant that anarchy and gloom shall enfold our land is it not shame in ye thus craven to deem her sons when in thy own breast so much devotion and loyalty have rest why not judge others by yourself my father and know the dark things of which ye dream can never be thou speakest as the enthusiast thou art my child yet it is not the rule of our maiden queen my foreboding spirit dreads tis that on such a slender thread as her young life suspends the welldoing or the ruin of her kingdom if she be permitted to live and reign over us all may be well tis on the event of her death for which i tremble wait till the evil day cometh then my father bring it not nearer by anticipation and should indeed such be thinkest thou not there are bold hearts and loyal souls to guard our land from foreign foe and give the rightful heir his due i know not isabella there remain but few with the pure scottish blood within their veins and it is but to them our land is so dear they would peril life and limb in her defence it is not to the proud baron descended from the intruding norman and thinking only of his knightly sports and increase of wealth by it matters not what war nor dare we look with confidence to the wild chiefs of the north and the lords of the isles eager to enlarge their own dominions to extend the terrors of their name they will gladly welcome the horrors and confusion that may arise and have we true scottish blood enough to weigh against these my child alas isabella our only hope is in the health and welldoing of our queen precarious as that is but if she fail us woe to scotland the young isabella could not bring forward any solid arguments in answer to this reasoning and therefore she was silent but she felt her scottish blood throb quicker in her veins as he spoke of the few pure scottish men remaining and inwardly vowed woman as she was to devote both energy and life to her country and its sovereign unhappily for his children though perhaps fortunately for himself the earl of fife was spared the witnessing in the miseries of his country how true had been his forebodings two years after the death of his king he was found dead in his bed not without strong suspicion of poison public rumor pointed to his uncle macduff of glamis as the instigator if not the actual perpetrator of the deed but as no decided proof could be alleged against him and the high courts of scotland not seeming inclined to pursue the investigation the rumor ceased and macduff assumed with great appearance of zeal the guardianship of the young earl of fife and his sister an office bequeathed to him under the hand and seal of the earl his nephew the character of the lady isabella was formed that of her brother a child of eight of course was not and the deep voiceless suffering her fathers loss occasioned her individually was painfully heightened by the idea that to her young brother his death was an infinitely greater misfortune than to herself he indeed knew not felt not the agony which bound her he knew not the void which was on her soul how utterly unspeakably lonely that heart had become accustomed as it had been to repose its every thought and hope and wish and feeling on a parents love yet notwithstanding this her clear mind felt and saw that while for herself there was little fear that she should waver in those principles so carefully instilled for her brother there was much very much to dread she did not and could not repose confidence in her kinsman for her parents sake she struggled to prevent dislike to compel belief that the suavity even kindness of his manner the sentiments which he expressed had their foundation in sincerity but when her young brother became solely and entirely subject to his influence she could no longer resist the conviction that their guardian was not the fittest person for the formation of a patriot she could not she would not believe the rumor which had once but once reached her ears uniting the hitherto pure line of macduff with midnight murder her own noble mind rejected the idea as a thing utterly and wholly impossible the more so perhaps as she knew her father had been latterly subject to an insidious disease baffling all the leechs art and which he himself had often warned her would terminate suddenly yet still an inward shuddering would cross her heart at times when in his presence she could not define the cause or why she felt it sometimes and not always and so she sought to subdue it but she sought in vain meanwhile an event approached materially connected with the lady isabella and whose consummation the late thane of fife had earnestly prayed he might have been permitted to hallow with his blessing alexander comyn earl of buchan and high constable of scotland had been from early youth the brother in arms and dearest friend of the earl of fife and in the romantic enthusiasm which ever characterized the companionship of chivalry they had exchanged a mutual vow that in after years should heaven grant them children a yet nearer and dearer tie should unite their houses the birth of isabella two years after that of an heir to buchan was hailed with increased delight by both fathers and from her earliest years she was accustomed to look to the lord john as her future husband perhaps had they been much thrown together isabellas high and independent spirit would have rebelled against this wish of her father and preferred the choosing for herself but from the ages of eleven and nine they had been separated the earl of buchan sending his son much against the advice of his friend to england imagining that there and under such a knight as prince edward he would better learn the noble art of war and all chivalric duties than in the more barbarous realm of scotland to isabella then her destined husband was a stranger yet with a heart too young and unsophisticated to combat her parents wishes by any idea of its affections becoming otherwise engaged and judging of the son by the father to whom she was ever a welcome guest and who in himself was indeed a noble example of chivalry and honor isabella neither felt nor expressed any repugnance to her fathers wish that she should sign her name to a contract of betrothal drawn up by the venerable abbot of buchan and to which the name of lord john had been already appended it was the lingering echoes of that deep yet gentle voice blessing her compliance to his wishes which thrilled again and again to her heart softening her grief even when that beloved voice was hushed forever and she had no thought no wish to recall that promise nay even looked to its consummation with joy as a release from the companionship nay as at times she felt the wardance of her kinsman but this calm and happy frame of mind was not permitted to be of long continuance in one of the brief intervals of macduffs absence from the castle about eighteen months after her fathers death the young earl prevailed on the aged retainer in whose charge he had been left to consent to his going forth to hunt the red deer a sport of which boy as he was he was passionately fond in joyous spirits and attended by a gallant train he set out calling for and receiving the ready sympathy of his sister who rejoiced as himself in his emancipation from restraint which either was or seemed to be adverse to the usual treatment of noble youths somewhat sooner than isabella anticipated they returned earl duncan with a wilfulness which already characterized him weary of the extreme watchfulness of his attendants who in their anxiety to keep him from danger checked and interfered with his boyish wish to signalize himself by some daring deed of agility and skill at length separated himself except from one or two as wilful and but little older than himself the young lord possessed all the daring of his race but skill and foresight he needed greatly and dearly would he have paid for his rashness a young and fiery bull had chanced to cross his path and disregarding the entreaties of his followers he taunted them with cowardice and goaded the furious animal to the encounter too late he discovered that he had neither skill nor strength for the combat he had provoked and had it not been for the strenuous exertions of a stranger youth who diverted aside the fury of the beast he must have fallen a victim to his thoughtless daring curiously and almost enviously he watched the combat between the stranger and the bull nor did any emotion of gratitude rise in the boys breast to soften the bitterness with which he regarded the victory of the former which the reproaches of his retainers who at that instant came up and their condemnation of his folly did not tend to diminish and almost sullenly he passed to the rear on their return leaving sir malise duff to make the acknowledgments which should have come from him and courteously invite the young stranger to accompany them home an invitation which somewhat to the discomposure of earl duncan was accepted if the stranger had experienced any emotion of anger from the boys slight of his services the gratitude of the lady isabella would have banished it on the instant and amply repaid them with cheeks glowing eyes glistening and a voice quivering with suppressed emotion she had spoken her brief yet eloquent thanks and had he needed further proof the embrace she lavished on her young brother as reluctantly and after a long interval he entered the hall said yet more than her broken words thou art but a fool isabella craving thy pardon was his ungracious address as he sullenly freed himself from her had i brought thee the bulls horns there might have been some cause for this marvellously warm welcome but as it is i joy thou wert not punished for thy rashness duncan yet twas not in such mood i hoped to find thee knowest thou that tis to yon brave stranger thou owest thy life better it had been forfeited than that he should stand between me and mine honor i thank him not for it nor owe him aught like gratitude peace ungrateful boy an thou knowest not thy station better was his sisters calm yet dignified reply and the stranger smiled and by his courteous manner speedily dismissed her fears as to the impression of her brothers words regarding them as the mere petulance of a child days passed and still the stranger lingered eminently handsome his carriage peculiarly graceful and even dignified although it was evident from the slight and as it were unfinished roundness of his figure that he was but in the first stage of youth yet his discourse and manner were of a kind that would bespeak him noble even had his appearance been less convincing according to the custom of the time which would have deemed the questioning a guest as to his name and family a breach of all the rules of chivalry and hospitality he remained unknown men call me sir robert though i have still my spurs to win he had once said laughingly to lady isabella and her kinsman sir malise duff but i would not proclaim my birth till i may bring it honor a month passed ere their guest took his departure leaving regard and regret behind him in all perhaps save in the childish breast of earl duncan whose sullen manner had never changed there was a freshness and lightheartedness and a wild spirit of daring gallantry about the stranger that fascinated men scarce knew wherefore a reckless independence of sentiment which charmed from the utter absence of all affectation which it comprised to all save to the lady isabella he was a mere boy younger even than his years but in conversation with her his superior mind shone forth proving he could in truth appreciate hers and give back intellect for intellect feeling for feeling perhaps her beauty and unusual endowments had left their impression upon him however it may be one day one little day after the departure of sir robert isabella woke to the consciousness that the calm which had so long rested on her spirit bad departed and forever and to what had it given place had she dared to love she the betrothed the promised bride of another no she could not have sunk thus low her heart had been too long controlled to rebel now she might not she would not listen to its voice to its wild impassioned throbs alas she miscalculated her own power the fastnesses she had deemed secure were forced they closed upon their subtle foe and held their conqueror prisoner but isabella was not one to waver in a determination when once formed how might she break asunder links which the dead had hallowed she became the bride of lord john she sought with her whole soul to forget the past and love him according to her bridal vow and as time passed she ceased to think of that beautiful vision of her early youth save as a dream that had had no resting and a mothers fond yearnings sent their deep delicious sweetness as oil on the troubled waters of her heart she might have done this but unhappily she too soon discovered her husband was not one to aid her in her unsuspected task to soothe and guide and by his affection demand her gratitude and reverence enwrapped in selfishness or haughty indifference his manner towards her ever harsh unbending and suspicious isabellas pride would have sustained her had not her previous trial lowered her in selfesteem but as it was meekly and silently she bore with the continued outbreak of unrestrained passion and never wavered from the path of duty her clear mind had laid down on the birth of a son however her mind regained its tone and inwardly yet solemnly she vowed that no mistaken sense of duty to her husband should interfere with the education of her son as widely opposed as were their individual characters so were the politics of the now earl and countess of buchan educated in england on friendly terms with her king he had as the earl of fife anticipated lost all nationality all interest in scotland and as willingly and unconcernedly taken the vows of homage to john baliol as the mere representative and lieutenant of edward as he would have done to a free and unlimited king he had been among the very first to vote for calling in the king of england as umpire the most eager to second and carry out all edwards views and consequently high in that monarchs favor a reputation which his enmity to the house of bruce one of the most troublesome competitors of the crown did not tend to diminish fortunately perhaps for isabella the bustling politics of her husband constantly divided them the births of a daughter and son had no effect in softening his hard and selfish temper he looked on them more as incumbrances than pleasures and leaving the countess in the strong tower of buchan he himself with a troop of armed and mounted comyns attached himself to the court and interests of edward seeming to forget that such beings as a wife and children had existence months often years would stretch between the earls visits to his mountain home and then a week was the longest period of his lingering but no evidence of a gentler spirit or of less indifference to his children was apparent and years seemed to have turned to positive evil qualities which in youth had merely seemed unamiable desolate as the situation of the countess might perhaps appear she found solace and delight in moulding the young minds of her children according to the pure and elevated cast of her own all the longsuppressed tenderness of her nature was lavished upon them and on their innocent love she sought to rest the passionate yearnings of her own she taught them to be patriots in the purest most beautiful appropriation of the termto spurn the yoke of the foreigner and the oppressor however light and flowery the links of that yoke might seem she could not bid them love and revere their father as she longed to do but she taught them that where their duty to their country and their free and unchained king interfered not in all things they must obey and serve their father and seek to win his love once only had the countess of buchan beheld the vision which had crossed her youth he had come it seemed unconscious of his track and asked hospitality for a night evidently without knowing who was the owner of the castle perhaps his thoughts were preoccupied for a deep gloom was on his brow and though he had started with evident pleasure when recognizing his beautiful hostess the gloom speedily resumed ascendency it was but a few weeks after the fatal battle of falkirk and therefore isabella felt there was cause enough for depression and uneasiness the graces of boyhood had given place to a finished manliness of deportment a calmer expression of feature denoting that years had changed and steadied the character even as the form he then seemed as one laboring under painful and heavy thought as one brooding over some mighty change within as if some question of weighty import were struggling with recollections and visions of the past he had spoken little evidently shrinking in pain from all reference to or information on the late engagement he tarried not long departing with dawn next day and they did not meet again and what had been the emotions of the countess perhaps her heart had throbbed and her cheek paled and flushed at this unexpected meeting with one she had fervently prayed never to see again but not one feeling obtained ascendency in that heart which she would have dreaded to unveil to the eye of her husband she did indeed feel that had her lot been cast otherwise it must have been a happy one but the thought was transient she was a wife a mother and in the happiness of her children her youth and all its joys and pangs and dreams and hopes were merged to be recalled no more the task of instilling patriotic sentiments in the breast of her son had been insensibly aided by the countesss independent position amid the retainers of buchan this earldom had only been possessed by the family of comyn since the latter years of the reign of william the lion passing into their family by the marriage of margaret countess of buchan with sir william comyn a knight of goodly favor and repute this interpolation and ascendency of strangers was a continual source of jealousy and ire to the ancient retainers of the olden heritage and continually threatened to break out into open feud had not the soothing policy of the countess margaret and her descendants by continually employing them together in subjecting other petty clans contrived to keep them in good humor as long as their lords were loyal to scotland and her king and behaved so as to occasion no unpleasant comparison between them and former superiors all went on smoothly but the haughty and often outrageous conduct of the present earl his utter neglect of their interests his treasonous politics speedily roused the slumbering fire into flame a secret yet solemn oath went round the clan by which every fighting man bound himself to rebel against their master rather than betray their country by siding with a foreign tyrant to desert their homes their all and disperse singly midst the fastnesses and rocks of scotland than lift up a sword against her freedom the sentiments of the countess were very soon discovered and even yet stronger than the contempt and loathing with which they looked upon the earl was the love the veneration they bore to her and to her children if his mothers lips had been silent the youthful heir would have learned loyalty and patriotism from his brave though unlettered retainers as it was to them he owed the skin and grace with which he sate his fiery steed and poised his heavy lance and wielded his stainless brandto them he owed all the chivalric accomplishments of the day and though he had never quitted the territories of buchan he would have found few to compete with him in his high and gallant spirit dark and troubled was the political aspect of unhappy scotland at the eventful period at which our tale commences the barbarous and most unjust execution of sir william wallace had struck the whole country as with a deadly panic from which it seemed there was not one to rise to cast aside the heavy chains whose weight it seemed had crushed the whole kingdom and taken from it the last gleams of patriotism and of hope every fortress of strength and consequence was in possession of the english english soldiers english commissioners english judges laws and regulations now filled and governed scotland the abrogation of all those ancient customs which had descended from the celts and picts and scots fell upon the hearts of all true scottish men as the tearing asunder the last links of freedom and branding them as slaves her principal nobles strangely and traitorously preferred safety and wealth in the acknowledgment and servitude of edward to glory and honor in the service of their country and the spirits of the middle ranks yet spurned the inglorious yoke and throbbed but for one to lead them on if not to victory at least to an honorable death that one seemed not to rise it was as if the mighty soul of scotland had departed when wallace slept in death chapter iii a bustling and joyous aspect did the ancient town of scone present near the end of march subdued indeed and evidently under some restraint and mystery which might be accounted for by the near vicinity of the english who were quartered in large numbers over almost the whole of perthshire some however appeared exempt from these most unwelcome guests the nobles esquires yeomen and peasantsall by their national garb and eager yet suppressed voices might be known at once as scotsmen right and true it had been long very long since the old quiet town had witnessed such busy groups and such eager tongues as on all sides thronged it now the very burghers and men of handicraft wore on their countenances tokens of something momentous there were smiths shops opening on every side armorers at work anvils clanging spears sharpening shields burnishing bits and steel saddles and sharp spurs meeting the eye at every turn ever and anon came a burst of enlivening music and well mounted and gallantly attired attended by some twenty or fifty followers as may be would gallop down some knight or noble his armor flashing back a hundred fold the rays of the setting sun his silken pennon displayed the device of which seldom failed to excite a hearty cheer from the excited crowds his stainless shield and heavy spear borne by his attendant esquires his vizor up as if he courted and dared recognition his surcoat curiously and tastefully embroidered his gold or silversheathed and hilted sword suspended by the silken sash of many folds and brilliant coloring on foot or on horseback these noble cavaliers were continually passing and repassing the ancient streets singly or in groups then there were their followers all carefully and strictly armed in the buff coat plaited with steel the wellquilted bonnet the huge broadsword highlanders in their peculiar and graceful costume even the stout farmers who might also be found amongst this motley assemblage wearing the iron hauberk and sharp sword beneath their apparently peaceful garb friars in their gray frocks and black cowls and stately burghers and magistrates in their velvet cloaks and gold chains continually mingled their peaceful forms with their more warlike brethren and lent a yet more varied character to the stirring picture varied as were the features of this moving multitude the expression on every countenance noble and follower yeoman and peasant burgher and even monk was invariably the samea species of strong yet suppressed excitement sometimes shaded by anxiety sometimes lighted by hope almost amounting to triumph sometimes the dark frown of scorn and hate would pass like a thundercloud over noble brows and the mailed hand unconsciously clutched the sword and then the low thrilling laugh of derisive contempt would disperse the shade and the muttered oath of vengeance drown the voice of execration it would have been a strange yet mighty study the face of man in that old town but men were all too much excited to observe their fellows to them it was enoughunspoken unimparted wisdom as it wasto know to feel one common feeling bound that varied mass of men one mighty interest made them brothers the ancient palace of scone so long unused was now evidently the headquarters of the noblemen hovering about the town for whatever purpose they were there assembled the heavy flag of scotland in all its massive quarterings as the symbol of a free unfettered kingdom waved from the centre tower archers and spearmen lined the courts sentinels were at their posts giving and receiving the watchword from all who passed and repassed the heavy gates which from dawn till nightfall were flung wide open as if the inmates of that regal dwelling were ever ready to receive their friends and feared not the approach of foes the sun though sinking was still bright when the slow and dignified approach of the venerable abbot of scone occasioned some stir and bustle amidst the joyous occupants of the palace yard the wild joke was hushed the noisy brawl subsided the games of quoit and hurling the bar a while suspended and the silence of unaffected reverence awaited the good old mans approach and kindlygiven benediction leaving his attendants in one of the lower rooms the abbot proceeded up the massive stone staircase and along a broad and lengthy passage darkly panelled with thick oak then pushing aside some heavy arras stood within one of the state chambers and gave his fervent benison on one within this was a man in the earliest and freshest prime of life that period uniting all the grace and beauty of youth with the mature thought and steady wisdom and calmer views of manhood that he was of noble birth and blood and training one glance sufficed peculiarly and gloriously distinguished in the quiet majesty of his figure in the mild attempered gravity of his commanding features nature herself seemed to have marked him out for the distinguished part it was his to play already there were lines of thought upon the clear and open brow and round the mouth and the blue eye shone with that calm steady lustre which seldom comes till the changeful fire and wild visions of dreamy youth have departed his hair of rich and glossy brown fell in loose natural curls on either side his face somewhat lower than his throat shading his cheeks which rather pale than otherwise added to the somewhat grave aspect of his countenance his armor of steel richly and curiously inlaid with burnished gold sat lightly and easily upon his peculiarly tall and manly figure a sash of azure silk and gold suspended his sword whose sheath was in unison with the rest of his armor though the hilt was studded with gems his collar was also of gold as were his gauntlets which with his helmet rested on a table near him a coronet of plain gold surmounted his helmet and on his surcoat which lay on a seat at the further end of the room might be discerned the rampant lion of scotland surmounted by a crown the apartment in which he stood though shorn of much of that splendor which ere the usurping invasion of edward of england had distinguished it still bore evidence of being a chamber of some state the hangings were of darkgreen velvet embroidered and with a very broad fringe of gold drapery of the same costly material adorned the broad casements which stood in heavy frames of oak black as ebony large foldingdoors with panels of the same beautiful material richly carved opened into an antechamber and thence to the grand staircase and more public parts of the building in this antechamber were now assembled pages esquires and other officers bespeaking a royal household though much less numerous than is generally the case sir edward and the young lord of douglas have not returned sayest thou good athelbert knowest thou when and for what went they forth were the words which were spoken by the noble we have described as the abbot entered unperceived at first from his having avoided the public entrance to the state rooms they were addressed to an esquire who with cap in hand and head somewhat lowered respectfully awaited the commands of his master they said not the direction of their course my liege tis thought to reconnoitre either the movements of the english or to ascertain the cause of the delay of the lord of fife they departed at sunrise with but few followers on but a useless errand good athelbert methinks an they hope to greet earl duncan save with a host of english at his back bid sir edward hither should he return ere nightfall and see to the instant delivery of those papers i fear me the good lord bishop has waited for them and staysir robert keith hath he not yet returned no good my lord ha he tarrieth long answered the noble musingly now heaven forefend no evil hath befallen him but to thy mission athelbert i must not detain thee with doubts and cavil ha reverend father right welcome he added perceiving him as he turned again to the table on the esquire reverentially withdrawing from his presence and bending his head humbly in acknowledgment of the abbots benediction thou findest me busied as usual seest thou he pointed to a rough map of scotland lying before him curiously intersected with mystic lines and crosses edinburgh berwick roxburgh lanark stirling dumbarton in the power of nay peopled by english argyle on the west elgin aberdeen with banff eastward teeming with proud false scots hereditary foes to the bruce false traitors to their land the northwhy tis the same foul tale and yet i dare to raise my banner dare to wear the crown and fling defiance in the teeth of all what sayest thou fatherist not a madmans deed all appearance of gravity vanished from his features as he spoke his eye seemingly so mild flashed till its very color could not have been distinguished his cheek glowed his lip curled and his voice ever peculiarly rich and sonorous deepened with the excitement of soul were the fate of man in his own hands were it his and his alone to make or mar his destiny i should een proclaim thee mad my son and seek to turn thee from thy desperate purpose but it is not so man is but an instrument and he who urged thee to this deed who wills not this poor land to rest enslaved will give thee strength and wisdom for its freedom his ways are not as mans and circled as thou seemest with foes his strength shall bring thee forth and gird thee with his glory thou wouldst not turn aside my sonthou fearest not thy foes fear holy father it is a word unknown to the children of the bruce i do but smile at mine extensive kingdomof some hundred acres square smile at the eagerness with which they greet me liege and king as if the words so long unused should now do double duty for long absence and better so my son answered the old man cheerfully devotion to her destined savior argues well for bonny scotland better do homage unto thee as liege and king though usurpation hath abridged thy kingdom than to the hireling of englands edward all scotland at his feet men will not kneel to sceptred slaves nor freemen fight for tyrants tools sovereign of scotland thou art thou shalt be robert the bruce too long hast thou kept back but now if arms can fight and hearts can pray thou shalt be king of scotland the abbot spoke with a fervor a spirit which though perhaps little accordant with his clerical character thrilled to the bruces heart he grasped the old mans hand holy father he said thou wouldst inspire hearts with ardor needing inspiration more than mine and to me thou givest hope and confidence and strength too long have i slept and dreamed his countenance darkened and his voice was sadder fickle in purpose uncertain in accomplishment permitting my youth to moulder neath the blasting atmosphere of tyranny yet will i now atone for the neglected past atone aye banish it from the minds of men my country hath a claim a double claim upon me she calls upon me trumpettongued to arise avenge her and redeem my misspent youth nor shall she call on me in vain so help me gracious heaven amen fervently responded the abbot and the king continued more hurriedly and that stain that blot father is there mercy in heaven to wash its darkness from my soul or must it linger there forever preying on my spirit dashing een its highest hopes and noblest dreams with poison whispering its still voice of accusation even when loudest rings the praise and love of men is there no rest for this no silence for that whisper penitence atonement any thing thou wilt let but my soul be free hastily and with step and countenance disordered he traversed the chamber his expressive countenance denoting the strife within it was in truth a rash and guilty deed my son answered the abbot gravely yet mildly and one that heaven in its justice will scarce pass unavenged man hath given thee the absolution accorded to the true and faithful penitent for such thou art yet scarcely dare we hope offended heaven is appeased justice will visit thee with troublesore oppressing grievous trouble yet despair not thou wilt come forth the purer nobler brighter from the fire despair not but as a child receive a fathers chastening lean upon that love which wills not death but penitence and life that love which yet will bring thee forth and bless this land in thee my son be comforted his mercy is yet greater than thy sin and blest art thou my father for these blessed words a messenger in truth thou art of peace and love and oh if prayers and penitence avail if sore temptation may be pleaded i shall i shall be pardoned yet would i give my dearest hopes of life of fame of allsave scotlands freedomthat this evil had not chanced that blood his bloodbase traitor as he waswas not upon my hand and can it be thou art such craven robert as to repent a comyns deatha comyn and a traitoreen though his dastard blood be on thy handbah an such deeds weigh heavy on thy mind a friars cowl were better suited to thy brow than scotlands diadem the speaker was a tall powerful man somewhat younger in appearance than the king but with an expression of fierceness and haughty pride contrasting powerfully with the benevolent and native dignity which so characterized the bruce his voice was as harsh as his manner was abrupt yet that he was brave nay rash in his unthinking daring a very transient glance would suffice to discover i forgive thee thine undeserved taunt edward answered the king calmly though the hot blood rushed up to his cheek and brow i trust ere long to prove thy words are as idle as the mood which prompted them i feel not that repentance cools the patriot fire which urges me to strike for scotlands wealthat sorrow for a hated crime unfits me for a warrior i would not comyn lived but that he had met a traitors fate by other hands than mine been judgedcondemned as his black treachery called for even for our countrys sake it had been better thus thou art overscrupulous my liege and brother and i too hasty replied sir edward bruce in the same bold careless tone yet beshrew me but i think that in these times a sudden blow and hasty fate the only judgment for a traitor the miscreant were too richly honored that by thy royal hand he fell my son my son i pray thee peace urged the abbot in accents of calm yet grave authority as minister of heaven i may not list such words bend not thy brow in wrath clad as thou art in mail in youthful might yet in my makers cause this withered frame is stronger yet than thou art enough of that which hath been thy sovereign spoke in lowly penitence to meto me who frail and lowly unto thee am yet the minister of him whom sin offends to thee he stands a warrior and a king who rude irreverence may brook not even from his brother be peace between us then my son an old mans blessing on thy fierce yet knightly spirit rest with a muttered oath sir edward had strode away at the abbots first words but the cloud passed from his brow as he concluded and slightly yet with something of reverence he bowed his head and whither didst thou wend thy way my fiery brother demanded robert bringest thou aught of news or didst thou and douglas but set foot in stirrup and hand on rein simply from weariness of quiet in sober truth twas even so partly to mark the movements of the english an they make a movement which till pembroke come they are all too much amazed to do partly to see if in truth that poltroon duncan of fife yet hangs back and still persists in forswearing the loyalty of his ancestors and leaving to better hands the proud task of placing the crown of scotland on thy head and thou art convinced at last that such and such only is his intention the knight nodded assent and bruce continued jestingly and so thou mightst have been long ago my sage brother hadst thou listened to me i tell thee earl duncan hath a spite against me not for daring to raise the standard of freedom and proclaim myself a king but for very hatred of myself nay hast thou not seen it thyself when fellowsoldiers fellowseekers of the banquet tournay or ball he hath avoided shunned me and why should he seek me now why does not scotland call him scotland bid him gird his sword and don his mail will not the dim spectres of his loyal line start from their very tombs to call him to thy side or brand him traitor and poltroon with naught of duff about him but the name thou smilest at thy violence good brother duncan of fife loves better the silken cords of peace and pleasure een though those silken threads hide chains than the trumpets voice and weight of mail in england bred courted flattered by her king twere much too sore a trouble to excite his anger and lose his favor and for whom for whatto crown the man he hateth from his soul and knowest thou wherefore good my son in what thou hast offended offended holy father nay in naught unless perchance a service rendered when a boya simple service merely that of saving lifehath rendered him the touchy fool he is but hark who comes the tramping of many horses mingled with the eager voices of men resounded from the courtyard as he spoke and sir edward strode hastily to the casement sir robert keith returned he exclaimed joyfully and seemingly right well attended litters toobah we want no more women tis somewhat new for keith to be a squire of dames why what banner is this the black bear of buchanimpossible the earl is a foul comyn ill to the court for this passes my poor wits he turned hastily to quit the chamber as a youth entered not without some opposition it appeared from the attendants without but eagerly he had burst through them and flung his plumed helmet from his beautiful brow and after glancing hastily round the room bounded to the side of robert knelt at his feet and clasped his knees without uttering a syllable voiceless from an emotion whose index was stamped upon his glowing features nigel by all thats marvellous and as moonstricken as his wont why where the foul fiend hast thou sprung from art dumb thou foolish boy by st andrew these are times to act and speak not think and feel whence comest thou so spoke the impatient edward to whom the character of his youngest brother had ever been a riddle which it had been too much trouble to expound and that which it seemed to his too careless thought he ever looked upon with scorn and contempt not so king robert he raised him affectionately in his arms and pressed him to his heart thourt welcome most most welcome nigel as welcome as unlooked for but why this quick return from scenes and studies more congenial to thy gentle nature my young brother this fettered land is scarce a home for thee thy free thy fond imaginings can scarce have resting here he spoke sadly and his smile unwittingly was sorrowful and thinkest thou robertnay forgive me good my liegethinkest thou because i loved the poets dream because i turned in sad and lonely musing from king edwards court i loved the cloister better than the camp oh do me not such wrong thou knowest not the guidings of my heart nor needs it now my sword shall better plead my cause than can my tongue he turned away deeply and evidently pained and a half laugh from sir edward prevented the kings reply well crowed my pretty fledgling he said half jesting half in scorn but knowest thou to fight in very earnest is something different than to read and chant it in a minstrels lay better hie thee back to florence boy the mail suit and crested helm are not for such as theebetter shun them now than after they are donned how darest thou edward edward tempt me not too far exclaimed nigel his cheek flushing and springing towards him his hand upon his halfdrawn sword by heaven wert thou not my mothers son i would compel thee to retract these words injurious unjust how darest thou judge me coward till my cowardice is proved thy blood is not more red than mine peace peace what meaneth this unseemly broil said robert hastily advancing between them for the dark features of edward were lowering in wrath and nigel was excited to unwonted fierceness edward begone and as thou saidst see to sir robert keithwhat news he brings nigel on thy love thy allegiance so lately proffered if i read thy greeting right i pray thee heed not his taunting words i do not doubt thee twas for thy happiness not for thy gallantry i trembled look not thus dejected he held out his hand which his brother knelt to salute nay nay thou foolish boy forget my new dignity a while and now that rude brawler has departed tell me in sober wisdom how camest thou here how didst thou know i might have need of thee a quick blush suffused the cheek of the young man he hesitated evidently confused why what ails thee boy by st andrew nigel i do believe thou hast never quitted scotland and if i have not my lord what wilt thou deem me a very strangely wayward boy not knowing his own mind replied the king smiling yet why should i say so i never asked thy confidence never sought it or in any way returned or appreciated thy boyish love and why should i deem thee wayward never inquiring into thy projectspassing thee by perchance as a wild visionary much happier than myself and thou wilt think me yet more a visionary i fear me robert yet thine interest is too dear to pass unanswered rejoined nigel after glancing round and perceiving they were alone for the abbot had departed with sir edward seeking to tame his reckless spirit know then to aid me in keeping aloof from the tyrant of my country whom instinctively i hated i confined myself to books and such lore yet more than my natural inclination prompted though that was strong enoughi had made a solemn vow rather to take the monks cowl and frock than receive knighthood from the hand of edward of england or raise my sword at his bidding my whole soul yearned towards the country of my fathers that country which was theirs by royal right and when the renown of wallace reached my ears when in my waking and sleeping dreams i beheld the patriot struggling for freedom peace the only one whose arm had struck for scotland whose tongue had dared to speak resistance i longed wildly intensely vainly to burst the thraldom which held my race and seek for death beneath the patriot banner i longed yet dared not my own death were welcome but mother father brothers sisters all were perilled had i done so i stood i deemed alone in my enthusiast dreams those i loved best acknowledged bowed before the man my very spirit loathed and how dared i a boy a child stand forth arraigning and condemning but wherefore art thou thus robert oh what has thus moved thee wrapped in his own earnest words and thoughts nigel had failed until that moment to perceive the effect of his words upon his brother roberts head had sunk upon his hand and his whole frame shook beneath some strong emotion evidently striving to subdue it some moments elapsed ere he could reply and then only in accents of bitter selfreproach why why did not such thoughts come to me instead of thee he said my youth had not wasted then in idle follyworse oh worsein slavish homage coward indecision flitting like the moth around the destructive flame and while i deemed thee buried in romantic dreams all a patriots blood was rushing in thy veins while mine was dull and stagnant but to flow forth the brighter my own brother interrupted nigel earnestly oh i have watched thee studied thee even as i loved thee long and i have hoped felt known that this day would dawn that thou wouldst rise for scotland and she would rise for thee ah now thou smilest as thyself and i will to my tale the patriot diedlet me not utter how no scottish tongue should speak those words save with the upraised arm and trumpet shout of vengeance i could not rest in england then i could not face the tyrant who dared proclaim and execute as traitor the noblest hero purest patriot that ever walked this earth but men said i sought the lyric schools the poets haunts in provence and i welcomed the delusion but it was to scotland that i came unknown and silently to mark if with her wallace all life and soul had fled i saw enough to know that were there but a fitting head her hardy sons would struggle yet for freedombut not yet that chief art thou and at the close of the last year i took passage to denmark intending to rest there till scotland called me and tis thence thou comest nigel can it be intelligence of my movements hath reached so far north already inquired the king somewhat surprised at the abruptness of his brothers pause not so my liege the vessel which bore me was wrecked off the breakers of buchan and cast me back again to the arms of scotland i found hospitality shelter kindness nay more were this a time and place to speak of happy trusting love he added turning away from the bruces penetrating eye and week after week passed and found me still an inmate of the tower of buchan buchan interrupted the king hastily the castle of a comyn and thou speakest of love of as true as firmhearted a scottish patriot my liege as ever lived in the heart of womanone that has naught of comyn about her or her fair children but the name as speedily thou wilt have proof but in good time is my tale come to a close for hither comes good sir robert and other noble knights who by their eager brows methinks have matters of graver import for thy graces ear they entered as he spoke the patriot nobles who at the first call of their rightful king had gathered round his person few in number yet firm in heart ready to lay down fame fortune life beside his standard rather than acknowledge the foreign foe who setting aside all principles of knightly honor knightly faith sought to claim their country as his own their persons as his slaves eager was the greeting of each and all to the youthful nigel mingled with some surprise their conference with the king was but brief and as it comprised matters more of speculation than of decided import we will pass on to a later period of the same evening chapter iv buchan the countess of buchan sayest thou athelbert nay tis scarce possible said a fair and noblelooking woman still in the bloom of life though early youth had passed pausing on her way to the queens apartment to answer some information given by the senior page indeed madam tis even so she arrived but now escorted by sir robert keith and his followers in addition to some fifty of the retainers of buchan and hath she lodging within the palace yes madam an it please you i will conduct you to her tis but a step beyond the royal suite she made him a sign of assent and followed him slowly as if musingly it is strange it is very strange she thought yet scarcely so she was ever in heart and soul a patriot nor has she seen enough of her husband to change such sentiments yet for her own sake perchance it had been better had she not taken this rash step tis a desperate game we play and the fewer lives and fortunes wrecked the better her cogitations were interrupted by hearing her name announced in a loud voice by the page and finding herself in presence of the object of her thoughts isabella dearest isabella tis even thine own dear self i deemed the boys tale wellnigh impossible was her hasty exclamation as with a much quicker step she advanced towards the countess who met her halfway and warmly returned her embrace saying as she did so this is kind indeed dearest mary to welcome me so soon tis long long years since we have met but they have left as faint a shadow on thy affections as on mine indeed thou judgest me truly isabella sorrow methinks doth but soften the heart and render the memory of young affections youthful pleasures the more vivid the more lasting we think of what we have been or what we are and the contrast heightens into perfect bliss that which at the time perchance we deemed but perishable joy hast thou too learnt such lesson mary i hoped its lore was all unknown to thee it was indeed deferred so long so blessedly i dared to picture perfect happiness on earth but since my husbands hateful captivity isabella there can be little for his wife but anxiety and dread but theseare these thine she added gazing admiringly and tearfully on agnes and alan who had at their mothers sign advanced from the embrasure where they had held low yet earnest converse and gracefully acknowledged the strangers notice oh wherefore bring them here my friend wherefore lady readily and impetuously answered alan art thou a friend of isabella of buchan and asketh wherefore where our sovereign is should not his subjects be thy mothers friend and sovereigns sister noble boy and yet i grieve to see thee here the bruce is but in name a king uncrowned as yet and unanointed his kingdom bounded by the confines of this one fair county struggling for every acre at the bright swords point the greater glory for his subjects lady answered the youth the very act of proclaiming himself king removes the chains of scotland and flings down her gage fear not he shall be king ere long in something more than name and is it thus a comyn speaks said the lady campbell ah were the idle feuds of petty minds thus laid at rest bold boy thy dreams might een be truth but knowest thou young manknowest thou isabella the breach between the comyn and the bruce is widened and alas by blood aye lady but what boots it a traitor should have no name no kin or those who bear that name should wash away their races stain by nobler deeds of loyalty and valor it would be well did others think with thee replied lady campbell yet i fear me in such sentiments the grandson of the loyal fife will stand alone isabella dearest isabella she added laying her hand on the arm of the countess and drawing her away from her children hast thou done well in this decision hast thou listened to the calmer voice of prudence as was thy wont hast thou thought on all the evils thou mayest draw upon thy head and upon these so lovely and so dear mary i have thought weighed pondered and yet i am here answered the countess firmly yet in an accent that still bespoke some inward struggle i know i feel all all that thou wouldst urge that i am exposing my brave boy to death perchance by a fathers hand bringing him hither to swear fealty to raise his sword for the bruce in direct opposition to my husbands politics still more to his will yet mary there are mutual duties between a parent and a child my poor boy has ever from his birth been fatherless no kindly word no glowing smile has ever met his infancy his boyhood he scarce can know his fatherthe love the reverence of a son it would have been such joy to teach left to my sole care could i instil sentiments other than those a fathers lips bestowed on me could i instruct him in aught save love devotion to his country to her rights her king i have done this so gradually my friend that for the burst of loyalty of impetuous gallantry which answered sir robert keiths appeal i was well nigh unprepared my father my noble father breathes in my boy and oh mary better better far lose him on the battlefield struggling for scotlands freedom glorying in his fate rejoicing blessing me for lessons i have taught than see him as my husband as my brotheralas alas that i should live to say itcringing as slaves before the footstool of a tyrant and oppressor had he sought it had he lovedtreated me as a wife mary i would have given my husband allall a womans dutyall save the dictates of my soul but even this he trampled on despised rejected and shall i dare i then forget oppose the precepts of that noble heart that patriot spirit which breathed into mine the faint reflection of itselfoffend the dead the hallowed dead my fatherthe heart that loved me she paused in strong and for the moment overpowering emotion the clear rich tones had never faltered till she spoke of him beloved even in deathfaltered not even when she spoke of death as the portion of her child it was but the quivering of lip and eye by which the anguish of that thought could have been ascertained lady campbell clasped her hand thou hast in very truth silenced me my isabella she said there is no combating with thoughts as these thine is still the same noble soul exalted mind that i knew in youth sorrow and time have had no power on these save to chasten and to purify i trust rejoined the countess in her own calm tone thrown back upon my own strength it must have gathered force dear mary or have perished altogether but thou speakest methinks but too despondingly of our sovereigns prospectsare they indeed so desperate desperate indeed isabella even his own family with the sole exception of that rash madman edward must look upon it thus how thinkest thou edward of england will brook this daring act of defiance of what he will deem rank apostasy and traitorous rebellion aged infirm as he is now he will not permit this bold attempt to pass unpunished the whole strength of england will be gathered together and pour its devastating fury on this devoted land and what to this has robert to oppose were he undisputed sovereign of scotland we might without cowardice be permitted to tremble threatened as he is but confined surrounded by english with scarce a town or fort to call his own his enterprise is madness isabella patriotic as it may be oh do not say so mary has he not some noble barons already by his side will not nay is not scotland rising to support him hath he not the hearts the prayers the swords of all whose mountain homes and freeborn rights are dearer than the yoke of edward and hath he not if rumor speaks aright within himself a hostnot mere valor alone but prudence foresight military skillall all that marks a general as rumor speaks thou dost not know him then inquired lady campbell how could i dearest hast thou forgotten thy anxiety that we should meet when we were last together holding at naught in thy merry mood my betrothment to lord johnthat i should turn him from his wandering ways and make him patriotic as myself thou seest mary thy brother needed not such influence of a truth no answered her friend for his present partner is a very contrast to thyself and would rather by her weak and trembling fears dissuade him from his purpose than inspire and encourage it well do i remember that fancy of my happy childhood and still i wish it had been so all idle as it seemsstrange that ye never met nay save thyself mary thy family resided more in england than in scotland and for the last seventeen years the territory of buchan has been my only home with little interruption to my solitude yet i have heard much of late of the earl of carrick and from whom thinkest thouthou canst not guesseven from thy noble brother nigel nigel repeated lady mary much surprised even so sweet sister learning dearer lore and lovelier tales than even provence could instil tis not the land it is the heart where poesie dwells rejoined nigel bruce gayly advancing from the side of agnes where he had been lingering the greater part of the dialogue between his sister and the countess and now joined them aye mary he continued tenderly my own land is dearer than the land of song and dear art thou to scotland nigel but i knew not thy fond dreams and wild visions could find resting amid the desert crags and barren plains of buchan yet have we not been idle dearest agnes wilt thou not speak for me the viol hath not been mute nor the fond harp unstrung and deeper dearer lessons have thy lips instilled than could have flowed from fairest lips and sweetest songs of provence nay blush not dearest mary thou must love this gentle girl he added as he led her forward and laid the hand of agnes in his sisters is it so then may we indeed be united though not as i in my girlhood dreamed my isabella said lady campbell kindly parting the clustering curls and looking fondly on the maidens blushing face she was about to speak again when steps were heard along the corridor and unannounced unattended save by the single page who drew aside the hangings king robert entered he had doffed the armor in which we saw him first for a plain yet rich suit of dark green velvet cut and slashed with cloth of gold and a long mantle of the richest crimson secured at his throat by a massive golden clasp from which gleamed the glistening rays of a large emerald a brooch of precious stones surrounded by diamonds clasped the white ostrich feather in his cup and the shade of the drooping plume heightened perhaps by the advance of evening somewhat obscured his features but there was that in his majestic mien in the noble yet dignified bearing which could not for one moment be mistaken and it needed not the word of nigel to cause the youthful alan to spring from the couch where he had listlessly thrown himself and stand suddenly silenced and abashed my liege and brother exclaimed lady campbell eagerly as she hastily led forward the countess of buchan who sunk at once on her knee overpowered by the emotion of a patriot thinking only of her country only of her sovereign as one inspired by heaven to attempt her rescue and give her freedom how glad am i that it has fallen on me to present to your grace in the noble countess of buchan the chosen friend of my girlhood the only descendant of the line of macduff worthy to bear that name allied as unhappily she is to the family of comyn yet still still most truly gloriously a patriot and loyal subject of your grace as her being here with all she holds most dear most precious upon earth will prove far better than her friends poor words were they most rich in eloquence mary believe me we yet should need them not in confirmation of this most noble ladys faithfulness and worth answered the king with ready courtesy and in accents that were only too familiar to the ear of isabella she started and gazed up for the first time seeing fully the countenance of the sovereign rise lady we do beseech you rise we are not yet so familiar with the forms of royalty as to behold without some shame a noble lady at our feet nay thou art pale very pale thy coming hither hath been too rapid too hurried for thy strength methinks i do beseech you sit gently he raised her and leading her gallantly to one of the cumbrous couches near them placed her upon it and sat down beside her ha that is well thou art better now knowest thou mary thine office would have been more wisely performed hadst thou presented me to the countess of buchan not her to me thou speakest darkly good my liege yet i joy to see thee thus jestingly inclined nay tis no jest fair sister the countess of buchan and i have met before though she knew me but as a wild heedless stripling first and a moody discontented soldier afterwards i owe thee much gentle lady much for the nights lodging thy hospitality bestowed though at the time my mood was such it had no words of courtesy no softening fancy even to thyself much for the kindness thou didst bestow not only then but when fate first threw us together and therefore do i seek thee ladytherefore would i speak to thee as the friend of former years not as the sovereign of scotland and as such received by thee he spoke gravely with somewhat of sadness in his rich voice perhaps it was well for the countess no other answer than a grateful bow was needed for the sudden faintness which had withdrawn the color from her cheek yet lingered sufficient to render the exertion of speaking painful yet pause one moment my liege said nigel playfully leading alan forward give me one moment ere you fling aside your kingly state here is a young soldier longing to rush into the very thickest of a fight that may win a golden spur and receive knighthood at your graces hand a doughty spokesman who was to say a marvellously long speech of duty homage and such like but whose tongue at sight of thee has turned traitor to its cause have mercy on him good my liege ill answer that his arm is less a traitor than his tongue we do not doubt it nigel and will accept thy words for his be satisfied young sir the willing homage of all true men is precious to king robert and thou fair maiden wilt thou too follow thy monarchs fortunes cloudy though they seem we read thine answer in thy blushing cheek and thus we thank thee maiden he threw aside his plumed cap and gallantly yet respectfully saluted the fair soft cheek confused yet pleased agnes looked doubtingly towards nigel who smiling a happy trusting joyous smile led her a few minutes apart whispered some fond words raised her hand to his lips and summoning alan they left the room together sir robert keith informs me noble lady said the king again addressing isabella that it is your determination to represent in your own proper person the ancient line of duff at the approaching ceremony and demand from our hands as such representative the privilege granted by king malcolm to your noble ancestor and his descendants of placing on the sovereigns brow the coronet of scotland is it not so i do indeed most earnestly demand this privilege my gracious liege answered the countess firmly demand it as a right a glorious right made mine by the weak and fickle conduct of my brother alas the only male descendant of that line which until now hath never known a traitor but hast thou well considered lady there is danger in this act danger even to thyself my liege that there is danger threatening all the patriots of scotland monarch or serf male or female i well know yet in what does it threaten me more in this act than in the mere acknowledgment of the earl of carrick as my sovereign it will excite the rage of edward of england against thyself individually lady i know him well only too well all who join in giving countenance and aid to my inauguration will be proclaimed hunted placed under the ban of traitors and if unfortunately taken will in all probability share the fate of wallace his voice became husky with strong emotion there is no exception in his sweeping tyranny youth and age noble and serf of either sex of either land if they raise the sword for bruce and freedom will fall by the hangmans cord or headsmans axe and i alas must look on and bear for i have neither men nor power to avert such fate and that hand which places on my head the crown death death a cruel death will be the doom of its patriot owner think think on this and oh retract thy noble resolution ere it be too late is she who gives the crown in greater danger good my liege than he who wears it demanded the countess with a calm and quiet smile nay he answered smiling likewise for the moment but i were worse than traitor did i shrink from scotland in her need and refuse her diadem in fear forsooth of death at edwards hands no i have held back too long and now will i not turn back till scotlands freedom is achieved or robert bruce lies with the slain repentance for the past hope ambition for the future a firm heart and iron frame a steady arm and sober mood to meet the presenti have these sweet lady to fit and nerve me for the task but not such hast thou i doubt not thy patriot soul perchance twas thy lip that first awoke the slumbering fire within my own breast and though a while forgotten recalled when again i looked on thee after falkirks fatal battle with the charge the solemn charge of wallace yet ringing in mine ears yet lady noble lady tempt not the fearful fate which shouldst thou fall into edwards hands i know too well will be thine own i dare not promise sure defence from his oerwhelming hosts on every side they compass me i see sorrow and death for all i love all who swear fealty to me i shall succeed in the end for heaven just heaven will favor the righteous cause but trouble and anguish must be my lot ere then and i would save those i can remain with us an thou wilt gratefully i accept the homage so nobly and unhesitatingly tendered but still i beseech thee lady expose not thy noble self to the blind wrath of edward as thou surely wilt if from thy hand i receive my countrys crown my liege answered the countess in that same calm quiet tone i have heard thee with a deep grateful sense of the noble feeling the kindly care which dictates thy words yet pardon me if they fail to shake my resolutiona resolution not lightly formed not the mere excitement of a patriotic moment but one based on the principles of years on the firm solemn conviction that in taking this sacred office on myself the voice of the dead is obeyed the memory of the dead the noble dead preserved from stain inviolate and pure would my father have kept aloof in such an hourrefused to place on the brow of scotlands patriot king the diadem of his forefathersheld back in fear of edward oh would that his iron hand and loyal heart were here instead of mine gladly would i lay me down in his cold home and place him at thy side might such things be but as it is my liege i do beseech thee cease to urge me i have but a womans frame a womans heart and yet death hath no fear for me let edward work his will if heaven ordain i fall into his ruthless hands death comes but once tis but a momentary pang and rest and bliss shall follow my fathers spirit breathes within me and as he would so let his daughter do tis not now a time to depart from ancient forms my gracious sovereign and there are those in scotland who scarce would deem thee crowned did not the blood of fife perform that holy office and this then noble lady is thy firm resolvei may not hope to change it tis firm as the ocean rock my liege i do not sue thee to permit my will the blood of macduff which rushes in my veins doth mark it as my right and as my right i do demand it she stood in her majestic beauty proudly and firmly before him and unconsciously the king acknowledged and revered the dauntless spirit that lovely form enshrined lady he said raising her hand with reverence to his lips do as thou wilt a weaker spirit would have shrunk at once in terror from the very thought of such open defiance to king edward i should have known the mind that framed such daring purpose would never shrink from its fulfilment however danger threatened enough we know thy faithfulness and worth and where to seek for brave and noble counsel in the hour of need and now may it be our privilege to present thee to our queen sweet lady we shall rejoice to see thee ever near her person i pray your grace excuse me for this night answered the countess we have made some length of way today and if it please you i would seek rest agnes shall supply my place mary thou wilt guard her wilt thou not nay be mine the grateful task said the king gayly taking the maidens hand and after a few words of courtesy he quitted the chamber followed by his sister there were sounds of mirth and revelry that night in the ancient halls of scone for king robert having taken upon himself the state and consequence of sovereignty determined on encouraging the high spirits and excited joyousness of his gallant followers by all the amusements of chivalry which his confined and precarious situation permitted and seldom was it that the dance and minstrelsy did not echo blithely in the royal suite for many hours of the evening even when the day had brought with it anxiety and fatigue and even intervals of despondency there were many noble dames and some few youthful maidens in king roberts court animated by the same patriotic spirit which led their husbands and brothers to risk fortune and life in the service of their country they preferred sharing and alleviating their dangers and anxieties by thronging round the bruces wife to the precarious calm and safety of their feudal castles and lightheartedness and glee shed their bright gleams on these social hours never clouded by the gloomy shades that darkened the political horizon of the bruces fortunes perchance this night there was a yet brighter radiance cast over the royal halls there was a spirit of light and glory in every word and action of the youthful enthusiast nigel bruce that acted as with magic power on all around known in the court of england but as a moody visionary boy whose dreams were all too ethereal to guide him in this nether world whose hand however fitted to guide a pen was all too weak to wield a sword the change or we should rather say the apparent change perceived in him occasioned many an eye to gaze in silent wonderment and in the superstition of the time argue well for the fortunes of one brother from the marvellous effect observable in the countenance and mood of the other the hopefulness of youth its rosy visions its smiling dreams all sparkled in his blight blue eye in the glad free ringing joyance of his deep rich voice his cloudless smiles and oh who is there can resist the witchery of lifes young hopes who does not feel the warm blood run quicker through his veins and bid his heart throb even as it hath throbbed in former days and the gray hues of life melt away before the rosy glow of youth even as the calm cold aspect of waning night is lost in the warmth and loveliness of the infant morn and what was the magic acting on the enthusiast himself that all traces of gloom and pensive thought were banished from his brow that the full tide of poetry within his soul seemed thrilling on his lip breathing in his simplest word entrancing his whole being in joy scarce could he himself have defined its cause such a multitude of strong emotions were busy at his heart he saw not the dangers overhanging the path of the bruce he only saw and only felt him as his sovereign as his brother his friend destined to be all that he had hoped prayed and believed he would be willing to accept and return the affection he had so long felt and give him that friendship and confidence for which he had yearned in vain so long he saw his country free independent unshackled glorious as of old and there was a light and lovely being mingling in these stirring visionswhen scotland was free what happiness would not be his own agnes who flitted before him in that gay scene the loveliest dearest object there clinging to him in her timidity shrinking from the gaze of the warriors around respectful as it was feeling that all was strange all save him to whom her young heart was vowedif such exclusiveness was dear to him if it were bliss to him to feel that save her young brother he alone had claim upon her notice and her smile oh what would it be when she indeed was all all indivisibly his own was it marvel then his soul was full of the joy that beamed forth from his eye and lip and browthat his faintest tone breathed gladness there was music and mirth in the royal halls the shadow of care had passed before the full sunshine of hope but within that palace wall not many roods removed from the royal suite was one heart struggling with its lone agony striving for calm for peace for rest to escape from the deep waters threatening to overwhelm it hour after hour beheld the countess of buchan in the same spot wellnigh in the same attitude the agonized dream of her youth had come upon her yet once again the voice whose musical echoes had never faded from her ear once more had sounded in its own deep thrilling tones his hand had pressed her own his eye had met hers aye and dwelt upon her with the unfeigned reverence and admiration which had marked its expression years before and it was to him her soul had yearned in all the fervidness of loyalty not to a stranger as she had deemed him loyalty patriotism reverence her sovereign claimed aye and had received but now how dare she encourage such emotions towards one it had been aye it was her duty to forget to think of no more had her husband been fond sought the noble heart which felt so bitterly his neglect the gulf which now divided them might never have existed and could she still the voice of that patriotism that loyalty towards a free just monarch which the dying words of a parent had so deeply inculcated and which the sentiments of her own heart had increased in steadiness and strength on what had that lone heart to rest to subdue its tempest to give it nerve and force to rise pure in thought as in deed unstained unshaded in its nobleness what but its own innate purity yet fearful was the storm that passed over terrible the struggle which shook that bent form as in lowliness and contrition and agony of spirit she knelt before the silver crucifix and called upon heaven in its mercy to give peace and strengthfierce fierce and terrible but the agonized cry was heard the stormy waves were stilled chapter v brightly and blithely dawned the th of march for the loyal inhabitants of scone few who might gaze on the olden city and marked the flags and pennons waving gayly and proudly on every side the rich tapestry flung over balconies or hung from the massive windows in every street the large branches of oak and laurel festooned with gay ribands that stood beside the entrance of every house which boasted any consequence the busy citizens in goodly array with their wives and families bedecked to the best of their ability all as inspired by one spirit hurrying in the direction of the abbey yard joining the merry clamor of eager voices to the continued peal of every bell of which the old town could boast sounding loud and joyously even above the roll of the drum or the shrill trumpet callthose who marked these things might well believe scotland was once again the same free land which had hailed in the same town the coronation of alexander the third some years before little would they deem that the foreign foeman still thronged her feudal holds and cottage homes that they waited but the commands of their monarch to pour down on all sides upon the daring individual who thus boldly assumed the state and solemn honor of a king and armed but by his own high heart and a handful of loyal followers prepared to resist defend and free or die for scotland there was silencedeep solemn yet most eloquent silence reigning in the abbey church of scone the sun shining in that full flood of glory we sometimes find in the infant spring illumined as with golden lustre the long narrow casements falling thence in flickering brilliance on the pavement floor its rays sometimes arrested to revolve in heightened lustre from the glittering sword or the suit of halfmail of one or other of the noble knights assembled there the rich plate of the abbey all at least which had escaped the cupidity of edward was arranged with care upon the various altars in the centre of the church was placed the abbots oaken throne which was to supply the place of the ancient stone the coronation seat of the scottish kingsno longer there its absence felt by one and all within that church as the closing seal to edwards infamythe damning proof that as his slave not as his sister kingdom he sought to render scotland from the throne to the high altar where the king was to receive the eucharist a carpet of richlybrocaded genoa velvet was laid down a cushion of the same elegantlywrought material marked the place beside the spot where he was to kneel priests in their richest vestments officiated at the high altar six beautiful boys bearing alternately a large waxen candle and the golden censers filled with the richest incense stood beside them while opposite the altar and behind the throne in an elevated gallery were ranged the seventy choristers of the abbey thirty of whom were youthful novices behind them a massive screen or curtain of tapestry concealed the organ and gave a yet more startling and thrilling effect to its rich deep tones thus bursting as it were from spheres unseen the throne was already occupied by the patriot king clothed in his robes of state his inner dress was a doublet and vest of white velvet slashed with cloth of silver his stockings fitting tight to the knee were of the finest woven white silk confined where they met the doublet with a broad band of silver his shoes of white velvet broidered with silver in unison with his dress a scarf of cloth of silver passed over his right shoulder fastened there by a jewelled clasp and crossing his breast secured his trusty sword to his left side his head of course was bare and his fair hair parted carefully on his arched and noble brow descended gracefully on either side his countenance was perfectly calm unexpressive of aught save of a deep sense of the solemn service in which he was engaged there was not the faintest trace of either anxiety or exultationnaught that could shadow the brows of his followers or diminish by one particle the love and veneration which in every heart were rapidly gaining absolute dominion on the right of the king stood the abbot of scone the archbishop of st andrews and bishop of glasgow all of which venerable prelates had instantaneously and unhesitatingly declared for the bruce ranged on either side of the throne according more to seniority than rank were seated the brothers of the bruce and the loyal barons who had joined his standard names there were already famous in the annals of patriotismfraser lennox athol haywhose stalwart arms had so nobly struck for wallace whose steady minds had risen superior to the petty emotions of jealousy and envy which had actuated so many of similar rank these were true patriots and gladly and freely they once more rose for scotland sir christopher seaton brotherinlaw to the bruce somerville keith st clair the young lord douglas and thomas randolph the kings nephew were the most noted of those now around the bruce yet on that eventful day not more than fourteen barons were mustered round their sovereign exclusive of his four gallant brothers who were in themselves a host all these were attired with the care and gallantry their precarious situation permitted half armor concealed by flowing scarfs and graceful mantles or suits of gayer seeming among the younger knights for those of the barons followers of gentle blood and chivalric training were also admitted within the church forming a goodly show of gallant men behind them on raised seats which were divided from the body of the church by an open railing of ebony sate the ladies of the court the seat of the queen distinguished from the rest by its canopy and cushion of embroidered taffeta and amongst those gentle beings fairest and loveliest shone the maiden of buchan as she sate in smiling happiness between the youthful daughter of the bruce the princess margory and his niece the lady isoline children of ten and fourteen who already claimed her as their companion and friend the color was bright on the soft cheek of agnes the smile laughed alike in her lip and eye for ever and anon from amidst the courtly crowd beneath the deep blue orb of nigel bruce met hers speaking in its passioned yet respectful gaze all that could whisper joy and peace unto a heart young loving and confiding as that of agnes the evening previous he had detached the blue riband which confined her flowing curls and it was with a feeling of pardonable pride she beheld it suspended from his neck even in that hour when his rich habiliments and the imposing ceremony of the day marked him the brother of a king her brother too was at his side gazing upon his sovereign with feelings whose index marked as it was on his brow gave him the appearance of being older than he was it was scarcely the excitement of a mere boy who rejoiced in the state and dignity around him the emotion of his mother had sunk upon his very soul subduing the wild buoyancy of his spirit and bidding him feel deeply and sadly the situation in which he stood it seemed to him as if he had never thought before and now that reflection had come upon him it was fraught with a weight and gloom he could not remove and scarcely comprehend he felt no power on earth could prevent his taking the only path which was open to the true patriot of scotland and in following that path he raised the standard of revolt and enlisted his own followers against his father till the moment of action he had dreamed not of these things but the deep anxieties the contending feelings of his mother which despite her controlled demeanor his heart perceived could not but have their effect and premature manhood was stealing fast upon his heart upon the left of the king and close beside his throne stood the countess of buchan attired in robes of the darkest crimson velvet with a deep border of gold which swept the ground and long falling sleeves with a broad fringe a thick cord of gold and tassels confined the robe around the waist and thence fell reaching to her feet and wellnigh concealing the inner dress of white silk which was worn to permit the robes falling easily on either side and thus forming a long train behind neither gem nor gold adorned her beautiful hair a veil was twisted in its luxuriant tresses and served the purpose of the matrons coif she was pale and calm but such was the usual expression of her countenance and perhaps accorded better with the dignified majesty of her commanding figure than a greater play of feature it was not the calmness of insensibility of vacancy it was the still reflection of a controlled and chastened soul of one whose depth and might was known but toherself the pealing anthem for a while had ceased and it was as if that church was desolate as if the very hearts that throbbed so quickly for their country and their king were hushed a while and stilled that every word which passed between the sovereign and the primate should be heard kneeling before him his hands placed between those of the archbishop the king in a clear and manly voice received as it were the kingdom from his hands and swore to govern according to the laws of his ancestors to defend the liberties of his people alike from the foreign and the civil foe to dispense justice to devote life itself to restoring scotland to her former station in the scale of kingdoms solemnly energetically he took the required vows his cheek flushed his eye glistened and ere he rose he bent his brow upon his spread hands as if his spirit supplicated strength and the primate standing over him blessed him in a loud voice in the name of him whose lowly minister he was a few minutes and the king was again seated on his throne and from the hands of the bishop of glasgow the countess of buchan received the simple coronet of gold which had been hastily made to supply the place of that which edward had removed it was a moment of intense interest every eye was directed towards the king and the dauntless woman by his side who rather than the descendant of malcolm cean mohr should demand in vain the service from the descendants of the brave macduff exposed herself to all the wrath of a fierce and cruel king the fury of an incensed husband and brother and in her own noble person represented that ancient and most loyal line were any other circumstance needed to enhance the excitement of the patriots of scotland they would have found it in this as it was a sudden irrepressible burst of applause broke from many eager voices as the bishop placed the coronet in her hands but one glance from those dark eloquent eyes sufficed to hush it on the instant into stillness simultaneously all within the church stood up and gracefully and steadily with a hand which trembled not even to the observant and anxious eyes of her son isabella of buchan placed the sacred symbol of royalty on the head of scotlands king and then arose as with one voice the wild enthusiastic shout of loyalty which bursting from all within the church was echoed again and again from without almost drowning the triumphant anthem which at the same moment sent its rich hallowed tones through the building and proclaimed robert bruce indeed a king again and yet again the voice of triumph and of loyalty arose hundredtongued and sent its echo even to the english camp and when it ceased when slowly and as it were reluctantly it died away it was a grand and glorious sight to see those stern and noble barons one by one approach their sovereigns throne and do him homage it was not always customary for the monarchs of those days to receive the feudal homage of their vassals the same hour of their coronation it was in general a distinct and almost equally gorgeous ceremony but in this case both the king and barons felt it better policy to unite them the excitement attendant on the one ceremonial they felt would prevent the deficiency of numbers in the other being observed and they acted wisely there was a dauntless firmness in each barons look in his manly carriage and unwavering step as one by one he traversed the space between him and the throne seeming to proclaim that in himself he held indeed a host to adhere to the usual custom of paying homage to the suzerain bareheaded barefooted and unarmed the embroidered slipper had been adopted by all instead of the iron boot and as he knelt before the throne the earl of lennox for first in rank he first approached his sovereign unbuckling his trusty sword laid it together with his dagger at roberts feet and placing his clasped hands between those of the king repeated in a deep sonorous voice the solemn vowto live and die with him against all manner of men athol fraser seaton douglas hay gladly and willingly followed his example and it was curious to mark the character of each man proclaimed in his mien and hurried step the calm controlled and somewhat thoughtful manner of those grown wise in war their bold spirits feeling to the inmost soul the whole extent of the risk they run scarcely daring to anticipate the freedom of their country the emancipation of their king from the heavy yoke that threatened him and yet so firm in the oath they pledged that had destruction yawned before them ere they reached the throne they would have dared it rather than turned backand then again those hot and eager youths feeling knowing but the excitement of the hour believing but as they hoped seeing but a king a free and independent king bounding from their seats to the monarchs feet regardless of the solemn ceremonial in which they took a part desirous only in the words of their oath to live and die for himcaused a brighter flush to mantle on king roberts cheek and his eyes to shine with new and radiant light none knew better than himself the perils that encircled him yet there was a momentary glow of exultation in his heart as he looked on the noble warriors the faithful friends around him and felt that they even they representatives of the oldest the noblest houses in scotlandmen famed not alone for their gallant bearing in war but their fidelity and wisdom and unstained honor and virtue in peaceeven they acknowledged him their king and vowed him that allegiance which was never known to fail alan of buchan was the last of that small yet noble train who approached his sovereign there was a hot flush of impetuous feeling on the boys cheek an indignant tear trembled in his dark flashing eye and his voice sweet thrilling as it was quivered with the vain effort to restrain his emotion sovereign of scotland he exclaimed descendant of that glorious line of kings to whom my ancestors have until this dark day vowed homage and allegiance sovereign of all good and faithful men on whose inmost souls the name of scotland is so indelibly writ that even in death it may there be found refuse not thou my homage i have but my sword not een a name of which to boast yet hear me swear he raised his clasped hands towards heaven swear that for thee for my country for thee alone will i draw it alone shall my life be spent my blood be shed reject me not because my name is comyn because i alone am here of that once loyal house oh condemn me not reject not untried a loyal heart and trusty sword reject thee said king robert laying his hand kindly on the boys shoulder reject thee young soldier he said cheeringly in alan of buchan we see but the noble son of our right noble countrywoman the lady isabella we see in him but a worthy descendant of macduff the noble scion though but by the mothers side of the loyal house of fife young as thou art we ask of thee but the heart and sword which thou hast so earnestly proffered nor can we son of isabella of fife doubt their honesty and truth thou shalt earn a loyal name for thyself and till then as the brother in arms the chosen friend of nigel bruce all shall respect and trust thee we confer knighthood on twenty of our youthful warriors seven days hence prepare thyself to receive it with our brother enough for us to know thou hast learned the art of chivalry at thy mothers hand dazzled bewildered by the benign manner and yet more gracious words of his sovereign the young heir of buchan remained kneeling for a brief space as if rooted to the ground but the deep earnest voice of his mother the kind greeting of nigel bruce as he grasped his arm and hailed him companion in arms roused him at once and he sprung to his feet the despondency shame doubt anxiety which like lead had weighed down his heart before dissolved before the glad buoyant spirit the bright free glorious hopes and dreams and visions which are known to youth alone stentorian and simultaneous was the eager shout that hailed the appearance of the newlyanointed king as he paused a moment on the great stone staircase leading from the principal doors of the abbey to the abbey yard for miles round particularly from those counties which were but thinly garrisoned by the english the loyal scots had poured at the first rumor of the bruces rising and now a rejoicing multitude welcomed him with one voice the execrations against their foes forgotten in this outpouring of the heart towards their native prince inspired by this heartfelt greeting the king advanced a few paces on the stone terrace and raised his right hand as if about to speak on the instant every shout was hushed and silence fell upon that eager multitude as deep and voiceless as if some mighty magic chained them spellbound where they stood their very breathing hushed fearful to lose one word many an aged eye grew dim with tears as it rested on the fair and graceful form the beautifully expressive face of him who with eloquent fervor referred to the ancient glory of their country tears of joy for they felt they looked upon the good genius of their land that she was raised from her dejected stupor to sleep a slave no more and the middleaged and the young with deafening shouts and eager gestures swore to give him the crown the kingdom he demanded free unshackled as his ancestors had borne them or die around him to a man and blessings and prayers in womans gentler voice mingled with the swelling cry and little children caught the bruces name and bade god bless him and others equally impetuous shouted bruce and freedom love obey follow me for scotlands sake noble or gentle let all private feud be forgotten in this one great struggle for liberty or death thus he concluded united and faithful the name of wallace on each lip the weal of scotland in each heart her mountains our shield her freedom our sword shall we can we fail no no scotland shall be free or her green sod and mountain flowers shall bloom upon our graves i have no crown save that which scotland gives no kingdom save what your swords shall conquer and your hearts bestow with you i live and die in the midst of the shouts and unrestrained clamor succeeding this eloquent address the fiery chargers of the king and his attendant barons and esquires were led to the foot of the staircase and a fair and noble sight was the royal cortege as slowly it passed through the old town with banners flying lances gleaming and the rich swell of triumphant music echoing on the air nobles and dames mingled indiscriminately together beautiful palfreys or welltrained glossy mules richly caparisoned gracefully guided by the dames and maidens bore their part well amid the more fiery chargers of their companions the queen rode at king roberts left hand the primate of scotland at his right lennox seaton and hay thronged around the countess of buchan eager to pay her that courteous homage which she now no longer refused and willingly joined in their animated converse the lady mary campbell and her sister lady seaton found an equally gallant and willing escort as did the other noble dames but none ventured to dispute the possession of the maiden of buchan with the gallant nigel who riding close at her bridle rein ever and anon whispered some magic words that called a blush to her cheek and a smile on her lip their attention called off now and then by some wild jest or courteous word from the young lord douglas whose post seemed in every part of the royal train now galloping to the front to caracole by the side of the queen to accustom her he said to the sight of good horsemanship then lingering beside the countess of buchan to give some unexpected rejoinder to the graver maxims of lennox the princess margory her cousins the lady isoline campbell and alice and christina seaton escorted by alan of buchan walter fitzalan alexander fraser and many other young esquires rejoicing in the task assigned them it was a gay and gorgeous sight and beautiful the ringing laugh and silvery voice of youth no dream of desponding dread shadowed their hearts though danger and suffering and defeat and death were darkly gathering round them who as he treads the elastic earth fresh with the breeze of day as he gazes on the cloudless blue of the circling sky or the dazzling rays of the morning sun as the hum of happy life is round himwho is there thinks of the silence and darkness and tempest that come in a few brief hours on the shadowy pinions of night chapter vi some ten or twelve days after the momentous event recorded in our last chapter king edwards royal palace at winchester was thronged at an unusually early hour by many noble knights and barons bearing on their countenances symptoms of some new and unexpected excitement and there was a dark boding gloom on the now contracted brow and altered features of englands king as weakened and wellnigh worn out by a lingering disease he reclined on a wellcushioned couch to receive the eagerlyoffered homage of his loyal barons he who had been from earliest youth a warrior with whose might and dauntless prowess there was not one or prince or noble or english or foreigner could compete whose strength of frame and energy of mind had ever borne him scathless and uninjured through scenes of fatigue and danger and blood and death whose sword had restored a kingdom to his fatherhad struggled for palestine and her holy pilgrimshad given wales to england and again and again prostrated the hopes and energies of scotland into the dust even he this mighty prince lay prostrate now unable to conquer or to struggle with diseasedisease that attacked the slave the lowest serf or yeoman of his land and thus made manifest how in the sight of that king of kings from whom both might and weakness come the prince and peasant are alikethe monarch and the slave the disease had been indeed in part subdued but edward could not close his eyes to the fact that he should never again be what he had been that the strength which had enabled him to do and endure so much the energy which had ever led him on to victory the fire which had so often inspired his own heart and urged on as by magic power his followersthat all these were gone from him and forever ambition indeed yet burned within strong undying mighty aye perhaps mightier than ever as the power of satisfying that ambition glided from his grasp he had rested indeed a brief while secure in the fulfilment of his darling wish that every rood of land composing the british isles should be united under him as sole sovereign he believed and rejoiced in the belief that with wallace all hope or desire of resistance had departed his disease had been at its height when bruce departed from his court and disabled him a while from composedly considering how that event would affect his interest in scotland as the violence of the disease subsided however he had leisure to contemplate and become anxious rumors some extravagant some probable now floated about and the sovereign looked anxiously to the high festival of easter to bring all his barons around him and by the absence or presence of the suspected discover at once how far his suspicions and the floating rumors were correct although the indisposition of the sovereign prevented the feasting merrymaking and other customary marks of royal munificence which ever attended the solemnization of easter yet it did not in any way interfere with the bounden duty of every earl and baron knight and liegeman and high ecclesiastics of the realm to present themselves before the monarch at such a time easter whitsuntide and christmas being the seasons when every loyal subject of fit degree appeared attendant on his sovereign without any summons so to do they had been seasons of peculiar interest since the dismemberment of scotland for edwards power was such that seldom had the peers and other great officers of that land refused the tacit acknowledgment of englands supremacy by their nonappearance even in that which was deemed the rebellion of wallace the highest families even the competitors for the crown and all the knights and vassals in their interest had swelled the train of the conqueror but this easter ten or twelve great barons and their followers were missing the nobles had eagerly and anxiously scanned the countenances of each and whispered suspicions and rumors which one glance on their monarchs ruffled brow confirmed so ho my faithful lords and gallant knights he exclaimed after the preliminaries of courtesy between each noble and his sovereign had been more hastily than usual performed speaking in a tone so unusually harsh and sarcastic that the terms faithful and gallant seemed used but in mockery so ho these are strange news we hear where be my lords of carrick athol lennox hay where be the knights of seaton somerville keith and very many others we could name where be these proud lords i say are none of ye well informed on these things i ask ye where be they why are they not here there was a pause for none dared risk reply edwards voice had waxed louder and louder his sallow cheek flushed with wrath and he raised himself from his couch as if irritability of thought had imparted strength to his frame i ask ye where be these truant lords there be some of ye who can reply aye and by good st edward reply ye shall gloucester my lord of gloucester stand forth i say he continued the thunderstorm drawing to that climax which made many tremble lest its bolt should fall on the daring baron who rumor said was implicated in the flight of the bruce and who now stood his perfect selfpossession and calmness of mien and feature contrasting well with the fury of his sovereign and darest thou front me with that bold shameless brow false traitor as thou art continued the king as with head erect and arms proudly folded in his mantle gloucester obeyed the kings impatient summons traitor i call thee traitor aye in the presence of thy countrys noblest peers i charge thee with a traitors deed deny it if thou darest tis my sovereign speaks the word else had it not been spoken with impunity returned the noble proudly and composedly though his cheek burned and his eye flashed yes monarch of england i dare deny the charge gloucester is no traitor how dost thou brave me minion darest thou deny the fact that from thee from thy traitorous hand thy base connivance robert of carrick warned that we knew his treachery fled from our powerthat tis to thee we owe the pleasant news we have but now received hast thou not given that rebel scotland a head a chief in this fell traitor and art thou not part and parcel of his guilt darest thou deny that from thee he received intelligence and means of flight baron of gloucester thou darest not add the stigma of falsity to thy already dishonored name sovereign of england my gracious liege and honored king answered gloucester still apparently unmoved and utterly regardless of the danger in which he stood dishonor is not further removed from thy royal name than it is from gloucesters i bear no stain of either falsity or treachery that which thou hast laid to my charge regarding the earl of carrick i shrink not care not to acknowledge yet edward of england i am no traitor ha thou specious orator reconcile the two an thou canst thou art a scholar of deep research and eloquence profound we have heard speak on then in heavens name he flung himself back on his cushions as he spoke for despite his wrath his suspicions there was that in the calm chivalric bearing of the earl that appealed not in vain to one who had so long been the soul of chivalry himself the tone in which his sovereign spoke was softened though his words were bitter and gloucester at once relaxed from his proud and cold reserve kneeling before him he spoke with fervor and impassioned truth condemn me not unheard my gracious sovereign he said i speak not to a harsh and despotic king who brings his faithful subjects to the block at the first whisper of evil or misguided conduct cast to their charge were edward such gloucester would speak not hope not for justice at his hands but to thee my liege to thee to whom all true knights may look up as to the minor of all that knight should bethe life and soul of chivalryto thee the noblest warrior the truest knight that ever put lance in restto thee i say i am no traitor and appeal but to the spirit of chivalry actuating thine own heart to acquit or condemn me as it listeth hear me my liege robert of carrick and myself were sworn brothers from the first hour of our entrance together upon life as pages esquires and finally as knights made such by thine own royal hand brothers in arms in dangers in victories in defeat aye and brothersmore than brothersin mutual fidelity and love to receive life to be rescued from captivity at each others hand to become equal sharers of whatever honors might be granted to the one and not the other need my sovereign be reminded that such constitutes the ties of brothers in arms and such brothers were robert of carrick and gilbert of gloucester there came a rumor that the instigations of a base traitor had poisoned your graces ear against one of these sworn brothers threatening his liberty if not his life that which was revealed its exact truth or falsehood might gloucester pause to list or weigh my liege thou knowest it could not be a piece of money and a pair of spurs was all the hint the warning that he dared to give and it was given and its warning taken and the imperative duty the laws of chivalry of honor friendship all alike demanded done the brother by the brother saved was gloucester then a traitor to his sovereign good my liege say first my lord how gloucester now will reconcile these widely adverse duties how comport himself if duty to his liege and sovereign call on him to lift his sword against his brother demanded edward raising himself on his elbow and looking on the kneeling nobleman with eyes which seemed to have recovered their flashing light to penetrate his soul wrath itself appeared to have subsided before this calm yet eloquent appeal which in that age could scarcely have been resisted without affecting the honor of the knight to whom it was addressed an expression of suffering amounting almost to anguish took the place of energy and fervor on the noble countenance of gloucester and his voice which had never once quivered or failed him in the height of edwards wrath now absolutely shook with the effort to master his emotion twice he essayed to speak ere words came at length with robert of carrick gilbert of gloucester was allied as brother my liege he said with robert the rebel robert the wouldbe king the daring opposer of my sovereign gloucester can have naught in common my liege as a knight and gentleman i have done my duty fearlessly openly as fearlessly as openly as your graces loyal liegeman fief and subject in the camp and in the court in victory or defeat against all manner or ranks of men be they friends or foes to my secret heart i am thine and thine alone in proof of which submission my royal liege lest still in your graces judgment gloucester be not cleared from treachery behold i resign alike my sword and coronet to your royal hands never again to be resumed save at my sovereigns bidding his voice became again firm ere he concluded and with the same respectful deference yet manly pride which had marked his bearing throughout he laid his sheathed sword and golden coronet at his sovereigns feet and then rising steadily and unflinchingly returned edwards searching glance and calmly awaited his decision by st edward baron of gloucester he exclaimed in his own tone of kingly courtesy mingled with a species of admiration he cared not to conceal thou hast fairly challenged us to run a tilt with thee not of sword and lance but of all knightly and generous courtesy i were no true knight to condemn nor king to mistrust thee yet of a truth the fruit of thy rash act might chafe a cooler mood than ours knowest thou sir john comyn is murderedmurdered by the arch traitor thou hast saved from our wrath i heard it good my liege calmly returned gloucester robert of carrick was no temper to pass by injuries aggravated traitorous injuries unavenged and this is all thou sayest exclaimed edward his wrath once again gaining dominion wouldst thou defend this base deed on plea forsooth that comyn was a traitor traitorand to whom to the man that trusted him my liege to him he falsely swore to second and to aid to every law of knighthood and of honor i say he was a traitor and deserved his fate and this to thy sovereign madman to us whose dignity and person have been insulted lowered trampled on by all the saints thou hast tempted us too far what ho there guards am i indeed so old and witless he muttered sinking back again upon the couch from which he had started in the moment of excitement as so soon to forget a knightly nobleness which in former days would have knitted my very soul to his bah tis this fell disease that spoke not edward away with ye sir guards we want ye not he added imperatively as they approached at his summons and thou sir earl take up thy sword and hence from my sight a whileanswer not but obey i fear more for mine own honor than thou dost for thy head we neither disarm nor restrain thee for we trust thee still but away with thee for on our kingly faith thou hast tried us sorely gloucester flung himself on his knee beside his sovereign his lips upon the royal hand which though scarcely yielded to him was not withheld and hastily resuming his sword and coronet with a deep reverence silently withdrew the king looked after him admiration and fierce anger struggling for dominion alike on his countenance as in his heart and then sternly and piercingly he scanned the noble crowd who hushed into a silence of terror as well as of extreme interest during the scene they had beheld now seemed absolutely to shrink from the dark flashing orbs of the king as they rested on each successively as if the accusation of lip would follow that of eye and the charge of treason fall indiscriminately on all but exhausted from the passion to which he had given vent edward once more stretched himself on his cushions and merely muttered deserved his fatea traitor is gloucester mador worse disloyal no that open brow and fearless eye are truth and faithfulness alone i will not doubt him tis but his lingering love for that foul traitor bruce which i were no true knight to hold in blame but that murder that base murderinsult alike to our authority our realmby every saint in heaven it shall be fearfully avenged and that madman rue the day he dared fling down the gauntlet of rebellion and as he spoke his right hand instinctively grasped the hilt of his sword and half drew it from its sheath madman in very truth my liege said aymer de valence earl of pembroke who high in favor with his sovereign alone ventured to address him as your grace will believe when i say not only hath he dared defy thee by the murder of comyn but has had the presumptuous folly to enact the farce of coronation taking upon himself all the insignia of a king how what sayst thou de valence returned edward again starting up coronationking by st edward this passeth all credence whence hadst thou this witless news from sure authority my liege marvellous as they seem these papers if it please your grace to peruse contain matters of import which demand most serious attention anon anon sir earl answered edward impatiently as pembroke kneeling laid the papers on a small table of ivory which stood at the monarchs side tell me more of this strange farce a king ha ha does the rebel think tis but to put a crown upon his head and a sceptre in his hand that makes the monarcha king forsooth and who officiated at this right solemn mockery twas doubtless a goodly sight on my knightly faith my liege strangely yet truly twas a ceremony regally performed and save for numbers regally attended thou darest not tell me so exclaimed the king striking his clenched hand fiercely on the table i tell thee thou darest not tis a false tale a lie thrust upon thee to rouse thy spirit but to laugh at de valence i tell thee tis a thing that cannot be scotland is laid too low her energies are crushed her best and bravest lying in no bloodless graves who is there to attend this puppet king save the few we miss who dared provoke our wrath by the countenance of such a deed who would dare tempt our fury by placing a crown on the rebels head i tell thee they have played thee falseit cannot be thy valor hath done much my gracious liege returned pembroke far more than ever king hath done before but pardon me your grace the people of scotland are not yet crushed they lie apparently in peace till a chief capable of guiding lordly in rank and knightly in war ariseth and then they too stand forth yet what are they they do but nominally swell the rebels court they do but seem a multitude which needs but thy presence to disperse he cannot if he dare resist thee and wherefore should these tidings so disturb you grace interposed the earl of hereford a brave blunt soldier like his own charger snuffing the scent of war far off we have but to bridle on our harness and we shall hear no more of solemn farces like to this give but the word my sovereign and these ignoble rebels shall be cut off to a man by an army as numerous and well appointed as any that have yet followed your grace to victory tis a pity they have but to encounter traitors and rebels instead of knightly foes continued the high constable of england perchance robert of carrick deems the assumption of king will provoke your grace to combat even more than his traitorous rebellion imagining in his madness the title of king may make ye equals laughingly observed the earl of arundel and remarks and opinions of similar import passed round but edward who had snatched the papers as he ceased to speak and was now deeply engrossed in their contents neither replied to nor heeded them darker and darker grew the frown upon his brow his tightly compressed lip his heaving chest betraying the fearful passion that agitated him but when he spoke there was evidently a struggle for that dignified calmness which in general distinguished him though ever and anon burst forth the undisguised voice of wrath tis well tis very well he said these wild scots would tempt us to the utmost and they shall be satisfied ah my lords of buchan and fife give ye good morrow what think ye of these doings amidst your countrymen bethink ye they have done well well as relates to their own ruin aye very well my liege they act but as would every follower of the murderer bruce replied buchan harshly and sullenly they are mad stark mad your highness the loss of a little blood may bring them to their senses rejoined the more volatile fife and is it thus ye think base villainous traitors as ye are leagued with the rebel band in his coronation my lord of chester attach them of high treason what means your grace exclaimed both noblemen at once but in very different accents of what are we charged and who dare make this lying accusation are ye indeed so ignorant replied the king jibingly know ye not that isabella countess of buchan and representative in the absence of her brother of the earldom of fife hath so dared our displeasure as to place the crown on the rebels head and vow him homage hath she indeed dared so to do by heaven she shall rue this burst wrathfully from buchan his swarthy countenance assuming a yet swarthier aspect my liege i swear to thee by the holy cross i knew no more of this than did your grace thinkest thou i would aid and abet the cause of one not merely a rebel and a traitor but the foul murderer of a comynone at whose hands by the swords point have i sworn to demand my kinsman and avenge him and wherefore did isabella of buchan take upon herself this deed my liege but because the only male descendant of her house refused to give his countenance or aid to this false earl because duncan of fife was neither a rebel himself nor gave his aid to rebels on the honor of a knight my liege i know naught of this foul deed it may be it may be answered edward impatiently we will see to it and condemn ye not unheard but in times like these when traitors and rebels walk abroad and insult us to our very teeth by st edward our honor our safety demands the committal of the suspected till they be cleared resign your swords to my lord of chester and confine yourselves to your apartments if ye be innocent we will find means to repay you for the injustice we have done if not the axe and the block shall make short work begone black as a thunderbolt was the scowl that lowered over the brow of buchan as he sullenly unclasped his sword and gave it into the lord constables hand while with an action of careless recklessness the earl of fife followed his example and they retired together the one scowling defiance on all who crossed his path the other jesting and laughing with each and all i would not give my best falcon as pledge for the countess of buchans welldoing an she hath done this without her lords connivance whispered the prince of wales to one of his favorites with many of whom he had been conversing in a low voice as if his fathers wrathful accents were not particularly grateful to his ear nor would i pledge a hawk for her safety if she fall into his graces hands whether with her lords consent or no replied the young nobleman laughing your royal father is fearfully incensed better destroy them root and branch at once said the prince who like all weak minds loved any extremity better than a protracted struggle exterminate with fire and sword ravage the land till there be neither food for man nor beast let neither noble nor serf remain and then perchance we shall hear no more of scotland on my faith i am sick of the word not so the king my royal lord returned his companion see how eagerly he talks to my lords of pembroke and hereford we shall have our sovereign yet again at our head and it was even as he said the king with that strong selfcommand which disease alone could in any way cause to fail now conquering alike his bitter disappointment and the fury it engendered turned his whole thought and energy towards obtaining the downfall of his insolent opponents at one stroke and for that purpose summoning around him the brave companions of former campaigns and other officers of state he retired with them to his private closet to deliberate more at length on the extraordinary news they had received and the best means of nipping the rebellion in the bud chapter vii the evening of this eventful day found the scottish earls seated together in a small apartment of one of the buildings adjoining the royal palace which in the solemn seasons we have enumerated was always crowded with guests who were there feasted and maintained at the kings expense during the whole of their stay inconveniences in their private quarters were little heeded by the nobles who seldom found themselves there save for the purpose of a few hours sleep and served but to enhance by contrast the lavish richness and luxury which surrounded them in the palace and presence of their king but to the earls of buchan and fife the inconveniences of their quarters very materially increased the irritability and annoyance of their present situation fife had stretched himself on two chairs and leaning his elbows on the broad shelf formed by the small casement cast many wistful glances on the street below through which richlyattired gallants both on foot and horseback were continually passing he was one of those frivolous little minds with whom the present is all in all caring little for the past and still less for the future it was no marvel therefore that he preferred the utter abandonment of his distracted country for the luxury and ease attending the court and camp of edward to the great dangers and little recompense attending the toils and struggles of a patriot the only emotion of any weight with him was the remembrance of and desire of avenging petty injuries fancying and aggravating them when in fact none was intended very different was the character of the earl of buchan morose fierce his natural hardness of disposition unsoftened by one whisper of chivalry although educated in the best school of knighthood and continually the follower of king edward he adhered to him first simply because his estates in england were far more to his taste than those in scotland towards which he felt no filial tie and soon after his marriage repugnance to his highminded and richlygifted countess which ever seemed a reproach and slur upon himself kept him still more aloof satisfied that the close retirement in which she lived the desert and rugged situation of his castle would effectually debar her from using that influence he knew she possessed and keep her wholly and solely his own a strange kind of feeling when in reality the wide contrast between them made her an object of dislike only to be accounted for by the fact that a dark suspicious jealous temper was ever at work within him now do but look at that fellows doublet comyn look how gay they pass below and here am i with my new richlybroidered suit with which i thought to brave it with the best of themhere am i i say pent up in stone walls like a caged goldfinch stead of the entertainment i had pictured tis enough to chafe the spirit of a saint and canst thou think of such things now thou sorry fool demanded buchan sternly pausing in his hurried stride up and down the narrow precincts of the chamber hast thou no worthier subject for contemplation none save thy dutiful wifes most dutiful conduct comyn which being the less agreeable of the two i dismiss the first i owe her small thanks for playing the representative of my house methinks her imprisonment would better serve king edwards cause and ours too aye imprisonmentimprisonment for life muttered the earl slowly let but king edward restore me my good sword and he may wreak his vengeance on her as he listeth not all the castles of scotland the arms of scottish men dare guard a wife against her husband bitterly shall she rue this deed and thy son my gentle kinsman what wilt thou do with him bethink thee thou wilt find him as great a rebel as his mother i have ever told thee thou wert a fool to leave him so long with his brainstruck mother she hath not she dared not bring him with her to the murderer of his kinsmanduncan of fife i tell thee she dare not but if she hath why he is but a child a mere boy incapable of forming judgment one way or the other not so much a child as thou thinkest my good lord some sixteen years or so have made a stalwart warrior ere this be warned send off a trusty messenger to the tower of buchan and without any time for warning bring that boy as the hostage of thy good faith and loyalty to edward thou wilt thus cure him of his patriotic fancies and render thine interest secure and as thou desirest to reward thy dutiful partner thou wilt do it effectually for trust me that boy is the very apple of her eye in her affections her very dotingplace jest not duncan or by all the saints thou wilt drive me mad wrathfully exclaimed buchan it shall be as thou sayest and more i will gain the royal warrant for the deedpermission to this effect may shorten this cursed confinement for us both i have forgotten the boys age his mothers highsounding patriotism may have tinctured him already thou smilest at thy marvellous good faith in thy wifes patriotism good kinsmanoh well perchance like charity it covereth a multitude of sins what meanest thou my lord of fife demanded buchan shortly and abruptly pausing in his walk to face his companion his suspicious temper instantly aroused by fifes peculiar tone what wouldst thou insinuate tamper not with me thou knowest i am no subject for a jest i have but to look on thee to know that my most solemnvisaged brother i neither insinuate nor tamper with your lordship simply and heartily i do but give thee joy for thy faith in female patriotism answered fife carelessly but with an expression of countenance that did not accord with his tone what in the fiends name then has urged her to this mad act if it be not what she and others as mad as she call patriotism may not a lurking affection for the bruce have given incentive to love of country buchan of a truth thou art dull as a swordblade when plunged in muddy water affection for the bruce thou art mad as she is duncan what the foul fiend knows she of the bruce no no tis too wild a talewhen have they ever met more often than thou listeth gentle kinsman returned fife with just sufficient show of mystery to lash his companion into fury i could tell thee of a time when robert of carrick was domesticated with my immaculate sister hunting with her hawking with her reading with her making favorable impressions on every heart in fife castle save mine own and she loved himshe was loved muttered buchan and she vowed her troth to me the foulmouthed traitress she loved him saidst thou on my faith i know not comyn rumors i know went abroad that it would have been better for the lady isabellas peace and honor if this gallant fairspoken knight had kept aloof and then her brother carest not to speak these things and in that reckless tone by st swithin ye are well matched returned buchan with a short and bitter laugh of scorn faith comyn i love mine own life and comfort too well to stand up the champion of womans honor besides i vouch not for the truth of floating rumors i tell thee but what comes across my brain for its worth thou art the best judge i were a fool to mine own interest to doubt thee now little worth as are thy words in common again muttered the incensed earl resuming his hasty strides patriotism loyalty ha ha highsounding words forsooth and have they not met since then until now he demanded stopping suddenly before his companion even so fair kinsman whilst thou wert doing such loyal duty to edward after the battle of falkirk forgetting thou hadst a wife and castle to look after robert earl of carrick found a comfortable domicile within thy stone walls and in the fair sweet company of thine isabella my lord no doubt in all honorable and seemly intercourse gallant devotion on the one side and dignified courtesy on the othernothing more depend ont still it seems but natural that the memory of a comely face and knightly form should prove incentives to loyalty and patriotism the foul fiend take thy jesting exclaimed buchan natural forsooth aye the same nature that bade me loathe the presence aye the very name of that deceiving traitress and so that smoothfaced villain carrick found welcome in the castle of a comyn the months we missed him from the court ha ha thou hast done me good service lord of fife i had not enough of injuries before to demand at the hand of robert bruce and for dame isabella may the fury of every fiend follow me if i place her not in the hands of edward alive or dead his wrath will save me the trouble of seeking further vengeance nay thou art a very fool to be so chafed coolly observed fife thou hast taken no care of thy wife and therefore hast no right to demand strict account of her amusements in thy absence and how do we know she is not as virtuous as the rest of them i do but tell thee of these things to pass away the time ha there goes the princes gascon favorite by mine honor gaveston sports it bravely look at his crimson mantle wadded with sables he hath changed his garb since morning faith he is a lucky dog the princes love may be valued at some thousand marks a yearworth possessing by st michael a muttered oath was all the reply which his companion vouchsafed nor did the thundercloud upon his brow disperse that evening the careless recklessness of fife had no power to lessen in the earls mind the weight of the shameful charge he had brought against the countess buchans dark suspicious mind not alone received it but cherished it revelled in it as giving him that which he had long desired a good foundation for dislike and jealousy a wellfounded pretence for every species of annoyance and revenge the earl of fife who had in fact merely spoken as he had said to while away the time and for the pleasure of seeing his brotherinlaw enraged thought as little of his words after as he had before they were uttered a licentious follower of pleasure in every form himself he imagined as such thoughtless characters generally do that everybody must be like him from his weak and volatile mind then all remembrance of that evenings conversation faded as soon as it was spoken but with the earl of buchan it remained brooding on itself and filling his dark spirit with yet blacker fancies the confinement of the scottish noblemen was not of long duration edward whose temper save when his ambition was concerned was generally just and equitable discovering after an impartial examination that they were in no ways connected with the affairs in the north and feeling also it was his interest to conciliate the regard of all the scottish nobles disaffected to bruce very soon restored them alike to their personal liberty and to his favor his courteous apology for unjust suspicion frankly acknowledging that the news from scotland combined with his irritating disease had rendered him blind and suspicious at once disarmed fife of wrath buchan perhaps had not been so easily appeased had his mind been less darkly engrossed his petition that his son might be sent for to be placed as a hostage in the hands of edward and thus saved from the authority of his mother whom he represented as an artful designing woman possessed of dangerous influence was acceded to on the instant and the kings full confidence restored it was easy to act upon edwards mind already incensed against isabella of buchan for her daring defiance of his power and buchan did work till he felt perfectly satisfied that the wife he hated would be fully cared for without the very smallest trouble or interference on his part save the obtaining possession of her person that the vengeance he had vowed would be fully perfected without any reproach or stigma cast upon his name meantime the exertions of the king of england for the suppression of the rebels continued with unabated ardor orders were issued and proclaimed in every part of england for the gathering together one of the noblest and mightiest armies that had ever yet followed him to war to render it still more splendidly impressive and give fresh incentive to his subjects whose warlike spirit he perhaps feared might be somewhat depressed by this constant call upon them for the reduction of a country ever rising in revolt edward caused proclamation to be severally made in every important town or county that all who were under the obligation to become knights and possessed the necessary means should appear at westminster on the coming solemn season of whitsuntide where they should be furnished with every requisite save and except the trappings for their horses from the kings wardrobe and be treated with all solemn honor and distinction as best befitted their rank and the holy vows they took upon themselves a proclamation such as this in the very heart of the chivalric era was allsufficient to engage every englishman heart and soul in the service of his king and ere the few weeks intervening between easter and whitsuntide were passed westminster and its environs presented a scene of martial magnificence and knightly splendor which had never before been equalled three hundred noble youths sons of earls barons and knights speedily assembled at the place appointed all attended according to their rank and pretensions all hot and fiery spirits eager to prove by their prompt attendance their desire to accept their sovereigns invitation the splendor of their attire seemed to demand little increase from the bounty of the king but nevertheless fine linen garments rich purple robes and superb mantles woven with gold were bestowed on each youthful candidate thus strengthening the links which bound him to his chivalric sovereign by the gratification of his vanity in addition to the envied honors of knighthood as our tale relates more to scottish than to english history we may not linger longer on the affairs of south britain than is absolutely necessary for the clear comprehension of the situation of her far less flourishing sister exciting therefore as was the scene enacted in westminster descriptive as it was of the spirit of the age we are compelled to give it but a hasty glance and pass on to events of greater moment glorious indeed to an eyewitness must have been the ceremony of admitting these noble and valiant youths into the solemn mysteries and chivalric honors of knighthood on that day the prince of wales was first dubbed a knight and made duke of aquitaine and so great was the pressure of the crowd in their eagerness to witness the ceremonial in the abbey where the prince hastened to confer his newlyreceived dignity on his companions that three knights were killed and several fainted from heat and exhaustion strong warhorses were compelled to drive back and divide the pressing crowds ere the ceremony was allowed to proceed a solemn banquet succeeded and then it was that edward whose energy of mind appeared completely to have annihilated disease and weakness of frame made that extraordinary vow which it has puzzled both historian and antiquary satisfactorily to explain the matter of the vow merely betrayed the indomitable spirit of the man but the manner seemed strange even in that age two swans decorated with golden nets and gilded reeds were placed in solemn pomp before the king and he with imposing fervor made a solemn vow to the almighty and the swans that he would go to scotland and living or dead avenge the murder of comyn and the broken faith of the traitorous scots then with that earnestness of voice and majesty of mien for which he was remarkable he adjured his subjects one and all by the solemn fealty they had sworn to him that if he should die on the journey they would carry his body into scotland and never give it burial till the princes dominion was established in that country eagerly and willingly the nobles gave the required pledge and so much earnestness of purpose so much martial spirit pervaded that gorgeous assembly that once more did hope prevail in the monarchs breast once more did he believe his ambitious yearnings would all be fulfilled and scotland rebellious haughty scotland lie crushed and broken at his feet once more his dark eye flashed his proud lip curled with its wonted smiles his warrior form erect and firm as in former days now spurned the couch of disease and rode his warhorse with all the grace and ease of former years a gallant army under the command of aymer de valence earl of pembroke had already been dispatched towards scotland bearing with it the messengers of the earl of buchan armed both with their lords commands and edwards warrant for the detention of the young heir of buchan and to bring him with all honor to the headquarters of the king the name of isabella of buchan was subjoined to that of the bruce and together with all those concerned in his rising proclaimed as traitors and a price set upon their heads this done the king had been enabled to wait with greater tranquillity the assembling of his larger army and after the ceremonials of westminster orders were issued for every earl and baron to proceed with their followers to carlisle which was named the headquarters of the army there to join their sovereign with his own immediate troops the scottish nobles edwards usual policy retained in honorable posts about his person not choosing to trust their fidelity beyond the reach of his own eye obedient to these commands all england speedily appeared in motion the troops of every county moving as by one impulse to carlisle yet there were some of englands noblest barons in whose breasts a species of admiration even affection was at work towards the very man they were now marching to destroy and this was frequently the case in the ages of chivalry fickle as the character of robert bruce had appeared to be there was that in it which had ever attracted riveted the regard of many of the noble spirits in king edwards court the rash daring of his enterprise the dangers which encircled him were such as dazzled and fascinated the imagination of those knights in whom the true spirit of chivalry found rest preeminent amongst these was the noble earl of gloucester his duty to his sovereign urged him to take the field his attachment for the bruce would have held him neuter for the ties that bound brothers in arms were of no common or wavering nature brothers in blood had frequently found themselves opposed horse to horse and lance to lance on the same field and no scruples of conscience no pleadings of affection had power to avert the unnatural strife but not such was it with brothers in armsa link strong as adamant pure as their own swordsteel bound their hearts as one and rather much rather would gloucester have laid down his own life than expose himself to the fearful risk of staining his sword with the blood of his friend the deepest dejection took possession of his soul which not all the confidence of his sovereign the gentle affectionate pleadings of his wife could in any way assuage chapter viii it was the month of june and the beautiful county of perth smiled in all the richness and loveliness of early summer not yet had the signal of war floated on the pure springy breeze not yet had the stains of blood desecrated the gladsome earth although the army of de valence was now within very few miles of scone which was still the headquarters of the scottish king aware of the very great disparity of numbers between his gallant followers and those of pembroke king robert preferred entrenching himself in his present guarded situation to meeting de valence in the open field although more than once tempted to do so and finding extreme difficulty in so curbing the dauntless spirit of his followers as to incline them more towards the defensive than the attack already had the fierce thunders of the church been launched against him for the sin of murder committed in consecrated ground excommunication in all its horrors exposed him to death from any hand that on any pretence of private hate or public weal might choose to strike but already had there arisen spirits bold enough to dispute the awful mandates of the pope and the patriotic prelates who had before acknowledged and done homage to their sovereign now neither wavered in their allegiance nor in any way sought to promulgate the sentence thundered against him a calm smile had passed over the bruces noble features as the intelligence of the wrath of rome was communicated to him the judge and the avenger is in heaven holy father he said to his hands i commit my cause conscious of deserving as humbly awaiting chastisement for that sin which none can reprobate and abhor more strongly than myself if blood must flow for blood his will be done i ask but to free my country to leave her in powerful yet righteous hands and willingly i will depart confident of mercy for my soul fearful however that this sentence might dispirit his subjects king robert watched his opportunity of assembling and addressing them in a brief yet eloquent speech he narrated the base coldblooded system of treachery of comyn how when travelling to scotland firmly trusting in and depending on the good faith the traitor had so solemnly pledged a brawl had arisen between his bruces followers and some men in the garb of borderers who were discovered to be emissaries of the red comyn and how papers had been found on them in which all that could expose the bruce to the deadly wrath of edward was revealed and his very death advised as the only effectual means of quelling his efforts for the freedom of scotland and crushing the last hopes of her still remaining patriots he told them how on the natural indignation excited by this black treachery subsiding he had met sir john comyn at dumfrieshow knowing the fierce irascibility of his natural temper he had willingly agreed that the interview comyn demanded should take place in the church of the minorite friars trusting that the sanctity of the place would be sufficient to restrain him but who may answer for himself my friends he continued mournfully it needs not to dilate on that dark and stormy interview suffice it that the traitor sought still to deceive still to win me by his specious sophistry to reveal my plans again to be betrayed and that when i taunted him with his base cowardly treachery his black dishonor words of wrath and hate and blind deluded passion arose between us and the spirit of evil at work within me urged my rash sword to strike subjects and friends i plead no temptation as excuse i make no defence i deplore i contemn the deed if ye deem me worthy of death if ye believe the sentence of our holy father in god his holiness the pope be just that it is wholly free from the machinations of england who deeming force of arms not sufficient would hurl the wrath of heavens viceregent on my devoted head go leave me to the fate it brings your oath of allegiance is dissolved i have yet faithful followers to make one bold stand against the tyrant and die for scotland but if ye absolve me if ye will yet give me your hearts and swords oh fear me not my countrymen we may yet be free cries tears and blessings followed this wiselyspoken appeal one universal shout reiterated their vows of allegiance those who had felt terrified at the mandate of their spiritual father now traced it not to his impartial judgment but to the schemes of edward and instantly felt its weight and magnitude had faded into air the unwavering loyalty of the primate of scotland the bishop of glasgow and the abbot of scone strengthened them alike in their belief and allegiance and a band of young citizens were instantly provided with arms at the expense of the town and the king entreated by a deputation of the principal magistrates to accept their services as a guard extraordinary lest his life should be yet more endangered from private individuals by the sentence under which he labored and gratified by their devotedness though his bold spirit spurned all fear of secret assassination their request was graciously accepted the ceremony of knighthood which the king had promised to confer on several of his young followers had been deferred until the present time to admit of their preparing for their inauguration with all the solemn services of religion which the rites enjoined the th day of june was the time appointed and nigel bruce and alan of buchan were to pass the night previous in solemn prayer and vigil in the abbey church of scone that the rules of chivalry should not be transgressed by his desire to confer some honor on the son of the countess of buchan which would demonstrate the high esteem in which she was held by her sovereign alan had served the king first as page and then as esquire in the interval that had elapsed since his coronation and now he beheld with ardor the near completion of the honor for which he pined his spirit had been wrung wellnigh to agony when amidst the list of the proscribed as traitors he beheld his mothers name not so much at the dangers that would encircle herfor from those he might defend herbut that his father was still a follower of the unmanly tyrant who would even war against a womanhis father should still calmly assist and serve the man who set a price upon his mothers head alas poor boy he little knew that fathers heart it was evening a still oppressive evening for though the sun yet shone brightly as he sunk in the west a succession of black thunderclouds gradually rising higher and higher athwart the intense blue of the firmament seemed to threaten that the wings of the tempest were already brooding on the dark bosom of night the very flowers appeared to droop beneath the weight of the atmosphere the trees moved not the birds were silent save when now and then a solitary note was heard and then hushed as if the little warbler shrunk back in his leafy nest frightened at his own voice perchance it was the stillness of nature which had likewise affected the inmates of a retired chamber in the palace for though they sate side by side and their looks betrayed that the full communion of soul was not denied few words were spoken the maiden of buchan bent over the frame which contained the blue satin scarf she was embroidering with the device of bruce in gold and gems and it was nigel bruce who sate beside her his deep expressive eyes fixed upon her in such fervid such eloquent love that seldom was it she ventured to raise her glance to his a slight shadow was on those sweet and gentle features perceptible perchance to the eye of love alone and it was this that after enjoying that silent communion of the spirit so dear to those who love which bade nigel fling his arm around that slender form and ask what is it sweet one why art thou sad do not ask me nigel for indeed i know not she answered simply looking up a moment in his face in that sweet touching confidence which made him draw her closer to his protecting heart save that perchance the oppression of nature has extended to me and filled my soul with unfounded fancies of evil i ought to be very happy nigel loved thus by thee she hid her eyes upon his bosom received as thy promised bride not alone by thy kind sisters thy noble brothers butsimplehearted maiden as i amdeemed worthy of thee by good king roberts self nigel dearest nigel why in an hour of joy like this should dreams of evil come to whisper my beloved that not on earth may we look for the perfection of joy the fulness of bliss that while the mortal shell is round us joy is chained to pain and granted us but to lift up the spirit to that heaven where pain is banished bliss made perfect dearest tis but for this answered the young enthusiast and the rich yet somewhat mournful tones of his voice thrilled to his listeners heart thou speakest as if thou too hadst experienced forebodings like to these my nigel said agnes thoughtfully i deemed them but the foolishness of my weaker mind deem them not foolishness beloved there are minds indeed that know them not but they are of that rude coarse material which owns no thought hath no hopes but those of earth and earthly things insensible to that profundity of joy which makes us feel its chain tis not to the lightly feeling such forebodings come but thouhast thou felt them nigel dearest hast thou listened to believed their voice i have felt i feel when i gaze on thee sweet one a joy so deep so full that i scarce dare trace it to an earthly cause he said slightly evading a direct answer i cannot look forward and as it were extend that deep joy to the future but the fetter binding it to pain reminds me i am mortal that not an earth may i demand find seek and hope to find its fulfilment she looked up in his face with an expression both of bewilderment and fear and her hand unconsciously closed on his arm as thus to detain him to her side yes my beloved he added with more animation it is not because i put not my trust in earth for unfading joy that we shall find not its sweet flowers below that our paths on earth may be darkened because the fulness of bliss is alone to be found in heaven mine own sweet agnes while darkness and strife and blood and death are thus at work around us is it marvel we should sometimes dream of sorrow yet oh yet have we not both the same hope the same god the same home in heaven and if our doom be to part on earth shall we not oh shall we not meet in bliss i say not such things will be my best beloved but better look thus upon the dim shadow sometimes resting on the rosy wings of joy than ever dismiss it as the vain folly of a weakened mind he pressed his lips which quivered on the fair beautiful brow then resting in irresistible sorrow on his bosom but he did not attempt by words to check that maidens sudden burst of tears after a while when he found his own emotion sufficiently restrained soothingly and fondly he cheered her to composure and drew from her the thoughts which had disturbed her when he first spoke twas of my mother nigel of my beloved my noble mother that i thought proscribed hunted set a price upon as a traitor can her children think on such indignity without emotionand when i remember the great power of king edward who has done thiswithout fear for her fate sweetest fear not for her her noble deed her dauntless heroism has circled her with such a guard of gallant knights and warriors that in the hands of edward trust me dearest she shall never fall and even if such should be still i say fear not unpitying and cruel as edward is where his ambition is concerned he is too true a knight too noble in spirit to take a womans blood he is now fearfully enraged and therefore has he done this and as to indignity tis shame to the proscriber not to the proscribed my love there is one i fear yet more than edward continued the maiden fearfully one that i should love more oh nigel my very spirit shrinks from the image of my father i have sought to love him to dismiss the dark haunting visions which his name has ever brought before me i saw him once but once and his stern terrible features and harsh voice so terrified my childish fancies that i hid myself till he had departed and i have never seen him since and yet oh yet i fear him what is it that thou fearest love i know not she answered but if evil approach my mother it will come from him and so silently so unsuspectedly that none may avoid it nigel he cannot love my mother he is a foe to bruce a friend of the slaughtered comyn and will he not demand a stern account of the deed that she hath done will he not seek vengeance and oh will he not may he not in wrath part thee and me and thus thy bodings be fulfilled agnes never the mandate of man shall never part us the power of man unless my limbs be chained shall never sever thee and me he that hath never acted a fathers part can have no power on his child thou art mine my belovedmine with thy mothers blessing and mine thou shalt beno earthly power shall part us death death alone can break the links that bind us and must be of god though man may seem the cause be comforted sweet love hark they are chiming vespers i must be gone for the solemn vigil of tonight and tomorrow thou shalt arm thine own true knight mine agnes and deck me with that blue scarf more precious even than the jewelled sword my sovereign brother gives farewell for a brief brief while i go to watch and pray oh let thy orisons attend me and surely then my vigil shall be blest pray thou for me my nigel whispered the trembling girl as he clasped her in his arms that true as i may be strength befitting thy promised bride may be mine own nigel my beloved indeed i need such prayer he whispered hope and comfort and departed by the stone stairs which led from the gothic casement where they had been sitting into the garden he lingered to gather some delicate bluebells which had just blown and turned back to place them in the lap of agnes she eagerly raised them and pressed them to her lips but either their fragile blossoms could not bear even her soft touch or the heavy air had inwardly withered their bloom for the blossoms fell from their stalks and scattered their beautiful petals at her feet chapter ix the hour of vespers had come and passed the organ and choir had hushed their solemn sounds the abbot and his attendant monks the king who with his train had that evening joined the solemn service all had departed and but two inmates were left within the abbey church of scone darkness and silence had assumed their undisturbed dominion for the waxen tapers left burning on the altar lighted but a few yards round leaving the nave and cloisters in impenetrable gloom some twenty or thirty yards east of the altar elevated some paces from the ground in its light and graceful shrine stood an elegantly sculptured figure of the virgin and child a silver lamp whose pure flame was fed with aromatic incense burned within the shrine and shed its soft light on a suit of glittering armor which was hanging on the shaft of a pillar close beside it directly behind the altar was a large oriel window of stained glass representing subjects from scripture the window with its various mullions and lights formed one high pointed arch marked by solid stone pillars on each side the capitals of which traced the commencement of the arch another window similar in character though somewhat smaller in dimensions lighted the west end of the church and near it stood another shrine containing a figure of st stephen lighted as was that of the virgin and child and like that gleaming on a suit of armor and on the figure of the youthful candidate for knighthood whose task was to pass that night in prayer and vigil beside his armor unarmed saved by that panoply of proof which is the christians portionfaith lowliness and prayer no word passed between these pledged brothers in arms their watch was in opposite ends of the church and save the dim solemn light of the altar darkness and immeasurable space appeared to stretch between them faintly and fitfully the moon had shone through one of the long narrow windows of the aisles shedding its cold spectral light for a brief space then passing into darkness heavy masses of clouds sailed slowly in the heavens dimly discernible through the unpainted panes the oppression of the atmosphere increasing as the night approached her zenith and ever and anon a low long peal of distant thunder each succeeding one becoming longer and louder than the last and heralded by the blue flash of vivid lightning announced the fury of the coming tempest the imaginations even as the feelings of the young men were already strongly excited although their thoughts perchance were less akin than might have been expected the form of his mother passed not from the mental vision of the young heir of buchan the tone of her voice the unwonted tear which had fallen on his cheek when he had knelt before her that evening ere he had departed to his post craving her blessing on his vigil her prayers for himthat tone that tear lingered on his memory hallowing every dream of glory every warrior hope that entered in his soul internally he vowed he would raise the banner of his race and prove the loyalty the patriotism the glowing love of liberty which her counsels her example had planted in his breast and if the recollection of his mothers precarious situation as a proscribed traitor to edward and of his fathers desertion of his country and her patriot king in his adherence to a tyrantif these reflections came to damp the bright glowing views of others they did but call the indignant blood to his cheek and add greater firmness to his impatient step for yet more powerfully did they awake his indignation against edward till now he had looked upon him exclusively in the light of scotlands foeone against whom he with all true scottish men must raise their swords or live forever neath the brand of slaves and cowards but now a personal cause of anger added fuel to the fire already burning in his breast his mother was proscribeda price set upon her head and as if to fill the measure of his cup of bitterness to overflowing his own father he who should have been her protector aided and abetted the cruel pitiless edward traitress isabella of buchan a traitress the noblest purest bravest amid scotlands children she who to him had ever seemed all that was pure and good and noblest in woman and most noble and patriothearted now in the fulfilment of an office inherent in the house of fife agitated beyond expression quicker and quicker he strode up and down the precincts marked for his watch the increasing tempest without seeming to assimilate strangely with the storm within silence would have irritated would have chafed those restless smartings into very agony but the wild war of the elements while they roused his young spirit into yet stronger energy removed its pain it matters not his train of thought continued while this brain can think this heart can feel this arm retain its strength isabella of buchan needs no other guardian but her son it is as if years had left their impress on my heart as if i had grown in very truth to man thinking with mans wisdom fighting with mans strength he that hath never given a fathers love hath never done a fathers duty hath no claim upon his child but she whose untiring devotion whose faithful love hath watched over me guarded blessed from the first hour of my life instilled within me the principles of life on earth and immortality in heavenmother mother will not thy gentle virtues cling around thy boy and save him even from a fathers curse can i do else than devote the life thou gavest to thee and render back with my stronger arm but not less firm soul the care protection love thou hast bestowed on me mother virgin saint he continued aloud flinging himself before the shrine to which we have alluded hear oh hear my prayer intercede for me above that strength prudence wisdom may be granted me in the accomplishment of my knightly vows that my mother my own mother may be the first and dearest object of my heart life fame and honor i dedicate to her spare me bless me but for her if danger imprisonment be unavailingly her doom let not my spirit waver nor my strength flag nor courage nor foresight fail till she is rescued to liberty and life wrapt in the deep earnest might of prayer the boy remained kneeling with clasped hands and eyes fixed on the virgins sculptured face his spirit inwardly communing long long after his impassioned vows had sunk in silence the thunder yet rolled fearfully and the blue lightning flashed and played around him with scarce a minutes intermission but no emotion save that of a son and warrior took possession of his soul he knew a terrific storm was raging round him but it drew him not from earthly thoughts and earthly feelings even while it raised his soul in prayer very different was the effect of this lonely vigil and awful night on the imaginative spirit of his companion it was not alone the spirit of chivalry which now burned in the noble heart of nigel bruce he was a poet and the glowing hues of poesie invested every emotion of his mind he loved deeply devotedly and love pure faithful hopeful love appeared to have increased every feeling whether of grief of joy in intensity and depth he felt too deeply to be free from that peculiar whispering within known by the world as presentiment and as such so often scorned and contemned as the mere offspring of weak superstitious minds when it is in reality one of those distinguishing marks of the higher more ethereal temperament of genius perchance it is the lively imagination of such minds which in the very midst of joy can so vividly portray and realize pain or it may be indeed the mysterious voice which links gifted man with a higher class of beings to whom futurity is revealed be this as it may even while the youthful patriot beheld with a visioned eye the liberty of his country and rejoiced in thus beholding there ever came a dim and silent shadowing a whispering voice that he should indeed behold it but not from earth when the devoted brother and loyal subject pictured his sovereign in very truth a free and honored king his throne surrounded by nobles and knights of his own free land and many others the enthusiast saw not himself amongst them and yet he rejoiced in the faith such things would be when the young and ardent lover sate by the side of his betrothed gazing on her sweet face and drinking in deeply the gushing tide of joy when his spirit pictured yet dearer lovelier more assured bliss when agnes would be in very truth his own still did that strange thrilling whisper come and promise he should indeed experience such bliss but not on earth and yet he loved aye and rejoiced and there came not one shadow on his bright beautiful face not one sad echo in the rich deep tones of his melodious voice to betray such dim forebodings had found resting in his soul already excited by his conversation with agnes the service in which he found himself engaged was not such as to tranquillize his spirit or still his full hearts quivering throb his imaginative soul had already flung its halo over the solemn rites which attended his inauguration as a knight even to less enthusiastic spirits there was a glow a glory in this ceremony which seldom failed to awake the soul and inspire it with high and noble sentiments it was not therefore strange that these emotions should in the heart of nigel bruce obtain that ascendency which to sensitive minds must become pain had it been a night of calm and holy stillness he would in all probability have felt its soothing effect but as it was every pulse throbbed and every nerve was strained neath his strong sense of the sublime he could not be said to think although he had struggled long and fiercely to compose his mind for those devotional exercises he deemed most fitted for the hour feeling alone possessed him overwhelming indefinable he deemed it admiration awe adoration of him at whose nod the mighty thunders rolled and the destructive lightnings flashed but he could not define it such he did not dream of earth not even the form of agnes flashed as was its wont before him no it was of scenes and sounds undreamed of in earths philosophy he thought and as he gazed on the impenetrable darkness and then beheld it dispersed by the repeated lightning his excited fancy almost believed that he should see it peopled by the spirits of the mighty dead which slept within those walls and no particle of terror attended this belief in the weak superstition of his age nigel bruce had never shared but firmly and steadfastly he believed even in his calm and unexcited moments that there was a link between the living and the dead that the freed spirits of the one were permitted to hold commune with the other not in visible shape but in those thrilling whispers which the spirit knows while yet it would deny them even to itself it was the very age of superstition religion itself was clothed in a veil of solemn mystery which to minds constituted as nigels gave it a deeper more impressive tone its ceremonies its shrines its fictions all gave fresh zest to the imagination and filled the heart of its votary with a species of devotion and excitement which would now be considered as mere visionary madness little in accordance with the true spirit of piety or acceptable to the most high but which was then regarded as meritorious and even as we look back upon the saints and heroes of the past even now should not be condemned for according to the light bestowed so is devotion demanded and accepted by the god of all nigel bruce had paused in his hasty walk and leaning against the pillar round which his armor hung fixed his eyes for a space on the large oriel window we have named whose outline was but faintly discernible save on the left side which was dimly illumined by the silver lamp burning in the shrine of st stephen close beside which the youthful warrior stood the storm had suddenly sunk into an awful and almost portentous silence and in that brief interval of stillness and gloom nigel felt his blood flow more calmly in his veins his pulses stilled their starting throbs and the young soldier crossed his arms on his breast and bent his uncovered head upon them in silent yet earnest prayer the deep solemn chime of the abbeybell echoing like a spiritvoice through the arched and silent church roused him and he looked up at the same moment a strong and awfully brilliant flash of lightning darted through the window on which his eyes were fixed followed by a mighty peal of thunder longer and louder than any that had come before for above a minute that blue flash lingered playing it seemed on steel and a cold shuddering thrill crept through the frame of nigel bruce sending the lifeblood from his cheek back to his very heart for either fancy had again assumed her sway and more vividly than before or his wild thoughts had found a shape and semblance within the arch formed by the high window stood or seemed to stand a tall and knightly form clad from the gorget to the heel in polished steel his head was bare and long dark hair shaded a face pale and shadowy indeed but strikingly and eminently noble there was a scarf across his breast and on it nigel recognized the cognizance of his own line the crest and motto of the bruce it could not have been more than a minute that the blue lightning lingered there yet to his excited spirit it was long enough to impress indelibly and startlingly every trace of that strange vision upon his heart the face was turned to his with a solemn yet sorrowful earnestness of expression and the mailed hand raised on high seemed pointing unto heaven the flash passed and all was darkness the more dense and impenetrable from the vivid light which had preceded it but nigel stirred not moved not his every sense absorbed not in the weakness of mortal terror but in one overwhelming sensation of awe which while it oppressed the spirit wellnigh to pain caused it to long with an almost sickening intensity for a longer and clearer view of that which had come and passed with the lightning flash again the vivid blaze dispersed the gloom but no shadow met his fixed impassioned gaze vision or reality the form was gone there was no trace no sign of that which had been for several successive flashes nigel remained gazing on the spot where the mailed form had stood as if he felt it would it must again appear but as time sped and he saw but space the soul relaxed from its highwrought mood the blood which had seemed stagnant in his veins rushed back tumultuously through its varied channels and nigel bruce prostrated himself before the altar to wrestle with his perturbed spirit till it found calm in prayer a right noble and glorious scene did the great hall of the palace present the morning which followed this eventful night the king surrounded by his highest prelates and nobles mingling indiscriminately with the highborn dames and maidens of his court all splendidly attired occupied the upper part of the hall the rest of which was crowded both by his military followers and many of the good citizens of scone who flocked in great numbers to behold the august ceremony of the day two immense oaken doors at the south side of the hall were flung open and through them was discerned the large space forming the palace yard prepared as a tiltingground where the newmade knights were to prove their skill the storm had given place to a soft breezy morning the cool freshness of which appearing peculiarly grateful from the oppressiveness of the night light downy clouds sailed over the blue expanse of heaven tempering without clouding the brilliant rays of the sun every face was clothed with smiles and the loud shouts which hailed the youthful candidates for knighthood as they severally entered told well the feeling with which the patriots of scotland were regarded some twenty youths received the envied honor at the hand of their sovereign this day but our limits forbid a minute scrutiny of the bearing of any however well deserving save of the two whose vigils have already detained us so long a yet longer and louder shout proclaimed the appearance of the youngest scion of the house of bruce and his companion the daring patriotism of isabella of buchan had enshrined her in every heart and so disposed all men towards her children that the name of their traitorous father was forgotten led by their godfathers nigel by his brotherinlaw sir christopher seaton and alan by the earl of lennox their swords which had been blessed by the abbot at the altar slung round their necks they advanced up the hall there was a glow on the cheek of the young alan in which pride and modesty were mingled his step at first was unsteady and his lip was seen to quiver from very bashfulness as he first glanced round the hall and felt that every eye was turned towards him but when that glance met his mothers fixed on him and breathing that might of love which filled her heart all boyish tremors fled the calm staid resolve of manhood took the place of the varying glow upon his cheek the quivering lip became compressed and firm and his step faltered not again the cheek of nigel bruce was pale but there was firmness in the glance of his bright eye and a smile unclouded in its joyance on his lip the frivolous lightness of the courtier the mad bravado of knighterrantry which was not uncommon to the times indeed were not there it was the quiet courage of the resolved warrior the calm of a spirit at peace with itself shedding its own high feeling and poetic glory over all around him on reaching the foot of king roberts throne both youths knelt and laid their sheathed swords at his feet their armorbearers then approached and the ceremony of clothing the candidates in steel commenced the golden spur was fastened on the left foot of each by his respective godfather while athol hay and other nobles advanced to do honor to the youths by aiding in the ceremony nor was it warriors alone is this permitted lady demanded the king smiling as the countess of buchan approached the martial group and aided by lennox fastened the polished cuirass on the form of her son is it permitted for a matron to arm a youthful knight is there no maiden to do such inspiring office yes when the knight be one as this my liege she answered in the same tone let a matron arm him good my liege she added sadlylet a mothers hand enwrap his boyish limbs in steel a mothers blessing mark him thine and scotlands that those who watch his bearing in the battlefield may know who sent him there may thrill his heart with memories of her who stands alone of her ancestral line that though he bears the name of comyn the blood of fife flows reddest in his veins arm him and welcome noble lady answered the king and a buzz of approbation ran through the hall and may thy noble spirit and dauntless loyalty inspire him we shall not need a trusty follower while such as he are round us yet in very deed my youthful knight must have a lady fair for whom he tilts today come hither isoline thou lookest verily inclined to envy thy sweet friend her office and nothing loth to have a loyal knight thyself come come my pretty one no blushing now lennox guide those tiny hands aright laughing and blushing isoline the daughter of lady campbell a sister of the bruce a graceful child of some thirteen summers advanced nothing loth to obey her royal uncles summons and an arch smile of real enjoyment irresistibly stole over the countenance of alan dispersing the emotion his mothers words produced nay tremble not sweet one the king continued in a lower and yet kinder tone as he turned from the one youth to the other and observed that agnes overpowered by emotion had scarcely power to perform her part despite the whispered words of encouraging affection nigel murmured in her ear imaginative to a degree which by her quiet subdued manners was never suspected the simple act of those early flowers withering in her grasp fresh as they were from the hand of her betrothed had weighed down her spirits as with an indefinable sense of pain which she could not combat the war of the elements attending as it did the vigil of her lover had not decreased these feelings and the morning found her dispirited and shrinking in sensitiveness from the very scene she had anticipated with joy it must not be with a trembling hand the betrothed of a bruce arms her chosen knight fair agnes continued the king cheeringly she must inspire him with valor and confidence smile then gentlest and loveliest we would have all smiles today and she did smile but it was a smile of tears gleaming on her beautiful face as a sunny beam through a glistening spray one by one the cuirass and shoulderpieces the greaves and gauntlets the gorget and brassards the joints of which were so beautifully burnished that they shone as mirrors and so flexible every limb had its free use enveloped those manly forms their swords once again girt to their sides and once more keeling the king descended from his throne and alternately dubbed them knight in the name of god st michael and st george be faithful brave and hardy youthful cavaliers he said true to the country which claims ye to the monarch ye have sworn to serve to the knight from whose sword ye have received the honor ye have craved remember tis not the tournay nor the tilted field in which ye will gain renown for your country let your swords be drawn against her foes reap laurels sir nigel tis thine to retain unsullied the name thou bearest to let the bruce be glorified in thee and thou sir alan tis thine to earn a namein very truth to win thy golden spurs to prove we do no unwise deed forgetting thy early years to do honor to thy mothers son lightly and eagerly the newmade knights sprung to their feet the very clang of their glittering armor ringing gratefully and rejoicingly in their ears their gallant steeds barded and richly caparisoned held by their esquires stood neighing and pawing at the foot of the steps leading from the oaken doors without touching the stirrup both sprung at the same instant in their saddles the helmet with its long graceful plume was quickly donned the lance and shield received the pennon adorning the iron head of each lowered a moment in honor to their sovereign then waved gayly in air and then each lance was laid in rest a trumpet sounded and onward darted the fiery youths thrice round the lists displaying a skill and courage in horsemanship which was hailed with repeated shouts of applause but on the tournay and the banquet which succeeded the ceremony we have described we may not linger but pass rapidly on to a later period of the same evening sir nigel and his beautiful betrothed had withdrawn a while from the glittering scene around them they had done their part in the graceful dance and now they sought the comparative solitude and stillness of the flowergemmed terrace on which the ballroom opened to speak unreservedly the thoughts which had filled each heart perchance there were some yet veiled for the vision of the preceding night the strange incongruous fancies it had engendered in the youthful warrior a solemn vow had buried deep in his own soul and not even to agnes to whom his heart was wont to be revealed might such thoughts find words and she shrunk in timidity from avowing the inquietude of her own simple heart and thus it was that each for the sake of the other spoke hopefully and cheeringly and gayly until at length they were but conscious of mutual and devoted lovethe darkening mists of the future lost in the radiance of the present sun a sudden pause in the inspiring music the quick advance of all the different groups towards one particular spot had failed perchance to interrupt the happy converse of the lovers had not sir alan hastily approached them exclaiming as he did so for the love of heaven nigel forget agnes for one moment and come along with me a messenger from pembroke has just arrived bearing a challenge or something very like it to his grace the king and it may be we shall win our spurs sooner than we looked for this morning the sight of sir henry seymour makes the war trumpet sound in mine ears come for truly there is something astir with agnes still leaning on his arm nigel obeyed the summons of his impatient friend and joined the group around the king there was a quiet dignity in the attitude and aspect of robert bruce or it might be the daring patriotism of his enterprise was appreciated by the gallant english knight certain it was that though sir henrys bearing had been somewhat haughty his brow knit and his head still covered as he passed up the hall by an irresistible impulse he doffed his helmet as he met the eagle glance of the bruce and bowed his head respectfully before him an example instantly followed by his attendants sir henry seymour is welcome to our court said the king courteously welcome whatever message he may bear how fares it with the chivalric knight and worthy gentleman aymer de valence earl of pembroke ye bring us a message from him tis said needs it a private hearing sir knight if so we are at your service yet little is it aymer de valence can say to scotlands king which scotland may not hear pembroke is well an please you and sendeth greeting replied the knight his message sent as it is to the bruce is well fitted for the ears of his followers therefore may it be spoken here he sendeth all loving and knightly greeting unto him known until now as robert earl of carrick and bids him an he would proclaim and prove the rights he hath assumed come forth from the narrow precincts of a palace and town which ill befit a warrior of such high renown and give him battle in the park of methven near at hand he challenges him to meet him there with nobles knights and yeomen who proclaiming robert bruce their sovereign cast down the gauntlet of defiance and rebellion against their rightful king and mine his grace of england he challenges thee sir knight or earl or king whichever name thou bearest and dares thee to the field and what if we accept not his daring challenge demanded king robert sternly without permitting the expression of his countenance to satisfy in any way the many anxious glances fixed upon it he will proclaim thee coward knight and traitor slave boldly answered sir henry in camp or in hall in ladys bower or tented field he will proclaim thee recreant one that took upon himself the state and pomp of royalty without the spirit to defend and prove it had he done so by our predecessor baliol he had done well returned the king calmly nobles and knights and gentlemen he added the lion spirit of his race kindling in his eye and cheek what say ye in accepting the bold challenge of this courtly earl do we not read your hearts as well as our own ye have chafed and fretted that we have retained ye so long inactive in very truth your monarchs spirit chafed and fretted too we will do battle with this knightly foe and give him in all chivalric and honorable courtesy the meeting he desires one startling and energetic shout burst simultaneously from the warriors around forming a wild and thrilling response to their sovereigns words in vain they sought to restrain that outbreak of rejoicing in respect to the royal presence they had pined they had yearned for action and sir henry was too good a knight himself not to understand to the full the patriotic fervor and chivalrous spirit from which that shout had sprung proudly and joyfully the bruce looked on his devoted adherents and then addressed the english knight thou hast our answer good sir henry he said more thou couldst scarcely need commend us to your master and take heed thou sayest all that thou hast heard and seen in answer to his challenge in the park of methven three days hence he may expect the king of scotland and his patriot troops with him to do battle unto death edward good brother thou seaton and the lord of douglas conduct this worthy knight in all honor from the hall thou hast our answer the knight bowed low but ere he retreated he spoke again i am charged with yet another matter an it so please you he said evidently studying to avoid all royal titles although the bearing of the king rendered his task rather more difficult than he could have imagined a matter of small import truly yet must it be spoken tis rumored that you have amid your household a child a boy whose father was a favored servant of my gracious liege and yours king edward the earl of pembroke in the name of his sovereign and of the childs father bids me demand him of thee as having from his tender years and inexperience no will nor voice in this matter he having been brought here by his mother who saving your presence had done better to have remembered her duty to her husband than encourage rebellion against her king keep to the import of thy message nor give thy tongue such license sir interrupted the bruce sternly and many an eye flashed and many a hand sought his sword sir alan of buchan stand forth and give thine own answer to this imperative demand tis to thee methinks its import would refer thou hast wisdom and experience if not years enough to answer for thyself tell aymer de valence would he seek me he will find me by the side of my sovereign king robert in methven park three days hence boldly and quickly answered the young soldier stepping forward from his post in the circle and fronting the knight tell him i am here of my own free will to acknowledge robert the bruce as mine and scotlands king to defy the tyrant edward even to the death tell him tis no child he seeks but a knight and soldier who will meet him on the field it would seem we are under some mistake young sir replied sir henry gazing with unfeigned admiration on the wellknit frame and glowing features of the youthful knight i speak of and demand the surrender of the son and heir of john comyn earl of buchan who was represented to me as a child of some ten or thirteen summers tis with him not with thee my business treats and tis the soni know not how long heirof john comyn earl of buchan who speaks with thee sir knight it may well be my very age my very existence hath been forgotten by my father he added with a fierceness and bitterness little in accordance with his years aye and would have been remembered no more had not the late events recalled them yet tis even soand that thy memory prove not treacherous there lies my gage foully and falsely hast thou spoken of isabella of buchan and her honor is dear to her son as is his own in methven park we two shall meet sir knight and the child the puny stripling who hath of his own nor voice nor will will not fail thee be thou sure proudly almost sternly the boy fixed his flashing orbs on the english knight and without removing his glance strode to the side of his mother and drew her arm within his own there was something in the accent in the saddened yet resolute expression of his countenance which forbade all rejoinder not from sir henry alone but even from his own friends seymour raised the gage and with a meaning smile secured it in his helmet then respectfully saluting the group around him withdrew attended as desired by the bruce heed it not my boy my own noble boy said the countess of buchan in those low earnest musical tones peculiarly her own for she saw that there was a quivering in the lip a sudden paleness in the cheek of her son as he gazed up in her lace when he thought they stood alone which denoted internal emotion yet stronger than that which had inspired his previous words their scorn their contumely i heed as little as the mountain rock the hailstones which fall upon its sides in vain seeking to penetrate or wound nay i could smile at them in very truth were it not that compelled as i am to act alone to throw aside as worthless and rejected those natural ties i had so joyed to wear my heart seems closed to smiles but for words as those or yet harsher scorn grieve not my noble boy they have no power to fret or hurt me yet to hear them speak in such tone of theethee whose high soul and noble courage would shame a score of some who write themselves menthee who with all a womans loving heart and guileless unselfish honorable mind hath all a warriors stern resolve a patriots noble purpose mother mother how may thy son brook scorn and falsity and foul calumny cast upon thee and there was a choking suffocation in his throat filling his eyes perforce with tears and had it not been that manhood struggled for dominion he would have flung himself upon his mothers breast and wept as a soldier and a man my son she drew him closer to her as she spoke as one who knowing and feeling the worth of the contemned one is conscious that the foul tongues of evil men can do no ill but fling back the shame upon themselves arouse thee my beloved son alas when i look on thee on thy bright face on those graceful limbs so supple now in health and life and feel to what my deed may have devoted thee my child my child i need not slanderous tongues to grieve me and doth the countess of buchan repent that deed asked the rich sonorous voice of the bruce who unobserved had heard their converse would she recall that which she hath done sire not so she answered precious as is my child to this lone heartinexpressibly dear and preciousyet if the liberty of his country demand me to resign him the call shall be obeyed speak not thus noble lady returned the king cheerily he is but lent scotland asks no more and when heaven smiles on this poor country smiles in liberty and peace trust me such devotedness will not have been in vain our youthful knight will lay many a wreath of laurel at his mothers feet nor will there then be need to guard her name from scorn see what new zest and spirit have irradiated the brows of our warlike guests we had scarce deemed more needed than was there before yet the visit of sir henry seymour bearing as it did a challenge to strife and blood hath given fresh lightness to every step new joyousness to every tone is not this as it should be aye as it must be sire while loyal hearts and patriot spirits form thy court nobly and gallantly was the answer given to pembrokes challenge yet pardon me sire was it wisewas it well its wisdom lady rests with its success in the hands of a higher power answered the king gravely yet kindly other than we did we could not do rashly and presumptuously we would not have left our quarters not for the mere chase of mad wish for glory would we have risked the precious lives of our few devoted friends but challenged as we were the soul of bruce could not have spoken other than he did nor do we repent nay we rejoice that the stern duty of inaction is over thine eye tells me thou canst understand this lady therefore we say no more save to beseech thee to inspire our consort with the necessity of this deed she trembles for the issue of our daring see how grave and sad she looks so lately as she was all smiles the countess did not reply but hastened to the side of the amiable but yet too womanly queen margaret and gently but invisibly sought to soothe her fears and she partially succeeded for the queen ever seemed to feel herself a bolder and firmer character when in the presence and under the influence of isabella of buchan chapter x it was a gallant though alas but too small a force which richly and bravely accoutred with banners proudly flying music sounding superb chargers caparisoned for war lances in rest and spear and bill sword and battleaxe marched through the olden gates of scone in a southwestward direction early on the morning of the th of june many were the admiring eyes and yearning hearts which followed them and if doubt and dread did mingle in the fervid aspirations raised for their welfare and success they were not permitted to gain ascendency so long as the cheering tones and happy smiles of every one of that patriot band lingered on the ear and sight as yet there were but few of the nobles and knights with their men the troops had been commanded to march leisurely forward under charge of the esquires and gentlemen who were mostly lieutenants or cornets to their leaders respective bands of followers and if not overtaken before to halt in a large meadow to the north of perth which lay in their way the knots of citizens however who had accompanied the army to the farthest environs of the town had not dispersed to their several homes ere the quick noisy clattering of a gallant troop of horse echoed along the street and the king surrounded by his highest nobles and bravest knights galloped by courteously returning the shouts and acclamations of delight which hailed him on every side his vizor was purposely left up and his noble countenance beaming with animation and hope seemed to inspire fresh hope and confidence in all that gazed a white ostrich plume secured to his helmet by a rich clasp of pearls and diamonds fell over his left shoulder till it wellnigh mingled with the flowing mane of his charger whose coalblack glossy hide was almost concealed beneath the armor which enveloped him and the saddlecloth of crimson velvet whose golden fringe nearly swept the ground king robert was clothed in the same superb suit of polished steel armor inlaid and curiously wrought with ingrained silver in which we saw him at first a crimson scarf secured his trusty sword to his side and a short mantle of azure velvet embroidered with the golden thistle of scotland and lined with the richest sable was secured at his throat by a splendid collaret of gems the costly materials of his dress and yet more the easy and graceful seat upon his charger his chivalric bearing and the frank noble expression of his countenance made him indeed look every inch a king and might well of themselves have inspired and retained the devoted loyalty of his subjects even had there been less of chivalry in his daring rising edward bruce was close beside his brother with a figure and appearance equally martial and equally prepossessing he wanted the quiet dignity the selfpossession of voice and feature which characterized the king he had not the mind of robert and consequently the uppermost passion of the spirit was ever the one marked on his brow on this morning he was all animated smiles for war was alike his vocation and his pastime thomas and alexander bruce were also there both gallant men and welltried warriors and eager as edward for close encounter with the foe the earls of lennox and athol although perhaps in their secret souls they felt that the enterprise was rash gave no evidence of reluctance in their noble bearing indeed had they been certain of marching to their death they would not have turned from the side of bruce the broad banner of scotland whose ample folds waved in the morning breeze had been intrusted to the young heir of buchan who with the other young and newmade knights eager and zealous to win their spurs had formed a body guard around the banner swearing to defend it to the last moment of their lives nigel bruce was one of these he rode close beside his brother in arms and midst that animated group those eager spirits throbbing for action no heart beat quicker than his own all was animated life anticipated victory the very heavens smiled as if they would shed no shadow on this patriot band it was scarcely two hours after noon when king robert and his troops arrived at the post assignedthe park or wood of methven and believing that it was not till the succeeding day to which the challenge of pembroke referred he commanded his men to make every preparation for a night encampment the english troops lay at about a quarter of a mile distant on the side of a hill which as well as tree and furze would permit commanded a view of the bruces movements there were tents erected horses picketed and every appearance of quiet confirming the scotch in their idea of no engagement taking place till the morrow aware of the great disparity of numbers king robert eagerly and anxiously examined his ground as to the best spot for awaiting the attack of the english he fixed on a level green about half a mile square guarded on two sides by a thick wood of trees on the third and left by a deep running rivulet and open on the fourth encumbered only by short thick bushes and little knots of thorn which the king welcomed as impeding the progress and obstructing the evolutions of pembrokes horse the bushes which were scattered about on the ground he had chosen he desired his men to clear away and ere the sun neared his setting all he wished was accomplished and his plan of battle arranged he well remembered the impenetrable phalanx of the unfortunate wallace at the battle of falkirk and determined on exposing a steady front of spears in the same manner not having above thirty horse on whom he could depend and well aware they would be but a handful against pembrokes two hundred he placed them in the rear as a reserve in the centre of which waved the banner of scotland the remainder of his troops he determined on arranging in a compact crescent the bow exposed to the english the line stretching out against the wood this was his intended line of battle but either from mistake or purposed treachery on the part of pembroke his plan was frustrated and in addition to the great disparity of numbers he had to struggle with surprise the day had been extremely sultry and trusting in full confidence to the honor of his opponent and willing to give his men all needful rest the king dismissed them from their ranks to refreshment and repose leaving but very few to guard himself retiring with his older officers to a tent prepared for his reception arm in arm and deep in converse nigel bruce and alan of buchan wandered a little apart from their companions preferring a hasty meal and the calm beauty of a lovely summer evening accompanied by a refreshing breeze to remaining beside the rude but welcome meal and sharing the festivity which enlivened it thinkest thou not nigel his grace trusts but too fully to the honor of these englishmen asked alan somewhat abruptly turning the conversation from the dearer topics of agnes and her mother which had before engrossed them on my faith if he judge of them by his own true noble spirit he judges them too well nay thou art oversuspicious friend alan answered nigel smiling what fearest thou i like not the absence of all guards not so much for the safety of our own camp but to keep sharp watch on the movements of our friends yonder nigel there is some movement they look not as they did an hour ago impossible quite impossible alan the english knights are too chivalric too honorable to advance on us tonight if they have made a movement tis but to repose nigel if pembroke feel inclined to take advantage of our unguarded situation he will swear as many have done before him that a new day began with the twelvechime bell of this morning and be upon us ere we are aware and i say again there is movement and warlike movement too in yonder army are tents deserted and horses and men collected for the simple purpose of retiring to rest come with me to yon mound and see if i be not correct in my surmise startled by alans earnest manner despite his firm reliance on pembrokes honor nigel made no further objection but hastened with him to the eminence he named it was only too true silently and guardedly the whole english army extending much further towards perth than was visible to the scotch had been formed in battle array line after line stretching forth its glittering files in too compact and animated array to admit of a doubt as to their intentions the sun had completely sunk and dim mists were spreading up higher and higher from the horizon greatly aiding the treacherous movements of the english by heavens tis but too true burst impetuously from nigels lips indignation expressed in every feature base treacherous cowards hie thee to the kingfly for thy lifegive him warning while i endeavor to form the lines in vain utterly in vain he muttered as alan with the speed of lightning darted down the slope they are formedfresh both man and horsedouble aye more than treble our numbers they will be upon us ere the order of battle can be formed and defeat now he would not give utterance to the dispiriting truth which closed that thought but springing forward dashed through fern and brake and halted not till he stood in the centre of his companions who scattered in various attitudes on the grass were giving vent in snatches of song and joyous laughter to the glee which filled their souls up upthe foe shouted nigel in tones so unlike the silvery accents which in general characterized him that his companions started to their feet and grasped their swords as roused by the sound of trumpet pembroke is false to armsto your posts fitzalandouglassound an alarm and in heavens name aid me in getting the men under arms be calm be steady display no alarm no confusion and all may yet be well he was obeyed the quick roll of the drum the sharp quick blast of the trumpet echoed and reechoed at different sides of the encampment the call to arms in various stentorian tones rung through the woodland glades quickly banishing all other sounds every man sprung at once from his posture of repose and gathered round their respective leaders startled confused yet still in order still animated still confident and yet more exasperated against their foe the appearance of their sovereign unchanged in his composed and warlike mien evincing perhaps yet more animation in his darkly flushing cheek compressed lip and sparkling eye his voice still calm though his commands were more than usually hurried his appearance on every side forming arranging encouraging almost at the same instantat one moment exciting their indignation against the treachery of the foe at others appealing to their love for their country their homes their wives to their sworn loyalty to himselfinspired courage and confidence at the same instant as he allayed confusion but despite every effort both of leader and men it needed time to form in the compact order which the king had planned and ere it was accomplished nearer and nearer came the english increasing their pace to a run as they approached and finally charging in full and overwhelming career against the unprepared but gallant scots still there was no wavering amid the scottish troops still they stood their ground and forming almost as they fought in closer and firmer order exposing the might and unflinching steadiness of desperate men determined on liberty or death to the greater number and better discipline of their foe it mattered not that the fading light of day had given place to the darker shades of night but dimly illumined by the rising moonthey struggled on knowing as if by instinct friend from foe and fearful was it to watch the mighty struggles from figures gleaming as gigantic shadows in the darkness now and then came a deep smothered cry or bursting groan wrung from the throes of death or the wild piercing scream from a slaughtered horse but the tongues of life were silent the clang of armor the clash of steel the heavy fall of man and horse indeed came fitfully and fearfully on the night breeze and even as the blue spectral flash of summer lightning did the bright swords rise and fall in the thick gloom back back dishonored knight back recreant traitor shouted james of douglas and his voice was heard above the roar of battle and those near him saw him at the same instant spring from his charger thrust back pembroke and other knights who were thronging round him and with unrivalled skill and swiftness aid a tall and wellknown form to rise and spring on the horse he held for him thinkest thou the sacred person of the king of scotland is for such as thee back i say and he did force him armed and on horseback as he was many paces back and robert bruce again galloped over the field bareheaded indeed for his helmet had fallen off in the strife urging inciting leading on yet again to the charge and it was in truth as if a superhuman strength and presence had been granted the patriot king that night for there were veteran warriors there alike english and scotch who paused even in the work of strife to gaze and tremble again was he unhorsed crushed by numbersone moment more and he had fallen into the hands of his foes and scotland had lain a slave forever at the feet of england but again was relief at hand and the young earl of mar dashing his horse between the prostrate monarch and his thronging enemies laid the foremost who was his own countryman dead on the field and remained fighting alone his single arm dealing deadly blows on every side at the same moment until robert had regained his feet and though wounded and wellnigh exhausted turned in fury to the rescue of his preserver it was too late in an agony of spirit no pen can describe he beheld his faithful and gallant nephew overpowered by numbers and led off a captive and he stood by fighting indeed like a lion dealing death wherever his sword fell but utterly unable to rescue or defend him again his men thronged round him their rallying point their inspiring hope their guardian spirit again he was on horseback and still still that fearful strife continued aided by the darkness the bruce in his secret soul yet encouraged one gleam of hope yet dreamed of partial success at least of avoiding that almost worse than death a total and irremediable defeat alas had the daylight suddenly illumined that scene he would have felt have seen that hope was void gallantly meanwhile gallantly even as a warrior of a hundred fields had the young heir of buchan redeemed his pledge to his sovereign and devoted sword and exposed life in his cause the standard of scotland had never touched the ground planting it firmly in the earth he had for a while defended it nobly where he stood curbing alike the high spirit of his prancing horse and his own intense longing to dash forward in the thickest of the fight he saw his companions fall one by one till he was wellnigh left alone he heard confused cries as of triumph he beheld above twenty englishmen dashing towards him and he felt a few brief minutes and his precious charge might be waved in scorn as a trophy by the victors the tide of battle had left him for an instant comparatively alone and in that instant his plan was formed strike hard and fear not he cried to an old retainer who stirred not from his side divide this heavy staff and i will yet protect my charge and thou and i donald will to king roberts side he needs all true men about him now even as he spoke his command was understood and obeyed one sweep of the stout highlanders battleaxe severed full four feet of the heavy lance to which the standard was attached and enabled alan without any inconvenience to grasp in his left hand the remainder from which the folds still waved grasping his sword firmly in his right and giving his horse the rein shouting comyn to the rescue he darted towards the side where the strife waxed hottest it was a cry which alike startled friends and foes for that name was known to one party as so connected with devotee adherence to edward to the other so synonymous with treachery that united as it was with to the rescue some there were who paused to see whence and from whom it came the banner of scotland quickly banished doubt as to which part that youthful warrior belonged knights and yeomen alike threw themselves in his path to obtain possession of so dear a prize followed by about ten stalwart men of his clan the young knight gallantly cut his way through the greater number of his opponents but a sudden gleam on the helmet of one of them caused him to halt suddenly ha sir henry seymour we have met at length he shouted thou bearest yet my gagetis well i am here to redeem it give up that banner to a follower then returned sir henry courteously checking his horse in its full career for otherwise we meet at odds thou canst not redeem thy gage and defend thy charge at the same moment give up my charge never so help me heaven friend or foe shall claim it but with my life returned alan proudly come on sir knight i am here to defend the honor thou hast injuredthe honor of one dearer than my own have then thy will proud boy thy blood be on thine own head replied seymour but ere he spurred on to the charge he called aloud let none come between us none dare to interferetis a quarrel touching none save ourselves and alan bowed his head in courteous recognition of the strict observance of the rules of chivalry in his adversary at the very moment that he closed with him in deadly strife and such was war in the age of chivalry and so strict were its rules that even with the standard of scotland in his hand the person of the heir of buchan was sacred to all save to his particular opponent it was a brief yet determined struggle their swords crossed and recrossed with such force and rapidity that sparks of fire flashed from the blades the aim of both appeared rather to unhorse and disarm than slay seymour perhaps from admiration of the boys extraordinary bravery and daring and alan from a feeling of respect for the true chivalry of the english knight the rush of battle for a minute unavoidably separated them about four feet of the bannerstaff yet remained uninjured both in its stout wood and sharp iron head with unparalleled swiftness alan partly furled the banner round the pike and transferred it to his right hand then grasping it firmly and aiming full at sir henrys helm backed his horse several paces to allow of a wider field gave his steed the spur and dashed forward quick as the wind the manoeuvre succeeded completely unprepared for this change alike in weapon and attack still dazzled and slightly confused by the rush which had divided them sir henry scarcely saw the youthful knight till he felt his helmet transfixed by the lance and the blow guided so well and true that irresistibly it bore him from his horse and he lay stunned and helpless but not otherwise hurt at the mercy of his foe recovering his weapon alan aware that the great disparity of numbers rendered the securing english prisoners but a mere waste of time contented himself by waving the standard high in air and again shouting his warcry galloped impetuously on wounded he was but he knew it not the excitement the inspiration of the moment was all he felt to the kingto the king shouted nigel bruce urging his horse to the side of alan and ably aiding him to strike down their rapidly increasing foes hemmed in on all sides he will fall beneath their thirsting swords to the kingto the king yield he never will and better he should not on on for the love of life of liberty of scotlandon to the king his impassioned words reached even hearts fainting neath exhaustion failing in hope for they knew they strove in vain yet did that tone those words rouse even them and their flagging limbs grew strong for roberts sake and some yet reached the spot to fight and die around him othersalas the greater numberfell ere the envied goal was gained the sight of the royal standard drew as alan had hoped the attention of some from the king and gave him a few moments to rally again there was a moment of diversion in favor of the scotch the brothers of the bruce and some others of his bravest knights were yet around him seemingly uninjured and each and all appeared endowed with the strength of two the gigantic form of edward bruce the whelming sweep of his enormous battleaxe had cleared a partial space around the king but still the foes hemmed in reinforced even as they fell about this time the moon riding high in the heavens had banished the mists which had enveloped her rising and flung down a clear silvery radiance over the whole field disclosing for the first time to king robert the exact situation in which he stood any further struggle and defeat imprisonment death all stared him in the face and scotlands liberty was lost and forever the agony of this conviction was known to none save to the sovereigns own heart and to that searcher of all by whom its every throb was felt the wood behind him was still plunged in deep shadows and he knew the grampian hills with all their inaccessible paths and mountain fastnessesknown only to the true children of scotlandcould easily be reached were the pursuit of the english eluded which he believed could be easily accomplished were they once enabled to retreat into the wood the consummate skill and prudence of the bruce characterizing him as a general even as his extraordinary daring and exhaustless courage marked the warrior enabled him to effect this precarious and delicate movement in the very sight of and almost surrounded by foes covering his troops or rather the scattered remnant of troops by exposing his own person to the enemy the king was still the first object of attack the desire of securing his person or at least obtaining possession of his head becoming more and more intense but it seemed as though a protecting angel hovered round him for he had been seen in every part of the field wherever the struggle had been fiercest he had been the centre twice he had been unhorsed and bareheaded almost from the commencement of the strife yet there he was still seemingly as firm in his saddle as strong in frame as unscathed in limb as determined in purpose as when he sent back his acceptance of pembrokes challenge douglas fitzalan alexander and nigel bruce and alan of buchan still bearing the standard were close around the king and it was in this time of precaution of less inspiriting service that the young alan became conscious that he was either severely wounded or that the strength he had taxed far beyond its natural powers was beginning to fail still mechanically he grasped the precious banner and still he crossed his sword with every foe that came but the quick eye of nigel discerned there was a flagging of strength and he kept close beside him to aid and defend the desired goal was just attained the foes were decreasing in numbers for they were scattered some distance from each other determined on scouring the woods in search of fugitives the horses of the king and his immediate followers were urged to quicken their pace when an ironheaded quarrel discharged from an arbalist struck the royal charger which with a shrill cry of death dropped instantly and again was the king unhorsed the delay occasioned in extricating him from the fallen animal was dangerous in the extreme the greater part of his men were at some distance for the king had ordered them as soon as the unfrequented hollows of the wood were reached to disperse the better to elude their pursuers douglas alexander bruce and fitzalan had galloped on unconscious of the accident and nigel and alan were alone near him a minute sufficed for the latter to spring from his horse and aid the king to mount and both entreated conjured him to follow their companions and leave them to cover his retreat a while he refused declaring he would abide with them he would not so cowardly desert them leave you to death he cried my friends my children no no urge me no more if i may not save my country i may die for her thou shalt not so help me heaven answered nigel impetuously king friend brother there is yet time hence i do beseech thee hence nay an thou wilt not i will een forget thou art my king and force thee from this spot he snatched the reins of his brothers horse and urging it with his own to their fullest speed took the most unfrequented path and dashing over every obstacle through brake and briar and over hedge and ditch placed him in comparative safety and was alan deserted did his brother in arms in his anxiety to save the precious person of his royal brother forget the tie that bound them and leave him to die alone a sickening sense of inability of utter exhaustion crept over the boys sinking frame inability even to drag his limbs towards the wood and conceal himself from his foes mechanically he at first stood grasping the nowtattered colors as if his hand were nailed unto the staff his foot rooted to the ground there were many mingled cries sending their shrill echoes on the night breeze there were chargers scouring the plain bodies of men passing and repassing within twenty yards of the spot where he stood yet half hidden by the deep shadow of a large tree for some minutes he was unobserved an armed knight with about twenty followers were rushing by they stopped they recognized the banner they saw the bowed and drooping figure who supported it they dashed towards him with a strong effort alan roused himself from that lethargy of faintness nearer and nearer they came yield or you die were the words borne to his ear shrill loud fraught with death and his spirit sprang up with the sound he waved his sword above his head and threw himself into a posture of defence but ere they reached him there was a sudden and rapid tramp of horse and the voice of nigel bruce shouted mount mount god in heaven be thanked i am here in time alan sprung into the saddle he thought not to inquire how that charger had been found nor knew he till some weeks after that nigel had exposed his own person to imminent danger to secure one of the many steeds flying masterless over the plain on on they went and frequently the head of alan drooped from very faintness to his saddlebow and nigel feared to see him fall exhausted to the earth but still they pursued their headlong way death was behind them and the lives of all true and loyal scotsmen were too precious to admit a pause the sun had risen when king robert gazed round him on the remnant of his troops it was a wild brake amid surrounding rocks and mountains where they stood a torrent threw itself headlong from a craggy steep and made its way to the glen tumbling and roaring and dashing over the black stones that opposed its way the dark pine the stunted fir the weeping birch and many another mountain tree marked the natural fertility of the soil although its aspect seemed wild and rude it was to this spot the king had desired the fugitives to direct their several ways and now he gazed upon all all that were spared to him and scotland from that disastrous night in scattered groups they stood or sate their swords fallen from their hands their heads drooping on their breasts with the mien of men whose last hope had been cast on a single die and wrecked forever and when king robert thought of the faithful men who when the sun had set the previous evening had gathered round him in such devoted patriotism such faithful love and now beheld the few there were to meet his glance to give him the sympathy the hope he needed scarcely could he summon energy sufficient to speak against hope to rally the failing spirits of his remaining followers mar athol hay fraser he knew were prisoners and he knew too that in their cases that word was but synonymous with death lennox his chosen friend individually the dearest of all his followers he too was not there though none remembered his being taken randolph his nephew and about half of those gallant youths who not ten days previous had received and welcomed the honor of knighthood in all the high hopes and buoyancy of youth and healthful life more many more than half the number of the stout yeomen who had risen at his call to rescue their land from chainswhere now were these was it wonder that the king had sunk upon a stone and bent his head upon his hands but speedily he rallied he addressed each man by name he spoke comfort hope not lessening the magnitude of his defeat but still promising them libertystill promising that yet would their homes be redeemed their country free aye even were he compelled to wander months nay years in those mountain paths with naught about him but the title of a king still while he had life would he struggle on for scotland still did he feel despite of blighted hope of bitter disappointment that to him was intrusted the sacred task of her deliverance would he might he sink and relax in his efforts and resign his purpose because his first engagement was attended by defeat had he done so it was easy to have found death on the field had he listened to the voice of despair he confessed he would not have left that field alive but i lived for my country for ye her children he continued his voice becoming impassioned in its fervor lived to redeem this night to suffer on a while to be your savior still will ye then desert me will ye despond because of one defeatyield to despair when scotland yet calls aloud no no it cannot be and roused by his earnest his eloquent appeal that devoted band sprung from their drooping posture and kneeling at his feet renewed their oaths of allegiance to him the oath that bound them to seek liberty for scotland it was then as one by one advanced the king for the first time missed his brother nigel and the heir of buchan amidst the overwhelming bitterness of thought which had engrossed him he had for a brief while forgotten the precarious situation of alan and the determination of nigel to seek and save or die with him but now the recollection of both rushed upon him and the flush which his eloquence had summoned faded at once and the sudden expression of anguish passing over his features roused the attention of all who stood near him they must have fallen he murmured and for the first time in a changed and hollow voice my brother my brother dearest best can it be that in thy young beauty thou too art taken from meand alan how can i tell his motherhow face her sorrow for her son time passed and there was no sound the visible anxiety of the king hushed into yet deeper stillness the voices hushed before his meaning was speedily gathered from his broken words and many mounted the craggy heights to mark if there might not yet be some signs of the missing ones time seemed to linger on his flight the intervening rocks and bushes confined all sounds within a very narrow space but at length a faint unintelligible noise broke on the stillness it came nearer nearer still a moment more and the tread of horses hoofs echoed amongst the rocksa shout a joyful shout proclaimed them friends the king sprung to his feet another minute nigel and alan pressed around him with the banner still in his hand alan knelt and laid it at his sovereigns feet from thy hand i received it to thee i restore it he said but his voice was scarcely articulate he bowed his head to press roberts extended hand to his lips and sunk senseless at his feet chapter xi rumors of the fatal issue of the engagement at methven speedily reached scone laden of course with yet more disastrous tidings than had foundation in reality king robert it was said and all his nobles and knightsnay his whole armywere cut off to a man the king if not taken prisoner was left dead on the field and all scotland lay again crushed and enslaved at the feet of edward for fourandtwenty hours did the fair inhabitants of the palace labor under this belief wellnigh stunned beneath the accumulation of misfortune it was curious to remark the different forms in which affliction appeared in different characters the queen in loud sobs and repeated wailing at one time deplored her own misery at others accused her husband of rashness and madness why had he not taken her advice and remained quiet why could he not have been contented with the favor of edward and a proud fair heritage what good did he hope to get for himself by assuming the crown of so rude and barren a land as scotland had she not told him he was but a summer king that the winter would soon blight his prospects and nip his budding hopes and had she not proved herself wiser even than he was himself and then she would suddenly break off in these reproaches to declare that if he were a prisoner she would go to him she would remain with him to the last she would prove how much she idolized himher own her brave her noble robert and vain was every effort on the part of her sistersinlaw and the countess of buchan and other of her friends to mitigate these successive bursts of sorrow the lady seaton of a stronger mind yet struggled with despondency yet strove to hope to believe all was not as overwhelming as had been described although if rumor were indeed true she had lost a husband and a son the gallant young earl of mar whom she had trained to all noble deeds and honorable thoughts for he had been fatherless from infancy lady mary could forget her own deep anxieties her own fearful forebodings silently and unobservedly to watch to follow to tend the countess of buchan whose marble cheek and lip and somewhat sterner expression of countenance than usual alone betrayed the anxiety passing within for words it found not she could share with her the task of soothing of cheering agnes whose young spirit lay crushed beneath this heavy blow she did not complain she did not murmur but evidently struggled to emulate her mothers calmness for she would bend over her frame and endeavor to continue her embroidery but those who watched her marked her frequent shudder the convulsive sob the tiny hands pressed closely together and then upon her eyes as if to still their smarting throbs and isoline who sat in silence on a cushion at her feet could catch such low whispered words as these nigel nigel could i but know thy fate dead deadcould i not die with thee imprisoned have i not a right to follow thee to tend to soothe thee any thing oh any thing but this horrible suspense alan my brother thou too so young to die the morning of the second day brought other and less distressing rumors all had not fallen all were not taken there were tales of courage of daring gallantry of mighty struggles almost past belief but what were they even in that era of chivalry to the heart sinking under apprehensions the hopes just springing up amidst the wild chaos of thoughts to smile a moment to be crushed neath suspense uncertainty the next still the eager tones of conjecture the faintestspoken whispers of renewed hope were better than the dead stillness the heavy hush of despair and the queens apartments in which at sunset all her friends had assembled presented less decided sounds of mourning and of wail than the previous day margaret was indeed still one minute plunged in tears and sobs and the next hoping more believing more than any one around her agnes had tacitly accompanied her mother and lady mary to the royal boudoir but she had turned in very sickness of heart from all her companions and remained standing in a deep recess formed by the high and narrow casement alone save isoline who still clung to her side pale motionless as the marble statue near her whose unconscious repose she envied speak isabella why will you not speak to me said the queen fretfully my husband bade me look to thee for strength for support under care and affliction like to this yet thou keepest aloof from me thou hast words of comfort of cheering for all save me not so royal lady not so she answered as with a faint scarcely perceptible smile she advanced to the side of her royal mistress and took her hand in hers i have spoken i have urged entreated conjured thee to droop not for thy husbands sake to hope on despite the terrible rumors abroad i have besought thee to seek firmness for his sake but thou didst but tell me isabella isabella thou canst not feel as i do he is naught to thee but thy king to me what is he not king hero husbandall my only all and i have desisted lady for i deemed my words offended my counsel unadvised and looked on but as cold and foolish nay did i say all this to thee isabella forgive me for indeed indeed i knew it not replied margaret her previous fretfulness subsiding into a softened and less painful burst of weeping he is in truth my all my hearts dearest best and without him oh what am i even a cipher a reed useless to myself to my child as to all others i am not like thee isabellawould would i were i should be more worthy of my roberts love and consequently dearer to his heart i can be but a burden to him now hush hush would he not chide thee for such words my margaret returned the countess soothingly and in a much lower voice speaking as she would to a younger sister had he not deemed thee worthy would he have made thee his oh no believe it not he is too true too honorable for such thought he loved me because he saw i loved whispered the queen perceiving that her companions had left her wellnigh alone with the countess and following as was her custom every impulse of her fond but illregulated heart i had not even strength to conceal thatthat truth which any other would have died rather than reveal he saw it and his noble spirit was touched and he has been all all aye more than i could have dreamed to meso loving and so true then why fancy thyself a burden not a joy to him sweet friend demanded isabella of buchan the rich accents of her voice even softer and sweeter than usual for there was something in the clinging confidence of the queen it was impossible not to love i did not i could not for he cherished me so fondly till this sudden risingthis time when his desperate enterprise demands energy and firmness even from the humblest female how much more from the bruces wife and his manner is not changed towards me nor his love i know he loves me cherishes me as he ever did but he must pity my weakness my want of nerve when he compares me to himself he must look on me with almost contempt for now it is now that clearer than ever his character stands forth in such glorious majesty such moderation such a daring yet selfgoverned spirit that i feel how utterly unworthy i am of him how little capable to give that spirit that mind the reflection it must demand and when my weak fears prevail my weak fancies speak only of danger and defeat how can he bear with me must i not become if i am not now a burden no dearest margaret replied the countess instantly the mind that can so well appreciate the virtues of her husband will never permit herself through weakness and want of nerve to become a burden to him thou hast but to struggle with these imaginary terrors to endeavor to encourage instead of to dispirit and he will love and cherish thee even more than hadst thou never been unnerved let him but be restored to me and i will do all this i will make myself more worthy of his love but oh isabella while i speak this perhaps he is lost to me forever i may never see his face never hear that tone of love again and a fresh flood of weeping concluded her words nay but thou wilti know thou wilt answered the countess cheeringly trust me sweet friend though defeat may attend him a while though he may pass through trial and suffering ere the goal be gained robert bruce will eventually deliver his countrywill be her king her saviorwill raise her in the scale of nations to a level even with the highest noblest most deserving he is not lost to thee trial will but prove his worth unto his countrymen even more than would success and how knowest thou these things my isabella demanded margaret looking up in her face with a halfplayful halfsorrowful smile hast thou the gift of prophecy prophecy repeated the countess sadly alas tis but the character of robert which hath inspired my brighter vision had i the gift of prophecy my fond heart would not start and quiver thus when it vainly strives to know the fate of my only son i too have anxiety lady though it find not words thou hast thou hast indeed and yet i weak selfish as i am think only of myself stay by me isabella oh do not leave me i am stronger by thy side it was growing darker and darker and the hopes that ere night fell new and more trustworthy intelligence of the movements of the fugitives would be received were becoming fainter and fainter on every heart voices were hushed to silence or spoke only in whispers half an hour passed thus when the listless suffering on the lovely face of agnes was observed by isoline to change to an expression of intense attention hearest thou no step she said in a low piercing whisper and laying a cold and trembling hand on isolines arm it is it is hisit is nigels he has not fallenhe is spared and she started up a bright flush on her cheek her hands pressed convulsively on her heart nay agnes there is no sound tis but a fancy but even while she spoke a rapid step was heard along the corridor and a shadow darkened the doorwaybut was that nigel there was no plume no proud crest on his helmet its vizor was still closely barred and a surcoat of coarse black stuff was thrown over his armor without any decoration to display or betray the rank of the wearer a faint cry of alarm broke from the queen and many of her friends but with one bound agnes sprang to the intruder whose arms were open to receive her and wildly uttering nigel fainted on his bosom and didst thou know me even thus beloved he murmured rapidly unclasping his helmet and dashing it from him to imprint repeated kisses on her cheek wake agnes best beloved my own sweet love what hadst thou heard that thou art thus oh wake smile speak to me tis thine own nigel calls and vainly till that face smiled again on him in consciousness would the anxious inmates of that room have sought and received intelligence had he not been followed by lord douglas fitzalan and others their armor and rank concealed as was nigels who gave the required information as eagerly as it was desired robertmy king my husbandwhere is hewhy is he not here reiterated margaret vainly seeking to distinguish his figure amid the others obscured as they were by the rapidlyincreasing darkness why is he not with yewhy is he not here and he is here meg here to chide thy love as less penetrating less able to read disguise or concealment than our gentle agnes there nay weep not dearest my hopes are as strong my purpose as unchanged my trust in heaven as fervent as it was when i went forth to battle trial and suffering must be mine a while i have called it on my own head but still oh still thy robert shall deliver scotlandshall cast aside her chains the deep manly voice of the king acted like magic on the depressed spirits of those around him and though there was grief bitter bitter grief to tell though many a hearts last lingering hopes were crushed neath that fell certainty which they thought to have pictured during the hours of suspense and deemed themselves strengthened to endure yet still twas a grief that found vent in tearsgrief that admitted of soothing of sympathygrief time might heal not the harrowing agony of grief half toldhopes rising to be crushed still did the countess of buchan cling to the massive arm of the chair which margaret had left utterly powerless wholly incapacitated from asking the question on which her very life seemed to depend not even the insensibility of her agnes had had the power to rouse her from the stupor of anxiety which had spread over her sharpening every faculty and feeling indeed but rooting her to the spot her boy her alan he was not amongst those warriors she heard not the beloved accents of his voice she saw not his boyish formdarkness could not deceive her disguise would not prevent him were he amongst his companions from seeking her embrace one word would end that anguish would speak the worst end ithad he fallen the king looked round the group anxiously and inquiringly the countess of buchan he said where is our noble friend she surely hath a voice to welcome her king even though he return to her defeated sire i am here she said but with difficulty and robert as if he understood it could read all she was enduring hastened towards her and took both her cold hands in his i give thee joy he said in accents that reassured her on the instant nobly gallantly hath thy patriot boy proved himself thy son well and faithfully hath he won his spurs and raised the honor of his mothers olden line he bade me greet thee with all loving duty and say he did but regret his wounds that they prevented his attending me and throwing himself at his mothers feet he is wounded then my liege robert felt her hands tremble in his hold it were cruel to deceive thee ladydesperately but not dangerously wounded on the honor of a true knight there is naught to alarm though something perchance to regret for he pines and grieves that it may be yet a while ere he recover sufficient strength to don his armor it is not loss of blood but far more exhaustion from the superhuman exertions that he made edward and alexander are with him the one a faithful guard in himself a host the other no unskilful leech trust me noble lady there is naught to fear he spoke evidently to give her time to recover the sudden revulsion of feeling which his penetrating eye discovered had nearly overpowered her and he succeeded ere he ceased that quivering of frame and lip had passed and isabella of buchan again stood calm and firm enabled to inquire all particulars of her child and then join in the council held as to the best plan to be adopted with regard to the safety of the queen and her companions in scone it was evident they could not remain for already the towns and villages around which had all declared for the bruce were hurrying in the greatest terror to humble themselves before pembroke and entreat his interference in their favor with his sovereign there was little hope even if scone remained faithful to his interests that she would be enabled to defend herself from the attacks of the english and it would be equally certain that if the wife of bruce and the wives and daughters of so many of his loyal followers remained within her walls to obtain possession of their persons would become pembrokes first object it remained to decide whether they would accompany their sovereign to his mountain fastnesses and expose themselves to all the privations and hardships which would inevitably attend a wandering life or that they should depart under a safe escort to norway whose monarch was friendly to the interests of scotland this latter scheme the king very strongly advised representing in vivid colors the misery they might have to endure if they adhered to him the continual danger of their falling into the hands of edward and even could they elude this how was it possible their delicate frames accustomed as they were to luxury and repose could sustain the rude fare the roofless homes the continued wandering amid the crags and floods and deserts of the mountains he spoke eloquently and feelingly and there was a brief silence when he concluded margaret had thrown her arms round her husband and buried her face on his bosom her child clung to her fathers knee and laid her soft cheek caressingly by his isabella of buchan standing a little aloof remained silent indeed but no one who gazed on her could doubt her determination or believe she wavered agnes was standing in the same recess she had formerly occupied but how different was the expression of her features the arm of nigel was twined round her his head bent down to hers in deep and earnest commune he was pleading against his own will and feelings it seemed and though he strove to answer every argument to persuade her it was far better she should seek safety in a foreign land her determination more firmly expressed than could have been supposed from her yielding disposition to abide with him in weal or in woe to share his wanderings his home be it roofless on the mountain or within palace walls that she was a highland girl accustomed to mountain paths and woody glens nerved to hardship and toilthis determination we say contrary as it was to his eloquent pleadings certainly afforded nigel no pain and might his beaming features be taken as reply it was fraught with unmingled pleasure in a much shorter time than we have taken to describe this however the queen had raised her head and looking up in her husbands face with an expression of devotedness which gave her countenance a charm it had never had before fervently exclaimed robert come woe or weal i will abide with thee her husbands side is the best protection for a wife and if wandering and suffering be his portion who will soothe and cheer as the wife of his love my spirit is but cowardly my will but weak but by thee i may gain the strength which in foreign lands could never be my own imaginary terrors fancied horrors would be worse oh how much worse than reality and when we met again i should be still less worthy of thy love no robert no urge me not plead to me no more my friends may do as they will but margaret abides with thee and who is there will pause will hesitate when their queen hath spoken thus continued the countess of buchan in a tone that to margarets ear whispered approval and encouragement surely there is none here whose love for their country is so weak their loyalty to their sovereign of such little worth that at the first defeat the first disappointment they would fly over seas for safety and contentedly leave the graves of their fathers the hearths of their ancestors the homes of their childhood to be desecrated by the chains of a foreign tyrant by the footsteps of his hirelings oh do not let us waver let us prove that though the arm of woman is weaker than that of man her spirit is as firm her heart as true and that privation and suffering and hardship encountered amid the mountains of our land the natural fastnesses of scotland in company with our rightful king our husbands our childrenall all aye death itself were preferable to exile and separation tis womans part to gild to bless and make a home and still still we may do this though our ancestral homes be in the hands of edward scotland has still her sheltering breast for all her children and shall we desert her now no no no echoed from every side enthusiasm kindling with her words better privation and danger in scotland than safety and comfort elsewhere nor was this the mere decision of the moment founded on its enthusiasm the next morning found them equally firm equally determined even the weak and timid margaret rose in that hour of trial superior to herself and preparations were rapidly made for their departure nor were the prelates of scotland who had remained at scone during the kings engagement backward in encouraging and blessing their decision his duties prevented the abbot of scone accompanying them but it was with deep regret he remained behind not from any fear of the english for a warrior spirit lurked beneath those episcopal robes but from his deep reverence for the enterprise and love for the person of king robert he acceded to the necessity of remaining in his abbey with the better grace as he fondly hoped to preserve the citizens in the good faith and loyalty they had so nobly demonstrated the archbishop of st andrews and the bishop of glasgow determined on following their sovereign to the death and the spirit of robert wounded as it had been felt healed and soothed and inspired afresh as the consciousness of his power over some true and faithful hearts of every grade and rank of either sex became yet more strongly proved in this hour of depression he ceased to speak of seeking refuge for his fair companions in another land their determination to abide with him and their husbands and sons was too heartfelt too unwavering to allow of a hope to change it and he well knew that their presence instead of increasing the cares and anxieties of his followers would rather lessen them by shedding a spirit of chivalry even over the weary wanderings he knew must be their portion for a while by gilding with the light of happier days the hours of darkness that might surround them chapter xii the queen and her companions were conveyed in detachments from the palace and town of scone the bruce believing with justice they would thus attract less notice and be better able to reach the mountains in safety the countess of buchan her friend lady mary agnes and isoline attended by sir nigel were the first to depart for though she spoke it not deep anxiety was on the mothers heart for the fate of her boy they mostly left scone at different hours of the night and the second day from the kings arrival the palace was untenanted all signs of the gallant court which for a brief space had shed such lustre such rays of hope on the old town were gone and sorrowfully and dispiritedly the burghers and citizens went about their several occupations for their hearts yet throbbed in loyalty and patriotism though hope they deemed was wholly at an end still they burned with indignation at every intelligence of new desertions to edward and though the power of pembroke compelled them to bend unwillingly to the yoke it was as a bow too tightly strung which would snap rather than use its strength in the cause of edward a few weeks good nursing from his mother and sister attended as it was by the kindness and warm friendship of the sovereign he adored and the constant care of nigel speedily restored the heir of buchan if not entirely to his usual strength at least with sufficient to enable him to accompany the royal wanderers wherever they pitched their tent and by degrees join in the adventurous excursions of his young companions to supply them with provender for on success in hunting entirely depended their subsistence it was in itself a strange romance the life they led frequently the blue sky was their only covering the purple heath their only bed nor would the king fare better than his followers eagerly indeed the young men ever exerted themselves to form tents or booths of brushwood branches of trees curiously and tastefully interwoven with the wild flowers that so luxuriantly adorned the rocks for the accommodation of the faithful companions who preferred this precarious existence with them to comfort safety and luxury in a foreign land nature indeed lavishly supplied them with beautiful materials and where the will was good exertion proved but a new enjoyment couches and cushions of the softest moss formed alike seats and places of repose by degrees almost a village of these primitive dwellings would start into being in the centre of some wild rocks which formed natural barriers around them watered perhaps by some pleasant brook rippling and gushing by in wild yet soothing music gemmed by its varied flowers here would be the rendezvous for some few weeks here would margaret and her companions rest a while from their fatiguing wanderings and could they have thought but of the present they would have been completely happy here would their faithful knights return laden with the spoils of the chase or with some gay tale of danger dared encountered and conquered here would the song send its full tone amid the responding echoes the harp and muse of nigel gave a refinement and delicacy to these meetings marking them indeed the days of chivalry and poetry even edward bruce the stern harsh dark passioned warrior even he felt the magic of the hour and now that the courage of nigel had been proved gave willing ear and would be among the first to bid him wake his harp and soothe the troubled visions of the hour and robert who saw so much of his own soul reflected in his young brother mingled as it was with yet more impassioned fervor more beautiful more endearing qualities for nigel had needed not trial to purify his soul and mark him out a patriot robert in very truth loved him and often would share with him his midnight couch his nightly watchings that he might confide to that young heart the despondency the hopelessness that to none other might be spoken none other might suspectthe secret fear that his crime would be visited on his unhappy country and he forbidden to secure her freedom even by the sacrifice of his life if it be so it must be so then be thou her savior her deliverer my nigel he would often urge droop not because i may have departed struggle on do as thy soul prompts and success will nay must attend thee for thou art pure and spotless and well deserving of all the glory the blessedness that will attend the sovereign of our country freed from chains thou art in truth deserving of all this but i peace peace my brother would be nigels answer thou only thou shalt deliver our country shall be her free her patriot king have we not often marked the glorious sun struggling with the black masses of clouds which surround and obscure his rising struggling and in vain to penetrate their murky folds and deluge the world with light shining a brief moment and then immersed in darkness until as he nears the western horizon the heaviest clouds flee before him the spotless azure spreadeth its beautiful expanse the brilliant rays dart on every side warming and cheering the whole earth with reviving beams and finally sinking to his rest in a flood of splendor more dazzling more imposing than ever attends his departure when his dawn hath been one of joy such is thy career my brother such will be thy glorious fate oh droop not even to meto thyself hope on strive on and thou shalt succeed would i had thy hopeful spirit my nigel an it pictured and believed things as these mournfully would the bruce reply and clasp the young warrior to his heart but it was only nigels ear that heard these whispers of despondency only nigels eye which could penetrate the inmost folds of that royal heart not even to his wifehis margaret whose faithfulness in these hours of adversity had drawn her yet closer to her husbanddid he breathe aught save encouragement and hope and to his followers he was the same as he had been from the first resolute unwavering triumphing over every obstacle cheering the fainthearted encouraging the desponding smiling with his young followers ever on the alert to provide amusement for them to approve guide instruct gallantly and kindly to smooth the path for his female companions joining in every accommodation for them even giving his manual labor with the lowest of his followers if his aid would lessen fatigue or more quickly enhance comfort and often and often in the little encampment we have described when night fell and warrior and dame would assemble in various picturesque groups on the grassy mound the king seated in the midst of them would read aloud and divert even the most wearied frame and careworn mind by the stirring scenes and chivalric feelings his mss recorded the talent of deciphering manuscripts indeed of reading any thing was one seldom attained or even sought for in the age of which we treat the sword and spear were alike the recreation and the business of the nobles reading and writing were in general confined to monks and the other clergy but robert even as his brother nigel possessed both these accomplishments although to the former their value never seemed so fully known as in his wanderings his readings were diversified by rude narratives or tales which he demanded in return from his companions and many a hearty laugh would resound from the woodland glades at the characteristic humor with which these demands were complied with the dance too would diversify these meetings a night of repose might perhaps succeed to be disturbed at its close by a cause for alarm and those pleasant restingplaces must be abandoned the happy party be divided and scattered far and wide to encounter fatigue danger perchance even death ere they met again yet still they drooped not murmured not no voice was ever heard to wish the kings advice had been taken and they had sought refuge in norway not even margaret breathed one sigh dropped one tear in her husbands presence although many were the times that she would have sunk from exhaustion had not isabella of buchan been near as her guardian angel to revive encourage infuse a portion of her own spirit in the weaker heart which so confidingly clung to her the youngest and most timid maiden the oldest and most ailing man still maintained the same patriotic spirit and resolute devotion which had upheld them at first the bruce and scotland were the words imprinted on their souls endowed with a power to awake the sinking heart and rouse the fainting frame to agnes and nigel it was shrewdly suspected these wanderings in the centre of magnificent nature their hearts open to each other revelling in the scenes around them were seasons of unalloyed enjoyment happiness more perfect than the state and restraint of a court precarious indeed it was but even in moments of danger they were not parted for nigel was ever the escort of the countess of buchan and danger by his side lost half its terror to agnes he left her side but to return to it covered with laurels unharmed uninjured even in the midst of foes and so frequently did this occur that the fond confiding spirit of the young agnes folded itself around the belief that he bore a charmed life that evil and death could not injure one so faultless and beloved their love grew stronger with each passing week for nature beautiful nature is surely the field of that interchange of thought for that silent commune of soul so dear to those that love the simplest flower the gushing brooks the frowning hills the varied hues attending the rising and the setting of the sun all were turned to poetry when the lips of nigel spoke to the ears of love the mind of agnes expanded before these rich communings she was so young so guileless her character moulded itself on his she learned yet more to comprehend to appreciate the nobility of his soul to cling yet closer to him as the consciousness of the rich treasure she possessed in his love became more and more unfolded to her view the natural fearfulness of her disposition gave way and the firmness the enthusiasm of purpose took possession of her heart secretly and silently indeed for to all save to herself she was the same gentle timid clinging girl that she had ever been so passed the summer months but as winter approached and the prospects of the king remained as apparently hopeless and gloomy as they were on his first taking refuge in the mountains it was soon pretty evident that some other plan must be resorted to for strong as the resolution might be the delicate frames of his female companions already suffering from the privations to which they had been exposed could not sustain the intense cold and heavy snows peculiar to the mountain region gallantly as the king had borne himself in every encounter with the english and angloscots sustaining with unexampled heroism repeated defeats and blighted hopes driven from one mountainous district by the fierce opposition of its inhabitants from another by a cessation of supplies till famine absolutely threatened closely followed by its grim attendant disease all his efforts to collect and inspire his countrymen with his own spirit his own hope were utterly and entirely fruitless for his enemies appeared to increase around him the autumn found him as far if not further from the successful termination of his desires than he had been at first all scotland lay at the feet of his foe john of lorn maternally related to the slain red comyn had collected his forces to the number of a thousand and effectually blockaded his progress through the district of breadalbane to which he had retreated from a superior body of english driving him to a narrow pass in the mountains where the bruces cavalry had no power to be of service and had it not been for the kings extraordinary exertions in guarding the rear and there checking the desperate fury of the assailants and interrupting their headlong pursuit of the fugitives by a strength activity and prudence that in these days would seem incredible the patriots must have been cut off to a man here it was that the family of lorn obtained possession of that brooch of bruce which even to this day is preserved as a relic and lauded as a triumph proving how nearly their redoubted enemy had fallen into their hands similar struggles had marked his progress through the mountains ever since the defeat of methven but vain was every effort of his foes to obtain possession of his person destroy his energy and thus frustrate his purpose perth inverness argyle and aberdeen had alternately been the scene of his wanderings the middle of autumn found him with about a hundred followers amongst whom were the countess of buchan and her son amid the mountains which divide kincardine from the southwest boundary of aberdeen the remainder of his officers and men divided into small bands each with some of their female companions under their especial charge were scattered over the different districts as better adapted to concealment and rest it was that part of the year when day gives place to night so suddenly that the sober calm of twilight even appears denied to us the streams rushed by turbid and swollen from the heavy autumnal rains a rude wind had robbed most of the trees of their foliage the sere and withered leaves indeed yet remained on the boughs beautiful even in their decay but the slightest breath would carry them away from their restingplaces and the mountain passes were incumbered and often slippery from the fallen leaves the mountains looked frowning and bare the pine and fir bent and rocked in their craggy cradles and the wind moaned through their dark branches sadly and painfully the sun had indeed shone fitfully through the day but still the scene was one of melancholy desolation and the heart of the countess of buchan bold and firm in general could not successfully resist the influence of natures sadness she sat comparatively alone a covering had indeed been thrown over some thick poles which interwove with brushwood and with a seat and couch of heather which was still in flower formed a rude tent and was destined for her repose but until nights dark mantle was fully unfurled she had preferred the natural seat of a jutting crag sheltered from the wind by an overhanging rock and some spreading firs her companions were scattered in different directions in search of food as was their wont some ten or fifteen men had been left with her and they were dispersed about the mountain collecting firewood and a supply of heath and moss for the night encampment within hail indeed but scarcely within sight for the space where the countess sate commanded little more than protruding crags and stunted trees and mountains lifting their dark bare brows to the starless sky it was not fear which had usurped dominion in the lady isabellas heart it was that heavy sluggish indefinable weight which sometimes clogs the spirit we know not wherefore until some event following quick upon it forces us even against our will to believe it the overhanging shadow of the future which had darkened the present she was sad very sad yet she could not as was ever her custom bring that sadness to judgment and impartially examining and determining its cause remove it if possible or banish it resolutely from her thoughts an impulse indefinable yet impossible to be resisted had caused her to intrust her agnes to the care of lady mary and nigel and compelled her to follow her son who had been the chosen companion of the king rigidly sternly she had questioned her own heart as to the motives of this decision it was nothing new her accompanying her son for she had invariably done so but it was something unusual her being separated from the queen and though her heart told her that her motives were so upright so pure they could have borne the sternest scrutiny there was naught which the most rigid mentor could condemn yet a feeling that evil would come of this was amongst the many others which weighed on her heart she could not tell wherefore yet she wished it had been otherwise wished the honor of being selected as the kings companion had fallen on other than her son for separate herself from him she could not one cause of this despondency might have been traced to the natural sinking of the spirit when it finds itself alone with time for its own fancies after a long period of exertion and that mental excitement which unseen to all outward observers preys upon itself memory had awakened dreams and visions she had long looked upon as dead it did but picture brightly beautifully joyously what might have been and disturbed the tranquil sadness which was usual to her now disturb it as with phantasmagoria dancing on the brain yet it was a struggle hard and fierce to banish them again as one sweet fancy sunk another rose even as gleams of moonlight on the waves which rise and fall with every breeze fancy and reason strove for dominion but the latter conquered what could be now the past save as a vision of the night the present a stern reality with all its dutiesduties not alone to others but to herself these were the things on which her thoughts must dwell these must banish all which might have been and they did and isabella of buchan came through that fiery ordeal unscathed uninjured in her selfesteem conscious that not in one thought did she wrong her husband in not one dream did she wrong the gentle heart of the queen which so clung to her in not the wildest flight of fancy did she look on robert as aught save as the deliverer of his country the king of all true scottish men she rose up from that weakness of suffering strengthened in her resolve to use every energy in the queens service in supporting encouraging endeavoring so to work on her appreciation of her husbands character as to render her yet more worthy of his love she had ever sought to remain beside the queen ever contrived they should be of the same party that her mind was ever on the stretch on the excitement could not be denied but she knew not how great its extent till the call for exertion was comparatively over and she found herself she scarcely understood how the only female companion of her sovereign the situation she had most dreaded most determined to avoid while engaged in the performance of her arduous task the schooling her own heart and devoting herself to roberts wife virtue seemed to have had its own reward for a new spirit had entwined her whole beingexcitement internal as it was had given a glow to thought and action but in her present solitude the reaction of spirit fell upon her as a dull sluggish weight of lead she had suffered too from both privation and fatigue and she was aware her strength was failing and this perhaps was another cause of her depression but be that as it may darkness closed round her unobserved and when startled by some sudden sound she raised her head from her hands she could scarcely discern one object from another in the density of gloom surely night has come suddenly upon us she said half aloud it is strange they have not yet returned and rising she was about seeking the tent prepared for her when a rude grasp was laid on her arm and a harsh unknown voice uttered in suppressed accents not so fast fair mistress not so fast my way does not lie in that direction and with your leave my way is yours how man fellow detain me at your peril answered the countess sternly permitting no trace of terror to falter in her voice although a drawn sword gleamed by her side and a gigantic form fully armed had grasped her arm unhand me or i will summon those that will force thee i am not alone and bethink thee insult to me will pass not with impunity the man laughed scornfully boldly answered fair one he said of a truth thou art a brave one i grieve such an office should descend upon me as the detention of so stout a heart yet even so in king edwards name you are my prisoner your prisoner and wherefore demanded the countess believing that calmness would be a better protection than any symptoms of fear you are mistaken good friend i knew not edward warred with women prove my mistake fair mistress and i will crave your pardon replied the man we have certain intelligence that a party of scottish rebels their quondam king perhaps among them are hidden in these mountains give us trusty news of their movements show us their track and edward will hold you in high favor and grant liberty and rich presents in excuse of his servants too great vigilance hearest thou what is the track of these rebelswhat their movements thou art a sorry fool murdock retorted another voice ere the countess could reply and hastily glancing around she beheld herself surrounded by armed men a sorry fool an thou wastest the precious darkness thus is not one rank rebel sufficient think you to satisfy our lord he will get intelligence enough out of her be sure isabella of buchan is not fool enough to hold parley with such as we rely ont a suppressed exclamation of exultation answered the utterance of that name and without further parley the arms of the countess were strongly pinioned and with the quickness of thought the man who had first spoken raised her in his arms and bore her through the thickest brushwood and wildest crags in quite the contrary direction to the encampment their movements accelerated by the fact that ere her arms were confined the countess with admirable presence of mind had raised to her lips a silver whistle attached to her girdle and blown a shrill distinct blast a moment sufficed to rudely tear it from her hand and hurry her off as we have said and when that call was answered which it was as soon as the men scattered on the mountain sufficiently recognized the sound they flung down their tools and sprung to the side whence it came but there was no sign no trace of her they sought they scoured with lighted torches every mossy path or craggy slope but in vain places of concealment were too numerous the darkness too intense save just the space illumined by the torch to permit success the trampling of horses announced the return of the king and his companions ere their search was concluded his bugle summoned the stragglers and speedily the loss of the countess was ascertained their fruitless search narrated and anxiety and alarm spread over the minds of all the agony of the youthful alan surpassed description even the efforts of his sovereign failed to calm him nor was the bruce himself much less agitated she did wrong she did wrong he said to leave herself so long unguarded yet who was there to commit this outrage there is some treachery here which we must sift we must not leave our noble countrywoman in the hands of these marauders trust me alan we shall recover her yet but the night promised ill for the fulfilment of this trust many hours passed in an utterly fruitless search and about one hour before midnight a thick fog increased the dense gloom and even prevented all assistance from the torches for not ten yards before them was distinguishable dispirited and disappointed the king and his companions threw themselves around the watchfires in gloomy meditation starting at the smallest sound and determined to renew their search with the first gleam of dawn the hurried pace of alan as he strode up and down for he could not rest alone disturbing the stillness all around chapter xiii it was already two hours after midnight when a hurried tread distinct from alans restless pacing disturbed the watchers and occasioned many to raise themselves on their elbows and listen it came nearer and nearer and very soon a young lad recognized as sir alans page was discerned springing from crag to crag in breathless haste and finally threw himself at his sovereigns feet it is not too lateup up and save her were the only words he had power to gasp panting painfully for the breath of which speed had deprived him his hair and dress were heavy with the damp occasioned by the fog and his whole appearance denoting no common agitation where how what knowest thou speak out what ailest thee boy were the eager words uttered at once by all and the king and others sprung to their feet while alan laid a heavy hand on the boys shoulder and glared on him in silence the lads glance fell beneath his and he sobbed forth mercy mercy my thoughtlessness has done this yet i guessed not dreamed not this ill would follow but oh do not wait for my tale now up up and save her ere it be too late and how may we trust thee now an this is the effect of former treachery demanded robert with a sternness that seemed to awe the terrified boy into composure i am not treacherous sire no no i would have exposed my throat to your graces sword rather than do a traitors deed trust me oh trust me and follow without delay speak first and clearly answered alan fiercely even for my mothers sake the sacred person of the king of scotland shall not be risked by a cravens word speak an thou wouldst bid me trust theespeak i charge thee he is righthe is right let him explain this mystery ere we follow echoed round and thus urged the boys tale was hurriedly told it was simply this some days previous when wandering alone about the rocks he had met a woodman whom he recognized as one of the retainers of buchan and as such believed him as loyal and faithful to king roberts interest as himself and others in the countesss train the man had artfully evaded all young malcolms expression of astonishment and inquiries as to why donald macalpine whom he well knew to be one of the stoutest and most sturdy menatarms which the clan possessed should have taken to so peaceful an employment as cutting wood and skilfully drew from the boy much information concerning the movements of the party to whom he belonged malcolm freely spoke of sir alan and the countess of buchan dilating with no little pleasure on his young master having received knighthood at the hand of his king and all the honors and delights which accompanied it aware however of the dangers which environed the bruce he spoke of him more cautiously and the more donald sought to discover if the king were near at hand the more carefully did malcolm conceal that he was telling the woodman if he wished to know all particulars he had better turn his sickle into a spear his cap into a helmet and strike a good blow for scotland and king robert this the man refused to do alleging he loved his own sturdy person and independent freedom too well to run his neck into such a noose that king robert might do very well for a while but eventually he must fall into king edwards hands malcolm angrily denied this and they parted not the best friends imaginable on reviewing all that had passed the boy reproached himself incessantly for having said too much and was continually tormented by an indefinable fear that some evil would follow this fear kept him by the side of the countess instead of as was his wont following sir alan to the chase the increasing darkness had concealed her from him but he was the first to distinguish her whistle he had reached the spot time enough to recognize the supposed woodman in the second speaker and to feel with painful acuteness his boyish thoughtlessness had brought this evil on a mistress to serve whom he would willingly have laid down his life resistance he knew on his part was utterly useless and therefore he determined to follow their track and thus bring accurate intelligence to the king the minds of the men preoccupied by the thought of their distinguished prisoner and the thickening gloom aided his resolution happening to have a quantity of thick flax in his pocket the boy with admirable foresight fastened it to different shrubs and stones as he passed and thus secured his safe return a precaution very necessary as from the windings and declivities and in parts wellnigh impregnable hollows into which he followed the men his return in time would have been utterly frustrated the gathering mist had occasioned a halt and a consultation as to whether they could reach the encampment to which they belonged or whether it would not be better to halt till dawn they had decided in favor of the latter fearing did they continue marching they might lose their track and perhaps fall in with the foe he had waited he said till he saw them making such evident preparations for a halt of some hours that he felt certain they would not remove till daylight it was a difficult and precarious path he said yet he was quite sure he could lead fifteen or twenty men easily to the spot and taken by surprise nothing would prevent the recovery of the countess less than two hours would take them there this tale was told in less time than we have taken to transcribe it and not twenty minutes after malcolms first appearance the king and sir alan with fifteen tried followers departed on their expedition there had been some attempt to dissuade the king from venturing his own person where further treachery might yet lurk but the attempt was vain she has perilled her life for me was his sole answer and were there any real peril mine would be hazarded for her but there is nonetis but a childs work we are about to do not even glory enough to call for envy the fog had sufficiently cleared to permit of their distinguishing the route marked out by malcolm but not enough to betray their advance even had there been scouts set to watch the pass not a word passed between them rapidly stealthily they advanced and about three in the morning stood within sight of their foes though still unseen themselves there was little appearance of caution two large fires had been kindled round one of which ten or twelve men were stretched their full length still armed indeed and their hands clasping their unsheathed swords but their senses fast locked in slumber near the other her arms and feet pinioned alan with a heart beating almost audibly with indignation recognized his mother two men armed with clubs walked up and down beside her and seven others were grouped in various attitudes at her feet most of them fast asleep it was evident that they had no idea of surprise and that their only fear was associated with the escape of their prisoner they are little more than man to man said the bruce therefore is there no need for further surprise than will attend the blast of your bugle sir alan sound the reveille and on to the rescue he was obeyed and the slumberers with suppressed oaths started to their feet glancing around them a brief minute in inquiring astonishment as to whence the sound came it was speedily explained man after man sprang through the thicket and rushed upon the foes several of whom gathering themselves around their prisoner seemed determined that her liberty should not be attained with her life more than once causing the swords of the bruces followers to turn aside in their rapid descent less they should injure her they sought to save like a young lion alan fought ably seconded by the king whose gigantic efforts clearing his path at length enabled himself and alan to stand uninjured beside the countess and thus obtain possession of her person and guard her from the injury to which her captors voluntarily exposed her there was at first no attempt at flight although the bruces men carried all before them the men fell where they stood till only five remained and these after a moments hesitation turned and fled a shrill cry from malcolm had turned the kings and alans attention in another direction and it was well they did so determined on foiling the efforts of his foes donald macalpine who was supposed to be among the fallen had stealthily approached the spot where the countess overcome with excessive faintness still reclined then noiselessly rising his sword was descending on her unguarded head when alan aroused by malcolms voice turned upon him and dashed his weapon from his grasp at the same minute that the bruces sword pierced the traitors heart he sprung in the air with a loud yell of agony and fell nearly crushing the countess with his weight it was the voice of alan which aroused that fainting heart it was in the bosom of her son those tearful eyes were hid after one startled and bewildered gaze on the countenance of her sovereign who had been leaning over her in unfeigned anxiety a thicket of thorn mingled with crags divided her from the unseemly signs of the late affray but though there was naught to renew alarm it was with a cold shudder she had clung to her son as if even her firm bold spirit had given way gently cheeringly the king addressed her and she evidently struggled to regain composure but her powers of body were evidently so prostrated that her friends felt rest of some kind she must have ere she could regain sufficient strength to accompany them on their wanderings she had received three or four wounds in the melee which though slight the loss of blood that had followed materially increased her weakness and the king anxiously summoned his friends around him to deliberate on the best measures to pursue amongst them were two of sir alans retainers old and faithful scottish men coeval with his grandfather the late earl of buchan devoted alike to the countess the king and their country they eagerly listened to all that was passing declaring that rather than leave the lady isabella in a situation of such danger as the present they would take it by turns to carry her in their arms to the encampment the king listened with a benevolent smile is there no hut or house or huntinglodge to which we could convey your lady he asked where she might find quieter shelter and greater rest than hitherto an ye knew of such it would be the wiser plan to seek it at break of day a huntinglodge belonging to the earls of buchan there was or ought to be the old men said near the head of the tay just at the entrance of athol forest it had not been used since their old masters days he had been very partial to it when a boy and was continually there it had most likely fallen into decay from disuse as they believed the present earl did not even know of its existence but that was all the better as it would be a still more safe and secure retreat for the countess and they were sure when once out of the hollows and intricacies of their present haltingplace they could easily discover the path to it and how long did they think it would be the king inquired before their lady could be taken to it the sooner they must perceive as well as himself the better for her comfort he was relieved when they declared that two days or at the very utmost three would bring them there if as the old men earnestly entreated he would they retraced their steps to the encampment as soon as daylight was sufficiently strong for them clearly to distinguish their path this was unanimously resolved on and the few intervening hours were spent by the countess in calm repose conscious that filial affection watched over her the sleep of the countess tranquillized her sufficiently to commence the return to the encampment with less painful evidences of exhaustion a rude litter waited for her in which she could recline when the pass allowed its safe passage and which could be easily borne by the bearers when the intricacies of the path prevented all egress save by pedestrianism it had been hurriedly made by her devoted adherents and soothed and gratified her usual energy seemed for the moment to return by nine oclock forenoon all traces of the bruce and his party had departed from the glen the last gleam of their armor was lost in the winding path and then it was that a man who had lain concealed in a thicket from the moment of the affray hearing all that had passed unseen himself now slowly cautiously raised himself on his knees gazed carefully round him then with a quicker but as silent motion sprung to his feet and raised his hands in an action of triumph he is amongst them then he muttered the traitor bruce himself this is well the countess her son find the wouldbe kingha ha my fortunes made and he bounded away in quite a contrary direction to that taken by the bruce the old retainers of buchan were correct in their surmises the evening of the second day succeeding the event we have narrated brought them to the huntinglodge it was indeed very old and parts had fallen almost to ruins but there were still three or four rooms remaining whose compact walls and wellclosed roofs rendered them a warm and welcome refuge for the countess of buchan whose strenuous exertions the two preceding days had ended as was expected by exhaustion more painful and overpowering than before the exertions of her friendsfor the bruce and his followers with one consent had permitted their wanderings to be guided by the old menspeedily rendered the apartments habitable large fires were soon blazing on the spacious hearths and ere night fell all appearance of damp and discomfort had vanished the frugal supper was that night a jovial meal the very look of a cheerful blaze beneath a walled roof was reviving to the wanderers the jest passed round the winecup sparkled to the health of the countess and many a fervent aspiration echoed round for the speedy restoration of her strength for truly she was the beloved the venerated of all alike from her sovereign to his lowest follower trust my experience my young knight had been the bruces address to alan ere they parted for the night a few days complete repose will quite restore your valued parent and my most honored friend this huntinglodge shall be our place of rendezvous for a time till she is sufficiently restored to accompany us southward you are satisfied are you not with the diligence of our scouts perfectly your highness was alans reply for welltried and intelligent men had been sent in every direction to discover if possible to what party of the enemy the captors of the lady isabella belonged and to note well the movements and appearance not only of any martial force but of the country people themselves they had executed their mission as well as the intricate passes and concealed hollows of the mountains permitted and brought back the welcome intelligence that for miles round the country was perfectly clear and to all appearance peaceful the huntinglodge too was so completely hidden by dark woods of pine and overhanging crags that even had there been foes prowling about the mountains they might pass within twenty yards of its vicinity and yet fail to discover it the very path leading to the bottom of the hollow in which it stood was concealed at the entrance by thick shrubs and an arch of rock which had either fallen naturally into that shape or been formed by the architects of the lodge it seemed barely possible that the retreat could be discovered except by the basest treachery and therefore the king and sir alan felt perfectly at rest regarding the safety of the countess even though they could only leave with her a guard of some twenty or thirty men so much was she refreshed the following morning that the hopes of her son brightened and with that filial devotion so peculiarly his characteristic he easily obtained leave of absence from his sovereign to remain by the couch of his mother for at least that day instead of accompanying him as was his wont in the expeditions of the day the countess combated this decision but in vain alan was resolved he was convinced he said her former capture and all its ill consequences would not have taken place had he been by her side and even were she not now exposed to such indignity she would be lonely and sad without him and stay in consequence he would the king and his officers approved of the youths resolution and reluctantly isabella yielded about two hours before noon the bruce and his companions departed desiring sir alan not to expect their return till near midnight as they intended penetrating a part of the country which had not yet been explored they might be a few hours sooner but they scarcely expected it it was afterwards remembered that a peculiar expression of sadness overclouded the countenance of the countess as for a moment she fixed her speaking eyes on the kings face when he cheerfully bade her farewell and said in a low emphatic voice farewell sire it may be the hour of meeting is longer deferred than we either of us now believe fain would i beseech your grace to grant me one boon make me but one promise ere you depart any boon any promise that our faithful friend and subject can demand is granted ere tis asked answered the king without a moments pause though startled alike at the expression of her features and the sadness of her voice gladly would we give any pledge that could in any way bespeak our warm sense of thy true merit lady therefore speak and fear not tis simply this sire she said and her voice was still mournful despite her every effort to prevent its being so should unforeseen evil befall me captivity danger of death or aught undreamed of now give me your royal word as a knight and king that you will not peril your sacred person and with it the weal and liberty of our unhappy country for my sake but leave me to my fate tis a strange and fanciful boon yet gracious sovereign refuse it not i mean not treachery such as we have encountered where your graces noble gallantry rescued me with little peril to yourself no i mean other and greater danger where i well know that rather than leave me exposed to the wrath of my husband and edward of england you would risk your own precious life and with it the liberty of scotland grant me this boon my liege and perchance this heavy weight upon my spirit will pass and leave me free nay tis such a strange and unknightly promise lady how may i pledge my word to its fulfilment answered robert gravely and sadly you bid me pledge mine honor to a deed that will stain my name with an everlasting infamy that even the liberty of scotland will not wash away how may i do this thing you press me sorely lady even for thee good and faithful as thou art how may i hurt my knightly fame sire thou wilt not she returned still more entreatingly thy brilliant fame thy noble name will nevercan never receive a stain i do but ask a promise whose fulfilment may never be demanded i do but bid thee remember thou art not only a knight a noble a king but one by whom the preservation the independence of our country can alone be achievedone on whose safety and freedom depends the welfare of a nation the unchained glory of her sons were death thy portion scotland lies a slave forever at the feet of england and therefore is it i do beseech thee king of scotland make me this pledge i know thy noble spirit well and i know thy too chivalric honor would blind thee to a sense of danger to a sense of country duty glory of all save the rescue of one who though she be faithful to thee and to her country is but as a drop of water in the ocean compared to other claims my liege thy word is already in part pledged she continued more proudly any pledge or promise i might demand is granted ere it is asked your highness deigned to say thou canst not retract it now and wherefore shouldst thou royal brother cheeringly interrupted alexander bruce the lady isahella asks not unreasonably she does but suggest what may be although that may be is as we all know next to impossible particularly now when nature has fortified this pleasant lodge even as would a garrison of some hundred men come be not so churlish in thy favors good my liege give her the pledge she demands and be sure its fulfilment will never be required could i but think so he replied still gravely lady i do entreat thee tell me wherefore thou demandest this strange boon fearest thou evildreamest thou aught of danger hovering near if so as there is a god in heaven i will not go forth today pardon me gracious sovereign answered isabella evasively i ask it because since the late adventure there has been a weight upon my spirit as if i impotent of little consequence as i am yet even i might be the means of hurling down evil on thy head and through thee on scotland and therefore until thy promise to the effect i have specified is given i cannot i will not resteven though as lord alexander justly believes its fulfilment will never be required evil here my liege trust me cannot be therefore go forth in confidence i fear not to await your return een should i linger here alone grant but my boon nay an it must be lady i promise all thou demandest answered bruce more cheerfully for her words reassured him but by mine honor thou hast asked neither well nor kindly remember my pledge is passed but for real danger and that only for scotlands sake not for mine own and now farewell lady i trust ere we meet again these depressing fancies will have left thee they have wellnigh departed now my liege twas simply for thee and scotland these heavy bodings oppressed me my son she added after a brief pause i would your highness could prevail on him to accompany you today wherefore should he stay with me wherefore not rather lady replied the king smiling i may not leave thee to thine own thoughts to weave fresh boons like to the last no no our young knight must guard thee till we meet again and with these words he departed they did not however deter the countess from resuming her persuasions to alan to accompany his sovereign but without success isabella of buchan had however in this instance departed from her usual strict adherence to the truth she did not feel so secure that no evil would befall her in the absence of the bruce as she had endeavored to make him believe some words she had caught during her brief captivity caused her she scarcely knew why to believe that the earl of buchan himself was in the neighborhood nay that the very party which had captured her were members of the army under his command she had gathered too that it was a very much larger force than the kings and therefore it was that she had made no objection to roberts wish that she should rest some few days in the huntinglodge she knew that however her failing strength might detain and harass their movements bruce and his followers would never consent to leave her unless as in the present case under a comparatively comfortable roof and wellconcealed shelter and she knew too that however she might struggle to accompany them in their wanderings the struggle in her present exhausted state would be utterly in vain and lingering for her might expose her sovereign to a renewal of the ills with which he had already striven so nobly and perchance to yet more irreparable misfortune the information of the scouts had partially reassured her at least to the fact that no immediate danger was to be apprehended and for a while she indulged the hope that safety might be found in this hidden spot until the peril passed she had full confidence in the fidelity of the old retainers who had guided them to the spot and sought to feel satisfied that its vicinity was unknown to the earl her husband but whether from the restlessness of a slight degree of fever or from that nervous state of mind attendant on wornout strength ere the bruce departed the same foreboding came on her again and all her desire was the absence of her sovereign and his followers to have some hold upon his almost too exalted sense of chivalry which would prevent any rash act of daring on his part and this as we have seen she obtained could she but have prevailed on her son to accompany them she would calmly and resignedly have awaited her fate whatever it might be but the horror of beholding him a prisoner in the hands of his fatherthat father perhaps so enraged at the boys daring opposition to his will and political opinions that he would give him up at once to the wrath of edwardwas a picture of anguish from which her mind revolted in such intense suffering she could not rest she strove with the fancy she sought to rouse every energy to feel secure in her present restingplace but who can resist the influence of feelings such as these what mothers heart cannot enter into the emotions of isabella of buchan as she gazed on her noble boy improved as he was in manliness and beauty and with the dread anticipation of evil believing only absence could protect him that perchance the very love which kept him by her side would expose him to danger imprisonment and death she did not speak her fears but alan vainly sought to soothe that unwonted restlessness she had endeavored to secure the bruces safety by the aid of malcolm the young page by whose instrumentality she had been both captured and released taking advantage of sir alans absence she had called the boy to her side and made him promise that at the first manifest sign of danger he would make his escape which by his extreme agility and address would easily be achieved seek the king and give him exact information of the numbers strength and situation of the foes reminding him at the same time of his solemn pledge she made him promise the profoundest secrecy and adjured him at all hazards to save the king the boy affected by the solemnity of her manner promised faithfully to observe her minutest sign and on the reentrance of sir alan departed to marvel wherefore his lady should so have spoken and examine the localities around as to the best means of concealment and escape the hours waned and night fell as is usual in october some five hours after noon the gloom perhaps greatly increased by the deep shades in which their place of concealment lay sir alan roused the fire to a cheerful blaze and lighting a torch of pinewood placed it in an iron bracket projecting from the wall and amused himself by polishing his arms and talking in that joyous tone his mother so loved on every subject that his affection fancied might interest and amuse her he was wholly unarmed except his sword which secured to his waist by a crimson sash he never laid aside and fair and graceful to his mothers eye did he look in his simple doublet of lincolngreen cut and slashed with ruby velvet his dark curls clustering round his bare throat and his bright face beaming in all the animation of youth and health spiritualized by the deeper feelings of his soul and she too was still beautiful though her frame was slighter her features more attenuated than when we first beheld her he had insisted on her reclining on the couch and drawn from her otherwise painful thoughts by his animated sallies smiles circled her pale lip and her sorrows were a while forgotten an hour perhaps rather more elapsed and found the mother and son still as we have described there had been no sound without but about that period many heavy footsteps might have been distinguished cautiously it seemed advancing alan started up and listened the impatient neigh of a charger was heard and then voices suppressed yet as he fancied familiar king robert returned already he exclaimed they must have had an unusually successful chase i must een seek them and inquire alan my child he started at the voice it was so unlike his mothers she had risen and flung her arm around him with a pressure so convulsive he looked at her with terror there was no time to answer a sudden noise usurped the place of the previous stillnessa strugglea heavy fall the door was flung rudely open and an armed man stood upon the threshold his vizor up but even had it not been the heart of the countess too truly told her she gazed upon her husband chapter xiv a brief pause followed the entrance of this unexpected visitor standing upon the threshold his dark brow knit his eyes fixed on his prisoners the earl of buchan stood a few minutes immovable alan saw but a mailclad warrior more fierce and brutal in appearance than the generality of their foes and felt with all that heartsinking despondency natural to youth that they were betrayed that resistance was in vain for heavier and louder grew the tramp of horse and man and the narrow passage discernible through the open door was filled with steelclad forms their drawn swords glancing in the torchlight their dark brows gleaming in illconcealed triumph alan was still a boy in years despite his experience as a warrior and in the first agony of this discovery the first dream of chains and captivity when his young spirit revelled in the thought of freedom and joyed as a bird in the fresh air of mount and stream weaving bright hopes not exile or wandering could remove his impulse had been to dash his useless sword in anguish to the earth and weep but the sight of his mother checked that internal weakness he felt her convulsive clasp he beheld the expression on her featureshow unlike their wontterror suffering whose entire cause he vainly endeavored to define and he roused himself for her and she did she see more than her son she knew that face and as she gazed she felt hope had departed she beheld naught but a long endless vista of anguish yet she felt not for herself she thought but of her child and the earl can we define his exulting moodit was the malice the triumph of a fiend who and what art thou demanded alan fiercely laying his right hand on his sword and with the left firmly clasping his mothers waist what bold knight and honorable chevalier art thou thus seeking by stealth the retreat of a wanderer and overpowering by numbers and treachery men who on the field thou and such as thou had never dared to meet the earl laughed that bitter biting laugh of contempt and triumph so difficult to bear thou hast a worthy tongue my pretty springald said he canst thou use thy sword as bravely who and what am i ask of the lady thou hast so caressingly encircled with thine arm perchance she can give thee information alan started a cold thrill passed through his frame as the real cause of his mothers terror flashed on his mind her lips parched and quivering parted as to speak but there was no sound mother he said mother speak to thy son why why art thou thus it is not the dread of imprisonment of death no no they have no terrors for such as thee who is this man engrossed in his own agitation alan had not heard the muttered exclamation which burst from buchans lips with his first words for great was the earls surprise as he looked on his son the impression he was still a child had remained on his mind despite all reports to the contrary but no softer feeling obtained dominion who and what am i he continued after a brief pause wouldst thou know alan of buchan even a faithful knight soldier and subject of his royal highness edward king of england and scotland and consequently thy foe the insulted and dishonored husband of the woman thou callest mother and consequently thy father young man ha have i spoken home thy sword thy sword acknowledge thy disloyalty to thy father and king and for thee all may yet be well never answered alan proudly the earls concluding words rousing the spirit which the knowledge of beholding his father and the emotion of his mother seemed to have crushed never lord of buchan for father i cannot call thee thou mayest force me to resign my sword thou mayest bring me to the block but acknowledge allegiance to a foreign tyrant who hath no claims on scotland or her sons save those of hate and detestation that thou canst never do even if thy sword be pointed at my heart boy burst from the earls lips in accents of irrepressible rage but he checked himself thou hast learned a goodly lesson of disobedience and daring of a truth and i should tender grateful thanks to thy most worthy most efficient and virtuous teacher he added in his own bitterly sarcastic tone the lady isabella deems perchance she has done her duty to her husband in placing a crown on the head of his hereditary and hated foe and leading his son in the same path of rebellion and disloyalty and giving his service to the murderer of his kinsman earl of buchan i have done my duty alike to my country and my son replied the countess her high spirit roused by the taunts of her husband according to the dictates of my conscience mine honor as a scottish woman the mother of a scottish warrior i have done my duty and neither imprisonment nor torture nor death will bid me retract those principles or waver in my acknowledgment of scotland and her king pardon me my lord but there is no rebellion in resisting the infringement of a tyrant no disloyalty in raising the standard against edward for there is no treason when there is no lawful authority and by what right is edward of england king of scotland lord of buchan i have done my duty as my father taught me i have taught my child regarding of course madam all which that childs father would have taught him particularly that most christian virtue returning good for evil as in the fact of revenging the death of a kinsman with the gift of a crown oh thou hast done well most intrinsically well i own no relationship with a traitor burst impetuously from alan sir john comyn was honored in his death for the sword of the bruce was too worthy a weapon for the black heart of a traitor lord of buchan we are in thy power it is enough hadst thou wished thy son to imbibe thy peculiar principles to forget his country and her lights it had been better perchance hadst thou remembered thou hadst a childa son had the duty of a father been performed perchance i had not now forgotten mine as a son as it is we stand as strangers and as foes against thee in truth i will not raise my sword but further we are severed and forever he crossed his arms proudly on his bosom and returned the dark scowling glance of his father with a flashing eye and a mien as firm and nobler than his own it is well young man i thank you for my freedom returned the earl between his teeth as my son i might stand between thee and edwards wrath as a stranger and my foe why whatever his sentence bethe axe and block without doubtlet it work it will move me little heed not his rash words in mercy heed them not exclaimed the countess her voice of agony contrasting strangely with its former proud reserve neglected forgotten him as thou hast yet lord of buchan he is still thy son oh in mercy expose him not to the deadly wrath of edward thou canst save him thou canst give him freedom it is ii who am the attainted traitor not my child give me up to edward and he will heed not ask not for thy son it is i who have offended him and thee not my child art thou not a scottish noble descendant of a house as purely loyal and devoted to their country as mine ownart thou not indeed this man and yet hath edward the deadly foe of thy race thy land thy countrymen more exalted claims than thine own blood no no it cannot be thou wilt relent thou wilt have mercy let him be but free and do with me even what thou wilt free go free repeated the earl with a hoarse laugh ere alan could interfere let him go free forsooth when he tells me he is my foe and will go hence and join my bitterest enemies the moment he is free go free and who art thou who askest this boon hast thou such claims upon me that for thy pleasure i should give freedom to thy son my lord my lord tis for thine own sake for his thy child as well as mine i do beseech implore thy mercy draw not the curse of heaven on thy heart by exposing him to death thou wilt know and feel him as indeed thy child when he lies bleeding before thee when thine own hand hath forged the deathbolt and then then it will be too late thou wilt yearn for his voice in vain oh is it not sufficient triumph to have in thy power the wife who hath dared thy authority who hath joined the patriot band and so drawn down on her the vengeance of edward the price of a traitor is set upon her head my lord my lord is not one victim enoughwill not my capture insure thee reward and honor in the court of edward then do with me what thou wiltchains torture death but my child my brave boyoh if thou hast one spark of mercy in thy heart let him go mother hoarsely murmured alan as he strove to raise her from her suppliant posture mother this shall not be look upon that face and know thou pleadest in vain i will not accept my freedom at such a price thy knee thy supplications unto a heart of stone for me no no mother dear mother we will die together thou shalt not thou shalt not my beloved my beautiful thy death will be on my head though it come from a fathers hand i will plead i will be heard my lord my lord she continued wrought to a pitch of agonized feeling no heart save that to which she pleaded could have heard unmoved i ask but his freedom the freedom of a boy a childand of whom do i ask itof his father his own father speak to me answer me thou canst not be so lost to the voice the feelings of nature for the sake of the mother who loved the father who blessed thee whose blessing hallowed our union and smiled on our infant boy have mercy on me on thyselflet him oh let him be free mercy on thee thou false and perjured woman the earl burst forth the cold sarcastic expression with which he had at first listened to her impassioned entreaties giving way to the fearful index of ungoverned rage on thee thou false traitress not alone to thy husbands principles but to his honor do i not know thee miniondo i not know the motives of thy conduct in leaving thy husbands castle for the court of bruce patriotism forsoothpatriotism ha the patriotism that had vent in giving and receiving love from him it was so easy to do homage to him in public as thy king oh most rare and immaculate specimen of female loyalty and virtue i know thee well man answered the countess springing from her knee and standing before him with a mien and countenance of such majestic dignity that for a brief moment it awed even him and her bewildered son gazed at her with emotions of awe struggling with surprise ha faithless minion thou bravest it well continued buchan determined on evincing no faltering in his purpose but thou bravest it in vain dishonored thou art and hast been aye from the time thy minion robert visited thee in buchan tower and lingered with thee the months he had disappeared from edwards court would isabella of buchan have rendered homage to any other bold usurper save her minion robert would the murder of a comyn have passed unavenged by her had the murderer been other than her gallant bruce would isabella of buchan be here the only female in the bruces trainfor i know that he is with theewere loyalty and patriotism her only motive woman i know thee i know that thou didst love him ere that false hand and falser heart were given to me thy lips spoke perfidy when they vowed allegiance at the altar and shall i have mercy on thy son for such as thee mercy ha have i silenced thy eloquence now silenced false blasphemous villain vociferated alan every other feeling lost in the whirlwind of passion and springing on the earl with his drawn sword tis thou who art the false and faithlessthou who art lost to every feeling of honor and of truth thy words are false as hell from whence they spring alan by the love thou bearest me i charge thee put up thy swordit is thy father exclaimed the countess commandingly and speaking the last word in a tone that thrilled to the boys heart he checked himself in his full career he snapped his drawn sword in twain he cast it passionately from him and uttering convulsively oh god oh god my father flung himself in agony on the ground with arms folded and the smile of a demon on his lip the earl had awaited his attack but there was disappointment within for his foul charge had failed in its intended effect prouder colder more commandingly erect had become the mein of the countess as he spoke till she even appeared to increase in stature her flashing eyes had never moved from his face till his fell beneath them her lip had curled his cheek had flushed powerful indeed became the contrast between the accused and the accuser arise my son she said arise and look upon thy mother her brow even as her heart is unstained with shame she fears not to meet the glance of her child look up my boy i speak these words to thee not to that bold bad man who hath dared unite the name of a daughter of fife with shame he hath no word either of exculpation denial or assent from me but to thee my child my young my innocent child thee whose ear when removed from me they may strive to poison with false tales woven with such skill that hadst thou not thy mothers word should win thee to beliefto thee i say look on me alanis this a brow of guilt no no no i will not look on thee my mother i need not to gaze on thee to know the horrid falsity of the charge answered alan flinging his arms passionately around his mother did i never see thee more never list that voice again and did all the fiends of hell come around me with their lies i would not hear much less believe such charge no no oh god tis my father speaks it fatherand my hand is powerless to avenge i need not vengeance my beloved grieve not weep not that thy hand is chained and may not defend thy mothers stainless name i need it not my heart is known unto my god my innocence to thee his blessing rest with thee my beautiful and give thee strength for all thou mayest endure she bent down to kiss his brow which was damp with the dew of intense anguish he started up he gave one long look on her calm and noble face and then he flung himself in her arms and sobbed like a child on her bosom it was a fearful moment for that woman heart had she been alone with her child both nerve and spirit must have given way but fortunately perhaps for the preservation of her fortitude the earl of buchan was still the witness of that scene triumphing in the sufferings he had caused the countess did indeed fold her boy convulsively to her breast but she did not bend her head on his as nature prompted it was still erect her mien majestic still and but a slight quivering in her beautiful lip betrayed emotion be firm be thy noble self she said forget not thou art a knight and soldier amid the patriots of scotland and now a while farewell she extricated herself with some difficulty from his embrace she paused not to gaze again upon the posture of overwhelming despondency in which he had sunk but with a step quick and firm advanced to the door whither goest thou madam demanded the earl fiercely bold as thou art it is well to know thou art a prisoner accused of high treason against king edward i need not your lordships voice to give me such information she answered proudly methinks these armed followers are allsufficient evidence guard me aye confine me with fetters an thou wilt but in thy presence thou canst not force me to abide bid a last farewell to thy son then proud minion he replied with fiendish malignity for an ye part now it is forever ye see him not again then be it so she rejoined we shall meet where falsehood and malignant hate can never harm us more and with a gesture of dignity more irritating to the earl than the fiercest demonstration of passion she passed the threshold a sign from buchan surrounded her with guards and by them she was conducted to a smaller apartment which was first carefully examined as to any concealed means of escape and then she was left alone a strong guard stationed at the door the first few minutes after the disappearance of the countess were passed by her husband in rapidly striding up and down the room by her son in the same posture of mute and motionless anguish in which she had left him there is no need to define that suffering his peculiar situation is allsufficient to explain it hurriedly securing the door from all intruders the earl at length approached his son wouldst thou be free he said abruptly methinks thou art young enough still to love liberty better than chains and perchance death speak i tell thee wouldst thou be free free answered alan raising his head with flashing eye and burning cheek would i be free ask of the chained lion the caged bird and they will tell thee the greenwood and forest glade are better dearer even though the chain were gemmed the prison gilded would i be free thou knowest that i would swear then that thou wilt quit scotland and vow fealty to edward that never more will thy sword be raised save against the contemned and hated bruce be faithful but to me and to king edward and thou shalt be free never answered alan proudly earl of buchan i accept no conditions with my freedom i will not be free if only on this base condition turn recreant and traitor to my country and my king resign the precious privilege of dying if i may not live for scotlandi tell thee never urge me no more nay thou art but a boy a foolish boy continued the earl struggling to speak persuadingly incapable of judging that which is right and best i tell thee i will give thee not freedom alone but honor station wealth i will acknowledge thee as my wellbeloved son and heir i will forget all that is past nay not een thy will or actions will i restrain i will bind thee by no vow thou shalt take no part with edward i will interfere not with thy peculiar politics een what thou wilt thou shalt do aye and haveand all this but on one condition so slight and simple that thou art worse than fool an thou refusest speak on muttered alan without raising his head i hear give me but information of the movements of him thou callest king replied buchan in a low yet emphatically distinct voice give me but a hint as to where we may meet him in combatin all honorable and knightly combat thou knowest that i meangive me but information such as this and thou art free unshackled in condition as in limb in other words betray him replied alan starting up purchase my freedom with the price of his mine of nothing worth aye less than nothing redeemed by his oh shame shame on thee my lord well mayest thou offer me freedom of action as in will on such condition of little heed to edward were the resistance of all scotland were robert in his power honor station wealthoh knowest thou the human heart so little as to believe these can exist with black treachery and fell remorse once and forever i tell thee thine offers are in vain were death in one scale and free unshackled liberty in the other and thou badest me choose between i would not so stain my soul death death itself were welcome aye worse than deathconfinement chains i would hug them to my heart as precious boons rather than live and walk the earth a traitor beware muttered the earl tempt me not too far rash boy i would not do thee ill i would have pity on thy erring youth remembering the evil counsels the base heart which hath guided thee do thou beware retorted alan fiercely speak not such foul words to me father as i know thou art in blood there are ties far stronger which bind me to my motherties neglect forgetfulness indifference as thine can never know pity aye mercys self i scorn them for i need them not ha sayest thou so then i swear thou shalt not have them exclaimed the earl rage again obtaining the ascendant i would have saved thee i would have given thee freedom though i needed not the condition that i offered thinkest thou i do not know that the traitor bruce and his followers will return hither and fall into the net prepared thinkest thou i know not he is with thee aye that he would not have left his patriot countess thus slightly guarded an he hoped not to return himself he cannot escape methe murder of sir john comyn will be avenged he shall he will escape thee proud earl undauntedly returned alan the savior of his wretched country will not be forced to bow before such as thee he will be saved out of the net preparedharassed chased encompassed as he is i tell thee earl of buchan he will escape thee yet then by heaven thy head shall fall for his fiercely replied the earl if he return not he has been forewarned prepared and i fool as i was have thought not of this danger look to it proud boy if the bruce return not fortyeight hours hence and thou art still silent thou diest he held up his clenched hand in a threatening attitude but alan neither moved nor spoke firmly returning the earls infuriated gaze till the door closed on his fathers retreating form he heard the bolts drawn the heavy tramp of the guard and then he threw himself on the couch and buried his face in his hands chapter xv while these fearful scenes were passing in the huntinglodge malcolm the young page already mentioned had contrived to elude the vigilance of the earls numerous followers and reach the brow of the hollow in perfect safety endowed with a sense and spirit above his years and inspired by his devoted attachment to the countess and sir alan the boy did not merely think of his own personal security and of the simple act of warning the king against the treachery which awaited his return but with an eye and mind well practised in intelligent observation he scanned the numbers character and peculiar situation of the foes which had so unexpectedly come upon them being peculiarly small and light in figure and completely clothed in a dark green tunic and hose which was scarcely discernible from the trees and shrubs around he stole in and out every brake and hollow clambering lightly and noiselessly over crags hanging like a broken branch from stunted trees leaping with the elasticity of a youthful fawn over stream and shrub and thus obtained a true and exact idea of the matter he desired the boys heart did indeed sink as he felt rescue would be utterly impossible that in one direction the english force extended nearly a mile guarding every avenue every hollow in the forest till it seemed next to impossible king robert could escape even if forewarned wherever he turned his steps the enemy appeared to lurk but he wavered not in his purpose aware of the direction which the king would take in returning malcolm slackened not his speed until some three hours after he had quitted the hollow and he stood before his sovereign wellnigh too exhausted for the utterance of his tale the first impulse of the king and his truehearted followers was to dare all danger and rescue the countess and her brave son at the expense of their lives but malcolm flinging himself at the feet of robert adjured him in the name of the countess to remember and act upon the vow he had so solemnly pledged at parting he earnestly and emphatically repeated the last injunctions of his lady her deep anguish that the king the savior of scotland should hazard all for her and her childbetter they should die than robert but these entreaties were but anguish to the noble spirit who heard aye and felt their truth though abide by them he could not again and again he questioned and crossquestioned as to their numbers and their strength but malcolm never wavered from his first account clearly and concisely he gave every required information and with bleeding hearts that little band of patriots felt they dared not hope to rescue and to conquer yet tacitly to assent to necessity to retreat without one blow to leave their faithful companions to death without one stroke for vengeance at least if not for relief this should not be we will see with our own eyes hear with our own ears at least my friends king robert said is there one among ye would retreat from the narrative of a child true as it may be remember the pass in argyle if necessary your sovereign can protect your retreat now as then and we shall at least feel we have struggled to rescue striven for the mastery even if it be in vain were my death aye the death of scotland the forfeit i could not so stain my knightly fame by such retreat let but the morning dawn and we will ourselves mark the strength of our foes there was not one dissenting voice rash as his determination might appear the extraordinary skill and courage of their sovereign displayed in so many instances during their perilous wanderings were too fresh in their memories to permit of one doubt one fear even had he led them on to certain death to throw themselves from their tired chargers to give them food to lie down themselves for a brief repose on the turf that they might be strengthened and cheered for the work of the morning all this did not occupy much time and if their slumbers were brief and troubled it did not prevent their rising with alacrity at the first peep of day to polish their arms look to the sharpening of their swords and spears share the rude huntsmans meal and mount and ride with the first signal of their king but bold and brave as were these truehearted men successful as comparatively speaking they were in the numberless skirmishes which took place that day darkness overtook them with increase of glory indeed but no nearer the accomplishment of their object than they had been in the morning with bitter sorrow king robert had perceived the full confirmation of the pages words the early close of the night attendant on the autumn season was also unfavorable to his views the events of the day had fully convinced him that many an ambush was set in his path that his personal safety was wholly incompatible with a night attack and therefore he was compelled to remain on the defensive in one spot which was fortunately barricaded and concealed by nature during the many long and weary hours forming an october night yet still the following day beheld him struggling on in the face alike of disappointment defeat and danger the most imminent still seeking the same object still hoping against hope and retreating only because the welfare of his country of her unfortunate children depended upon him bands more and more numerous pressed upon him coming from every side that scarcely was one skilfully eluded ere he had to struggle against another nothing but the most consummate skill the most patient courage and coolest address could have extricated him from the fearful dangers which encompassed him again did his followers believe he bore a charmed life for not only did he deal destruction unhurt himself but after three days almost incessant fighting and fatigue he had brought them to a place of safety with but the loss of fiveandtwenty men but though painfully conscious that further efforts for the rescue of his friends were completely useless king robert could not rest satisfied without some more accurate knowledge of their fate and after some hurried yet anxious consultation sir james douglas with that daring which so marked his simplest action declared that at all risks he would seek some tidings that would end their anxiety in the disguise of a peasant he would be secure from all discovery he said and he had not the slightest fear as to the success of the adventure five others started up as he spoke entreating permission to take the same disguise and accompany him it was granted king robert advising them however to adopt a diversity of costume and keep each one apart as they approached inhabited districts as their numbers might excite suspicion even though the actual disguise was complete with arms concealed beneath their various disguises they departed that same evening engaging to meet the king at the base of bencruchan some miles more south than their present trysting it was an anxious parting and yet more when they were actually gone for the high spirit and vein of humor which characterized the young lord douglas had power to cheer his friends even in the most painful moments king robert indeed exerted himself but this last stroke had been a heavy one knowing so well the character of edward he trembled both for the countess and her noble son perhaps less for the latter than the former for he hoped and believed the earl of buchan if indeed he were their captor would at least have some mercy on his son but for the countess he knew that there was no hope the character the sentiments of the earl had been noticed by the bruce when both were at the court of edward and he felt and knew that any excuse to rid him of a wife whose virtues were obnoxious to him would be acted on with joy and here perhaps it may be well to say a few words as to the real nature of king roberts sentiments towards isabella of buchan as from the anxiety her detention occasioned they may be so easily misunderstood we have performed our task but ill if our readers have imagined aught but the most purely noble most chivalric sentiments actuated the heart of the king whatever might have been the nature of those sentiments in earlier days since his marriage with the daughter of the earl of mar they had never entered his soul he had always believed the lady isabellas union with lord john comyn was one of choice not of necessity nor did his visit to her after the battle of falkirk recall any former feeling his mind had been under the heavy pressure of that selfreproach which the impressive words of wallace had first awakened the wretched state of his country the tyranny of edward occupied the mind of the man in which the emotions of the boy had merged he was too a husband and a father and he was as his fond wife so trustingly believed too nobly honorable to entertain one thought to her dishonor he looked on isabella of buchan as one indeed demanding his utmost esteem and gratitude his most faithful friendship and he secretly vowed that she should have it but these emotions took not their coloring from the past they were excited simply by her highminded devotion to the cause of her country her unshrinking patriotism her noble qualities alike as a mother subject friend he felt but as one noble spirit ever feels for a kindred essence heightened perhaps by the dissimilarity of sex but aught of love even in its faintest shadow aught of dishonorable feelings towards her or his own wife never entered his wildest dream it was the recollection of her unwavering loyalty of the supporting kindness she had ever shown his queen which occasioned his bitter sorrow at her detention by the foe it was the dread that the cruel wrath of edward would indeed condemn her to death for the active part she had taken in his coronation the conviction so agonizing to a mind like his that he had no power to rescue and avenge the fearful foreboding that thus would all his faithful friends fall from himthis only this would be the reward of all who served and loved him and even while still with undaunted firmness cheering the spirits of his adherents speaking hope to them his own inward soul was tortured with doubts as to the wisdom of his resistance lingering regrets for the fate of those of his friends already lost to him and painful fears for the final doom of those who yet remained it was in such moments of despondency that remorse too ever gained dominion and heightened his inward struggles roberts hand was not framed for blood his whole soul revolted from the bitter remembrance of that fatal act of passion which had stained his first rising he would have given worlds if he had had them to have recalled that deed busy fancy represented a hundred ways of punishing treachery other than that which his fury had adopted and this remembrance ever increased the anguish with which he regarded the fate of his friends his lot was indeed as yet one of unexampled suffering borne by heroism as great as unequalled but the lustre of the latter too frequently dazzles the mind and prevents the full meed of glory being obtained his heroism is known to all his sufferings to but a few but perhaps it was the latter yet more than the former which gave to scotland the glory and honor she acquired in his reign heroism is scarce separable from ambition but to mere ambition the voice of suffering is seldom heard heroism dazzles the crowd suffering purifies the man if robert the bruce were ambitious the passion in him assumed a nobler and better form yet we can scarcely call that ambition which sought but the delivery of scotland from chains but the regaining an ancient heritage and sought no more it was patriotism hallowed by suffering purified by adversity patriotism the noblest purest which ever entered the heart of man king robert and his handful of followers not only reached their trystingplace themselves but were joined by the queen and many of her female companions and their attendant warriors ere lord james of douglas returned three of his companions had straggled in one by one with various accounts but none so satisfactory as the king desired and he believed with justice that douglas lingered to bring if not satisfactory for that alas could not be yet accurate intelligence if aught could have comforted agnes in these moments of agonized suspense it would have been not alone the redoubled affection of her nigel but the soothing kindness the love and sympathy of a father which was lavished on her by king robert nay each of those rude warriors softened in address and tone as they looked on and spoke to that fair fragile being whom they feared now stood alone she did not weep when other eyes than those of nigel or the lady campbell or the gentle isoline were on her but that deadly pallor that quivering lip and heavy eye spoke all that she endured a large cavern divided by nature into many compartments was now the temporary shelter of the king and his friends it was situated at the base of bencruchan which though at the entrance of the territories of lorn was now comparatively secure the foe imagining the bruce still amidst the mountains of aberdeenshire the evening meal was spread a huge fire blazing in the stony cavity removed all appearance of damp or discomfort and shed a warm ruddy light on the groups within it was a rude home for the king of scotland and his court yet neither murmuring nor despondency was marked on the bold brows of the warriors or the gentler and paler features of their faithful companions their frames indeed showed the effect of wandering and anxiety many an eye which had been bright was sunken many a blooming cheek was paled but the lip yet smiled the voice had yet its gleesome tones to soothe and cheer their warrior friends the eager wish to prepare the couch and dress the simple meal to perform those many little offices of love and kindness so peculiarly a womans and engaged in with a zest a skill which was intuitive for there had been a time and one not far distant when those highborn females little dreamed such household deeds would be their occupation brightly and beautifully shone forth conjugal and filial love in those wandering hours the wife the child the sister bound themselves yet closer to the warrior husband father brother which claimed them his yet sweet most sweet as were those acts of love there were anxious and loving hearts which felt that soon too soon they must part from them they must persuade those gentle ones to accede to a temporary separationthey could not they would not expose them to the snows and killing frosts of a scottish winter anxiety deep anxiety was on the heart of king robert becoming more painful with each glance he fixed on agnes who was sitting apart with nigel her aching head resting on his shoulder but he strove to return the caresses of his daughter to repay with fond smiles the exertions of his wife sir niel campbell who after many painful trials had rejoined the king and others strove to disperse the silently gathering gloom by jest and song till the cavern walls reechoed with their soldier mirth harshly and mournfully it fell on the ear and heart of the maiden of buchan but she would not have it stilled no no do thou speak to me nigel and i shall only list to thee why should the noble efforts of these brave menfor i know even to them mirth is now an effortbe chilled and checked because my sick heart beats not in unison oh when will lord james return nigel sought to soothe to speak hope but though his words fell like balm on the bleeding heart he held to his it was the rich melody of their voice not the matter of their meaning the hour of rest was fast approaching when the wellknown signal was heard without and the young lord douglas with his two companions were hastily and eagerly admitted within the cave their looks denoted great fatigue and the eager eyes which scanned their countenances read little to hope yet much much alas to fear thou hast so far succeeded as to obtain the intelligence we need was the kings instant greeting as he released his favorite young follower from his embrace that i can read but further i fear me thou hast little to communicate which we shall love to hear my tidings are ill indeed your highness aggravated and most undreamedof ill but perchance and the young man hesitated for his eye caught the pallid face of agnes who had irresistibly drawn closer to the circle about the king and fixed her eyes on him with an expression almost wild in its agony perchance they had better first meet your graces private ear no no reiterated agnes springing forward and clinging convulsively to his arm it is only me thou fearest i know i know thou wouldst spare me but do not do not i can bear all every thing save this horrible suspense speak out let me but know all and then i can teach my soul to bear it oh do not hesitate do not pause in mercy tell meoh tell me all thus adjured but feeling most painfully the suffering his tale would produce douglas struggled with his own emotion and repeated all the information he had obtained guardedly as he spoke evidently as he endeavored to prepare the mind of agnes and thus soften its woe his tale was yet such as to harrow up the hearts of all his hearers how much more the frail and gentle being to whom it more immediately related yet she stood calm pale indeed and quivering but with a desperate effort conquering the weakness of her nature and bearing that deep woe as the daughter of her mother the betrothed of nigel bruce the young lords information was simply this on nearing the huntinglodge which was his first object he found it very nearly deserted but a few stragglers amounting perhaps to fifty in number of the followers of buchan remaining behind with orders to follow their master to dunkeld without delay mingling with these as a countryman of the more northern counties eager to obtain every species of intelligence respecting the movements of the english and the hunted bruce whom he pretended to condemn and vilify after the fashion of the angloscots and feeling perfectly secure not only in the disguise he had assumed but in the peculiar accent and intonation of the northcountry peasant which he could assume at pleasure he made himself a welcome guest and with scarcely any trouble received much of the information he desired he was told of the first capture and rescue of the countess of buchan that it was through one of the men left for dead on the scene of the skirmish the earl had received such exact information concerning the movements and intended destination of the bruce that immediately on receiving this intelligence he had gathered all his force amounting to five hundred men and dividing them into different bands sent skilful guides with each and was thus enabled to surround the lodge and command five different avenues of the forest without interruption or discovery he learned too that a stormy interview had taken place between the earl his wife and son the particulars of which however had not transpired that the earls rage had been terrific when he found the night passed and the bruce had not fallen into the snare laid for him and he had sworn a fearful oath that if the countess would not betray him into his power her son should die that both mother and son had stood this awful trial without shrinking that no word either to betray their king or implore life and mercy had been wrung from them incensed beyond all measure buchan had sent on the countess with a numerous guard his men believed either to dunkeld or perth in both of which towns there was a strong garrison of english and lingered yet another day and night in the hope of dragging some intelligence from the lips of alan or persuading him into acting the spy upon the actions and movements of the bruce he succeeded in neither and the men continued to state with shuddering horror which even their rude natures could not suppress that they believed the son had actually fallen a victim to his fathers ragethat he had actually been murdered numerous reports to that effect had been circulated on all sides and though they had watched narrowly they had seen nothing to contradict it the body of the unfortunate boy had been cast into a deep well heaps of rubbish flung over it and the well built up this they knew as a positive certainty for they had seen it douglas heard this tale with an intensity of horror of loathing which at first deprived him almost of every other feeling but when he could withdraw himself from the horrible idea a species of disbelief took possession of him it was impossible such utter depravity such fearful insensibility to the claims of nature could exist in the breast of any man it was a tale forged to inflict fresh agony on the mothers heart and he determined on discovering if possible the truth he pretended entirely to disbelieve it declared it was not possible that the earl had practised on their credulity and would laugh at them afterwards and contrived so well that three or four declared he should be convinced with his own eyes and set about pulling down the slight brickwork which covered the well this was what douglas wanted and he eagerly lent them a helping hand a body there was indeed in form and in clothing so exactly that of the unhappy alan that even though the face was so marred it could not be recognized the young earl could doubt no longer the young the brave the beautiful and true had fallen a victim to his own patriot loyalty and by a fathers hand the deep suffering this certainly occasioned was regarded by his companions as sulkiness for having been proved wrong in his judgment they jeered and laughed at him accordingly and harshly as these sounds reverberated in his heart they were welcome as enabling him still more easily to continue his disguise he accompanied them to dunkeld and found the earl had proceeded with his wife as prisoner to the castle of stirling there to deliver her over to the earl of hereford through whom to be sent on to edward determined on seeing her if possible douglas resolved on daring the danger and venturing even to the very stronghold of his foes the horror which this unnatural act of the earl had excited in the minds of his men he found had extended even over those in dunkeld and through them he learned that directly on reaching the town the earl had sought the countess brutally communicated the death of her son and placed in her hands the raven curls as all which remained of him some of which were dabbled in blood that she had remained apparently unmoved while in his presence but the moment he left her had sunk into a succession of the most fearful fainting fits in one of which she had been removed to stirling withdrawing himself from his companions under pretence of returning to his home in the north having he said loitered too long douglas concealed himself for some days in the abbey of scone the holy inmates of which still retained their loyalty and patriotism notwithstanding their revered abbot unable to remain longer inactive had donned the warriors dress and departed to join and fight with his king assuming the cowl and robes of one of the lay brothers and removing the red wig and beard he had adopted with his former costume the young lord took the staff in his hand and with difficulty bringing his hasty pace to a level with the sober step and grave demeanor of a reverend monk reached stirling just as the cavalcade with the litter intended for the captive countess had assembled before the castle gate agitated almost beyond the power of control douglas made his way through the gathering crowds and stood unquestioned close beside the litter he did not wait long respectfully supported by the earl of hereford himself the countess of buchan with a firm unfaltering step approached the litter the hood was thrown back and douglas could read the effects of withering agony on the marble stillness of those beautiful features though to all else they spoke but firm and calm resolve there was not a vestige of color on cheek or lip or brow and though her figure was as commanding as majestic as heretofore there was a fearful attenuation about it speaking volumes to lord jamess heart hereford placed her in the litter and with a respectful salutation turned away to give some necessary orders to his men bold in his disguise douglas bent over the countess and spoke in a low feigned voice those words of comfort and of peace suited to his assumed character but feigned as it was the countess recognized him on that instant a convulsive shudder passed through her every limb contracting her features with very agony my childmy alan she whispered harrowing his very soul beneath that voices thrilling woe douglas hast thou heardyes yes i can read it in thine awestruck face this this is all i have left of him and she partly drew from her bosom the clustering ringlets he recognized at once yet wherefore should i mourn him he is happy bid his memory be honored among ye and oh tell the sovereign for whom he fell better a death like this than treachery and shame she had paused as fearing observation but perceiving the attention of all more fixed on the glittering cavalcade than on herself she placed one of those glossy curls in the young earls hand and continued give this to my poor agnes with her mothers blessing and bid her take comfort bid her not weep and mourn for me a prison even death is preferable now to life for she is cared for i trust her to sir nigels love i know that he will tend her as a brother till a happier hour makes her all his own commend me to my sovereign and tell him might i choose my path again despite its anguish twould be that which i have trod and now farewell young lord i bless thee for this meeting dominus vobiscum mea filia et vale responded the supposed monk in a loud voice for he had only time to assure the countess by a look of deep sympathy of his willingness to execute her simplest wish and hide the ringlet in his bosom ere hereford turned towards him with a gaze of stern inquiry ably concealing alike his emotion and the expression of his countenance douglas evaded discovery and even obtained permission to follow the litter to the environs of the town he did so but the countess addressed him not again and it was with a heartsinking despondency he had turned to the mountains when the cavalcade disappeared from his view he retained his monkish garb till he entered the mountain district where he fell in with his two companions and they proceeded as we have seen to the quarters of their king a pause of horror followed his narrative told more forcibly and briefly by the lips of douglas than through the cooler medium of the historians pen stunned overwhelmed as if incapable of movement or speech though sense remained agnes stood insensible even to the voice of nigel whose soothing accents strove to whisper peace but when douglas placed in her cold hand the raven curls she knew so well when tenderly yet earnestly he repeated her mothers words the poor girl repeatedly pressed the hair to her parched lips and laid it in her bosom and then perceiving the sad and anxious face of her beloved she passed her hand hurriedly over her brow and burying her head on his breast sense was preserved by an agony of tears it was long long ere this aggravated wretchedness was calmed though the love of many the devotion of one were ever round her to strengthen and console sympathy the most heartfelt reigned in every bosom of the many misfortunes which had befallen this patriot band this seemed if not really the severest more fraught with horror than any which had come before the youth the gallant bearing the endearing qualities of the heir of buchan stood forth with vivid clearness in the memories of all and there were times when they felt it could not be it was too fearful and then again the too certain evidence of the fact witnessed as it had been by one of such tried truth as james of douglas brought conviction too clearly home and the sternest warrior who would have faced his own captivity and death unmoved felt no shame in the dimness which gathered in his eye for the fearful fate of the murdered boy in king roberts breast these emotions obtained yet more powerful dominion again did remorse distract him and there were moments of darkness when his spirit questioned the justice of the creator why was not his crime visited on his own head why did the guiltless and unstained fall thus around him and he remain unharmed and it needed all the eloquence of nigel the pious reasonings of the abbot of scone to convince him that dark and inscrutable as the decrees of omnipotence sometimes seemed in his case they were as clear as the wisdom from which they sprung by chastisement he was purified he was not yet fit to receive the reward of the righteous waiting on death destined to be the savior of his unhappy country the remorse which bowed down his naturally haughty spirit was more acceptable in the sight of his god more beneficial to his own soul than the one act of devotedness included in a brave mans death robert struggled with his despondency with his souls deep grief known as it was but to himself his confessor and his young brother he felt its encouragement would unnerve him for his destined task other imperative matters now pressed round him and by presenting fresh and increased danger roused his energies once more to their wonted action the winter had set in with unexampled severity overwhelming snowstorms filled up the rude paths of the mountains till egress and ingress appeared impossible the earl of athol himself who had been the inseparable companion of the bruce in all his wanderings now spoke of retiring and passing the winter within stone walls urging his sovereign with earnest eloquence to take refuge in ireland till the spring when they would reassemble under arms and perhaps take the tyrant edward once more by surprise bruce knew the veteran nobleman too well to attribute this advice to any motive save deep interest in his safety he saw too that it was utterly impossible for them to remain as they then were without serious evils alike to his female and male companions the common soldiers steady and firm as they still continued in loyalty yet were continually dispersing promising to reassemble in the spring but declaring that it was useless to think of struggling against the english when the very elements were at war against them with a sad foreboding robert saw and communicated to his devoted wife the necessity of their separation he felt that it was right and best and therefore he resisted all her tearful entreaties still to linger by his side her child was suffering for her tender years could not bear up against the cold and the want of proper nourishment and yet even that claim seemed less to the mothers heart than the vision of her husband enduring increase of hardship alone her acquiescence was indeed at length obtained but dimmed by many very bitter tears a hasty consultation with his few remaining friends speedily decided the bruces plans the castle of kildrummie a strong fortress situated at the head of the don in aberdeenshire yet remained to him and thither under the escort of his brother nigel and three hundred men the king determined to send his wife and child and the other ladies of his court himself his three brothers edward alexander and thomas douglas sir niel campbell and his remaining two hundred followers resolved on cautiously making their way southward across loch lomond and proceed thence to the coast of ireland there to await the spring in pursuance of this plan sir niel campbell was dispatched without delay to conciliate angus lord of the isles to whom cantire then belonged knowing he was unfriendly to his near neighbors the lords of lorn the king trusted he should find in him a powerful ally to appeal yet more strongly to the chivalric hospitality which characterized the chieftain sir niel consented that his wife and daughter isoline should accompany him lady campbell had too lately undergone the grief and anxiety attendant on the supposed loss of her husband to consent to another parting even the king her brother sought not to dissuade her but all persuasions to induce agnes to accompany them were vain bitter as the pang of separation was to her already aching heartfor lady campbell and isoline were both most dear to hershe steadily resolved to remain with the queen and her attendants and thus share the fate of her betrothed did not my mother commend me to thy care did she not bid thee tend me as a brother until happier hours and shall i seek other guardianship than thine my nigel were her whispered words and nigel could not answer them so pure so unselfish was her love that though he felt his happiness would have departed with her presence could he have commanded words he would have implored her to seek the hospitality of the lord of the isles as a securer home than kildrummie those forebodings already alluded to had returned with darker weight from the hour his separation from his brother was resolved on he evinced no sign of his inward thoughts he uttered no word of dissent for the trust reposed in him by his sovereign was indeed as precious as it was honorable but there was a mournful expression on his beautiful countenancewhen unobserved it would rest upon his brotherthat agnes could not define although it filled her spirit with incomprehensible alarm and urged her yet more to abide by his side the dreaded day arrived at length and agonized was indeed that parting cheerfully the king looked and hopefully he spoke but it had no power to calm the whelming tide of sorrow in which his wife clung to his embrace again and again she returned to that faithful heart which bore so fondly so forbearingly with all her faults and weaknesses and margory although she could not comprehend the extent of sorrow experienced by her mother wept bitterly at her side nor were they the only sufferers some indeed were fortunate enough to have relatives amid the band which accompanied them to kildrummie but by far the greater number clung to the necks of brothers fathers husbands whose faithful and loving companions they had been so longclung to them and wept as if a long dim vista of sorrow and separation stretched before them danger indeed was around them and the very fact of their being thus compelled to divide appeared to heighten the perils and tacitly acknowledge them as too great to be endured with pain and difficulty the ironsouled warriors at length tore themselves from the embrace of those they held most dear the knights and their followers had closed round the litters and commenced their march no clarion sent its shrill blast on the mountain echoes no inspiring drum reverberated through the glensall was mournfully still as the rudest soldier revered the grief he beheld and shrunk from disturbing it by a sound king robert stood alone on the spot where sir christopher seaton had borne from him his wife and child his eyes still watched their litter his thoughts still lingered with them alone full of affection anxiety sadness they were engrossed but not defined he was aroused by the sudden appearance of his younger brother who bareheaded threw himself at his feet and in a voice strangely husky murmured my sovereign my brother bless me oh bless me ere we part my blessingthe blessing of one they deem accursed and to thee good noble stainless as thou art nigel nigel do not mock me thus answered the king bitterness struggling with the deepest melancholy as he laid his hand which strangely trembled on the young mans lowered head alas bring i not evil and misery and death on all who love me what what may my blessing bring to thee joy bright joy in the hour of mirth and comfort oh untoldof comfort in the time of sorrow imprisonment death my brother my brother oh refuse it not thou knowest not thou canst not know how nigel loves thee robert gazed at him till every thought every feeling was lost in the sudden sensation of dread lest ill should come to him it had overtaken one as fair in promise as beloved and yet younger and oh if death selected the best the loveliest the dearest would it next fall on him the thought was such absolute agony that the previous suffering of that hour was lost before it bless theeoh may god in heaven bless thee my brave my noble nigel he exclaimed with a burst of emotion perfectly appalling in one generally so controlled and raising him he strained him convulsively to his heart yet why should we part he added after a long pause why did i fix on thee for this officeare there not others nigel nigel say but the word and thou shalt rest with me danger privation exile we have borne and may still share together why should i send thee from me dearest most beloved of all who call me brother why answered nigel raising his glistening eyes from his brothers shoulder why dear robert because thine eye could read my heart and trust it because thou knewest i would watch over those who bear thy name who are dear to thee even as thy noble self oh do not repent thee of thy choice tis hard to bear alone danger so long encountered hand in hand yet as thou hast decided let it be thy words have soothed my yearning heart which craved to list thy voice once more and now then my noble liege and brother farewell think on thy nigels words even when misery is round thee thou shalt thou shalt be blessed think on them my robert and then when joy and liberty and conquest crown thee oh forget not nigel he threw his arms around him imprinted a fervent kiss on his cheek and was out of sight ere the king by sign or word could arrest his progress one hasty bound forward robert indeed made but a dimness stole over his sight and for one brief minute he sunk down on the grass and when he lifted his head again there were burning tears upon his cheek chapter xvi the hardships and dangers attendant on king roberts progress southward mingled as they were with the very spirit of romance are so well known to every reader of scottish history that they must be excluded from our pages although a tale of chivalry would seem the very place for their insertion the life of no hero no sovereign no general presents us with a parallel to the lone and dreary passage of loch lomond we hear of an ancient and a modern hannibal crossing the snowy alps but it was at the head of triumphant armies it was carrying war and victory into an enemys land and there was glory in the dangerthe glory and pride of successful ambition but there was greater and truer heroism in the spirit which struggled on when the broad deep waters of loch lomond lay between them and comparative safety when mid falling snow and howling winds he cheered his drooping and exhausted followers by reading aloud a spiritstirring romance to which they listened enwrapt and charmed little imagining their own situation was one of far greater peril of more exciting romance than any which the volume so vividly described a leaky boat which scarcely allowed three men to cross in safety was their only means of conveyance and a day and night passed ere the two hundred followers of the bruce assembled on the opposite side the cheerful blast of his bugle which sounded to form them in bands before him on the beach was answered by one whose unexpected appearance occasioned such joy to the heart of the king that the exertions both of body and mind of the last few hours were forgotten it was the earl of lennox who since the fatal battle of methven had been numbered amongst the dead and lamented by his royal master with grief as deep as the joy was exceeding which greeted him again mutual was the tale of suffering each had to relate few and faint the hopes and prospects to communicate but so many were the friends the patriots had lost that the reappearance of the venerable nobleman infused a new and brighter spirit amid the almost despairing men that the earl of lennox had found a kind and hospitable home in the dominions of the lord of the isles and received welcome and favor from the chieftain himself was justly a subject of rejoicing to the fugitive king guided by him the intricacies of their path were smoothed and they reached their destination in a much shorter time than would otherwise have been the case sir niel campbell had performed his mission well and kindness and truth so long unknown now eagerly opened their hearths and hearts to the patriot king scorning alike the scottish and english authority angus lord of the isles had formed an independent sovereignty and now felt pride in receiving in his territories the only sovereign he had felt inclination to revere the daring heroism the unshaken spirit of the bruce were akin to his own wild and reckless courage and had there been no actual claim and right in roberts pretensions to the crown angus would still have declared that he and he alone was the sovereign worthy to assume it all then of state and dignity which he could assemble round him were proffered to the king and had there been less generosity less chivalric honor in his character king robert might have passed the winter months in comparative security and comfort angus indeed spoke daringly and slightly of the english force and had his inmost soul been read would have joyed had they ventured to attack him that he might show his skill and bravery in resisting and defending against their united force the sovereign who had confided in his gallantry and honor but robert knew better than the rude chieftain the devastating warfare which characterized edwards efforts at subjection and his whole soul shrunk from exposing angus and his truehearted followers to the utter ruin which if he were once known to be amongst them would inevitably ensue at once to secure his personal concealment and yet to withdraw from cantire without in any way offending the high spirit of the island chieftain bruce resolved on making the little island of rathlin the winter refuge of himself and his two hundred followers inhabited by the macdonalds who were of course subject to their general chief though divided from him by the channel bruce was still under the generous protection of his friend and therefore angus could bring forward no objection to the proposal save the miserable poverty the many discomforts of the barren islet and entreat with all his natural eloquence that king robert would still remain in the peninsula the arguments of the king however prevailed a small fleet better manned than built was instantly made ready for his service and angus himself conveyed the king in his own galley to his destined residence the aspect of the island the savage appearance and manner of its inhabitants were indeed such as to strike despondingly and painfully on the hearts of any less inured to suffering than king robert and his devoted adherents to them it was welcome for they justly felt the eye of edward could scarcely reach them there it was a painful alternative to warrior spirits such as theirs that the safety of their country depended on their inaction and concealment yet as their king their patriot king was still amongst them there was much much to hope and cherish still that their gentler friends and relatives were they hoped and believed in a place of safety was a matter of rejoicing though neither entreaty nor command could persuade the lady campbell and her daughter isoline to accept the proffered hospitality of the island chieftain it was nothing to them that they were the only females mid that warrior train that many hardships were around them still neither sir kiel nor the king could resist their pleadings and ere the sun of spring had shed its influence on the heart of man as well as the hardened earth there were many who mourned that a separation had taken place who wished that fatigue and anxiety had still been met together many weeks before king robert retreated to the island of rathlin sir nigel bruce had conducted his precious charge in safety to the castle of kildrummie whose feeble garrison gladly flung open their gates to receive them it was a strong fortress situated on a circular mount overhanging the river don which at that point ever rushed darkly and stormily along the mount though not steep was full two miles in circumference from base to brow occupied by the castle which was erected in that massive yet irregular form peculiar to the architecture of the middle ages a deep broad moat or fosse constantly supplied by the river defended the castle wall which ran round the mound irregularly indeed for there were indentations and sharp angles occasioned by the uneven ground each of which was guarded by a strong turret or tower rising from the wall the wall itself was some fourandtwenty feet in height and nine in thickness consequently the spaces between the turrets on the top of the wall formed broad level platforms which in case of a siege were generally kept strongly guarded facing the east and commanding a view of the river and adjacent country stood the barbacan gate and drawbridge which latter was further defended by strong oaken doors and an iron portcullis forming the great gate of the castle wall and the principal entrance into the fortress two towers of immense strength united by a narrow dimlylighted passage guarded this gate and on these depended the grate or portcullis which was lowered or raised by internal machinery within the castle wall was the outer ballium or court containing some small lowroofed dwellings the residence of many feudal retainers of the baron a rude church or chapel was also within this court holding a communication with the keep or principal part of the castle by means of a passage in the third wall which divided the ballium from the inner court in very large castles there were in general a second fosse wall gate and towers guarding the keep and thus making a complete division between it and the ballium but the original owners of kildrummie less rich and powerful suzerains than their equals in south britain were probably contented with merely a stout wall to divide their own sovereign residence from their more plebeian followers the keep itself constructed like all other similar buildings of the age was a massive tower covering but a small square and four or five stories high there were attempts at luxury in the chambers within but to modern taste the norman luxury was little better than rudeness and certainly though the cushions were soft and richly embroidered the arras in some of the apartments splendid specimens of needlework and the beautifully carved and often inlaid oaken walls of others gave evidence of both taste and talent yet the dim light seemed to shed a gloom and heaviness over the whole range of rooms and passages which no skill of workmanship or richness of material could remove the windows were invariably small and very long and narrow and set in walls of such huge thickness that the sun had barely power even in his summer splendor to penetrate the dusky panes in this keep was the great hall of audience and for the banquet at the upper end of which the dais was invariably found and dark and loathsome dungeons formed its basement the roof of kildrummie keep was flatter than the generality of norman castles its four angles being surmounted more by the appearance than the reality of turrets but one rose from the centre round and pierced by loopholes turreted at the top and commanding an extensive view of the adjoining country from this tower the banner of the baron always waved and its nonappearance excited some indignation in the breast of nigel bruce for his warrior spirit had no sympathy with that timorous excuse that did it wave at such a time it might excite the attention of the english whereas did it elevate no symbol of defiance its garrison might pass unquestioned up with the banner of scotland and the bruce were the first commands of sir nigel as he stood within the ballium surrounded by his charge and followers shall we pledged as we are to our country and king even seem to stand neutral and conceal our colors as ashamed of them shall this be he was answered by a simultaneous rush towards the keep and at his word the folds of the broad banner waved exultingly from the tower its appearance hailed by a loud shout from those beneath and by a bright and momentary gleam of sunshine flashing through the heavy clouds ha see ye my friends even heaven smiles on us exclaimed the young knight triumphantly and smiling cheerily on his fair friends as with gay words and graceful action he marshalled them into the keep it was while doing so that agnes marked the figure of an old yet majesticlooking man whose eyes still bright and flashing though his white hair denoted extreme old age were fixed immovably on the face and form of nigel it was a peculiar glance strained eager and yet mournful holding her attention so fascinated that she paused in her onward way and pointed him out to nigel i know him not love he said in answer to her inquiry i should deem him minstrel by his garb or seer or both perchance as is sometimes the case conjoined i will speak with him when my present grateful task is done but it was the next morning ere he had the opportunity of doing so for much devolved on the young seneschal he had to visit the outworks the stores the offices to give multitudinous orders and receive various intelligences to review the present garrison and his own followers and assign to each his post and though ably aided by sir christopher seaton and other of his officers all this occupied much time the outworks he found in excellent condition the barbacan of massive stone seemed well enabled to resist attack should it be made the machinery of the drawbridge was in good order and enabled to be drawn up or let down at a moments warning the stores and granaries which were contained in the towers on the castle wall were very amply provided though nigel taking advantage of the present peaceful temper of the country dispatched trusty messengers without delay for further supplies that this fortress almost the only one remaining to his brother would remain unmolested nigel did not for one moment believe but he did hope that in case of a siege if amply provided with stores it might hold out till the intense cold of the season and climate would turn the besiegers from their purpose at all events the advancing winter would be more favorable to the besieged than the besiegers and though the garrison was comparatively small the place itself was of such great strength as to guarantee the indulgence of his hopes that the original garrison were too timorous and wavering for him to place much dependence on them he readily perceived but he trusted much to the beneficial influence which his own steady truehearted followers might be enabled to infuse nigel was young brave and animated by every feeling which inspires courage and hope in the buoyant heart of youth the gloom which had oppressed him in parting with his brother and indeed had partially clouded his spirit during their rapid journey vanished before the duties and responsibilities which thronged round him now that he felt himself the guard and seneschal of the castle intrusted to his charge now that new duties devolved on him duties particularly dear to a young and gallant spirit like his own duties too that bound him closer and closer with the gentle being in whose welfare and happiness his own were shrined it was with a bright smile then and animated brow he joined his agnes early the following morning in a stroll through a small woody inclosure dignified by the name of garden which occupied part of the inner court the old minstrel who had so attracted the attention of agnes was there before them he stood against a projecting buttress his arms folded his eyes fixed it seemed on vacancy and evidently not aware he was approached till nigel spoke good morrow father i thought we had been the earliest to greet this fresh and frosty air save those on guard yet you are before us nay wherefore doff thy cap good father the air is somewhat too frosty for thy silvered head i cannot doff it to a nobler gentle youth answered the old man courteously save to my sovereigns self and as his representative i pay willing homage to his brother ha dost thou know me father and was it because i am king roberts brother thine eyes so rested on me yester morn mournfully methought as if the joy with which i hailed the gleam of sunshine smiling on our banner had little echo in thy breast not that not that answered the old man tremulous i scarce remarked it for my thoughts were in that future which is sometimes given me to read i saw thee noble youth but twas not here dim visions come across my waking hours it is not well to note them and he turned away as if he might not meet those eager eyes not here yet i was at his side good father and agnes laid her fair hand on the old mans arm thou wert thou wert my child beautiful beautiful he half whispered as he laid his hand dreamily on those golden curls and looked on her face yet hath sorrow touched thee maiden thy morn of life hath been oerclouded its shadow lingers yet too truly speakest thou father replied nigel drawing agnes closer to his heart for tears were starting in her eyes yet will not love soon chase that sorrow thou who canst penetrate the future seer of the bruces line tell me shall she not be mine the old man looked on them both and then his eyes became fixed on vacancy long and painfully once or twice he passed his hand across his high pale brow vain vain he said sadly but one vision comes to mine aching sight and there she seems thine own she is thine ownbut i know not how that will be ask me no more the dream is passing tis a sad and fearful gift others may triumph in the power but for me tis sad tis very sad sad nay is it not joy the anticipating joy answered nigel with animation to look on a beloved one and mark amid the clouds of distance glory and honor and love entwining on his path to look through shades of present sorrow and discern the sunbeam afar offis there not joy in this aye gentle youth but now oh now is there aught in scotland to whisper these bright things there was rejoicing find glory and triumph around the patriot wallace scotland sprung from her sluggish sleep and gave back her echo to his inspiring call i looked upon the heros beaming brow i met the sparkle of his brilliant eye i bowed before the native majesty of his godlike form but there was no joy for me dark masses of clouds closed round the present sunshine the present fled like a mist before them and they oped and thenthere was still wallace but oh how did i see him the scaffold the cord the mocking crowds the steelclad guardsall all even as he fell my children my children was there joy in this there was a thrilling pathos in the old mans voice that touched the very heart of his listeners agnes clung closer to the arm of her betrothed and looked up tearfully in his face his cheek was very pale and his lip slightly quivered there was evidently a desire to speak to utter some inquiry but he looked on that sweet face upturned to his and the unspoken words died in an inarticulate murmur on his lips my brother he said at length and with some difficulty though it was evident from the expression of his countenance this was not the question he had meant to ask my noble brother will thy glorious struggles thy persevering valor end in this no no it cannot be prophet and seer hast thou eer gazed on himhim the hope the joy the glory of the line of bruce hast thou gazed on him and was there no joy there yes answered the old man starting from his posture of despondency and raising his hands with animated fervor while his cheek flushed and his eyes fixed on distance sparkled with all the fire of youth yes i have gazed upon that face and in present and in future it is glorious still thick mists have risen round him wellnigh concealing him within their murky folds but still still as a star penetrating through cloud and mist and space till it sees its own bright semblance in the ocean depths so has that brow circled by its diadem of freedom gleamed back upon mine aching sight and i have seen and known there is joy for bruce and scotland yet then is there joy for all true scottish men good father and so will we chase all sadness from our brows and hearts replied nigel lightly come tell us of the past and not the future while we stroll thou hast traditions hast thou not to while away an hour nay my young lord replied the seer hast thou not enough in the present embodied as it is in this fair maidens dreaming eye and loving heart the minstrels harp and ancient lore are for the evening hour not for a time and companion such as this and with an audible blessing he turned away leaving them to their stroll together it was not however without an effort nigel could take advantage of his absence and make good use of moments so blissful to hearts that love there was something in the old mans mournful tone and glance when it rested upon him that answered strangely and sadly to the spiritvoice breathing in his own bold breast it seemed to touch that chord indefinably yet felt by the vibration of every nerve which followed he roused himself however and ere they joined the morning meal there was a brighter smile on the lip and heart of agnes than had rested there for many a long day for a few weeks there was peace both within and without the castle of kildrummie the relief the shelter which its walls afforded to the wearied and exhausted wanderers was at first felt and enjoyed alone many of the frailer sex were far too exhausted and disabled by a variety of sufferings to be sensible of any thing but that greater comforts than had been theirs for many painful months were now possessed but when their strength became partially restored when these comforts became sufficiently familiar to admit of other thoughts the queens fortitude began to waver it was not the mere impulse of the moment which caused her to urge her accompanying her husband on the plea of becoming more and more unworthy of his love if separated from him margaret of mar was not born for a heroine more especially to act on such a stormy stage as scotland full of kindly feeling of affection confidence gentleness one that would have drooped and died had her doom been to pass through life unloved her yielding mind took its tone and coloring from those with whom she most intimately associated not indeed from the rude and evil for from those she intuitively shrunk beneath her husbands influence cradled in his love her spirit received and cherished the reflection of his strength of itself she too truly felt it had none and consequently when that beloved one was far away the reflection passed from her mind even as the gleam of his armor from the mirror on which it glanced and margaret was weak and timorous again she had thought and hoped and prayed her unfeigned admiration of isabella of buchan her meek and beautiful appreciation of those qualities and candid acknowledgment that such was the character most adapted to her warrior husband would bring more steadiness and courage to her own woman breast alas the fearful fate which had overtaken the heroic countess came with such a shock to the weaker soul of margaret that if she had obtained any increase of courage it was at once annihilated and the desponding fancy entered her mind that if evil reached one so noble so steadfast in thought and in action how might she hope to escape and now when weakened and depressed alike by bodily and mental suffering such fancies obtained so much possession of her that she became more and more restless the exertions of sir nigel and his companions even of her own friends failed in rousing or infusing strength sometimes it was vague conjectures as to the fate of her husband the dread that he had fallen into the hands of his foesa catastrophe which not only herself but many stronger minds imagined could scarcely be avoided she would dwell on these fancies till suspense became intolerable and then if these were partially calmed came personal fears the belief that if attacked the castle could not muster force enough for defence suspicions of treachery in the garrison and other symptoms of the wavering nature of her mind till sir nigel felt too truly that if danger did come she would not stay to meet it her wishes ever turned to the sanctuary of st duthac in the domains of the earl of ross believing the sanctity of the place would be more effectual protection than the strongest castle and bravest force in vain sir nigel remonstrated nay assured her that the fidelity of the lord of ross was impugned that he doubted his flattering overtures that he was known to be in correspondence with england but he spoke in vainthe queen persisted in trusting him that he had ever been a friend of her father and brother the earls of mar and he would be faithful to her interests now her opinion weighed with many of the ladies of her court even amongst those who were not affected with her fears at such times agnes never spoke but there was a calm quiet determination in her expression that convinced the lady seaton who alone had leisure to observe her that her resolution was already taken and unalterable all that could be done to calm the queens perturbed spirits by way of amusement sir nigel did but his task was not an easy one and the rumor which about this time reached him that the earls of hereford and lancaster with a very large force were rapidly advancing towards aberdeenshire did not lessen its difficulties he sought to keep the information as long as possible from all his female charge although the appearance of many terrified villagers flying from their homes to the protection of the castle hardly enabled him to do so and confirmed without doubt the truth of what he had heard nigel felt the moment of peril was approaching and he nerved both mind and frame to meet it the weak terrors of the queen and some of her train increased with every rumor and despite every persuasion of sir nigel seaton and other brave and welltried warriors she rested not till a negotiation was entered into with the earl of ross to grant them a safe conduct through his lands and permission to enter the sanctuary of st duthac perplexed with many sad thoughts nigel bruce was one day slowly traversing a long gallery leading to some uninhabited chambers in the west wing of the building it was of different architecture and ruder heavier aspect than the remainder of the castle tradition said that those rooms had been the original building inhabited by an ancestor of the line of bruce and the remainder had been gradually added to them that some dark deed of blood had been there committed and consequently they were generally kept locked none of the vassals in the castle choosing to run the risk of meeting the spirits which they declared abode there we have before said that nigel was not superstitious though his mind being of a cast which adopting and embodying the ideal he was likely to be supposed such the particulars of the tradition he had never heard and consequently it was always with a smile of disbelief he listened to the oftrepeated injunction not to walk at dusk in the western turret this warning came across him now but his mind was far otherwise engrossed too much so indeed for him even to give more than a casual glance to the rude portraits which hung on either side the gallery he mistrusted the earl of ross and there came a fear upon his noble spirit that in permitting the departure of the queen and her attendants he might be liable to the censure of his sovereign that he was failing in his trust yet how was he to act how put a restraint upon his charge had he indeed believed that the defence of the castle would be successful that he should be enabled to force the besiegers to raise the siege he might perhaps have felt justified in restraining the queenbut he did not feel this he had observed there were many discontented and seditious spirits in the castle not indeed in the three hundred of his immediate followers but what were they compared to the immense force now pouring over the country and whose goal he knew was kildrummie the increase of inmates also from the number of small villages which had emptied their inhabitants into his walls till he was compelled to prevent further ingress must inevitably diminish his stores and when once blockaded to replenish them would be impossible no personal fears no weakness of purpose entered the high soul of nigel bruce amid these painful cogitations he well knew no shade of dishonor could fall on him he thought not one moment of his own fate although if the castle were taken he knew death awaited him either by the besiegers sword or the hangmans cord for he would make no condition he thought only that this was wellnigh the last castle in his brothers keeping which if lost would in the present depressed state of his affairs be indeed a fatal blow and a still greater triumph to england these thoughts naturally engrossed his mind to the exclusion of all imaginative whisperings and therefore was it that he drew back the bolt of a door which closed the passage without any of those peculiar feelings that at a less anxious time might have possessed him for souls less gifted than that of nigel bruce can seldom enter a spot hallowed by tradition without the electric thrill which so strangely unites the present with the past it was a chamber of moderate dimensions to which the oaken door admitted him hung with coarse and faded tapestry which disturbed by the wind disclosed an opening into another passage through which he pursued his way in the apartment on which the dark and narrow passage ended however his steps were irresistibly arrested it was panelled with blackoak of which the floor also was composed giving the whole an aspect calculated to infect the most thoughtless spirit with gloom two high and very narrow windows the small panes of which were quite incrusted with dust were the only conductors of light with the exception of a loopholefor it could scarcely be dignified by the name of casementon the western side through this loophole the red light of a declining winter sun sent its rays which were caught and stayed on what seemed at the distance an antique pictureframe wondering to perceive a picture out of its place in the gallery nigel hastily advanced towards it pausing however on his way to examine with some surprise one of the planks in the floor which instead of the beautiful black polish which age had rather heightened than marred in the rest was rough and white with all the appearance of having been hewn and scraped by some sharp instrument it is curious to mark how trifling a thing will sometimes connect arrange and render clear as day to the mind all that has before been vague imperfect and indistinct it is like the touch of lightning on an electric chain link after link starts up till we see the illumined whole we have said nigel had never heard the particulars of the tradition but he looked on that misshapen plank and in an instant a tale of blood and terror weaved itself in his mind in that room the deed whatever it was had been done and from that plank the sanguine evidence of murder had been with difficulty erased a cold shuddering passed over him and he turned instinctively away and strode hastily to examine the frame which had attracted him it did contain a picturewe should rather say a portraitfor it comprised but one figure the halflength of a youthful warrior clad in steel save the beautifullyformed head which was covered only by his own luxuriant raven curls in a better light it could not have been placed particularly in the evening the rays condensed and softened seemed to gather up their power into one focus and throw such an almost supernatural glow on the half face give such an extraordinary appearance of life to the whole figure that a casual visitant to that chamber might well fancy it was no picture but reality on which he gazed but no such emotion was at work in the bosom of nigel bruce though his first glance upon that face occasioned an almost convulsive start and then a gaze of such intense such almost fearful interest that he stood as if fascinated by some overpowering spell his features worked with internal emotions flushed and paled alternately it was no weakminded terror which bound him there no mood in which a step or sound could chill and startle for so wrapt was he in his own strange dreams that he heard not a slow and measured step approach him he did not even start when he felt a hand on his shoulder and the melodious voice of the seer caused him to turn slowly around the warnings thou hast heard have no power on thee young lord he said slightly smiling or i should not see thee here at this hour alone yet thou wert strangely wrapt knowest thou aught of him good father answered nigel in a voice that to his own ears sounded hoarse and unnatural and turning his glance once again to the portrait my thoughts are busy with that face and yon taletelling plank there are wild feverish incongruous dreams within me and i would have them solved thou of all others art best fitted to the task for amid the records of the past where thou hast loved to linger thou hast surely found the tradition of this tower i shame not to confess there is in my heart a deep yearning to learn the truth wherefore when thy harp and song have so pleasantly whiled the evening hours did not this tale find voice good father alas my son tis too fraught with horror too sad for gentle ears a few stern rugged words will best repeat it i love not to linger on the theme listen then now and it shall be told thee in the reign of malcolm the second the districts now called aberdeen and forfar were possessed and had been so so tradition saith since kenneth macalpine by the lords of brus or bris a family originally from the north they were largely and nobly connected particularly with norway and gaul it is generally supposed the first possessions in scotland held in fief by the line of bruce can be traced back only to the time of david i in the person of robert de bruce an anglonorman baron whose father came over to england with the conqueror the cause of this supposition my tale will presently explain haco brus or bris was the lord of aberdeen in the reign of malcolm the second he spent many years abroad indeed was supposed to have married and settled there when to the surprise of his vassals he suddenly returned unmarried and soon after uniting himself with a beautiful and accomplished girl nearly related to the bloodroyal of scotland settled quietly in this tower which was the stronghold of his possessions years passed the only child of the baron a son born in the first year of his marriage grew up in strength and beauty the idol not only of his mother but of his father a man stern and cold in seeming even morose but with passions fearful alike in their influence and extent your eye glances to that pictured face he was not the barons son of whom i speak the affections nay the very passions of the baron were centered in this boy it is supposed pride and ambition were their origin for he looked through his near connection with the sovereign for further aggrandizement for himself there were some who declared ambition was not the masterpassion that a deeper sterner fiercer emotion dwelt within whether they spoke thus from the sequel i know not but that sequel proved their truth there was a gathering of all the knightly and noble in king malcolms court not perchance for trials at arms resembling the tournays of the present day but very similar in their motive and bearing though ruder and more dangerous tho wreath of glory and victory was ever given by the gentle hand of beauty bright eyes and lovely forms presided at the sports even as now and the king and his highest nobles joined in the revels the wife of the baron of brus and his son now a fine boy of thirteen were of course amongst the royal guests though matron grace and dignified demeanor had taken the place of the blushing charms of early girlhood the lady helen brus was still very beautiful and as the niece of the king and wife of such a distinguished baron commanded and received universal homage among the combatants was a youthful knight of an exterior and bearing so much more polished and graceful than the sons of the soil or their more northern visitors that he was instantly recognized as coming from gaul then as now the most polished kingdom of the south delighted with his bravery his modesty and most chivalric bearing the king treated him with most distinguished honor invited him to his palace spoke with him as friend with friend on the kingdoms of normandy and france to the former of which he was subject there was a mystery too about the young knight which heightened the interest he excited he bore no device on his shield no cognizance whatever to mark his name and birth and his countenance beautiful as it was often when in repose expressed sadness and care unusual to his years for he was still very young though in reply to the kings solicitations that he would choose one of scotlands fairest maidens her dower should be princely and make the scottish court his home he had smilingly avowed that he was already a husband and father the notice of the king of course inspired the nobles with similar feelings of hospitality attention and kindness were lavished on the stranger from all and nothing was talked of but the nameless knight the lord of brus who had been absent on a mission to a distant court during the continuance of the martial games was on his return presented by the king himself to the young warrior it is said that both were so much moved by this meeting that all present were mystified still more the baron with that deep subtlety for which he was remarkable recovered himself the first and accounted for his emotion to the satisfaction of his hearers though not apparently to that of the stranger who though his cheek was blanched still kept his bright searching eyes upon him till the barons quailed neath his gaze the hundred tongues of rumor chose to speak of relationship that there was a likeness between them yet i know not how that could be there is no impress of the fiendish passion at work in the barons soul on those bright beautiful features ha is it of him you speak involuntarily escaped from nigel as the old man for a moment paused of him methought yon portrait was of an ancestor of bruce or wherefore is it here be patient good my son my narrative wanders for my lips shrink from its tale that the baron and the knight met not in warlike joust but in peaceful converse and at the request of the latter is known but on what passed in that interview even tradition is silent it can only be imagined by the sequel they appeared however less reserved than at first the baron treated him with the same distinction as his fellownobles and the strangers manner towards him was even more respectful than the mere difference of age appeared to demand important business with the lord of brus was alleged as the cause of his accepting that noblemans invitation to the tower of kildrummie in preference to others earlier given and more eagerly enforced they departed together the knight accompanied but by two of his followers and the baron leaving the greater number of his in attendance on his wife and child who for some frivolous reason he left with the court it was a strange thing for him to do men said as he had never before been known to lose sight of his boy even for a day for some days all seemed peace and hospitality within the tower the stranger was too noble himself and too kindly disposed towards all his fellowcreatures to suspect aught of treachery or he might have remarked the retainers of the baron were changed that ruder forms and darker visages than at first were gathering around him how the baron might have intended to make use of themalmost all robbers and murderers by tradecannot be known though it may be suspected in this room the last interview between them took place and here on this silent witness of the deed the hand of the father was bathed in the blood of the son god in heaven burst from nigels parched lips as he sprang up the sonhow could that be how known fearfully most fearfully shudderingly answered the old man through the dying ravings of the maniac lord of brus himself had not heaven in its allseeing justice thus revealed it the crime would ever have remained concealed his bandit hirelings were at hand to remove and bury many fathoms deep in moat and earth all traces of the deed one of the unfortunate knights followers was supposed to have shared the fate of his master and to the other who escaped almost miraculously you owe the preservation of your royal line but there was one witness of the deed neither time nor the most cunning art could efface the blood lay in a pool on the oaken floor and the voice of tradition whispers that day after day it was supernaturally renewed that vain were the efforts to absorb it it ever seemed moist and red and that to remove the plank and refloor the apartment was attempted again and again in vain however this may be it is evident that erasing it was attended with extreme difficulty that the blood had penetrated wellnigh through the immense thickness of the wood nigel stooped down over the crumbling fragment years aye centuries had rolled away yet there it still stood arrested it seemed even in its decay not permitted to crumble into dust but to remain an everlasting monument of crime and its retribution after a brief pause nigel resumed his seat and pushing the hair from his brow which was damp with some untold emotion signed to the old man to proceed that the stranger warrior returned not to malcolms court and had failed in his promises to various friends was a matter of disappointment and for a time of conjecture to the king and his court that his followers in obedience it was said to their masters signet set off instantly to join him either in england or normandy for both of which places they had received directions satisfied the greater number if others suspected foul play it was speedily hushed up for the baron was too powerful too closely related to the throne and justice then too weak in scotland to permit accusation or hope for conviction time passed and the only change observable in the baron was that he became more gloomy more abstracted wrapt up as it were in one dark remembrance one allengrossing thought towards his wife he was changedharsh cold bitterly sarcastic as if her caresses had turned to gall her gentle spirit sunk beneath the withering blight and he was heard to laugh the mocking laugh of a fiend as he followed her to the grave her child indeed he still idolized but it was a fearful affection and a just heaven permitted not its continuance the child to whom many had looked as likely to ascend the scottish throne from the failure of all direct heirs the beautiful and innocent child of a most guilty father faded like a lovely flower before him so softly so gradually that there came no suspicion of death till the cold hand was on his heart and he lay lifeless before him who had plunged his soul in deadliest crime through that child to aggrandize himself then was it that remorse torturing before took the form of partial madness and there was not one who had power to restrain or guide or soothe then it was the fearful tale was told freezing the blood not so much with the wild madness of the tone but that the words were too collected too stamped with truth to admit of aught like doubt the couch of the baron was at his own command placed here where we now stand covering the spot where his firstborn fell and that portrait obtained from normandy hung where it now is ever in his sight the dark tale which those wild ravings revealed was simply this he had married as was suspected during his wanderings but soon tired of the yoke more particularly as his wife possessed a spirit proud and haughty as his own and all efforts to mould her to his will were useless he plunged anew into his reckless career he had never loved his wife marrying her simply because it suited his convenience and brought him increase of wealth and station and her illdisguised abhorrence of many of his actions her beautiful adherence to virtue however tempted occasioned all former feelings to concentrate in hatred the most deadly more than one attempt to rid himself of her by poison she had discovered and frustrated and at last removed herself and her child under a feigned name to normandy and ably eluded all pursuit and inquiry the barons search continued some time in the hope of silencing her forever as he feared she might prove a dangerous enemy but failing in his wishes he travelled some time over different countries returned at length to scotland and acted as we have seen the young knight had been informed of his birthright by his mother at her death which took place two years before he made his appearance in scotland that she had concealed from him the fearful character of his father being unable so completely to divest herself of all feeling towards the father of her child as to make him an object of aversion to his son she had long told him his real name and urged him to demand from his father an acknowledgment of his being heir to the proud barony of the bruce his likeness to herself was so strong that she knew it must carry conviction to his father but to make his identity still more certain she furnished him with certain jewels and papers none but herself could produce she had done this in the presence of two faithful witnesses the father and brother of her sons betrothed bride high lords of normandy the former of which made it a condition annexed to his consent to the marriage that as soon as possible afterwards he should urge and claim his rights sir walter of course willingly complied they were married by the name of brus and their child so baptized a war which retained sir walter in arms with his sovereign prevented his seeking scotland till his boy was a year old and then for his sake far more than for his own the young father determined on asserting his birthright his child should not be nameless as he had been but to spare his unknown parent all public mortification he joined the martial games without any cognizance or bearing on his shield terrible were the ravings in which the baron alluded to the interview he had had with his murdered child the angelic mildness and generosity of the youthful warrior that amid all his firmness never to depart from his claimas it was not alone himself but his child he would irreparably injurehe never wavered in his respectful deference to his parent he quitted the court in the belief that the baron sought kildrummie to collect the necessary papers for substantiating his claim but ere he died it appeared his eyes were opened the fierce passions of the baron had been too long restrained in the last interview they burst even his politic control and he had flung the papers received from the hand of his tooconfiding son on the blazing hearth and with dreadful oaths swore that if he would not instantly retract his claim and bind himself by the most sacred promise never to breathe the foul tale again death should be its silent keeper he would not bring his own head low and avow that he had dishonored a scion of the bloodroyal appalled far more at the dark fiendish passions he beheld than the threat held out to himself sir walter stood silent a while and then mildly demanded to be heard that if so much public mortification to his parent would attend the pursuance of his claims at the present time he would consent to forego them on condition of his fathers solemnly promising on his deathbed to reveal the truth and do him tardy justice then but forego them altogether he would not were his life the forfeit the calm firmness of his tone it is supposed lashed his father into greater madness and thus the dark deed was done that the baron several times endeavored to possess himself of the infant child of sir walter also came to light in his dying moments that he had determined to exterminate root and branch fearful he should still possess some clue to his birth he had frantically avowed but in his last hour he would have given all his amassed treasure his greatness his power but for one little moment of assurance that his grandson lived he left him all his possessions his lordship his name but as there were none came forth to claim they of necessity passed to the crown but the child the son of sir walterif from him our line descends he must have lived to manhoodwhy did not he demand his rights he lived aye and had a goodly progeny but the fearful tale of his fathers fate related to him again and again by the faithful edric who had fled from his masters murdered corse to watch over the safety of that masters child and warn all who had the charge of him of the fiend in human shape who would probably seek the boys life as he had his fathers caused him to shun the idea of his scottish possessions with a loathing horror which he could not conquer they were associated with the loss of both his parents for his fathers murder killed his devoted mother he was contented to feel himself norman in possessions as well as in name he received lands and honors from the dukes of normandy and at the advanced age of seventy and five accompanied duke william to england the third generation from him obtained anew scottish possessions and gradually kildrummie and its feudal tenures returned to its original lords but the tower had been altered and enlarged and except the tradition of these chambers the fearful fate of the second of the line has faded from the minds of his descendants unless casually or supernaturally recalled ha supernaturally sayest thou interrupted nigel in a tone so peculiar it almost startled his companion are there those who assert they have seen his semblancegood gifted beautiful as thou hast described him why not at once deem him the guardian spirit of our house and there are those who deem him so young lord answered the seer it is said that until the lords of bruce again obtained possession of these lands in the visions of the night the form of the murdered warrior clad as in yon portrait save with the addition of a scarf across his breast bearing the crest and cognizance of the bruce appeared once in his lifetime to each lineal descendant such visitations are said to have ceased and he is now only seen by those destined like himself to an early and bloody death cut off in the prime of manhood nobleness and joy and wheresleeping or waking demanded the young nobleman in a low deep tone laying his hand on the minstrels arm and looking fixedly on his now strangely agitated face sleeping or waking it hath been both he answered and his voice faltered if it be in the front of the war amid the press the crush the glory of the battle he hath come circled with bright forms and brighter dreams to the sleeping warrior on the eve of his last fight ifand his voice grew lower and huskier yetif by the red hand of the foe by the captives chain and headsmans axe as the noble wallace there have been those who sayi vouch not for its truthhe hath been seen in the vigils of the night on the eve of knighthood when the young aspiring warrior hath watched and prayed beside his arms boy boy why dost thou look upon me thus because thine eye hath read my doom he said in a firm sweet tone and if there be aught of truth in thy tale thou knowest feelest i have seen him god of mercy the captives chain the headsmans axe yet tis thy will and for my countrylet it come chapter xvii thou art idle maiden wherefore not gather thy robes and other gear together as thy companions knowest thou not in twentyfour hours we shall be heaven willing safely sheltered under the holy wing of st duthac was queen margarets address to agnes about a week after the conversation we have recorded there were many signs of confusion and tokens of removal in her scanty train but the maiden of buchan stood apart offering assistance when needed but making no arrangements for herself i seek not such holy keeping may it please you madam she replied i do not quit this castle how exclaimed margaret art thou mad in what royal madam or hath love blinded thee girl knowest thou not hereford and lancaster are advancing as rapidly as their ironclad force permits and in less than seven days the castle must be besieged in form i know it madam and thou wilt brave it maidendare a danger that may be avoided is thy life of so little worth or if not thy life thy liberty when a life is wrapt up in onewhen there is none on earth save that one to whom that life is of any worth wherefore should i seek safety save by his side royal madam i am not mad nor blind but desolate as i amnay were i not twould be the samei covet to share sir nigels fate the blow that strikes him shall lay me at his side be it in prison or in death my safety is with him and were the danger ten times as great as that which threatens now id share it with him still nay thou art but a loving fool agnes be advised seek safety in the sanctuary peril cannot reach us there save by the treachery of the darkbrowed earl who grants that shelter nay pardon me madam thou lovest not to list that theme believing him as honorable and faithful as thyself god grant he prove so if she added with a faint smile if it be such mad folly to cling to a beloved one in danger as in joy in adversity as in triumph forgive me royal lady but thy maidens have learned that tale of thee and would to god i could teach them thus again exclaimed the queen tears coursing down her cheeks oh agnes agnes were robert here not death itself should part us for my childs sake for his i go hence for safety could my resting nay my death benefit him agnes i would meet it weak as thou deemest me nay nay i doubt it not my queen answered agnes soothingly it is best thou shouldst find some place of repose till this struggle be past if it end in victory it will be joy to hail thee once again within its walls if otherwise better thy safety should be cared for but for thee my child is it not unmaidenly for thee to linger here it would be royal madam and a bright vivid flush glowed on her pale cheeks but for the protection of the lady seaton who will not leave her husband i may not blame her after mine own words said the queen sorrowfully yet she is one i could have wished beside me ha that trumpet merciful heaven is it the foe and trembling with alarm she dispatched attendant after attendant to know the cause the english force was known to be so near that many a warriorheart beat quicker at any unusual blast and it was not marvel the queens terrors should very often affect her attendants agnes alone amid the maiden train ever retained a calm selfpossession strange in one who till the last eventful year had seemed such a very child her mother trembled lest the turmoils and confusion of her country should ever approach her or those she loved how might she timid nay often fearful weak and yielding as the flower on the heath how might she encounter storm and grief and care had her mothers eye been on her now and could have followed her in yet deeper trials that mother scarce had known her child she it was whose coolness enabled her easily to recognize and explain the trumpets blast it was an officer with an escort from the lord of ross informing the queen that from late intelligence respecting the movements of the english he deemed it better they should not defer their departure from the castle another night on the receipt of this message all was increased hurry and confusion in the apartments of the queen the advice was to be followed on the instant and ere sunset the litters and mules and other accommodation for the travellers waited their pleasure in the outer court it was with a mien of princely dignity a countenance grave and thoughtful with which the youthful seneschal attended the travellers to the great gate of the castle in after years the expression of his features flashed again and again upon those who looked upon him them calmly he bade his sisterinlaw farewell and bade her should she be the first to see his brother tell him that it was at her own free will and pleasure she thus departed that neither advice nor persuasion on his part had been used she had of her own will released him from his sacred charge and if ill came of it to free his memory from blame trust me nigel oh surely you may trust me you will not part from me in anger at my wilfulness entreated margaret as clinging to his arm she retained him a few minutes ere he placed her in the litter in anger my sweet sister nay thou wrongest me he said a bright smile dispersing a moment the pensive cast of his features in sorrow perchance for i love not him to whose care thou hast committed thyself yet if ill await this castle and thou wert with me twould enhance its bitterness no tis better thou shouldst go though i would it were not to the lord of ross and wherefore demanded the deep stern voice of the officer beside him because i doubt him archibald macfarlane sternly replied the young nobleman fixing his flashing eyes upon him and thou mayst so inform him an thou wilt an i do him wrong let him deliver the queen of scotland and her attendants in safety to king robert in the forthcoming spring and nigel bruce will crave forgiveness for the wrong that he hath done him nay let his conduct give my doubts the lie and i will even thank him sir turning on his heel he conducted the queen to her litter and bade a graceful farewell to all her fair companions bidding good angels speed them on their way the heavy gates were thrown back the portcullis raised and the drawbridge lowered and amid a parting cheer from the menatarms drawn up in the court in military homage to their queen the cavalcade departed attended only by the men of ross for the number of the garrison was too limited to admit of their attendance anywhere save within and on the walls with folded arms and an anxious brow sir nigel stood beside the gate marking the progress of the train a gentle voice aroused him it playfully said come to the highest turret nigel there thou wilt trace their path as long as light remains he started for agnes was at his side he drew her arm within his own briefly gave the command to close the gate and make all secure and turned with her in the direction of the keep have i done right he said as when they had reached a more retired path he folded his arm caressingly around her and drew her closer to him to list thy pleadings dearest to grant thy boon oh if they go to safety why did i listen to thee and permit thee to remain nay there is equal safety within these walls nigel be assured thine agnes hath neither regret nor doubt when thou art by her side she answered still playfully i love not the sanctuaries they go to seek the stout hearts and trusty blades of warriors like thee and thine my nigel are better and truer safeguards alas agnes i fear me not in cases such as these i am not wont to be desponding but from the small number of true men which garrison this castle i care not to acknowledge i had loved better to meet my foe on open ground here i can scarce know friend from foe traitors may be around me nay in my very confidence and i know it not art thou not infected with queen margarets suspicions nigel why ponder on such uneasy dreams because my best love i am a better adept in the perusal of mens countenances and manners than many and there are signs of lowering discontent and gloomy cowardice arguing ill for unity of measures on which our safety greatly rests yet my fancies may be wrong and at all hazards my duty shall be done the issue is in the hands of a higher power we cannot do wrong in committing ourselves to him for thou knowest he giveth not the battle to the strong and right and justice we have on scotlands side agnes looked on his face and she saw though he spoke cheerfully his thoughts echoed not his words she would not express her own anxiety but led him gently to explain to her his plan of defence and prepare her for all she might have to encounter five days passed and all within and without the walls remained the same the sixth was the sabbath and the greater part of the officers and garrison were assembled in the chapel where divine service was regularly read by the abbot of scone whom we should perhaps before have mentioned as having at the kings especial request accompanied the queen and her attendants to kildrummie it was a solemn yet stirring sight that little edifice filled as it was with steelclad warriors and rude and dusky forms now bending in one prayer before their god the proud the lowly the faithless and the true the honorable and the base the warrior whose whole soul burned and throbbed but for his country and his king the coward whose only thought was how he could obtain life for himself and save the dread of war by the surrender of the castleone and all knelt there the workings of those diverse hearts known but to him before whom they bent strangely and mournfully did that little group of delicate females gleam forth amidst the darker and harsher forms around as a knot of fragile flowers blooming alone and unsheltered amidst some rude old forest trees safe in their own lowliness from the approaching tempest but liable to be overwhelmed in the fall of their companions whom yet they would not leave as calmly as in his own abbey the venerable abbot read the holy service and administered the rites of religion to all who sought it was in the deep silence of individual prayer which preceded the chanting of the conclusion of the service that a shrill peculiar blast of a trumpet was heard on the instant it was recognized as the bugle of the warder stationed on the centre turret of the keep as the blast which told the foe was at length in sight once twice thrice it sounded at irregular intervals even as nigel had commanded the notes were caught up by the warders on the walls and repeated again and again a sudden cry of the foe broke from the soldiers scattered round and again all was silence there had been a movement almost a confusion in some parts of the church but the officers and those who had followed them from the mountains neither looted up nor stirred the imperative gesture of the abbot commanded and retained order and silence the service proceeded there might have been some faltering in the tones of the choir but the swelling notes of the organ concealed the deficiency the eye of agnes voluntarily sought her betrothed his head was still bent down in earnest prayer but she had not looked long before she saw him raise it and lift up his clasped hands in the evident passionate fervor of his prayer so beautiful so gloriously beautiful was that countenance thus breathing prayer so little seemed that soul of earth that tears started to the eyes of agnes and the paleness of strong emotion overspread the cheek aye and the quivering lip which the war and deathspeaking trumpet had had no power to disturb let me abide by him merciful father in weal or in woe oh part us not she prayed again and yet again and the bright smile which now encircled his lipsfor he had caught her glanceseemed an answer to her prayer it was a beautiful though perhaps to many of the inmates of kildrummie a terrible sight which from the roof of the turret now presented itself to their view the english force lay before them presenting many a solid phalanx of steel many a glancing wood of spears nor were these all the various engines used in sieges at this time batteringrams and others whose technical names are unfortunately lost to us but used to fling stones of immense weight to an almost incredible distance arbalists and the incomparable archer who carried as many lives as arrows in his belt wagons heavily laden with all things necessary for a close and numerous encampmentall these could be plainly distinguished in rapid advance towards the castle marking their path through the country by the smoke of the hamlets they had burned many and eager voices resounded in various parts of the castle numbers had thronged to the tower with their own eyes to mark the approach of the enemy and to report all they had seen to their companions below triumphantly or despondingly according to the temper of their minds sir nigel bruce and sir christopher seaton with others of the superior officers stood a little apart conversing eagerly and animatedly and finally separating with an eager grasp of the hand to perform the duties intrusted to each ha christine and thou fair maiden exclaimed sir christopher gayly as on turning he encountered his wife and agnes arminarm by mine honor this is bravely done ye will not wait in your tiringbower till your knights seek ye but come for information yourselves well tis a goodly company ist not as gallant a show as ever mustered by my troth those english warriors tacitly do us honor and proclaim our worth by the numbers of gallant men they bring against us we shall return the compliment some day and pay them similar homage his wife smiled at his jest and even felt reassured for it was not the jest of a mind ill at ease it was the same bluff soldier spirit she had always loved and nigel what thinkest thou think dearest he said answering far more the appealing look of agnes than her words think that we shall do well aye nobly well they muster not half the force they led me to expect the very sight of them has braced me with new spirit and put to ignominious flight the doubts and dreams i told thee had tormented me movement and bustle now pervaded every part of the castle but all was conducted with an order and military skill that spoke well for the officers to whom it was intrusted the walls were manned pickaxes and levers for the purposes of hurling down stones on the besiegers collected and arranged on the walls arms polished and so arranged that the hand might grasp them at a minutes warning were brought from the armory to every court and tower the granaries and storehouses were visited and placed under trustworthy guards a band of picked men under an experienced officer threw themselves into the barbacan determined to defend it to the last sir nigel and sir christopher visited every part of the outworks displaying the most unceasing care encouraged the doubting roused the timid and cheered and inspired the boldest with new confidence new hope but one feeling appeared to predominateliberty and scotland seemed the watchword of one and all onward like a mighty river rolled the english force nearer and nearer till the middle of the second day saw them encamped within a quarter of a mile from the palisades and outworks raised on either side of the barbacan obtaining easy possession of the riverfor sir nigel aware of the great disparity of numbers had not even attempted its defencethey formed three distinct bodies round the walls the strongest and noblest setting down before the barbacan as the principal point of attack numerous as they had appeared in the distance well provided with all that could forward their success it was not till closer seen all their strength could be discovered but there was no change in the hopes and gallant feelings of the scottish officers and their menatarms though could hearts have been read the timidity the doubts the anxious wishes to make favorable peace with the english had in some of the original garrison alarmingly increased before however any recourse was made to arms an english herald properly supported demanded and obtained admission within the gates on a mission from the earls of hereford and lancaster to sir christopher seaton sir nigel bruce and others of command they were summoned to deliver up the castle and themselves to their liege lord and sovereign king edward to submit to his mercy and grace should be shown to them and safe conduct granted to all those who taking refuge within the walls and adopting a position of defence proclaimed themselves rebels and abettors of rebellion that they should have freedom to return to their homes uninjured not only in their persons but in their belongings and this should be on the instant the gates were thrown open and the banner of england had taken the place of that of scotland now floating from their keep tell thy master thou smoothtongued knave burst angrily from the lips of sir christopher seaton as he half rose from his seat and clenched his mailed hand at the speaker and then hastily checking himself added in a lower tone answer him nigel thou hast eloquence at thy command i have none save at my swords point and my temper is somewhat too hot to list such words courteous though they may be tell your master sir herald continued nigel rising as his colleague flung himself back on his seat and though his voice was sternly calm his manner was still courteous tell them they may spare themselves the trouble and their followers the danger of all further negotiation we are scottish men and scottish subjects and consequently to all the offers of england we are as if we heard not neither rebels nor abettors of rebels we neither acknowledge the necessity of submitting ourselves to a tyrants mercy nor desire the advantage of his offered grace return sir herald we scorn the conditions proposed we are here for scotland and for scotlands king and for them we know both how to live and how to die his words were echoed by all around him and there was a sharp clang of steel as if each man half drew his eager sword which spoke yet truer than mere words dark brows and features stern were bent upon the herald as he left their presence and animated council followed his departure no new movement followed the return of the herald for some days no decisive operation was observable in the english force and when they did attack the outworks it was as if more to pass the time than with any serious intent it was a period of fearful suspense to the besieged their storehouses were scarcely sufficiently provided to hold out for any great length of time and they almost imagined that to reduce them to extremities by famine was the intention of the besiegers the greatest danger if encountered hand to hand in the melee was welcome but the very idea of a slow lingering fate with the enemy before them mocking their misery was terrible to the bravest a daring sally into the very thickest of the enemys camp headed by nigel and his own immediate followers carrying all before them and when by numbers compelled to retreat bearing both booty and prisoners with them roused the english from their confident supposition that the besieged would soon be obliged to capitulate and urged them into action the ire of the haughty english blazed up at what seemed such daring insolence in their petty foe decisive measures were resorted to on the instant and increased bustle appeared to pervade both besiegers and besieged pity thou art already a knight nigel bluffly exclaimed seaton springing into his saddle by torchlight the following morning as with a gallant band he was about dashing over the drawbridge to second the defenders of the barbacan and palisades how shall we reward thee my boy thou hast brought the foe to bay hark they are there before me and he spurred on to the very centre of the melee sir nigel was not long after him the enemy was driven back with fearful loss scalingladders were thrown down the archers on the walls better accustomed to their ground marking their foes by the torches they carried but concealed themselves by the darkness dealt destruction with as unerring hand as their more famous english brethren shouts and cries rose on either side the english bore back before the sweeping stroke of nigel bruce as before the scythe of death for the brief space of an hour the strife lasted and still victory was on the side of the scotsglorious victory purchased with scarce the loss of ten men the english fled back to their camp leaving many wounded and dead on the field and some prisoners in the hands of the scots ineffectual efforts were made to harass the scots as with a daring coolness seldom equalled they repaired the outworks and planted fresh palisades to supply those which had fallen in the strife in the very face of the english many of them coolly detaching the arrows which shot at too great distance could not penetrate the thick lining of their buff coats and scornfully flinging them back several sharp skirmishes took place that day both under the walls and at a little distance from them but in all the scots were victorious and when night fell all was joy and triumph in the castle shame confusion and fury in the english camp for several days this continued if at any time the english by superiority of numbers were victorious they were sure to be taken by surprise by an impetuous sally from the besieged and beaten back with loss and so sudden and concealed were the movements of nigel and seaton that though the besiegers lay closer and closer round the castle the moment of their setting forth on their daring expeditions could never be discovered said i not we should do well right well sweet agnes exclaimed nigel one night on his return from an unusually successful sally and are not my words true hast thou looked forth on the field today and seen how gloriously it went oh to resign this castle to my brothers hands unscathed even as he intrusted it to hold it for him threatened as it is he smiled gayly as he spoke for the consciousness of power was upon himpower to will and do to win and to retainthat most blessed consciousness whether it bless a heros breast or poets soul a maidens heart or scholars dream this checkered world can know i did look forth my nigel for i could not rest yet ask me not to tell thee how the battle went she added with a faint flush as she looked up in his noble face beaming as it was with every feeling dear to the heart that loved for i traced but the course of one charger saw but the waving of one plume and thou didst not fear the besiegers arrows my beloved didst stand in the shelter i contrived thou must not risk danger dearest better not list the urgings of thy noble spirit than be aught exposed there was no danger nigel at least there seemed none she said i felt no fear for i looked on thee chapter xviii had the gallant defenders of kildrummie castle been conscious that the at first dilatory and then uncertain measures of their foes originated in the fact that the earls of hereford and lancaster were not themselves yet on the field and that they had with them a vast addition to their forces they would not perhaps have rested so securely on the hopes which their unexpected success very naturally engendered attack on one side they knew they could resist their only dread had been that from the numbers of the english the angle towers each of which covered a postern might be attacked at once and thus discover the real weakness of their forces the obstinate struggle for the barbacan the strongest point of the castle had been welcomed with joy by the scotch for there they could overlook every movement of the besiegers some wonder it did cause that such renowned knights as the earls were known to be should not endeavor to throw them off their guard by a division of attack but this wonder could not take from the triumph of success it was from no want of observation the absence of the two earls remained undiscovered by the besieged engaged on a secret expedition whose object will be seen in the sequel they had commanded the message demanding surrender to be given in their names their pavilions to be pitched in sight of the castle as if they were already there their banners to wave above them esquires and pages to be in attendance and their warcries to be shouted as was the custom when they led on in person the numerous knights clothed in bright armor from head to heel ever traversing the field assisted the illusion and the scotch never once suspected the truth imagining a very brief struggle would deliver the castle into their hands even if its garrison were mad enough to refuse compliance with king edwards terms the earls had not hurried themselves on their expedition and a fortnight after the siege had begun were reposing themselves very cavalierly in the stronghold of an angloscottish baron some thirty miles southward of the scene of action it was the hour of supper a rude repast of venison interspersed with horn and silver flagons filled with the strong liquors of the day and served up in a rude hall of which the low round arches in the roof the massive walls without buttresses and windows running small outside but spreading as to become much larger within all denoted the saxon architecture unsoftened by any of the norman improvements the earls and their host with some attendant knights sat as usual round the dais or raised part of the hall their table distinguished it may be by some gold as well as silver vessels and a greater variety of liquor particularly hypocras and claret of the day the one formed of wine and honey the other of wine and spices by the sinnel and wastel cakes but certainly not by the superior refinement of the more solid food the huge silver saltcellar alone divided the table of the baron from that of his dependants yet the distinction of sitting above and below the salt was as great as the division between the master and servant of the present day the jest the loud laugh seasoned the viands placed before them and the hearty draught from the welcome flagon nor was the barons own table much quieter remarks on the state of the country speculations as to the hidingplace of king robert and when they should receive tidings of the surrender of kildrummie formed topics of conversation alternately with discussions on the excellence of the wines the flavor of the venison the difference between english and scottish cookery and such like matters important in the days of our ancestors as in our own you have ridden long enough today good my lords to make a hearty charge on your suppers a long journey and a tough battle commend me to them for helps to the appetite said the scottish baron joyously inviting them by his own example to eat on and spare not commend me to the latter an ye will answered hereford on whose brow a cloud of something like distaste had spread but by mine honor i love not the business of the last week i have brought it to a close however and praise the saints for it bah thou art oversqueamish hereford edward would give us the second best jewel in his chaplet for the rich prize we have sent him resumed lancaster reserving the first of course for the traitor bruce himself interposed their host ah such a captive were in truth worth an earldom then by my troth the traitors wife is worth a barony returned lancaster laughing and her fair bevy of attendants amongst whom are the wives daughters and sisters of many a rebel thinkest thou not we shall be high in edwards favor for them too i tell thee we might have fought many a good fight and not have done him such good service it may be it may be answered hereford impatiently had it been at the swords point had they been prisoners by force of arms i would have joyed too and felt it was good service but such rank treachery decoyed entrapped by that foul prince of lies the lord of rossfaugh i could have rammed his treachery back into his throat and done the king perchance good service too rejoined lancaster still excessively amused for i have no faith in a traitor however he may serve us a while yet thou art not overwise good friend to let such trifles chafe thee thus trust me edward will think more of the captives than the capture there was a time he would not answered the earl mournfully a time when edward would have held it foul scorn to war with women and worse than scorn to obtain their persons by treachery as now aye but he has changed and we must change too would we please him said the baron such notions might have done in former days but they are too highflown for the present time my good lord i marvel they should have lingered so long with thee a frown gathered on herefords broad and noble brow but remembering the forbearance due to his host he checked an angry reply the king has changed he said darkly and painfully changed ambition has warped the noblest knightliest heart which ever beat for chivalry hush ere thou speakest treason sir earl give me not the pain of draining another flagon of this sparkling hypocras to gain strength for thine arrest good friend exclaimed lancaster laying the flat of his sword on the earls shoulder hereford half smiled thou art too happy in thy lighthearted mirth for me to say aught that would so disturb it he said yet i say and will say again would to heaven i had been before the gates of kildrummie and left to thee all the honor and glory an thou wilt of this capture honor and glory thou bitter piece of satire rejoined lancaster holding up a large golden flagon to hide his face from the earl unhappy me were this all the glory i could win i will wipe away the stain if stain there be at kildrummie an it be not surrendered ere we reach it the stain is with the base traitor ross not with thee or me answered hereford tis that i abhor the nature of such expeditions that i loathe aye loathe communication with such as he and thatif it can bethat worse traitor buchan that makes me rejoice i have naught before me now but as fair a field as a siege may be would to god this devastating and most cruel war were over i do say on a fair field it may be borne but not to war with women and children as has been my fate aye by the way this is not the first fair prize thou hast sent to edward the countess of buchan was a rare jewel for our coveting monarchsomewhat more than possession there was room for vengeance there bore she her captivity more queenly than the sobbing and weeping margaret the question was reiterated by most of the knights around the dais but hereford evidently shrunk from the inquiry speak not of it i charge ye he said there is no room for jesting on grief as hers majestic and glorious she was but if the reported tale be true her every thought her every feeling was as i even then imagined swallowed up in one tearless and stern but allengrossing anguish the reported tale meanest thou the fate of her son asked one of the knights if it be true resumed another believest thou my lord there is aught of hope to prove it false more likely to be true than false added lancaster i can believe any thing of that dark scowling villain buchaneven the murder of his child i believe it not answered hereford bad as that man is hard in heart as in temper he has too much policy to act thus even if he had no feelings of nature rising to prevent it no no i would wager the ruby brooch in my helmet that boy lives and his father will make use of him to forward his own interests yet but why then forge this tale demanded their host how may that serve his purpose easily enough with regard to the vengeance we all know he vowed to wreak on his unhappy wife what deeper misery could he inflict upon her than the belief her boy was murdered and as for its effect on edward trust a comyn to make his own way clear but what do with the boy meanwhile keep him under lock and key chained up may be as a dog in a kennel till he has broken his high spirit and moulds him to the tool he wills answered hereford or at least till his mother is out of his path ha thinkest thou the king will demand such sweeping vengeance he surely will not sentence a woman to death had i thought so had i only dreamed so replied hereford with almost startling sternness as there is a god above us i would have risked the charge of treason and refused to give her up but no my lords no changed as edward is he would not he dared not use his power thus i meant but imprisonment when i said out of the boys pathmore he will not do but even such i love not bold as it was to crown the rebel bruce the deed sprung from a noble heart and noble deeds should meet with noble judgment a bugle sounded twice or thrice sharply without and occasioning some bustle at the lower part of the ball interrupted for a brief space the converse of the lords a few minutes after the seneschal attended by two or three higher servants returned marshalling in due form two young men in the garb of esquires followed by some fifteen or twenty menatarms ha fitzernest and hugo well met and ye bring us good tidings from kildrummie exclaimed both the english earls at once as cap in hand the esquires slowly walked up the hall and did obeisance to their masters yet your steps are somewhat laggard as they bring us news of victory by my troth were it not utterly impossible i could deem ye had been worsted in the strife continued the impatient lancaster while the cooler and more sagacious hereford scanned the countenances of the esquires in silence yet and ye come not to tell of victory why have ye come at all to beseech your lordships speedy return to the camp replied fitzernest after a moments hesitation his cheek still flushed from his masters words there is division of purpose and action in the camp and an ye not return and head the attack your noble selves i fear me there is little hope of victory peace fool is there such skill and wisdom needed division in purpose and action quarrelling methinks had better be turned against the enemy than against yourselves hugo do thou speak in plain terms wherefore come ye in plain terms then good my lord as yet we have had the worst of it answered the esquire bluntly the scotch fight like very devils attacking us instead of waiting for our attack penetrating into the very centre of our camp one knows not how or whence bearing off prisoners and booty in our very teeth prisonersbootyworsted thou durst not tell me so exclaimed lancaster furiously as he started up and half drew his sword peace peace i pray thee good friend peace continued hereford laying his hand on lancasters shoulder with a force which compelled him to resume his seat let us at least hear and understand their mission speak out hugo and brieflywhat has befallen in a few straightforward words his esquire gave all the information which was needed interrupted only now and then by a brief interrogation from hereford and some impatient starts and muttering from his colleague the success of the scots described in a former page had continued despite the action of the mangonels and other engines which the massive walls appeared to hold in defiance so watchful and skilful were the besieged that the greatest havoc had been made amongst the men employed in working the engines and not yet had even the palisades and barbacan been successfully stormed have they tried any weaker point hereford asked and the answer was that it was on this very matter division had spread amongst the knights some insisting on carrying the barbacan as the most important point and others advising and declaring their only hope of success lay in a divided attack on two of the weaker sides at once the fools the sorry fools burst again from lancaster they deserve to be worsted for their inordinate pride and folly all wanted to lead and none would follow give you good een my lord he added turning hastily to his host ill to the courtyard and muster forth my men fitzernest thou shalt speak on as we go and drawing his furred mantle around him he strode rapidly yet haughtily from the hall hereford only waited to learn all from hugo to hold a brief consultation with some of his attendant knights and he too despite the entreaties of his host to tarry with him at least till morning left the banquet to don his armor silence and speed carry all before them my good lord he said courteously in such a case though i fear no eventual evil they must not be neglected i would change the mode of attack on these scotch ere they are even aware their foes are reinforced eventual evil of a truth there need not be my lord interposed his esquire even should no force of arms prevail i have heard there are some within the walls who need but a golden bribe to do the work for us peace said the nobleman sternly i loathe the very word betrayspoken or intended shame shame on thee to speak it and yet more shame to imagine it needed art thou of norman birth and deemest a handful of scotch like these will bid us raise the siege and tamely departyet better so than gained by treachery hugo and the scottish baron alike shrunk back from the reproving look of hereford and both silently followed him to the courtyard already it was a scene of bustling animation trumpets were sounding and drums rolling torches flashing through the darkness on the mailed coats of the knights and on gleaming weapons and the heavy tramp of near two hundred horse hastily accoutred and led from the stable mingled with the hoarse winds of winter howling tempestuously around the reserve which hereford had retained to guard the prisoners so treacherously delivered over to him was composed of the noblest amidst his army almost all mounted chevaliers and therefore though he might not add much actual force to the besiegers the military skill and experience which that little troop included argued ill for the besieged some of the heaviest engines he had kept back also particularly a tower some four or five stories high so constructed that it could be rolled to the walls and its inmates ascend unscathed by the weapons of their defenders not imagining it would be needed he had not sent it on with the main body but now he commanded twelve of the strongest horses to be yoked to it and on went the unwieldy engine rumbling and staggering on its illformed wheels lancaster whose impatience no advice could ever control dashed on with the first troop leaving his cooler comrade to look to the yoking of the engines and the marshalling the men and with his own immediate attendants bringing up the rear a task for which herefords selfcommand as well fitted him as his daring gallantry to head the foremost charge ye will have a rough journey my good lord yet an ye deem it best farewell and heaven speed ye was the parting greeting of the baron as he stood beside the impatient charger of the earl the rougher the better was that noblemans reply the noise of the wind will conceal our movements better than a calmer night farewell and thanksa soldiers thanks my lord poor yet honestfor thy right noble welcome he bent his head courteously set spurs to his steed and dashed over the drawbridge as the last of his men disappeared through the outer gate the scottish nobleman looked after him with many mingled feelings as noble a warrior as ever breathed he muttered it were honor to serve under him yet an he wants me not i will not join him i love not the bruce yet uncalled unneeded i will not raise sword against my countrymen and with slow and equal steps he returned to the hall hereford was correct in his surmises the pitchy darkness of a winter night would scarcely have sufficed to hide the movements attendant on the sudden arrival of a large body of men in the english camp had not the hoarse artillery of the wind moaning sweeping and then rushing oer the hills with a crashing sound like thunder completely smothered every other sound and if at intervals of quiet unusual sounds did attract the ears of those eager watchers on the scottish walls the utter impossibility of kindling torches or fires in either camp frustrated every effort of discovery hoarser and wilder grew the whirlwind with the waning hours till even the steelclad menatarms stationed on the walls moved before it and were compelled to crouch down till its violence had passed favored by the elements hereford proceeded to execute his measures heedless alike of the joyful surprise his sudden appearance occasioned and of the tale of division and discord which hugo and fitzernest had reported as destroying the unity of the camp briefly and sternly refusing audience to each who pressed forward eager to exculpate himself at the expense of his companions he desired his esquire to proclaim a general amnesty to all who allowed themselves to have been in error and would henceforth implicitly obey his commands he returned to his pavilion with the earl of lancaster summoning around him the veterans of the army and a brief consultation was held they informed him the greatest mischief had been occasioned by the injuries done to the engines which had been brought to play against the walls stones of immense weight had been hurled upon them materially injuring their works and attended with such fatal slaughter to the men who worked them that even the bravest shrunk back appalled that the advice of the senior officers had been to hold back until these engines were repaired merely keeping strict guard against unexpected sallies on the part of the scotch as this would not only give them time to recruit their strength but in all probability throw the besieged off their guard not above half of the army however agreed with this counsel the younger and less wary spurned it as cowardice and folly and rushing on to the attack illformed and illconducted had ever been beaten back with immense loss defeat however instead of teaching prudence lashed them into greater fury which sometimes turned upon each other hereford listened calmly yet with deep attention now and then indeed turning his expressive eyes towards his colleague as if entreating him to observe that the mischief which had befallen them proceeded greatly from impetuosity and imprudence and beseeching his forbearance nor was lancaster regardless of this silent appeal conscious of his equality with hereford in bravery and nobleness he disdained not to acknowledge his inferiority to him in that greater coolness which in a siege is so much needed and grasping his hand with generous fervor bade him speak advise command and he would find no one in the camp more ready to be counselled and to obey than lancaster to tear down those rebel colors and raise those of england in their stead was all he asked and fear not that task shall be other than thine own my gallant friend was herefords instant reply his features kindling at lancasters words more than they had done yet and then again quickly resuming his calm unimpassioned exterior he inquired if the mangonels and other engines were again fit for use there were several that could instantly be put in action was the reply had the numbers of fighting men within the castle been ascertained they had a veteran answered from a prisoner who had appeared so willing to give information that his captors imagined there were very many malcontents within the walls of stalwart fighting men there were scarcely more than three hundred others there were of whose number was the prisoner who fought because their companions swords would else have been at their throats but that they would be glad enough to be made prisoners to escape the horrors of the siege i am sorry for it was the earls sole rejoinder there will be less glory in the conquest and this sir nigel bruce whoeer he be hath to combat against fearful odds remarked lancaster and these scotchmen by my troth seem touched by the hoof of the archdeceivertreachery from the earl to the peasant hast noticed how this scion of the bruce bears himselfright gallantly tis said as a very devil my lord impetuously answered a knight in the walls or out of them theres no standing before him he sweeps down his foes line after line as cards blown before the wind he is at the head of every charge the last of each retreat but yesternight there were those who marked him covering the retreat of his men absolutely alone his sword struck down two at every sweep till his passage was cleared he darted onthe drawbridge trembled in its groovesfor he had given the command to raise it despite his own dangerhis charger mad as himself sprang forward and like a lightning flash both disappeared within the portcullis as the bridge uprose gallantly done exclaimed lancaster who had listened to this recital almost breathlessly by st george a foe worthy to meet and struggle with but who is hewhat is he knowest thou not said hereford surprised the brother youngest brother i have heard of this same daring earl of carrick who has so troubled our sovereign nigel the brother of robert what the scribe the poet the dreamer of edwards court a poor youth with naught but his beauty to recommend him by all good angels this metamorphosis soundeth strangely art sure tis the same the very same i have heard so was herefords quiet reply and continuing his more important queries with the veterans around while lancaster his gayer spirit roused by this account of nigel demanded every minute particular concerning him that he might seek him hand to hand steel armor inlaid with silverblue scarf across his breast embroidered with his cognizance in goldblue plume which no english sword hath ever soiledhumph thats reserved for mecharger white as the snow on the groundsits his steed as man and horse were one well gloriously well there will be no lack of glory here he said joyously as one by one he slowly enumerated the symbols by which he might recognize his foe so expeditiously had hereford conducted his wellarranged plans that when his council was over it still wanted two hours to dawn and these hereford commanded the men who had accompanied him to pass in repose but he himself partook not of this repose passing the remainder of the darkness in carefully reviewing the forces which were still fresh and prepared for the onset in examining the nature of the engines and finally still aided by the noise of the howling winds marshalled them in formidable array in very front of the barbacan the heavy mist thrown onward by the blasts effectually concealing their near approach to lancaster the command of this party was intrusted hereford reserving to himself the desirable yet delicate task of surveying the ground confident that the attack on the barbacan would demand the whole strength and attention of the besieged and thus effectually cover his movements his plan succeeded a fearful shout seconded by a tremendous discharge of huge stones some of which rattled against the massive walls in vain others flying across the moat and crushing some of the men on the inner wall were the first terrific sounds which unexpectedly greeted the aroused attention of the scotch the armor of their foes flashing through the mist the furious charge of the knights up to the very gates of the barbacan seemingly in sterner and more compact array than of late had been their wont the immense body which followed them appearing in that dim light more numerous than reality struck a momentary chill on the scottish garrison but the unwonted emotion was speedily dissipated by the instant and unhesitating sally of sir christopher seaton and his brave companions the impetuosity of their charge the suddenness of their appearance despite their great disparity of numbers caused the english a moment to bear back and kept them in full play until nigel and his menatarms rushing over the lowered drawbridge joined in the strife a brief very brief interval of fighting convinced both the scottish leaders that a masterspirit now headed their foes that they were struggling at infinitely greater odds than before that unity of purpose greater sagacity and military skill were now at work against them they scarce knew wherefore for they recognized the same warcry the same banners there were the same gallant show of knights for in the desperate melee it was scarcely possible to distinguish the noble form of lancaster from his fellows although marking the azure plume which even then waved high above all others though round it the work of death ever waxed hottest the efforts of the english earl were all bent to meet its gallant wearer hand to hand but the press of war still held them apart though both seemed in every part of the field it was a desperate struggle man to man the clash of swords became one strange continuous mass of sound instead of the fearful distinctness which had marked their work before shouts and cries mingled fearfully with the sharper clang the heavy fall of man and horse the creaking of the engines the wild shrieks of the victims within the walls mangled by the stones or from the survivors who witnessed their fallall formed a din as terrific to hear as dreadful to behold with even more than their wonted bravery the scotch fought but with less success the charge of the english was no longer the impetuous fury of a few hotheaded young men more eager to despite their cooler advisers than gain any permanent good for themselves now as one man fell another stepped forward in his place and though the slaughter might have been equal nay greater on the side of the besiegers than the besieged by one it was scarcely felt by the other the death of each man was even as the loss of a host still still they struggled on the english obtaining possession of the palisades though the immense strength of the barbacan itself defended as it was by the strenuous efforts of the scotch still resisted all attack bravely nobly the besieged retreated within their walls pellmell their foes dashed after them and terrific was the combat on the drawbridge which groaned and creaked beneath the heavy tramp of man and horse many wrestling in the fierceness of mortal strife fell together in the moat and encumbered with heavy armor sunk in each others arms in the grim clasp of death then it was lancaster met hand to hand the gallant foe he sought covering the retreat of his men who were bearing sir christopher seaton desperately wounded to the castle sir nigel stood wellnigh alone on the bridge his bright armor his foaming charger bore evident marks of the fray but still he rode his steed firmly and unbent his plume yet waved untouched by the foemans sword nearer and nearer pressed forward the english earl signing to his men to secure without wounding his gallant foe round him they closely gathered but nigel evinced no sign either of trepidation or anger fearlessly gallantly he returned the earls impetuous charge backing his steed slowly as he did so and keeping his full front to his foe on on pressed lancaster even to the postern a bound a shout and scarcely was he aware that his sword had ceased to cross with nigels before he was startled by the heavy fall of the portcullis effectually dividing them and utterly frustrating further pursuit a cry of rage of disappointment broke from the english as they were compelled to turn and rejoin their friends the strife still continued within and without the barbacan and ended without much advantage on either side the palisades and outward barriers had indeed fallen into the hands of the english which was the first serious loss yet sustained by the besieged from the barbacan they had gallantly and successfully driven their foe but that trifling success was so counterbalanced by the serious loss of life amid the garrison which it included that both nigel and sir christopher felt the next attack must deliver it into the hands of the besiegers their loss of men was in reality scarcely a third of the number which had fallen among the english yet to them that loss was of infinitely more consequence than to the foe bitter and painful emotions filled the noble spirit of nigel as he gazed on the diminished number of his men and met the illsuppressed groans and lamentations of those who had at the first alarm of the english sought shelter and protection in the castle their illsuppressed entreaties that he would struggle no longer against such odds grated harshly and ominously on his ear but sternly he turned from them to the menatarms and in their steadfast bravery and joyous acclamations found some degree of hope yet ere the day closed the besieged felt too truly their dreams of triumph of final success little short of a miracle would realize their fancy that some new and mightier spirit of generalship was at work within the english camp was confirmed two distinct bodies were observed at work on the eastern and southern sides of the mount the one evidently employed in turning aside the bed of the river which on that side flowed instead of the moat beneath the wall the other in endeavoring to fill up the moat by a causeway so as to admit of an easy access to the outer wall the progress they had made in their work the first day while the attention of the scotch had been confined to the attack on the barbacan was allsufficient evidence of their intent and with bitter sorrow sir nigel and his brotherinlaw felt that their only means of any efficient defence lay in resigning the longcontested barbacan to the besiegers an important point it certainly was but still to retain it the walls overlooking the more silent efforts of the english must be left comparatively unguarded and they might obtain an almost uninterrupted and scarcecontested passage within the walls while the whole strength and attention of the besieged were employed as had already been the case on a point that they had scarce a hope eventually to retain with deep and bitter sorrow the alternative was proposed and carried in a hurried council of war and so well acted upon that despite the extreme watchfulness of the english men treasure arms and artillery all that the strong towers contained were conveyed at dead of night over the drawbridge into the castle and the following morning lancaster in utter astonishment took possession of the deserted fort perhaps to both parties this resolution was alike a disappointment and restraint the english felt there was no glory in their prize they had not obtained possession through their own prowess and skill and now that the siege had become so much closer and this point of communication was entirely stopped the handtohand combat the glorious melee the press of war which to both parties had been an excitement and little more than warlike recreation had of course entirely ceased but hereford heeded not the disappointment of his men his plans were progressing as he had desired even though his workmen were greatly harassed by the continued discharge of arrows and immense stones from the walls the desertion of the barbacan was an allconvincing proof of the very small number of the garrison and though the immense thickness and solidity of the walls bespoke time patience and control the english earl never wavered from his purpose and by his firmness his personal gallantry his readilybestowed approbation on all who demanded it he contrived to keep his more impatient followers steadily to their task while nigel to prevent the spirits of his men from sinking would frequently lead them forth at night and by a sudden attack annoy and often cut off many of the men stationed within the barbacan the drawbridge was the precarious ground of many a midnight strife till the daring gallantry of nigel bruce became the theme of every tongue a gallantry equalled only by the consummate skill which he displayed in retreating within his entrenchments frequently without the loss of a single man either as killed or wounded often would sir christopher seaton whose wounds still bound him a most unwilling prisoner to his couch entreat him to avoid such rash exposures of his life but nigel only answered him with a smile and an assurance he bore a charmed life which the sword of the foe could not touch the siege had now lasted six weeks and the position of both parties continued much as we have seen save that the bed of the river had now begun to appear promising a free passage to the english on the eastern side and on the south a broad causeway had stretched itself over the moat on which the towers for defending the ascent of the walls mangonels and other engines were already safely bestowed and all promised fair to the besiegers whose numerous forces scarcely appeared to have suffered any diminution although in reality some hundreds had fallen while on the side of the besieged although the walls were still most gallantly manned and the first efforts of the english to scale the walls had been rendered ineffectual by huge stones hurled down upon them still a look of greater care was observable on the brows of both officers and men and provisions had now begun to be doled out by weight and measure for though the granaries still possessed stores sufficient for some weeks longer the apparent determination of the english to permit no relaxation in their close attack demanded increase of caution on the part of the besieged about this time an event occurred which though comparatively trifling in itself when the lives of so many were concerned was fraught in effect with fatal consequences to all the inmates of kildrummie the conversation of the next chapter however will better explain it and to it we refer our readers chapter xix in a circular apartment of the lower floor in kildrummie keep its stone floor but ill covered with rushes and the walls hung with the darkest and rudest arras sir christopher seaton reclined on a rough couch in earnest converse with his brotherinlaw nigel lady seaton was also within the chamber at some little distance from the knights engaged in preparing lint and healing ointments with the aid of an attendant for the wounded and ready at the first call to rise and attend them as she had done unremittingly during the continuance of the siege the countenances of both warriors were slightly changed from the last time we beheld them the severity of his wounds had shed a cast almost of age on the noble features of seaton but care and deep regret had mingled with that pallor and perhaps on the face of nigel which three short weeks before had beamed forth such radiant hope the change was more painful he had escaped with but slight flesh wounds but disappointment and anxiety were now vividly impressed on his features the smooth brow would unconsciously wrinkle in deep and unexpressed thought the lip to which love joy and hope alone had once seemed natural now often compressed and his eye flashed till his whole countenance seemed stern not with the sternness of a tyrannical changed and chafing moodno twas the sternness most fearful to behold in youth of thought deep bitter whelming thought and sterner even than it had been yet was the expression on his features as he spoke this day with seaton he must die were the words which broke a long and anxious pause and fell in deep yet emphatic tones from the lips of seaton yes die perchance the example may best arrest the spreading contagion of treachery around us i know not i fear not yet as thou sayest he must die replied nigel speaking as in deep thought would that the noble enemy who thus scorned to benefit by the offered treason had done on him the work of death himself i love not the necessity nor the deed yet it must be nigel is there aught else save death the death of a traitor which can sufficiently chastise a crime like this well was it the knave craved speech of hereford himself i marvel whether the majesty of england had resisted a like temptation seaton he would not answered the young man i knew him aye studied him in his own court and though i doubt not there was a time when chivalry was strongest in the breast of edward it was before ambitions fatal poison had corroded his heart now he would deem all things honorable in the art of war aye even the delivery of a castle through the treachery of a knave and he hath more in yon host to think with him than with the noble hereford resumed sir christopher yet this is but idle parley and concerneth but little our present task in what temper do our men receive the tidings of this foul treason our own brave fellows call aloud for vengeance on the traitor nay had i not rescued him from their hands they would have torn him limb from limb in their rage but there are others seatonalas the more numerous body nowand they speak not but with moody brows and gloomy mutterings prowl up and down the courts aye the coward hearts answered seaton their good wishes went with him and but lowbreathed curses follow our efforts for their freedom yes it must be if it be but as a warning unto others see to it nigel an hour before the set of sun he dies a brief pause followed his words whose low sternness of tone betrayed far more than the syllables themselves both warriors remained a while plunged in moody thought which seaton was the first to break and how went the last attack and defence he asked they told me bravely aye so bravely that could we but reinforce our fighting men aided as we are by impenetrable walls we might dream still of conquest they have gained little as yet despite their nearer approach hand to hand we have indeed struggled on the walls and hurled back our foremost foes in their own intrenchments our huge fragments of rocks have dealt destruction on one of their towers crushing all who manned it beneath the ruins and i lie here when such brave work is going on beside me even as a bedridden monk or coward layman when my whole soul is in the fight said the knight bitterly and half springing from his couch when will these open woundsto the foul fiend with them and those who gave themwhen will they let me mount and ride again as best befits a warrior better slain at once than lie here a burden not a helptaking from those whose gallant efforts need it more the food we may not have for long i will not thus be chained ill to the action be my life the forfeit he sprung up and for a moment stood upon his feet but with a low groan of pain instantly fell back the dew of weakness gathering on his brow lady seaton was at his side on the instant to bathe his temples and his hands yet without one reproachful word for she knew the anguish it was to his brave heart to lie thus disabled when every loyal hand was needed for his country nigel i would that i might join thee remember tis no mean game we play we hold not out as marauding chieftains against a lawful king we struggle not in defence of petty rights of doubtful privileges tis for scotland for king robert still we strive did this castle hold out aye compel the foe to raise the siege much much would be done for scotland others would do as we have done many whose strongholds rest in english hands would rise and expel the foe had we but reinforcements of men and stores all might still be well aye answered nigel bitterly but with all scotland crushed neath english chains her king and his bold patriots fugitives and exiles ourselves the only scottish force in arms the only scottish castle which resists the tyrant how may this be whence may come increase of force of store seaton seaton thine are bright dreamswould that they were real wouldst thou then give up at once and strive no more it cannot be never answered his companion passionately ere english feet shall cross these courts and english colors wave above these towers the blood of the defenders must flow beneath their steps they gain not a yard of earth save at the bright swords point not a rood of grass unstained by scottish blood give up not till my arm can wield no sword my voice no more shout forward for the bruce then we will hope on dream on nigel and despair not replied seaton in the same earnest tone we know not yet what may be and improbable as it seems now succors may yet arrive how long doth last the truce for eighteen hours two of which have passed didst thou demand it no replied nigel it was proffered by the earl as needed for a strict examination of the traitor evan roy and accepted in the spirit with which it was offered thou didst well and the foul traitorwhere hast thou lodged him in the western turret strongly guarded i would not seek thy counsel until i had examined and knew the truth and thine own judgment was as thine it is an ill necessity yet it must be didst pronounce his sentence nigel answered in the affirmative and how was it received in the same sullen silence on the part of the criminal as he had borne during his examination methought a low murmur of discontent escaped from some within the hall but it was drowned in the shout of approbation from the menatarms and the execrations they lavished on the traitor as they bore him away so i heeded it not but thou wilt heed it said a sweet voice beside him and agnes who had just entered the chamber laid her hand on his arm and looked beseechingly in his face dearest nigel i come a pleader and for whom my beloved he asked his countenance changing into its own soft beautiful expression as he gazed on her what can mine agnes ask that nigel may not grant nay i am no pleader for myself she said i come on the part of a wretched wife and aged mother beseeching the gift of life and for a traitor agnes i think of him but as a husband and son dearest nigel she said more timidly for his voice was stern they tell me he is condemned to death and his wretched wife and mother besought my influence with thee and indeed it needed little entreaty for when death is so busy around us when in this fearful war we see the best and bravest of our friends fall victims every day oh i would beseech you to spare life when it may be dearest dearest nigel have mercy on this wretched man traitor as he is oh do not take his lifedo not let thy lips sentence him to death wilt thou not be merciful if the death of one man will preserve the lives of many how may that one be spared said sir nigel folding the sweet pleader closer to him though his features spoke no relaxation of his purpose sweet agnes do not ask this give me not the bitter pain of refusing aught to thee thou knowest not all the mischief and misery which pardon to a traitor such as this will do thou listenest only to thy kind heart and the sad pleadings of those who love this man now listen to me beloved and judge thyself did i believe a pardon would bring back the traitor to a sense of duty to a consciousness of his great crimedid i believe giving life to him would deter others from the same guilt i should scarce wait even for thy sweet pleading to give him both liberty and life but i know him better than thou mine agnes he is one of those dark discontented rebellious spirits that never rest in stirring up others to be like them who would employ even the life i gave him to my own destruction and that of the brave and faithful soldiers with me but send him hence dearest nigel still entreated agnes give him life but send him from the castle will not this remove the danger of his influence with others and give him field and scope to betray us yet again sweet one it were indeed scorning the honorable counsel of hereford to act thus for trust me agnes there are not many amid our foes would resist temptation as he hath done yet would not keeping him close prisoner serve thee as well as death nigel bethink thee would it not spare the ill of taking life dearest no he answered there are many alas too many within these walls who need an example of terror to keep them to their duty they will see that treachery avails not with the noble hereford and that discovered by me it hath no escape from death if this man be as i imagine in league with other contentious spiritsfor he could scarce hope to betray the castle into the hands of the english without some aid withinhis fate may strike such terror into other traitor hearts that their designs will be abandoned trust me dearest i do not do this deed of justice without deep regret i grieve for the necessity even as the deed and yet it must be and bitter as it is to refuse thee aught indeed i cannot grant thy boon yet hear me once more nigel simple and ignorant as i am i cannot answer such arguments as thine yet may it not be that this deed of justice even while it strikes terror may also excite the desire for revenge and situated as we are were it not better to avoid all such bitterness such heartburnings amongst the people we must brave it dearest answered nigel firmly the direct line of justice and of duty may not be turned aside for such fears as these nor do i think they have foundation continued sir christopher seaton thou hast pleaded well and kindly gentle maiden yet gladly as we would do aught to pleasure thee this that thou hast asked alas must not be the crime itself demands punishment and even could we pardon that duty to our country our king ourselves calls loudly for his death lest his foul treachery should spread the eyes of the maiden filled with tears then my last hope is over she said sadly i looked to thy influence sir christopher to plead for me even if mine own supplications should fail and thou judgest even as nigel not as my heart could wish we judge as men and soldiers gentle maiden as men who charged with a most solemn responsibility dare listen to naught save the voice of justice however loudly mercy pleads and didst thou think mine agnes if thy pleading was of no avail the entreaty of others could move me whispered nigel in a voice which though tender was reproachful dearest and best oh thou knowest not the pang it is to refuse thee even this and to feel my words have filled those eyes with tears say thou wilt not deem me cruel abiding by justice when there is room for mercy i know thee better than to judge thee thus answered agnes tearfully the voice of duty must have spoken loudly to urge thee to this decision and i may not dispute it yet would that death could be averted there was madness in that womans eyes and she shuddered as she spoke of whom speakest thou love nigel asked and seaton looked the question of his wife she replied she came to me distracted and used such dreadful words menaces and threats they seemed but his mother more composed assured me they meant nothing they were but the ravings of distress and yet i fear to look on her again without his pardon and thou shalt not my beloved these are not scenes and words for such as thee rest here with christine and good sir christopher to tend and cheer a wounded knight is a fitter task for thee sweet one than thus to plead a traitors cause pressing his lips upon her brow as he spoke he placed her gently on a settle by sir christopher then crossing the apartment he paused a moment to whisper to lady seaton look to her my dear sister she has been terrified though she would conceal it let her not leave thee till this fatal duty is accomplished lady seaton assured him of her compliance and he left the apartment he had scarcely quitted the postern before he himself encountered jean roy a woman who even in her mildest moments evinced very little appearance of sanity and who now from her furious and distracting gestures seemed wrought up to no ordinary pitch of madness she kept hovering round him uttering menaces and entreaties in one and the same breath declaring one moment that her husband was no traitor and had only done what every truehearted scotsman ought to do if he would save himself and those he loved from destruction the next piteously acknowledging his crime and wildly beseeching mercy for a while nigel endeavored calmly and soothingly to reason with her but it was of no avail louder and fiercer became her curses and imprecations beseeching heaven to hurl down all its maledictions upon him and the woman he loved and refuse him mercy when he most needed it perceiving her violence becoming more and more outrageous nigel placed her in charge of two of his menatarms desiring them to treat her kindly but not to lose sight of her and keep her as far as possible from the scene about to be enacted she was dragged away struggling furiously and nigel felt his heart sink heavier within him it was not that he wavered in his opinion that he believed situated as he was it was better to spare the traitors life than excite to a flame the already aroused and angered populace he thought indeed terror might do much but whether it was the entreating words of agnes or the state of the unhappy jean there had come upon him a dim sense of impending ill an impression that the act of justice about to be performed would bring matters to a crisis and the ruin of the garrison be consummated ere he was aware it had begun the shadow of the future appeared to have enfolded him but still he wavered not the hours sped his preparations were completed and at the time appointed by seaton with as much of awful solemnity as circumstances would admit the soul of the traitor was launched into eternity men women and children had gathered round the temporary scaffold every one within the castle save the maimed and wounded thronged to that centre court and cheers and shouts and groans and curses mingled strangely on the air clad in complete steel but bareheaded sir nigel bruce had witnessed the act of justice his voice had pronounced and after a brief pause he stood forward on the scaffold and in a deep rich voice addressed the multitude ere they separated eloquently forcibly he spoke of the guilt the foul guilt of treachery now when scotland demanded all men to join together hand and heart as onenow when the foe was at their gates when if united they might yet bid defiance to the tyrant who if they were defeated would hold them slaves he addressed them as scottish men and freemen as soldiers husbands and fathers as children of the brave who welcomed death with joy rather than life in slavery and degradation and when his words elicited a shout of exultation and applause from the greater number he turned his eye on the group of malcontents and sternly and terribly bade them beware of a fate similar to that which they had just witnessed for the gallant earl of hereford he said would deal with all scottish traitors as with evan roy and once known as traitors within the castle walls he need not speak their doom for they had witnessed it and then changing his tone frankly and beseechingly he conjured them to awake from the dull sluggish sleep of indifference and fear to put forth their energies as men as warriors their country their king their families called on them and would they not hear he bade them arise awake to their duty and all that had been should never be recalled he spoke with a brief yet mighty eloquence that seemed to carry conviction with it many a stern face and darkened brow relaxed and there was hope in many a patriot breast as that group dispersed and all was once more martial bustle on the walls well and wisely hast thou spoken my son said the aged abbot of scone who had attended the criminals last moments and now with nigel sought the keep thy words have moved those rebellious spirits have calmed the rising tempest even as oil flung on the troubled waves thine eloquence was even as an angel voice mid muttering fiends yet thou art still sad still anxious my son this should not be it must be father answered the young man i have looked beyond that oily surface and see naught save darker storms and fiercer tempests those spirits need somewhat more than a mere voice father reproach me not as mistrusting the gracious heaven in whose keeping lie our earthly fates i know the battle is not to the strong tis with the united the faithful and those men are neither my words have stirred them for the moment as a pebble flung mid the troubled watersa few brief instants and all trace is passed we see naught but the blackened wave but speak not of these things my trust is higher than earth and let man work his will another week passed and the fierce struggle continued alternating success one day with the besiegers the next with the besieged the scene of action was now principally on the wallsa fearful field for there was no retreatand often the combatants entwined in a deadly struggle fell together into the moat still there were no signs of wavering on either side still did the massive walls give no sign of yielding to the tremendous and continued discharge of heavy stones that against battlements less strongly constructed must long ere this have dealt destruction and inevitable mischief to the besieged one tower commanding the causeway across the moat and its adjoining platform on the wall had indeed been taken by the english and was to them a decided advantage but still their further progress even to the next tower was lingering and dubious and it appeared evident to both parties that from the utter impossibility of the scotch obtaining supplies of provision and men success must finally attend the english they would succeed more by the effects of famine than by their swords it was as we have said seven days after the execution of the traitor roy a truce for twelve hours had been concluded with the english at the request of sir nigel bruce and safe conduct granted by the earl of hereford to those men women and children of the adjoining villages who chose even at this hour to leave the castle but few a very few took advantage of this permission and these were mostly the widows and children of those who had fallen in the siege a fact which caused some surprise as the officers and menatarms imagined it would have been eagerly seized upon by all those contentious spirits who had appeared so desirous of a league with england a quiet smile slightly curled the lips of nigel as this information was reported to hima smile as of a mind prepared for and not surprised at what he heard but when left alone the smile was gone he folded his arms on his breast his head was slightly bent forward but had there been any present to have remarked him they would have seen his features move and work with the intensity of internal emotion some mighty struggle he was enduring something there was passing at his very heart for when recalled from that trance by the heavy bell of the adjoining church chiming the hour of five and he looked up there were large drops of moisture on his brow and his beautiful eye seemed for the moment strained and bloodshot he paced the chamber slowly and pensively till there was no outward mark of agitation and then he sought for agnes she was alone in an upper chamber of the keep looking out from the narrow casement on a scene of hill and vale and water which though still wintry from the total absence of leaf and flower was yet calm and beautiful in the declining sun and undisturbed by the fearful scenes and sounds which met the glance and ear on every other side seemed even as a paradise of peace it had been one of those mild soft days of february still more rare in scotland than in england and on the heart and sinking frame of agnes its influence had fallen till almost unconsciously she wept the step of nigel caused her hastily to dash these tears aside and as he stood by her and silently folded his arm around her she looked up in his face with a smile he sought to return it but the sight of such emotion trifling as it was caused his heart to sink with indescribable fear his lip quivered as utterly to prevent the words he sought to speak and as he clasped her to his bosom and bent his head on hers a low yet instantly suppressed moan burst from him nigel dearest nigel what has chanced oh speak to me she exclaimed clasping his hand in both hers and gazing wildly in his face thou art wounded or ill or wearied unto death oh let me undo this heavy armor dearest seek but a brief interval of rest speak to me i know thou art not well it is but folly my beloved a momentary pang that weakness caused indeed thy fears are causeless i am well quite well he answered struggling with himself and subduing with an effort his emotion mine own agnes thou wilt not doubt me look not upon me so tearfully tis passed tis over now and thou wilt not tell me that which caused it nigel hast thou aught of suffering which thou fearest to tell thine agnes oh do not fear it weak childlike as i am my soul will find strength for it and thou shalt know all all in a brief while he said her sweet pleading voice rendering the task of calmness more difficult yet tell me first thy thoughts my love methought thy gaze was on yon peaceful landscape as i entered and yet thine eyes were dimmed with tears and yet i know not wherefore she replied save the yearnings for peace were stronger deeper than they should be and i pictured a cot where love might dwell in yon calm valley and wished that this fierce strife was oer tis in truth no scene for thee mine own i know i feel thou pinest for freedom for the fresh pure stainless air of the mountain the valleys holy calm thine ear is sick with the fell sounds that burst upon it thine eye must turn in loathing from this fierce strife agnes mine own agnes is it not so would it not be happiness aye heavens own bliss to seek some peaceful home far far away from this he spoke hurriedly and more passionately than was his wont but agnes only answered with thee nigel it were bliss indeed with me he said and couldst thou not be happy were i not at thy side listen to me beloved and his voice became as solemnly earnest as it had previously been hurried i sought thee armed i thought with fortitude sufficient for the task sought thee to beseech implore thee to seek safety and peace for a brief while apart from me till these fearful scenes are passed start not and oh do not look upon me thus i know all that strength of nerve of soul which bids thee care not for the dangers round thee i know that where i am thy loving spirit feels no fear but oh agnes for my sake if not for thine own consent to fly ere it be too late consent to seek safety far from this fatal tower let me not feel that on thee on thee far dearer than my life destruction and misery and suffering in a thousand fearful shapes may fall let me but feel thee safe far from this terrible scene and then come what will it can have no pang and thee murmured the startled girl on whose ear the words of nigel had fallen as with scarce half their meaning thee wouldst thou bid me leave thee to strive on suffer on and oh merciful heaven perchance fall alone nigel nigel how may this be are we not one only one and how may i dwell in safety without theehow mayest thou suffer without me dearest and best he answered passionately oh that we were indeed one that the voice of heaven had bound us one long long ere this and yetno no tis better thus and again he struggled with emotion and spoke calmly agnes beloved precious as thou art in these hours of anxiety dear dearer than ever in thy clinging changeless love yet tempt me not selfishly to retain thee by my side when liberty and life and joy await thee beyond these fated walls thy path is secured all that can assist can accelerate thy flight waits but thy approval the dress of a minstrel boy is procured and will completely conceal and guard thee through the english camp our faithful friend the minstrel seer will be thy guide and lead thee to a home of peace and safety until my brothers happier fortune dawns he will guard and love thee for thine own and for my sake speak to me beloved thou knowest this good old man and i so trust him that i have no fear for thee oh do not pause and ere this truce be over let me let me feel that thou art safe and free and may in time be happy in time she repeated slowly as if to herself and then rousing herself from that stupor of emotion looked up with a countenance on which a sudden glow had spread and why hast thou so suddenly resolved on this she asked calmly why shouldst thou fear for me more now than hitherto dearest nigel hath not the danger always been the same and yet thou neer hast breathed of parting are not thy hopes the samewhat hath chanced unknown to me that thou speakest and lookest thus tell me ere thou urgest more i will tell thee what i fear my love he answered reassured by her firmness much that is seen not guessed not by my comrades they were satisfied that my appeal had had its effect and the execution of evan roy was attended with no disturbance no ill will amongst those supposed to be of his partynay that terror did its work and all ideas of treachery which might have been before encouraged were dismissed i too believed this agnes for a while but a few brief hours were sufficient to prove the utter fallacy of the dream some secret conspiracy is i am convinced carrying on within these very walls i know and feel this and yet so cautious so secret are their movements whatever they may be that i cannot guard against them there are as thou knowest fewer true fighting men amongst us than any other class and these are needed to man the walls and guard against the foe without they may not be spared to watch as spies their comradesnay i dare not even breathe such thoughts lest their bold hearts should faint and fail and they too demand surrender ere evil come upon us from within what will be that evil i know not and therefore cannot guard against it i dare not employ these men upon the walls i dare not bring them out against the foe for so bitterly do i mistrust them i should fear even then they would betray us i only know that evil awaits us and therefore my beloved i do beseech thee tarry not till it be upon us depart while thy path is free yet if they sought safety and peace if they tire of this warfare she replied disregarding his last words wherefore not depart today when egress was permitted bethink thee dearest nigel is not this proof thy fears are ill founded and that no further ill hangs over us than that which threatens from without alas no he said it but confirms my suspicions i obtained this safe conduct expressly to nullify or confirm them had they departed as i wished all would have been well but they linger and i can feel their plans are maturing and therefore they will not depart oh agnes he continued bitterly my very soul is crushed beneath this weight of unexpressed anxiety and care had i but to contend with our english foe but to fight a good and honorable fight to struggle on conscious that to the last gasp the brave inmates of this fortress would follow me and edward would find naught on which to wreak his vengeance but the dead bodies of his foes my task were easy as twere glorious but to be conscious of secret brooding evil each morn that rises each night that falls to dread what yet i know not to see perchance my brave fellows whelmed chained through a base treachery impossible to guard againstoh agnes tis this i fear yet have they not seemed more willing more active in their assigned tasks since the execution of their comrade continued agnes with all a womans gentle artifice still seeking to impart hope even when she felt that none remained may it not be that in reality they repent them of former traitorous designs and remain behind to aid thee to the last thou sayest that palpable proof of this brooding evil thou canst not find then do not heed its voice let no fear of me of my safety add its pang mine own nigel indeed i fear them not i know that all i urge will naught avail with thee beloved he answered somewhat less agitated i know thy gentle love is all too deep too pure too strong to share my fears for thee and oh i bless thee bless thee for the sweet solace of that faithful love yet yet i may not listen to thy wishes all that thou sayest is but confirmation of the brooding evil they are active willing but to hide their dark designs yet even were there not this evil to dread no dream of treachery still still i would send thee hence sweet one famine and blood and chains and deathoh no no thou must not stay for these and whither wouldst thou send me nigel and for what she asked still calmly though her quivering lip denoted that selfpossession was fast failing why whither to safety freedom peace my best beloved he answered fervently for what that happier brighter days may beam for thee that thou mayest live to bless and be a blessing dearest best cling not to a withered stem thou mayest be happy yet and wilt thou join me if i seek this home of safety nigel she laid her hand on his arm and fixed her eyes unflinchingly upon his face he could not meet that glance a cold shudder passed over his frame ere he could reply mine own agnes and even then he paused for his quivering lip could not give utterance to his thoughts and a minute rolled in that deep stillness and still those anxious eyes moved not from his face at length voice returned and it was sad yet deeply solemn our lives rest not in our own hands he said and who when they part may look to meet again beloved if life be spared canst doubt that i will join thee yet situated as i am governor of a castle about to fall a patriot and a bruce brother to the noble spirit who wears our countrys crown and has dared to fling down defiance to a tyrant agnes mine own agnes how may i dream of life i would send thee hence ere that fatal moment come i would spare thee this deep woe i would bid thee live beloved live till years had shed sweet peace upon thy heart and thou wert happy once again there was a moments pause the features of agnes had become convulsed with agony as nigel spoke and her hands had closed with fearful pressure on his arm but his last words spoken in his own rich thrilling voice called back the stagnant blood no no i will not leave thee she sobbed forth as from the sudden failing of strength in every limb she sunk kneeling at his feet nigel nigel i will not leave thee in life or in death i will abide by thee force me not from thee seek not to tempt me by the tale of safety freedom peace thou knowest not the depth the might of womans love if thou thinkest things like these can weigh aught with her even if chains and death stood frowningly beside i will not leave thee whom have i beside thee for whom else wouldst thou call on me to live alone alone utterly alone save thee wilt thou bid me hence and leave thee to meet thy fate alonethee to whom my mother gave methee without whom my very life is naught nigel oh despise me not for these wild words unmaidenly as they sound oh let me speak them or my heart will break despise thee for these blessed words nigel answered passionately as he raised her from the ground and clasped her to his heart oh thou knowest not the bliss they give yet yet would i speak of parting implore thee still to leave me aye though in that parting my very heartstrings snap agnes how may i bear to see thee in the power of the foe perchance insulted persecuted tortured with the ribald admiration of the rude crowd and feel i have no power to save thee no claim to bind thee to my side what are the mere chains of love in such an hour abiding by me as thou mightst till our last hope is over and english colors wave above this fortressthen dearest oh must we not shall we not be rudely parted no no who shall dare to part us she said as she clung sobbing to his breast who shall dare to do this thing and say i may not tend thee follow thee even until death who our captors dearest thinkest thou they will heed thy tender love thine anguish will they have hearts for aught save for thy loveliness sweet one think think of terrors like to this and oh still wilt thou refuse to fly but thy sister the lady seaton nigel doth she not stay doth she not brave these perils asked agnes shuddering at her lovers words yet clinging to him still if she escapes such evil why oh why may not i she is seatons wife sweet one bound to him by the voice of heaven by the holiest of ties the noble knights who head our foes will protect her in all honorable keeping but for thee agnes even if the ills i dread be as naught there is yet one i have dared not name lest it should pain thee yet one that is most probable as tis most fearful thou canst not hide thy name and as a daughter of buchan oh will they not give thee to a fathers keeping the murderer of my brothermy mothers jailer oh nigel nigel to look on him were more than death she wildly exclaimed yet yet once known as agnes of buchan this will this must be but leave thee now leave thee to a tyrants doom if indeed indeed thou fallest in his handsleave thee when faithful love and womans tenderness are more than ever neededleave thee for a fear like this no no i will not nigel i will rest with thee speak not answer not give us one short moment and thenoh all the ills may be averted by one brief wordand i oh can i speak it she paused in fearful agitation and every limb shook as if she must have fallen the blood rushed up to cheek and brow and neck as fixing her beautiful eyes on nigels face she said in a low yet thrilling voice let the voice of heaven hallow the vows we have so often spoken nigel give me a right a sacred right to bear thy name to be thine own at the altars foot by the holy abbots blessing let us pledge our troth and then let what will come no man can part us i am thine only thine without waiting for a reply she buried her face in his bosom and nigel could feel her heart throb as if twould burst its bounds her frame quiver as if the torrent of blood checked and stayed to give strength for the effort now rushed back with such overwhelming force through its varied channels as to threaten life itself agnes my own noble selfdevoted love oh how may i answer thee he cried tears of strong emotion coursing down his cheektears and the warrior felt no shame how have i been deserving of love like thishow may i repay it how bless thee for such words mine own mine own this would indeed guard thee from the most dreaded ills yet how may i link that selfdevoted heart to one whose thread of life is wellnigh spun how may i make thee mine when a few brief weeks of misery and horror must part us and on earth forever no no thou knowest not all a wife may do my nigel she said as she raised her head from his bosom and faintly smiled though her frame still shook how she may plead even with a tyrant and find mercy or if this fail how she may open iron gates and break through bonds till freedom may be found oh no we shall not wed to part beloved but live and yet be happy doubt it not and then oh then forget the words that joined us made us one had birth from other lips than thinethou wilt forget forgive this nigel forgetforgive that to thy pure unselfish soul i owe the bliss which een at this hour i feel he answered passionately kissing the beautiful brow upturned to his forget words that have provedhad i needed proofhow purely nobly faithfully i am beloved how utterly how wholly thou hast forgotten all of self for me no no were thy words proved true might i indeed live blessed with thee the life allotted man each year each month i would recall this hour and bless thee for its love but oh it may not be and his voice so suddenly lost its impassioned fervor that the breast of agnes filled with new alarm dearest best thou must not dream of life of happiness with me i may not mock thee with such blessed but alas delusive hopes my doom hath gone forth revealed when i knew it not confirmed by that visioned seer but few short weeks ago agnes my noble agnes wherefore shouldst thou wed with death i know that i must die the solemn earnestness of his words chased the still lingering glow from the lips and cheek of the maiden and a cold shiver passed through her frame but still she clung to him and said it matters not my maiden love my maiden troth is pledged to theein life or in death i am thine alone i will not leave thee she said firmly and calmly nigel if it be indeed as thou sayest that affliction andand all thou hast spoken must befall thee the more need is there for the sustaining and the soothing comfort of a womans love fear not for me weak as i may have seemed there is yet a spirit in me worthy of thy love i will not unman thee for all thou mayest encounter no even if i follow thee toto death it shall be as a bruces wife ask not how i will contrive to abide by thee undiscovered when if it must be the foe is triumphant it will take time and we have none to lose thou hast promised to forget all i have urged all save my love for thee then oh fear me not doubt me not thine agnes will not fail thee nigel gazed at her almost with surprise she was no longer the gentle timid being who but a few minutes since had clung weeping to his bosom as a child she was indeed very pale and on her features was the stillness of marble but she stood erect and unfaltering in her innocent loveliness sustained by that mighty spirit which dwelt within an emotion of deep reverence took possession of that warrior heart and unable to resist the impulse he bent his knee before her then let it be so he said solemnly but oh how fervently i will not torture mine own heart and thine by conjuring thee to fly and now here at thy feet agnes noble generous being let me swear solemnly sacredly swear that should life be preserved to me longer than i now dream of should i indeed be spared to lavish on thee all a husbands love and care never never shalt thou have cause to regret this day to mourn thy faithful love was shown as it hath beento weep the hour that in the midst of danger and darkness and woe hath joined our earthly fates and made us one and now he continued rising and folding her once more in his arms wilt thou meet me at the altar ere the truce concludes tis but a brief while a very brief while my love yet if it can be i know thou wilt not shrink i will not she answered the hour thou namest i will meet thee lady seaton she added slightly faltering and the vivid blush rose to her temples i would see her speak with her yet she shall come to thee mine own prepared to love and hail thee sister as she hath long done she will not blame thee dearest she loves hath loved too faithfully herself fear not i will leave naught for thee to tell that can bid that cheek glow as it doth now she too will bless thee for thy love he imprinted a fervent kiss on her cheek and hastily left her agnes remained standing as he had left her for several minutes her hands tightly clasped her whole soul speaking in her beautiful features and then she sunk on her knees before a rudelycarved image of the virgin and child and prayed long and fervently she did not weep her spirit had been too painfully excited for such relief but so wrapt was she in devotion she knew not that lady seaton with a countenance beaming in admiration and love stood beside her till she spoke rouse thee my gentle one she said tenderly as she twined her arm caressingly around her i may not let thee linger longer even here for time passes only too quickly and i shall have but little time to attire my beautiful bride for the altar nigel hath been telling such a tale of womans love that my good lord hath vowed despite his weakness and his wounds none else shall lead thee to the altar and give thee to my brother save himself i knew that not even nigels influence would bid thee leave us dearest she continued as agnes hid her face in her bosom but i dreamed not such a spirit dwelt within this childlike heart sweet one thy lot must surely be for joy chapter xx it was something past the hour of nine when agnes leaning on the arm of sir christopher seaton and followed by lady seaton and two young girls their attendants entered the church and walked with an unfaltering step and firm though modest mien up to the altar beside which nigel already stood she was robed entirely in white without the smallest ornament save the emerald clasp which secured and the beautiful pearl embroidery which adorned her girdle her mantle was of white silk its little hood thrown back disclosing a rich lining of the white fox fur lady seaton had simply arranged her hair in its own beautiful curls and not a flower or gem peeped through them a silver bodkin secured the veil which was just sufficiently transparent to permit her betrothed to look upon her features and feel that pale and still as they were they evinced no change in her generous purpose he too was pale for he felt those rites yet more impressively holy than he had deemed them even when his dreams had pictured them peculiarly and solemnly holy for he looked not to a continuance of life and happiness he felt not that ceremony set its seal upon joy and bound it as far as mortality might hope forever on their hearts he was conscious only of the deep unutterable fulness of that gentle beings love of the bright beautiful lustre with which it shone upon his path the emotion of his young and ardent breast was perhaps almost too holy too condensed to be termed joy but it was one so powerful so blessed that all of earth and earthly care was lost before it the fears and doubts which he had so lately felt for the time completely faded from his memory that there were foes without and yet darker foes within he might have known perhaps but at that moment they did not occupy a fleeting thought he had changed his dress for one of richness suited to his rank and though at the advice of his friends he still retained the breastplate and some other parts of his armor his doublet of azure velvet cut and slashed with white satin and his long flowing mantle lined with sable and so richly decorated with silver stars that its color could scarcely be distinguished removed all appearance of a martial costume and well became the graceful figure they adorned two of the oldest knights and four other officers all gayly attired as the hurry of the moment would permit had at his own request attended him to the altar much surprise this sudden intention had indeed caused but it was an excitement a change from the dull routine of the siege and consequently welcomed with joy many indeed believing sir nigel had requested the truce for the purpose sir christopher too though pale and gaunt and compelled to use the support of a cane in walking was observed to look upon his youthful charge with all his former hilarity of mien chastened by a kindly tenderness which seemed indeed that of the father whom he personated and lady seaton had donned a richer garb than was her wont and stood encouragingly beside the bride about twenty menatarms their armor and weapons hastily burnished that no unseemly soil should mar the peaceful nature of the ceremony by recalling thoughts of war were ranged on either side the church was lighted dimly in the nave and aisles but softly and somewhat with a holy radiance where the youthful couple knelt from the large waxen tapers burning in their silver stands upon the altar the abbot of scone was at his post attended by the domestic chaplain of kildrummie there was a strange mixture of admiration and anxiety on the old mans face but agnes saw it not she saw nothing save him at whose side she knelt nigel even in the agitation of mind in which he had quitted agnesan agitation scarcely conquered in hastily informing his sister and her husband of all that had passed between them and imploring their countenance and aidyet made it his first care strictly to make the round of the walls to notice all that might be passing within the courts and see that the menatarms were at their posts in consequence of the truce for the conclusion of which it still wanted some little time there were fewer men on the walls than usual their commanders having desired them to take advantage of this brief cessation of hostilities and seek refreshment and rest a trumpet was to sound at the hour of ten half an hour before the truce concluded to summon them again to their posts the men most acute in penetration most firm and steady in purpose nigel selected as sentries along the walls the post of each being one of the round towers we have mentioned the remaining spaces were consequently clear night had already fallen and anxiously observing the movements on the walls endeavoring to discover whether the various little groups of men and women in the ballium meant any thing more than usual sir nigel did not notice various piles or stacks of straw and wood which were raised against the wall in many parts where the shadows lay darkest and some also against the other granaries which were contained in low wooden buildings projecting from the wall neither he nor his friends nor even the menatarms noticed them or if they did imagined them in the darkness to be but the stones and other weights generally collected there and used to supply the engines on the wails with the exception of the sentries and the men employed by nigel all the garrison had assembled in the hall of the keep for their evening meal the recollection of whose frugality they determined to banish by the jest and song there were in consequence none about the courts and therefore that dark forms were continually hovering about beneath the deep shadows of the walls increasing the size of the stacks remained wholly undiscovered agnes had entered the church by a covered passage which united the keep to its inner wall and thence by a gallery through the wall itself dimly lighted by loopholes to the edifice whose southern side was formed by this same wall it was therefore though in reality situated within the ballium or outer court nearer by many hundred yards to the dwelling of the baron than to the castle walls its granaries towers etc this outward ballium indeed was a very large space giving the appearance of a closelybuilt village or town from the number of low wooden and thatchedroofed dwellings which on either side of the large open space before the great gate were congregated together this account may we fear at such a moment seem somewhat out of place but events in the sequel compel us to be thus particular a space about half a mile square surrounded the church and this position when visited by sir nigel at nine oclock was quiet and deserted indeed there was very much less confusion and other evidences of disquiet within the dwellings than was now usual and this circumstance perhaps heightened the calm which as we have said had settled on sir nigels mind there was silence within that little sacred edifice the silence of emotion for not one could gaze upon that young fair girl could think of that devoted spirit which at such a time preferred to unite her fate with a beloved one than seek safety and freedom in flight without being conscious of a strange swelling of the heart and unwonted moisture in the eye and there was that in the expression of the beautiful features of nigel bruce none could remark unmoved he was so young so gifted so strangely uniting the gift of the sage the poet with the glorious achievements of the most perfect knight that he had bound himself alike to every heart however varied their dispositions however opposite their tastes and there was not one from the holy abbot of scone to the lowest and rudest of the menatarms who would not willingly aye joyfully have laid down life for his have gladly accepted chains to give him freedom the deep sonorous voice of the abbot audibly faltered as he commenced the sacred service and looked on the fair beings kneeling in the beauty and freshness of their youth before him accustomed however to control every human emotion he speedily recovered himself and uninterruptedly the ceremony continued modestly yet with a voice that never faltered agnes made the required responses and so deep was the stillness that reigned around not a word was lost but sweetly and clearly as a silver clarion it sunk on every ear and thrilled to every heart to his who knelt beside her as if each tone revealed yet more the devoted love which led her there towards the conclusion of the service and just as every one within the church knelt in general prayer a faint yet suffocating odor borne on what appeared a light mist was distinguished and occasioned some slight surprise by the group around the altar however it was unnoticed and the menatarms on looking towards the narrow windows and perceiving nothing but the intense darkness of the night hushed the rising exclamation and continued in devotion two of the knights too were observed to glance somewhat uneasily around still nothing was perceivable but the light wreaths of vapor penetrating through the northern aisle and dissolving ere long the arches of the roof almost unconsciously they listened and became aware of some sounds in the distance but so faint and indefinable as to permit them to rest in the belief that it must be the menatarms hurrying from the keep to the walls although they were certain the trumpet had not yet sounded determined not to heed such vague sounds they looked again to the altar the abbot had laid a trembling hand on either lowbent head and was emphatically pronouncing his blessing on their vows calling on heaven in its mercy to bless and keep them and spare them to each other for a long and happy life or if it must be that a union commenced in danger should end in sorrow to keep them still and fit them for a union in eternity his words were few but earnest and for the first time the lip of agnes was observed to quiverthey were one agnes was clasped to the heart of her husband she heard him call her his ownhis wifethat man should never part them more the voice of congratulation woke around her but ere either could gaze around to look their thanks or clasp the eagerly proffered hand a cry of alarm of horror ran though the building a red lurid light impossible to be mistaken illumined every window as from a fearful conflagration without darkness had fled before it on all sides it was lightlight the most horrible the most awful though perchance the most fascinating the eye can behold fearful shouts and cries and the rush of many feet mingled with the now easily distinguished roar of the devouring element burst confusedly on the ear a minute sufficed to fling open the door of the church for knights and menatarms to rush forth in one indiscriminate mass sir christopher would have followed them utterly regardless of his inability had not his wife clung to him imploringly and effectually restrained him the abbot grasping the silver crosier by his side with a swift yet still majestic stride made his way through the church and vanished by the widely opened door agnes and sir nigel stood comparatively alone not a cry not a word passed her lips every feature was wrapped in one absorbing look upon her husband he had clasped his hands convulsively together his brow was knit his lip compressed his eye fixed and rigid though it gazed on vacancy it hath fallen it hath fallen he muttered fool fool that i was never to dream of this friends followers all i hold most dear swallowed up in this fell swoop god of mercy how may it be born and thou thou he added in increased agony roused from that stupor by the wild shouts of sir nigel sir nigel where is he why does he tarry in such an hour that rung shrilly on the air agnes mine own it is not too late even now to fly ha son of dermid in good tune thou art here save her in mercy save her i know not when or how or where we may meet again i may not tarry here he clasped her in his arms imprinted an impassioned kiss on her now deathlike cheek placed her at once in the arms of the seer who robed as a minstrel had stood concealed behind a projecting pillar during the ceremony and now approached and darted wildly from the church what a scene met his gaze all the buildings within the ballium with the sole exception of the church were in one vivid blaze of fire the old dry wood and thatch of which they were composed kindling with a mere spark the wind blew the flames in the direction of the principal wall which was already ignited from the heaps of combustibles that had been raised within for the purpose although it was likely that from its extreme thickness and strength the fire had there done but partial evil had not the conflagration within the court spread faster and nearer every moment and from the blazing rafters and large masses of thatch caught by the wind and hurled on the very wall done greater and more irreparable mischief than the combustibles themselves up up seeming to the very heavens the lurid flames ascended blazing and roaring and lighting the whole scene as with the glare of day fantastic wreaths of red fire danced in the air against the pitchy blackness of the heavens rising and falling in such graceful yet terrible shapes that the very eye felt riveted in admiration while the heart quailed with horror backwards and forwards gleamed the forms of men in the dusky glare and oaths and cries and the clang of swords and the shrieks of women terrified by the destruction they had not a little assisted to ignitethe sudden rush of horses bursting from their stables and flying here and there scared by the unusual sight and horrid soundsthe hissing streams of water which thrown from huge buckets on the flames seemed but to excite them to greater fury instead of lessening their devouring waythe crackling of straw and wood as of the roar of a hundred furnacesthese were the varied sounds and sights that burst upon the eye and ear of nigel as richly attired as he was his drawn sword in his hand his fair hair thrown back from his uncovered brow and head he stood in the very centre of the scene one glance sufficed to perceive that the rage of the menatarms was turned on their treacherous countrymen that the work of war raged even thenthe swords of scotsmen were raised against each other even women fell in that fierce slaughter for the demon of revenge was at work and sought but blood in vain the holy abbot heedless that one sudden gust and his flowing garments must inevitably catch fire uplifted his crosier and called on them to forbear in vain the officers rushed amidst the infuriated men bidding them keep their weapons and their lives for the foe who in such a moment would assuredly be upon them in vain they commanded exhorted implored but on a sudden the voice of sir nigel bruce was heard above the tumult loud stern commanding his form was seen hurrying from group to group turning back with his own sword the weapons of his men giving life even to those who had wrought this woe and there was a sudden hush a sudden pause peace peace he cried would ye all share the madness of these men they have hurled down destruction let them reap it let them live to thrive and fatten in their chains let them feel the yoke they pine for for us my friends and fellowsoldiers let us not meet our glorious fate with the blood of scotsmen on our swords we have striven for our country we have striven gloriously faithfully and now we have but to die for her ha do i speak in vain againback coward wouldst thou slay a woman and with a sudden bound he stood beside one of the soldiers who was in the act of plunging his dagger in the breast of a kneeling and struggling female one moment sufficed to wrench the dagger from his grasp and release the woman from his hold it is ill done your lordship it is the fiend the archfiend that has planned it all loudly exclaimed the man she has been heard to mutter threats of vengeance and blood and fire against thee and all belonging to thee let her not go free my lord thou mayest repent it still repent giving a woman lifebah thou art a fool though a faithful one answered sir nigel but even he started as he recognized the features of jean roy she gave him no time to restrain her however for sliding from his hold she bounded several paces from him singing as she did so repent ye shall repent where is thy buxom bride jean roy will see to her safety a bonny courtship ye shall have tossing up her arms wildly she vanished as she spoke seeming in that light in very truth more like a fiend than woman a chill sunk on the heart of nigel but no no he said internally as again he sought the spot where confusion and horror waxed thickest dermid will care for agnes and guard her i will not think of that mad womans words yet even as he rushed onwards giving directions commands lending his aid to every effort made for extinguishing the fire a prayer for his wife was uttered in his heart the fire continued its rapid progress buttress after buttress tower after tower caught on the walls causing the conflagration to continue even when by the most strenuous efforts it had been partially extinguished amongst the dwellings of the court the wind blowing from the north fortunately preserved the keep inner wall and even the church uninjured save that the scorched and blackened sides of the latter gave evidence of the close vicinity of the flames and how narrowly it had escaped with saddened hearts the noble defenders of scotlands last remaining bulwark beheld their impregnable wall the scene of such dauntless valor such unconquered struggles against which the whole force of their mighty foes had been of no availthat wall crumbling into dust and ashes in their very sight opening a broad passage to the english foe yet still there was no evidence that to yield were preferable than to die still though wellnigh exhausted with their herculean efforts to quench the flames there was no cessation no pause although the very height of the wall prevented success for they had not the facilities afforded by the engines of the present day sir nigel his knights nay the venerable abbot himself seconded every effort of the men it seemed as if little more could add to the horror of the scene and yet the shouts of the granaries the granariesmerciful heaven all is consumed came with such appalling consciousness on every ear that for a brief while the stoutest arm hung powerless the firmest spirit quailed famine stood suddenly before them as a gaunt terrific spectre whose cold hand it seemed had grasped their very hearts nobles and men knights and soldiers alike stood paralyzed gazing at each other with a blank dim unutterable despair the shrill blast of many trumpets the roll of heavy drums broke that deep stillness the foe the foe was echoed round fiercely yet rejoicingly they are upon usthey brave the flameswell done now firm and steady to your armsstand close sound trumpetsthe defiance the bruce and scotland and sharply and clearly as if but just arrayed for battle as if naught had chanced to bend those gallant spirits to the earth the scottish clarions sent back their answering blast and the men gathered in compact array around their gallant leader my horsemy horse shouted nigel bruce as he sprung from rank to rank of the little phalanx urging commanding entreating them to make one last stand and fall as befitted scottish patriots the keep and inner ballium was still their own as a place of retreat however short a period it might remain so a brave defence a glorious death would still do much for scotland shouts cheers blessings on his name awoke in answer as unfalteringly as bravely as those of the advancing foes prancing neighing rearing the superb charger was at length brought to the dauntless leader not thus my lord in heavens name do not mount thus unarmed bareheaded as thou art exclaimed several voices and two or three of his esquires crowded round him retire but for a brief space within the church and turn my back upon my foes hubert not for worlds no no bring me the greaves gauntlets and helmet here if thou wilt and an they give me time i will arm me in their very teeth haste ye my friends if ye will have it so for myself these garments would serve me well enough but ere he ceased to speak they had flown to obey and returned ere a dozen more of the english had made their way across the crumbling wall coolly composedly nigel threw aside his mantle and doublet and permitted his esquires to assist in arming him speaking at the same time in a tone so utterly unconcerned that ere their task was finished his coolness had extended unto them he had allowed some few of the english to make an unmolested way his own men were drawn up in close lines against the inner wall so deep in shadow that they were at first unobserved by the english he could perceive by the still clear light of the flames troop after troop of the besiegers were marching forward in the direction both of the causeway and the river several were plunging in the moat sword in hand and attack threatened on every side he waited no longer springing on his charger with a movement so sudden and unexpected the helmet fell from his esquires hand and waving his sword above his undefended head he shouted aloud his warcry and dashed on followed by his men to the spot where a large body of his foes already stood desperately they struggled most gallantly they fought man after man of the english fell before them on on they struggled a path seemed cleared before them the english were bearing back despite their continued reinforcements from the troops that so thronged the causeway it appeared but one mass of men but other shouts rent the air the besiegers now poured in on every side wherever that gallant body turned they were met by english on on they came fresh from some hours of repose buoyed up by the certainty of conquest unnumbered swords and spears and coats of mail gleaming in that lurid light on came the fiery steeds urged by the spur and rein till through the very flames they bore their masters on through the waters of the moat up the scorching ruins and with a sound as of thunder clearing with a single bound all obstacles into the very court it was a fearful sight that little patriot band hemmed in on every side yet struggling to the last clearing a free passage through men and horse and glancing swords and closing multitudes nearing the church slowly yet surely forming in yet closer order as they advanced there there they stood as a single bark amid the troubled waves cleaving them asunder but to close again in fatal fury on her track in vain amid that furious strife did the earl of lancaster seek out the azure plume and golden helmet that marked the foe he still desired to meet there was indeed a face beautiful and glorious even in that moment ever in the very thickest of the fight alike the front the centre the rearguard of his men there was indeed that stately form sitting his noble charger as if horse and man were one and that unhelmed brow that beautifully formed head with its long curls streaming in the night wind which towered unharmed unbent above his foes and where that was the last hope of his country had gathered the open door of the church was gained and there the scottish patriots made a stand defended in their rear by the building a brief and desperate struggle partially cleared their foes and ere those in the rear could press forward the besieged had disappeared and the heavy doors were closed the sudden pause of astonishment amidst the assailants was speedily dispelled by the heavy blows of axes and hatchets the sudden shout to the wall to the wall while several ran to plant scalingladders and mount the inner barrier left unhappily unguarded from the diminished numbers of the scotch there however their progress was impeded for the space which that wall inclosed being scarce half the size of the ballium and the barrier itself uninjured they were repulsed with loss from within the churchdoors meanwhile had given way and permitted ingress to the assailants but the door leading to the passage through the inner wall and by which in reality the scotch had effected their retreat was carefully closed and barred within and had so completely the same appearance as the wall of the church in which it stood that the english gazed round them fairly puzzled and amazed this movement however on the part of the besieged occasioned a brief cessation of hostilities on both sides the flames had subsided except here and there where the passing wind fanned the redhot embers anew into life and caused a flickering radiance to pass athwart the pitchy darkness of the night and over the bustling scene on either side the ruins there was no moon and hereford imagined the hours of darkness might be better employed in active measures for resuming the attack by dawn than continuing it then much very much had been gained a very brief struggle more he knew must now decide it and he hoped though against his better judgment that the garrison would surrender without further loss of blood terms he could not propose none at least that could prevail on the brave commanders to give up with life and so great was the admiration nigels conduct had occasioned that this true son of chivalry ardently wished he would eventually fall in combat rather than be consigned to the fearful fate which he knew would be inflicted on him by the commands of edward commands to the troops without were forwarded by trusty esquires the wounded conveyed to the camp and their places supplied by fresh forces who with the joyous sound of trumpet and drum marched over by torchlight into the ballium so long the coveted object of their attack sir nigel meanwhile had desired his exhausted men to lie down in their arms ready to start up at the faintest appearance of renewed hostility and utterly worn out they most willingly obeyed but the young knight himself neither shared nor sought for that repose he stood against a buttress on the walls leaning on a tall spear and gazing at once upon his wearied followers and keeping a strict watch on the movements of his foes a tall form clothed in complete armor suddenly stood beside him he started seaton he said thou here and in armor aye answered the knight his voice from very weakness sounding hollow in his helmet aye to make one last stand and if it may be die as i have lived for scotland i have strength to strike one last blow for last it will beall is lost a low groan broke from nigels lips but he made no further answer than the utterance of one wordagnes is safe i trust rejoined the knight the son of dermid in whose arms i last saw her knoweth many a secret path and hidden passage and can make his way wherever his will may lead how thinkest thou he will preserve her save her even now from the foe aye perchance conceal her till the castle be dismantled but what do they now see a herald and white flag he added abruptly as by the light of several torches a trumpeter bannerbearer herald and five menatarms were discerned approaching the walls what would ye halt and answer demanded sir nigel recalled on the instant to his sterner duties and advancing spear in hand to the utmost verge of the wall we demand speech of sir nigel bruce and sir christopher seaton governors of this castle was the brief reply speak on then we are before ye ready to list your say what would your lords give ye not admittance within the wall inquired the herald tis somewhat strange parleying without no answered nigel briefly and sternly speak on and quickly we doubt not the honor of the noble earl of herefordit hath been too gloriously proved but we are here to list your mission what would ye that ye surrender this fortress by tomorrows dawn and strive no longer with the destiny against you ye have neither men nor stores and in all good and chivalric feeling the noble earls of hereford and lancaster call on ye to surrender without further loss of blood and if we do this demanded nigel they promise all honorable treatment and lenient captivity to the leaders of the rebels until the pleasure of his grace the king be known protection to all females liberty to those whose rank demands not their detention and for the common soldiers on the delivery of their arms and upper garments and their taking a solemn oath that within seven days they will leave scotland never to return liberty and life shall be mercifully extended unto one and all and if we do not this your blood be upon your own rebellious heads sacking and pillage must take their course ye have heard were the sole words that passed the lips of nigel turning to his men who roused by the first sound of the trumpet had started from their slumbers and falling in a semicircle round him and sir christopher listened with intense eagerness to the heralds words ye have heard speak thenyour answer yours shall be ours death death death was the universally reiterated shout we will struggle to the death our king and country shall not say we deserted them because we feared to die or surrendered on terms of shame as these no let the foe come on we will die if we may not live still patriots of scotland king robert will avenge us god save the bruce again and yet again they bade god bless him and startlingly and thrillingly was the united voice of that desperate devoted band borne on the wings of night to the very furthest tents of their foes calmly sir nigel turned again to the herald thou hast scotlands answer he said tis in such men as these her glorious spirit lives they will fall not unavenged commend us to your masters we await them with the dawn and turning on his heel he reassumed the posture of thought as if he had never been aroused the dawn uprose the attack was renewed with increased vigor and defended with the same calm determined spirit which had been ever shown the patriots fell where they fought leaving fearful traces of their desperate courage in the numbers of english that surrounded each it was now before the principal entrance to the keep they made their final stand and horrible was the loss of life fierce and deadly the strife ere that entrance was forced and the shrieks of women and children within proclaimed the triumph of the foe then came a shout loud ringing joyous echoed and reechoed by the blast of the trumpets both within and without and the proud banner of scotland was hurled contemptuously to the earth and the flag of england floated in its place many a dying eye unclosed by those sudden sounds looked on that emblem of defeat and moved not in life again others sprung up to their feet with wild shrieks of defiance and fell back powerless in death sir christopher seaton whose exhausted frame could barely sustain the weight of his armor had been taken in the first charge fighting bravely but falling from exhaustion to the earth and where was nigelhemmed in on all sides yet seemingly unwounded unconquered still his face indeed was deadly pale and there were moments when his strokes flagged as from an utter failing of strength but if on observing this his foes pressed closer strength appeared to return and still still he struggled on he sought for death he felt that he dared his destiny but death shunned him he strove with his destiny in vain not thus might he fall the young the generous the gifted on foot his armor hacked and stained with blood not yet had the word yield been shouted in his ear back back leave me this glorious prize shouted lancaster spurring on his charger through the crowd and leaping from him the instant he neared the spot where nigel stood take heed of my gallant horse i need him noti shall not need him now ha bareheaded too well so shall it be with mehand to hand foot to foot turn noble nigel we are wellnigh equals now and none shall come between us he hastily unclasped his helmet threw it from his brow and stood in the attitude of defence one moment sir nigel paused his closing foes had fallen from him at the words of their leader he hesitated one brief instant as to whether indeed he should struggle more or deliver up his sword to the generous earl when the shout of triumph from the topmost turret proclaiming the raising of the banner fell upon his ear and nerved him to the onset noble and generous he exclaimed as their swords crossed might i choose my fate i would fall by thy knightly sword as stupefied with wonder at the skill the extraordinary velocity and power of the combatants the menatarms stood round without making one movement to leave the spot and fearful indeed was that deadly strife equal they seemed in stature in the use of their weapons in every mystery of the sword the eye ached with the rapid flashing of the blades the ear tired of the sharp unwavering clash but still they quailed not moved not from the spot where the combat had commenced how long this fearful struggle would have continued or who would finally be victor was undecided still when suddenly the wild mocking laugh of madness sounded in the very ear of nigel and a voice shouted aloud fight on my bonny lord see see how i care for your winsome bride and the maniac form of jean roy rushed by through the thickest ranks of the men swift swift as the lightning track a veil of silver tissue floated from her shoulder and she seemed to be bearing something in her arms but what the rapidity of her way precluded all discovery the fierce soldiers shrunk away from her as if appalled by her gaunt spectral look or too much scared by her sudden appearance to attempt detaining her the eye of nigel involuntarily turned from his foe to follow her he recognized the veil and fancy did the rest he saw her near a part of the wall which was tottering beneath the engines of the english there was a wild shriek in other tones than hers the wall fell burying the maniac in its ruins a mist came over the senses of the young knight strength suddenly fled his arm he stepped back as to recover himself but slipped and fell the violence of the fall dashing his sword many yards in air i yield me true prisoner rescue or no rescue he said in a tone so startling in its agony that the rudest heart beside him shrunk within itself appalled and for a minute lancaster checked the words upon his lips nay nay yield not in such tone my gallant foe he said with eager courtesy and with his own hand aiding him to rise would that i were the majesty of england i should deem myself debased did i hold such gallantry in durance of a truth thou hast robbed me of my conquest fair sir for it was no skill of mine which brought thee to the ground i may thank that shrieking mad woman perchance for the preservation of my laurels i give you thanks for your courtesy my lord replied sir nigel striving to recover himself but i pray you pardon me if i beseech you let that falling mass be cleared at once and note if that unhappy woman breathes methought he added in stronger agitation she carried something in her arms she did answered many voices some child or girl who was struggling though the head was muffled up as if to prevent all sounds see to it and bring us news of what you find said lancaster hastily for the same ghastly expression passed over the countenance of his prisoner as had startled him at first thou art not well my good lord he continued kindly nay i am well my lord but i will go with you replied the young knight slowly as if collecting strength ere he could speak i am wearied with the turmoil of the last twelve hours fighting against fire and sword at once i would fain see the noble hereford and with his permission rest me a brief while lancaster made no further comment and the two knights who but a few minutes before had been engaged in deadly strife now made their way together through the heaps of the dying and the dead through many a group of rude soldiery who scowled on nigel with no friendly eye for they only recognized him as the destroyer of hundreds of their countrymen not the chivalric champion who had won the enthusiastic admiration of their leaders and soon found themselves in the castlehall in the presence of the earl of hereford who was surrounded by his noblest officers sir christopher and lady seaton and some few other scottish prisoners most of whom were badly wounded he advanced to meet sir nigel courteously though gravely it grieves me he said to receive as a prisoner a knight of such high renown and such chivalric bearing as sir nigel bruce i would he had kept those rare qualities for the sovereign to whom they were naturally due and who would have known how to have appreciated and honor them rather than shed such lustre on so weak a cause does your lordship regard the freedom of an oppressed country so weak a cause replied nigel the hot blood mounting to his cheek the rising in defence of a rightful king in lieu of slavishly adhering to one who though so powerful all good men aye even all good englishmen must look on in his claims to scotland as an ambitious usurper my lord my lord the spirit of hereford spoke not in those words but i forgive them for i have much for which to proffer thanks unto the noble hereford much that his knightly soul scorned treachery and gave us a fair field durance is but a melancholy prospect yet an it must be i would not nobler captors nor would i forfeit the esteem in which you hold me gallant sir replied the earl and therefore do i pray you command my services in aught that can pleasure you and an it interfere not with my duty to my sovereign i shall be proud to give them speak i pray you nay i can ask naught which the earl of hereford hath not granted of himself said sir nigel i would beseech you to extend protection to all the females of this unhappy castle to part not my sister from her lord for as you see his wounds and weakness call for womans care to grant the leechs aid to those who need it and if there be some unhappy men of my faithful troop remaining i would beseech you show mercy unto them and let them go freethey can work no further ill to edward they can fight no more for scotland for she lieth chained they have no head and therefore no means of resistancei beseech you give them freedom unshackled by conditions it shall be it shall be replied hereford hastily and evidently moved but for thyself young sir thyself can we do naught for thee nothing answered the young man calmly i need little more on earth for neither my youth my birth nor what it pleaseth thee to term my gallantry will save me from the sweeping axe of edward i would beseech thee to let my death atone for all and redeem my noble friends but i ask it not for i know in this thou hast no power and yet though i ask nothing now he added after a brief pause and in a lower voice as to be heard only by hereford ere we march to england i may have a boon to craveprotection liberty for a beloved one whose fate as yet i know not he spoke almost inarticulately for again it seemed the horrid words and maniac laugh of jean roy resounded in his ears there was that in the look and manner of the english earl inviting confidence a moment the tortured young man longed to pour all into his ear to conjure him to find agnes and give her to his arms the next he refrained for her words ask not how i will contrive to abide by thee undiscovered by the foe suddenly flashed on his memory with the conviction that if she were indeed still in life and he acknowledged her his wife hereford would feel himself compelled to keep her under restraint as he did lady seaton and the wives of other noble scotsmen his lip trembled but fortunately for the preservation of his composure herefords attention was called from him by the eager entrance of several other officers who all crowded round him alike in congratulation and waiting his commands and perceiving he was agitated the earl turned from him with a courteous bow eagerly he seized that moment to spring to the side of his sister to whisper the impatient inquiry agnes where is agnes to feel his heart a moment throb high and then sink again by her reply that she had not seen her since he had placed her in the arms of the seer that in the fearful confusion which followed she had looked for her in vain examined all her accustomed haunts but discovered no traces of her save the silver tissue veil there was however some hope in that jean roy misled by the glittering article and seeing it perchance in the hands of another might have been deceived in her prey nay he welcomed the uncertainty of suspense there was something so fearful so horrible in the idea that his own faithful agnes was among those blackened and mangled bodies which lancaster informed him had been discovered beneath the ruins something so sickening so revolting he could not take advantage of the earls offer to examine them himself though lancaster added it would not be of much use for he challenged their dearest friends to recognize them he could not believe such was her fate dermid had not been seen since the fatal conclusion of their marriage he knew his fidelity his interest in both agnes and himself and he could not he would not believe the maniac had decoyed her from his care but where was shewhere in such a moment could he have conveyed herwhat would be her final fatehow would she rejoin him were questions ever thronging on his heart and brain struggling with doubts with the horrible suspicion still clinging to that shriek which had sounded as the ruins fell darker and more forebodingly oppressive grew these conflicting thoughts as day after day passed and still she came not nor were there any tidings of the seer a very brief interval sufficed for the english earls to conclude their arrangements at kildrummie and prepare to march southward berwick being the frontier town to which the scottish prisoners were usually conveyed their loss had been greater than at any other similar siege more than a third of their large army had fallen several others were wounded and not much above a third remained who were fitted to continue in arms it was a fearful proof of the desperate valor of the besieged but both earls felt it would so exasperate their sovereign against the scottish commanders as to remove the slightest hope of mercy the ruins were with some labor cleared away the remains of the outer wall levelled with the earth except the tower communicating with the drawbridge and barbacan which could be easily repaired the inner wall hereford likewise commanded to be restored the keep he turned into a hospital for the wounded leaving with them a sufficient garrison to defend the castle in case of renewed incursions of the scottish patriots a case in the present state of the country not very probable true to his promise these menatarms who survived and whose wounds permitted their removal hereford set at liberty not above ten in number dispirited heartbroken he felt indeed there was no need to impose conditions on them those of the traitors who remained endeavored by cringing humility to gain the favor of the english but finding themselves shunned and despised for the commonest english soldier was of a nature too noble to bear with aught of treachery they dispersed over the country finding little in its miserable condition to impart enjoyment to the lives they had enacted so base a part to preserve it may be well to state ere we entirely leave the subject that the execution of evan roy exciting every evil passion in their already rebellious hearts had determined them to conspire for a signal revenge the ravings of jean roy and the desperate counsels of her motherinlaw urging them to the catastrophe we have related the murder of nigel had been first planned but dismissed as likely to be discovered and thwarted and bring vengeance on their own heads instead of his before the execution of their comrade and head of the conspiracy they had only been desirous of shunning the horrors of a prolonged siege but afterwards revenge became stronger than mere personal safety and therefore was it they refused to take advantage of the safe conduct demanded by nigel and granted as we have said the scottish prisoners were removed from the castle a few hours after its capitulation and placed in honorable restraint in separate pavilions lancaster whose romantic admiration for his antagonist had not been in the least diminished by sir nigels bearing in captivity and the lofty tone of the young knights society and conversation which he frequently courted absolutely made him shrink from heading the force which was to conduct him a prisoner to england for he well knew those very qualities calling forth every spark of chivalry in his own bosom would be only so many incitements to edward for his instant execution he therefore demanded that the superintending the works of the garrison and keeping a strict watch upon the movements of the adjoining country should devolve on him and hereford as the older and wiser should conduct his prisoners to the border and report the events of the siege to his sovereign his colleague acceded and the eighth day from the triumph of the besiegers was fixed on to commence their march it was on the evening of the seventh day that the earl of hereford then engaged in earnest council with lancaster on subjects relating to their military charge was informed that an old man and a boy so earnestly entreated speech with him that they had even moved the iron heart of hugo de lorme the earls esquire who himself craved audience for them they must bear some marvellous charm about them an they have worked upon thee de lorme said his master smiling in good sooth let them enter yet there was nothing very striking in their appearance when they came the old man indeed was of a tall almost majestic figure and it was only the snowy whiteness of his hair and flowing beard that betrayed his age for his eye was still bright his form unbent he was attired as a minstrel his viol slung across his breast a garb which obtained for its possessor free entrance alike into camp and castle hall and bower to all parties to all lands friendly or hostile as it might be his companion was a slight boy seemingly little more than thirteen or fourteen with small exquisitely delicate features his complexion either dark or sunburnt his eyes were bent down and their long very dark lashes rested on his cheek but when raised their beautiful blue seemed so little in accordance with the brunette skin that the sun might be deemed more at fault than nature his hair of the darkest brown clustered closely round his throat in short thick curls his garb was that of a page but more rude than the general habiliments of those usually petted members of noble establishments and favored both hereford and lancasters belief that he was either the son or grandson of his companion ye are welcome fair sirs was the elder earls kindly salutation when his esquire had retired who and what are ye and what crave ye with me we are scotsmen an it so please you noble lords replied the old man followers and retainers of the house of bruce more particularly of him so lately fallen into your power then by mine honor my good friends ye had done wiser to benefit by the liberty i promised and gave to those of his followers who escaped this devastating siege wherefore are ye here in the name of this poor child to beseech a boon my noble lord for me my calling permitteth my going where i list unquestioned unrestrained and if i ask permission to abide with ye scotsman and follower of the bruce as i am i know ye will not say me nay i would not an ye besought such a boon old man answered the earl yet i would advise thee to tempt not thy fate for even thy minstrel garb an thou braggest of thy service to the bruce i cannot promise to be thy safeguard in edwards court whither i give ye notice i wend my way tomorrows dawn for this child what wouldst thouhath he no voice no power of his own to speak the aged minstrel looked at his charge whose eyes were still bent on the floor the heaving of his doublet denoted some internal emotion but ere the old man could answer for him he had made a few hasty steps forward and bent his knee before hereford tis a simple boon i crave my lord he said in a voice so peculiarly sweet that it seemed to impart new beauty to his features a very simple boon yet my lips tremble to ask it for thou mayest deem it more weighty than it seemeth to me and thou alone canst grant it speak it fair child whateer it be replied the earl reassuringly and laying his hand caressingly on the boys head thou art methinks over young to crave a boon we may not grant too young although a scotsman for hereford to treat thee aught but kindly what wouldst thou permission to tend on my young lord sir nigel bruce answered the boy more firmly and for the first time fixing the full gaze of his beautiful eyes on the earls face oh my lord what is there in that simple boon to bid thee knit thy brow as if it must not be he added more agitated the noble hereford cannot fear a child or if he doubted me he cannot doubt the honor of his prisoner an honor pure unsullied as his own thou speakest not as the child thou seemest replied hereford musingly and yet i know not misery makes sager of us long ere the rose of youth hath faded for this thy boon i know not how it may be granted it is not usual to permit other than english attendants on our scottish prisoners since sir niel campbells escape through the agency of his scottish attendant it hath been most strictly prohibited oh do not do not say me nay entreated the boy i ask but to share his imprisonment to be with him serve him tend him i ask no more liberty than is granted unto him the rudest coarsest fare a little straw or the bare ground beside his couch i can do naught to give him freedom and if i could were there an open path before himdid i beseech him on my knees to flyif he hath surrendered as i have heard to thee rescue or no rescue he would scorn my counsel and abide thy prisoner still oh no no i swear to thee i will do naught that can make thee regret thou hast granted an orphans prayer and who art thou that pleadeth thus inquired the earl moved alike by the thrilling sweetness of his voice and the earnestness of his manner thou must have some wondrous interest in him to prefer imprisonment with him to all the joys which liberty can give and i have interest answered the boy fervently the interest of gratitude and faithfulness and love an orphan miserably an orphanalone upon the wide earthhe hath protected cherished aye and honored me with his confidence and love he tended me in sorrow and i would pour back into his noble heart all the love the devotion he hath excited in mine little can i do alas naught but love and serve yet yet i know he would not reject even thishe would let me love him still grant the poor boy his boon whispered lancaster hurriedly of a truth he moveth even me thine heart is of right true mettle my child said his colleague even tenderly yet bethink thee all thou must endure if i grant thy boon not while with me for there would be a foul blot upon my escutcheon did so noble a knight as sir nigel bruce receive aught save respect and honor at my hands but in this business i am but a tool an agent when once within the boundaries of edwards court sir nigel is no longer my prisoner i must resign him to my sovereign and then i dare not give thee hope of gentle treatment either for thyself or him i will brave it answered the boy calmly danger aye death in his service were preferable to my personal liberty with the torture of the thought upon me that i shrunk from his side when fidelity and love were most needed but that very faithfulness that very love my child will make thy fate the harder the scaffold and the axe if not the cord he added in a low stifled tone i fear me will be his doom despite his youth his gallantryall that would make me save him thou turnest pale at the bare mention of such things how couldst thou bear to witness them better than to think of them to sit me down in idle safety and feel that he hath gone forth to this horrible doom and i have done naught to soothe and tend him on his way replied the boy firmly though his very lip blanched at herefords words but must these things be is edward so inexorable aye unto all who thwart him now said the earl there is no hope for any of the race of bruce be advised then gentle boy retain thy freedom while thou mayest no no he answered passionately oh do not seek to fright me from my purpose do not think aught of me save but to grant my boon and oh i will bless thee pray for thee to my dying hour thou wilt i know thou wilt i were no father could i refuse thee my poor child he replied with earnest tenderness alas i fear me thou hast asked but increase of misery yet be it as thou list and yet he added after a brief pause during which the boy had sprung from his knee with an inarticulate cry of joy and flung himself into the minstrels arms sir nigel hath resolutely refused the attendance of any of his former followers who would willingly have attended him to england hast thou so much influence thinkest thou to change his purpose in thy favor i know not answered the boy timidly yet an it please your noble lordship to permit my pleading mine own cause without witness i may prevail as i have done before be it so then replied the earl and now ere we part i would bid thee remember i have trusted thee i have granted that to thee without condition with perfect liberty of action which to others could only have been granted on their surrendering themselves rescue or no rescue even as thy master i have done this trusting to that noble faithfulness the candor and honesty of youth which hath breathed forth in all that thou hast said let me not repent it and now hugo de lorme he called aloud but lancaster himself declared his intention of conducting the boy to sir nigels tent and the esquire was consequently dismissed but ere they departed the boy turned once more to the aged minstrel and thouwhither goest thou he said in low yet thrilling tones my more than father thou hast seen thy childs earnest wish fulfilled that for which thou didst conduct me hither is accomplished yet ere i say farewell tell meoh tell me whither goest thou i know not answered the old man struggling with unexpressed emotion yet think not of me my child i shall be free be safe untouched by aught of personal ill while young and lovely ones for whom it would be bliss to die are crushed and bleeding in their spring the mountains and rocks and woods yet unstained with blood call on me to return and be at rest within their caves the love i bear to thee and him thou seekest hath yet a louder voice to bid me follow ye i know not whither i shall go yet an my vision telleth that thou needst my aid i shall not be far from thee farewell my child and ye truehearted lords the blessing of an aged man repay ye for the kindly deed this day that ye have done he pressed the boy in his arms reverentially saluted the earls and passed from the tent as he spoke a few words passed between the warriors and then lancaster desired the page to follow him in silence they proceeded through the camp avoiding the more bustling parts where the soldiery were evidently busied in preparing for the morrows march and inclining towards the wooded bank of the river the eye of the earl of lancaster had scarcely moved from the page during his interview with hereford though the boy engrossed in his own feelings had failed to remark it he now glanced rapidly and searchingly round him and perceiving the ground perfectly clear not a soldier visible he suddenly paused in his hasty stride and laying his hand heavily on the boys shoulder said in a deep impressive voice i know not who or what thou art but i love thy master and know that he is ill at ease not from captivity but from uncertainty as to the fate of one beloved if it be as i suspect in thy power entirely to remove this uneasiness be cautioned and whoever thou mayest be let not one in this camp from the noble earl of hereford himself to the lowest soldier suspect thou art other than thou seemesta faithful page the rage of edward is deadly and all who bear the name of bruce be it male or female will suffer from that wrath tell this to thy lord i ask not his confidence nor thine nay i would refuse it were it offeredi would know no more than my own thoughts but i honor him aye and from my very heart i honor thee hush not a word in answer my speech is rude but my heart is true and now a few steps more and we are there and without waiting for reply he turned suddenly and the page found himself in the very centre of the camp near the entrance of a small pavilion before which two sentinels were stationed fully armed and pacing up and down their stated posts the pennon of hereford floated from the centre staff above the drapery marking the tent and all its appurtenances peculiarly the earls the watchword was exchanged and the sentinels lowered their arms on recognizing one of their leaders let this boy have egress and ingress from and to this tent unquestioned and unmolested he said he has the earl of herefords permission nay commands to wait on sir nigel bruce his business lieth principally with him but if he hath need to quit his side he is to pass free report this to your comrades the soldiers bowed in respectful acquiescence for thee young man this toy will give thee free passage where thou listeth none shall molest thee and now farewellgod speed thee he unclasped a ruby brooch curiously set in antique gold from his collar and placed it in the boys hand dost thou not enter asked the page in a voice that quivered and the light of the torches falling full on his face disclosed to lancaster a look of such voiceless gratitude it haunted him for many a long day no he said half smiling and in a lower voice hast thou forgotten thy cause was to be pleaded without witness i have not if thou hast i will see thy noble master ere he depart not now thou wilt i trust me take him better comfort than i could he lifted the hangings as he spoke and the boy passed in his heart beating wellnigh to suffocation as he did so it was in a small compartment leading to the principal chamber of the tent he found himself at first and sir nigel was not there with a fleet yet noiseless movement he drew aside the massive curtain let it fall again behind him and stood unperceived in the presence of him he sought the brow of sir nigel rested on his hand his attitude was as one bowed and drooping neath despondency the light of the taper fell full upon his head bringing it out in beautiful profile it was not his capture alone which had made him thus the boy felt and knew the complicated evils which attended his king and country in his imprisonment were yet not sufficient to crush that spirit to the earth it was some other anxiety some yet nearer woe there had been many strange rumors afloat both of sir nigels bridal and the supposed fate of that bride and the boy though he knew them false aye and that the victim of jean roy was a young attendant of agnes who had been collecting together the trinkets of her mistress to save them from the pillage which would attend the conquest of the english and had been thus mistaken by the maniacthe boy we say though he knew this had instead of denying it encouraged the report and therefore was at no loss to discover his masters woe he advanced knelt down and in a trembling husky voice addressed him my lordsir nigel the young knight started and looked at the intruder evidently without recognizing him what wouldst thou he said in a tone somewhat stern who art thou thus boldly intruding on my privacy begone i need thee not the earl of hereford hath permitted me to tend thee follow thee answered the page in the same subdued voice my gracious lord do not thou refuse me tend mefollow me whitherto the scaffold seek some other master my good boy i know thee not and can serve thee little and need no earthly aid an thou seekest noble service go follow hereford he is a generous and knightly lord but i am scotch my lord and would rather follow thee to death than hereford to victory poor child poor child repeated nigel sadly i should know thee methinks an thou wouldst follow me so faithfully and yet i do not what claim have i upon thy love dost thou not know me nigel the boy spoke in his own peculiarly sweet and most thrilling voice and raising his head fixed his full glance upon the knight a wild cry burst from nigels lips he sprang up gazed once again and in another moment the page and knight had sprung into each others arms the arms of the former were twined round the warriors neck and sir nigel had bent down his lordly head burning tears and impassioned kisses were mingled on the soft cheek that leaned against his breast chapter xxi the ancient town of berwickupontweed associated as it is with scottish and english history from the time these two kingdoms had a name presented a somewhat different aspect in the year to that of the present day the key to both countries it was ever a scene of struggle unless the sister kingdoms chanced to be at peace an event in the middle ages of rare occurrence and whoever was its fortunate possessor was undeniably considered as the greater power since the death of alexander it had been captured no less than three times by edward in by wallace the succeeding year and recaptured by the english the following spring to edward consequently it now belonged and many and fearful had been the sanguinary executions its walls had beheld its streets had been deluged with noble scottish blood its prisons filled with the nobles of scotland even highminded women who by their countenance and faithfulness had given a yet higher tone to patriotism and valor were said to be there immured it might have been termed not alone the key but the dungeon and grave of scotland and many a noble spirit which had never quailed in the battles front shrunk back appalled as it neared those dismal walls in the time of edward the fortifications though merely consisting of a deep moat and wooden palisades instead of the stone wall still remaining inclosed a much larger space than the modern town a magnificent castle with its mounts rampiers and flankers its towers walls and courts crowned an easy ascent overhanging the tweed and was at this period peopled by a powerful garrison filled with immense stores both of arms artillery and provisions and many unhappy prisoners who from their lonely turrets could look beyond the silver tweed on their own beautiful land their hearts burning with the vain desire to free her from her chains both square and round towers guarded the palisades and moat surrounding the town which presented a goodly collection of churches hospitals dwellinghouses stores and monastic buildings from all of which crowds were continually passing and repassing on their several ways and forming altogether a motley assemblage of knights nobles menatarms archers the various orders of monks the busy leech from the hospital the peaceful burgher the bustling storekeeper and artisan noble dames and pretty maidensall in the picturesque costumes of the day jostling one another unconscious of the curious effect they each assisted to produce and ever and anon came the trampling of fiery steeds it was a rich thriving bustling town always presenting curious scenes of activity at present apparently under some excitement which the gay knights and their followers tended not a little to increase the popular excitement had strange to say been confined for an unusually long time to one subject orders had been received from king edward for the erection of an extraordinary cage or tower curiously worked in stone and iron on the very highest turret of the castle visible to every eye of a circular form with pyramidal points supporting gilded balls giving it the appearance when completed of a huge coronet or crown it was barred and crossbarred with iron on all sides effectually preventing egress from within but exposing its inmate whoever that might be to every passerby the impatient king had commanded several of the artisans employed in its erection to be thrown into prison because it was not completed fast enough to please him but despite his wrath and impatience the work of fashioning the iron wood and stone as he required occasioned them to proceed but slowly and it was now three months after the royal order had been given only just completed and firmly fixed on the principal turret of the castle day after day the people flocked to gaze and marvel for whom it could be intended and when it would be occupied their thoughts only turned from it by the intelligence that the earl of hereford with some scottish prisoners of high rank was within fourandtwenty hours march of the town and was there to deliver up his captives to the seneschal of the castle the earl of berwick at the same time rumors were afloat that the prisoner for whom that cage had been erected was under a strong guard advancing from carlisle and likely to encounter hereford at the castle gates the popular excitement increased threefold the whole town seemed under the influence of a restless fever utterly preventing the continuance of their usual avocations or permitting them to rest quiet in their houses crowds filled the streets and pressed and fumed to obtain places by the great gates and open squares of the castle through which both parties must pass that wind rain and sunshine alternately ruled the day was a matter of small importance nor did it signify that english soldiers were returning victorious with scottish prisoners being a thing now of most common occurrence before the day was over however they found anticipation for once had been less marvellous than reality and stranger things were seen and heard than they had dreamed of from sunrise till noon they waited and watched and waxed impatient in vain about that time trumpets and drums were heard from the south and there was a general rush towards the bridge and hearts beat high in expectancy of they knew not what as a gallant band of english archers and menatarms headed by some few knights were discovered slowly and solemnly advancing from the carlisle road where and who was the prisoner a person of some consequence of dangerous influence it must be else why had the king made such extraordinary provision for confinement there were not wanting suggestions and guesses and wondrous fancies for as yet there was such a close guard in the centre of the cavalcade that the very person of the prisoner could not be distinguished nay there were some who ventured to hint and believe it might be the excommunicated earl of carrick himself it was most likely for whom else could the cage so exactly like a crown be intended and there were many who vaunted the wise policy of edward at having hit on such an expedient for lowering his rivals pride others indeed declared the idea was all nonsense it was not likely he would incur such expense king as he was merely to mortify a traitor he had sworn to put to death the argument waxed loud and warm meanwhile the cavalcade had crossed the bridge been received through the south gate and in the same slow and solemn pomp proceeded through the town by all the saints it is only a woman was the information shouted by an eager spectator who had clambered above the heads of his fellows to obtain the first and most coveted view his words were echoed in blank amazement aye clothed in white like a penitent with her black hair streaming all over her shoulders without any covering on her head at all and nothing but a thin torn sandal on her bare feet and the knights look black as thunder as if they like not the business they are engaged in it was even so there was an expression on the face of the officers impossible to be misunderstood frowningly darkly they obeyed their sovereigns mandate simply because they dared not disobey but there was not one among them who would not rather have sought the most deadly front of battle than thus conduct a woman aye and a most noble one unto her prison the very men rude stern as they mostly were shared this feeling they guarded her with lowered heads and knitted brows and if either officer or manatarms had to address her it was with an involuntary yet genuine movement and manner of respect that little accorded with their present relative position the crowds looked first at the cavalcade and marvelled then at the prisoner and they did not marvel more clad as she was in white flowing garments very similar to those worn by penitents her head wholly undefended from cold or rain even by a veil her long luxuriant jetblack hair in which as yet despite of care and woe no silver thread had mingled falling round her from her noble brow which shone forth from its shade white as snow and displaying that most perfect face which anguish had only chiselled into paler purer marble it could not rob it of its beauty that beauty which is the holy emanation of the soul that lingered still with power to awe the rudest heart to bow the proudest in voluntary respect the sovereign of england had commanded this solemn procession and its degrading accompaniments to humble to crush to dust the woman who had dared defy his power but it was himself alone he humbled as she walked there surrounded by guards by gazing hundreds on foot and but protected from the flinty ground by a thin sandal her step was as firm and unfaltering her attitude her bearing as dignified as calmly imposingly majestic as when in the midst of scotlands patriots she had placed the crown on the bruces head edward sought to debase her but she was not debased to compel her to regret the part that she had acted but she gloried in it still to acknowledge his powerbut in all he failed calmly and majestically the countess of buchan proceeded on her way neither looking to the right or left nor evincing by the slightest variation of countenance her consciousness of the many hundreds gazing on or that they annoyed or disturbed her her spirit was wrapt in itself we should assert falsehood did we say she did not suffer she did but it was a mothers agony heightened by a patriots grief she believed her son who had been in truth the idol of her mourning heart had indeed fallen her agnes was not amongst the queens train of whose captivity she had been made aware though not allowed speech with them where was shewhat would be her fate she only knew her as a lovely fragile flower liable to be crushed under the first storm and pictured her rudely severed from nigel perchance in the hands of some lawless spoiler and heartbroken dying shuddering with anguish she thought not of her own fateshe thought but of her children of her country and if king robert did enter these visions it was simply as her sovereign as one whose patriotism would yet achieve the liberty of scotland but there was a dimness even oer that dream for the figure of her noble boy was gone naught but a blankdull shapelessoccupied that spot in the vision of the future which once his light had filled the castleyard was at length gained and a half and some change in the line of march ensued the officers and men formed in a compact crescent leaving the countess a herald trumpeters and some of the highest knights in front so intense was the interest of the crowd at this moment that they did not heed the rapid advance of a gallant body of horse and foot from the north except to rail at the pressure they occasioned in forcing their way through they gained the castleyard at length and there halted and fell back in utter astonishment at the scene they witnessed the herald had drawn a parchment from his belt and made a step forward as if to speak the knights in sullen silence leant upon their sheathed swords without even glancing at their prisoner who appeared far the most composed and dignified of all present and after a brief pause words to this effect were distinguished by the crowd to our loyal and loving subjects of both north and south britain edward by the grace of god king of england wales france and scotland greeting whereas isabella born of fife and late of buchan which latter she hath by foul dishonor and utter disregard of marriage vows now forfeited hath done traitorously and disloyally alike to her sovereign lord the king and to her gracious lord and husband john earl of buchan whom for his fidelity we hold in good favor as she hath not struck by the sword so she shall not perish by the sword but for her lawless conspiracy she shall be shut up in a stone and iron chamber circular as the crown she gave in this proclaiming to both countries her everlasting infamy and this we do in mercy for whereas she deserveth death we do remit the same and give her time to repent her of her heinous crime given at our palace of carlisle this twentythird day of february in the year of our lord and saviour one thousand three hundred and seven god save the king but the loyal ejaculation was not echoed nay the herald himself had read the proclamation as if every word had been forced from him and the eyes of every knight and soldier had been fixed upon the ground as if shame rested on them rather than on their prisoner a dead silence for a few minutes followed broken only by some faint cries of god save king edward and down with all traitors which seemed raised more to drown the groans which involuntarily burst forth than as the echo of the heart they dared not evince the faintest sign of disapproval for they stood on precarious ground a groan even might be punished by their irritable king as treachery but there was one present who cared little for this charge scarcely had the words passed the heralds lips before a young man whose bare head and lack of all weapons would have proclaimed him one of the earl of herefords prisoners had not the attention of all been turned from him by the one engrossing object now snatching a sword from a soldier near him sprung from his horse and violently attacking the herald exclaimed in a voice of thunder liar and slave thinkest thou there is none near to give the lie to thy foul slandersnone to defend the fair fame the stainless honor of this muchabused lady dastard and coward fit mouthpiece of a dishonored and blasphemous tyrant go tell him his prisoneraye nigel brucethrusts back his foul lies into his very teeth ha coward and slave wouldst thou shun me a scene of indescribable confusion now ensued the herald a man not much in love with war stood cowering and trembling before his adversary seeking to cover himself with his weapon but from his trembling hold ineffectually the stature of the youthful scotsman appeared towering as he stood over him with his uplifted sword refusing to strike a defenceless man but holding him with a gripe of iron his cheek flushed crimson his nostrils distended for his soul was moved with a mightier darker passion than had ever stirred its depths before the soldiers of both parties joined too by some from the castlefor a party headed by the earl of berwick himself had attended to give countenance to the proclamationrushed forward but involuntarily fell back awed for the moment by the mighty spirit of one man the knights roused from their sullen posture looked much as if they would if they dared have left the herald to his fate hereford and berwick at the same instant spurred forward their steeds the one exclaiming madman let go your holdyou are tempting your own fate nigel for the love of heaven for the sake of those that love you be not so rash the other thundering forth cut down the traitor an he will not loose his hold forward cowardly knaves will ye hear your king insulted and not revenge itforward i say fear ye a single man and numbers spurred on by his words dashed forward to obey him but fearlessly sir nigel bruce retained his hold with his left hand and with his right grasped tighter his sword and stood with the fierce undaunted port of a lion lashed into fury gazing on his foes but ere he had crossed with the foremost weapons a slight lad burst through the gathering crowd and with a piercing shriek threw himself at his masters feet and grasping his knees seemed by his pleading looks for his words were inaudible imploring him to desist from his rashness at the same moment another form pressed through the soldiers her look her mien compelling them involuntarily to open their ranks and give her passage the sword of nigel was in the act of falling on a second foe the first lay at his feet when his arm was caught in its descent and isabella of buchan stood at his side forbear she said in those rich impressive tones that ever forced obedience nigel bruce brother of my sovereign friend of my son forbear strike not one blow for me mine honor needs no defence by those that love me my country will acquit me the words of englands monarch angered at a womans defiance of his power affect me not noble nigel excite not further wrath against thyself by this vain struggle for my sake put up thy sword ere it is forced from thee let go thy hold this man is but an instrument why wreak thy wrath on him must i speak implore in vain nay then i do command thee and those who gazed on her as she drew that stately form to its full height as they heard those accents of imperative command scarce marvelled that edward should dread her influence woman as she was despite the increasing wrath on the earl of berwicks brow the men waited to see the effect of these words there was still an expression of illcontrolled passion on nigels features he waited one moment when she ceased to speak then slowly and deliberately shook the herald by the collar and hurled him from his hold snapped his sword in twain and flinging it from him folded his arms on his breast and calmly uttering pardon me noble lady mine honor were impugned had i suffered that dastardly villain to pass hence unpunishedlet edward act as he lists it matters little now waited with impenetrable resolve the rage he had provoked nigel nigel rash impetuous boy what hast thou done exclaimed the countess losing all mien and accent of command in the terror with which she clung round him as if to protect him from all ill in the tone and look of maternal tenderness with which she addressed him why why must it be my ill fate to hurl down increase of misery and danger on all whom i love speak not so noble lady in mercy do not he whispered in reply keep that undaunted spirit shown but now i can better bear it than this voice of anguish and thou he added laying his hand on the shoulder of the boy who still clung to his knees as if fascinated there by speechless terror and gazed alternately on him and the countess with eyes glazed almost in madness up up this is no place for thee what can they do with me but slaylet them come onbetter far better than a scaffold but the boy moved not nigel spoke in vain the fate he dared seemed indeed threatening wrought wellnigh to phrensy at this daring insult to his sovereign in whose acts of cruelty and oppression he could far better sympathize than in his more knightly qualities the earl of berwick loudly and fiercely called on his soldiers to advance and cut down the traitor to bring the heaviest fetters and bear him to the lowest dungeon the men roused from their stupor of amaze rushed on impetuously to obey him their naked swords already gleamed round nigel the countess of buchan was torn from his side her own especial guards closing darkly around her but vainly did they seek to unclasp the convulsive grasp of the boy from nigel he neither shrieked nor spake but he remained in that one posture rigid as stone fiends monsters would ye dare ye touch a boy a child as this shouted nigel struggling with herculean strength to free himself from the rude grasp of the soldiers as he beheld the sharp steel pointed at the breast of the boy to compel him to unloose his hold villains cowards bear back and let me speak with him and nerved to madness by the violence of his emotions he suddenly wrenched himself away the rapidity of the movement throwing one of the men to the earth and bent over the boy again they rushed forward they closed upon him they tore away the lad by force of numbers and flung him senseless on the earth they sought to bear away their prisoner but at that moment hereford who had been parleying loudly and wrathfully with berwick spurred his charger in the very midst of them and compelled them to bear back back back he exclaimed making a path for himself with his drawn sword how dare ye thrust yourselves betwixt me and my lawful prisoner captive of my sword and power what right have ye to dare detain him let go your hold none but the men whose prowess gained this gallant prize shall guard him till my sovereigns will be known back back i say traitor retorted berwick he is no longer your prisoner an insult offered to king edward in the loyal citadel of berwick in my very presence his representative as i stand shall meet with fit retribution he hath insulted his sovereign by act and word and i attach him of high treason and will enforce my charge forward i say and i say back shouted the earl of hereford i tell thee proud earl he is my prisoner and mine alone thou mayest vaunt thy loyalty thy representation of majesty as thou listeth mine hath been proved at the good swords point and edward will deem me no traitor because i protect a captive who hath surrendered himself a knight to a knight rescue or no rescue from this unseemly violence i bandy no more words with such as thee back the first man that dares lay hold on him i chastise with my sword thou shalt repent this muttered berwick with a suppressed yet terrible oath but he dared proceed no further a signal from their leader brought up all herefords men who in compact order and perfect silence surrounded their prisoner sternly the earl called for a pair of handcuffs and with his own hands fastened them on his captive it grieves me he said to see a brave man thus manacled but thine own mad act hath brought it on thyself and now my lord of berwick an it please thee to proceed we demand admission to thy citadel in king edwards name bring up the other prisoners concealing his wrath with difficulty the earl of berwick and his attendants dashed forward over the drawbridge into the castle at full speed closing the gates and lowering the portcullis after them after a brief space the portcullis was again raised the gates flung wide apart and the menatarms were discerned lining either side in all due form and homage to the officers of their sovereign during the wrathful words passing between the two earls the attention of the crowd had been given alternately to them and to the countess of buchan who had utterly forgotten her own precarious situation in anxiety for nigel and in pity for the unfortunate child who had been hurled by the soldiers close to the spot where she stood do not leave him there he will be trampled on she said imploringly to the officers beside her he can do no harm poor child scotch though he be a little water only bring me a little water and he will speedily recover all she desired was done the boy was tenderly raised and brought within the circle of her guards and laid on the ground at her feet she knelt down beside him chafed his cold hands within her own and moistened his lips and brow with water after a while his scattered senses returned he started up in a sitting posture and gazed in wild inquiry around him uttering a few inarticulate words and then saying aloud sir nigel my lord mymymaster where is he oh let me go to him why am i here thou shalt go to him poor boy as soon as thy strength returns an they have let thee follow him from scotland surely they will not part ye now said the countess soothingly and her voice seemed to rouse the lad into more consciousness he gazed long in her face with an expression which at that time she could not define but which startled and affected her and she put her arm round him and kissed his brow a convulsive almost agonized sob broke from the boys breast and caused his slight frame to shake as with an ague then suddenly he knelt before her and in accents barely articulate murmured bless me oh bless me while another word seemed struggling for utterance but checked with an effort which caused it to die on his lips in indistinct murmurs bless thee poor child from my very heart i do if the blessing of one sorrowing and afflicted as myself can in aught avail thee for thy faithfulness to thy master i bless thee for it speaketh well for thee and that face would bid me love and bless thee for thyself i know not wherefore good angels keep and bless thee gentle boy thou hast isabellas prayers and may they give thee peace pray for me aye pray for me repeated the boy in the same murmured tones he clasped her hands in both his he pressed them again and again to his lips repeated sobs burst from his laboring breast and then he sprung up darted away and stood at sir nigels side just as the earl of hereford had commanded his men to wheel a little to the right to permit the countess of buchan her guards and officers free passage over the drawbridge and first entrance within the fortress the brow of this noble son of chivalry darkened as sitting motionless on his tall steed his gaze rested on the noble woman whom it had originally been his painful charge to deliver over to his sovereign he had not dreamed of a vengeance such as this he could not have believed a change so dark as this had fallen on the character of a sovereign whom he still loved still sought to admire and revere and his spirit sunk neath the sorrow this conviction caused almost involuntarily as the procession slowly proceeded and the countess passed within three paces of his horses head he bent his lordly brow in silent homage she saw it and returned it more effected by the unfeigned commiseration on that warriors face than at aught which had occurred to shame and humble her that morning a brief pause took place in the movements of the officers and their prisoners when they reached the great hall of the castle for a brief minute lady seaton and the countess of buchan had met had clasped hands in sad yet eager greeting my child mine agnes had been by the latter hurriedly whispered and the answer safe i trust safe just permitted to reach her ear when roughly and fiercely the earl of berwick summoned the lady of buchan to proceed to the chamber appointed for her use those simple words had however removed a load of anxiety from her mind for they appeared to confirm what she had sometimes permitted herself to hope that agnes had shared king roberts exile under the care of lady campbell prevailed on to do so perchance by the entreaties of nigel who in all probability had deemed that course though one of hardship less perilous than remaining with him she hoped indeed against her better judgment for though she knew not the depth the might of her daughters feelings she knew it must have been a terrible trial so to part and she absolutely shuddered when she thought of the whelming blow it would be to that young heart when the fate of her betrothed was ascertained lady seaton had spoken as she believed no communication had been permitted between the prisoners on their way to england indeed from sir christophers wounded and exhausted state he had travelled more leisurely in a litter always in the rear of the earls detachment and occupied by her close attendance upon him his wife had scarcely been aware of the young page ever in attendance on her brother or deemed him if she did observe him a retainer of herefords own there was so much of fearful peril and misery hovering over her in her husbands fate that it was not much wonder her thoughts lingered there more than on agnes and that she was contented to believe as she had spoken that she at least was safe night fell on the town of berwick silence and darkness had come on her brooding wings the varied excitement of the day was now but a matter of wondering commune round the many blazing hearths where the busy crowds of the morning had now gathered night came with her closing pall her softened memories her sleeping visions and sad waking dreams she had come alike to the mourned and mourner the conqueror and his captive the happy and the wretched she had found the earl of berwick pacing up and down his stately chamber his curtained couch unsought devising schemes to lower the haughty pride of the gallant warrior whom he yet feared she had looked softly within the room where that warrior lay and found him too sleepless but not from the same dark dreams he grieved for his sovereign for the fate of one noble spirit shrined in a womans form and restless and fevered turned again and again within his mind how he might save from a yet darker doom the gallant youth his arms had conquered and not alone on them did night look down she sent her sweet reviving influence on the rays of a bright liquid star through the narrow casement which gave light to the rude unfurnished chamber where sir nigel bruce and his attendant lay they had not torn that poor faithful child from his side herefords last commands had been that they should not part them and there they now lay and sleep balmy sleep had for them descended on the wings of night hovering over that humble pallet of straw when from the curtained couch of power the downy bed of luxury she fled there they lay but it was the boy who lay on the pallet of straw his head pillowed by the arm of the knight who sat on a wooden settle at his side he had watched for a brief space those troubled slumbers but as they grew calmer and calmer he had pressed one light kiss on the soft yielding cheek and then leant his head on his breast and he too slepteven in sleep tending one beloved and in the dark close sleepingchamber within the prison cage of the noble countess of buchan night too looked pityingly sleep indeed was not there it had come and gone for in a troubled slumber a dream had come of agnes and she had woke to think upon her child and pray for her and as she prayed she thought of her promise to the poor boy who had so strangely moved her she could not trace how one thought had sprung from the other nor why in the darkness his features so suddenly flashed before her but so it was his face seemed to gleam upon her with the same strange indefinable expression which even at the time had startled her and then a sudden flash appeared to illumine that darkness of bewilderment she started up from her reclining posture she pressed both hands on her throbbing eyeballs a wild sickening yearning took possession of her whole soul and then she felt in its full bitterness she was a chained and guarded prisoner and the deep anguish of her spirit found vent in the convulsive cry fool fool that i wasmy child my child chapter xxii leaving the goodly town of berwick and its busy citizens its castle and its prisoners for a brief space we must now transport our readers to a pleasant chamber overlooking the eden in the castle of carlisle now a royal residence a fact which from its numerous noble inmates its concourse of pages esquires guards and various other retainers of a royal establishment the constant ingress and egress of richlyattired courtiers the somewhat bustling yet deferential aspect of the scene a very cursory glance would have been allsufficient to prove it had been with a full determination to set all obstacles even disease itself at defiance king edward some months before had quitted winchester and directed his march towards the north vowing vengeance on the rebellious and disaffected scots and swearing death alone should prevent the complete and terrible extermination of the traitors he had proceeded in this spirit to carlisle disregarding the threatening violence of disease so sustained by the spirit of disappointed ambition within as scarcely to be conscious of an almost prostrating increase of weakness and exhaustion he had determined to make a halt of some weeks at carlisle to wait the effect of the large armies he had sent forward to overrun scotland and to receive intelligence of the measures they had already taken here then disease as if enraged that he should have borne up so long that his spirit had mastered even her convened the whole powers of suffering and compelled him not alone to acknowledge but to writhe beneath her sway his whole frame was shaken intolerable pains took possession of him and though the virulence of the complaint was at length so far abated as to permit him a short continuance of life he could never sit his horse again or even hope to carry on in his own person his plans for the total reduction of scotland but as his frame weakened as he became the victim of almost continual pain all the darker and fiercer passions of his nature gained yet more fearful ascendency the change had been some time gathering but within the last twelve months its effects were such that his noblest most devoted knights blind as their affection for his person rendered them could scarce recognize in the bloodthirsty ambitious tyrant they now beheld their gallant generous humane and most chivalric sovereign who had won golden opinions from all sorts and conditions of men who had performed the duties of a son and husband so as to fix the eyes of all europe on him in admiration who had swayed the sceptre of his mighty kingdom with such a powerful and fearless hand it had been long since england had acquired such weight in the scale of kingdoms wise moderate merciful even in strict justice as he had been could it be that ambition had wrought such change that disease had banished every feeling from his breast save this one dark fiendlike passion for the furtherance of which or in revenge of its disappointment noble blood flowed like waterthe brave the good the young the old the noble and his follower alike fell before the axe or the cord of the executioner could it indeed be that edward once such a perfect glorious scion of chivalry had now shut up his heart against its every whisper lest it should interfere with his brooding visions of revenge forgot each feeling lest he should involuntarily sympathize with the noble and knightly spirit of the patriots of scotland whom he had sworn to crush alas it was even so ruthless and tyrannical the nobles he had once favored once loved now became odious to him for their presence made him painfully conscious of the change within himself and he now associated but with spirits dark fierce cruel as his ownmen he would once have shunned have banished from his court as utterly unworthy of his favor it was then in a royallyfurnished chamber pleasantly overlooking the river eden and the adjoining country that about a week after the events narrated in the preceding chapter king edward reclined his couch was softly and luxuriously cushioned and not a little art had been expended in the endeavor to lighten his sufferings and enable him to rest at ease the repeated contraction of his countenance however betrayed how impotent was even luxury when brought in contact with disease the richlyfurred and wadded crimson velvet robe could not conceal the attenuation of his once peculiarly fine and noble form his great length of limb which had gained him and handed down to posterity the inelegant surname of longshanks rendered his appearance yet more gaunt and meagre while his features which once from the benignity and nobleness of his character had been eminently handsome now pale thin and pointed seemed to express but the one passion of his soulits gratification of revenge his expansive brow was now contracted and stern rendered more so perhaps by the lack of hair about the temples he wore a black velvet cap circled coronetwise with large diamonds from which a white feather drooped to his shoulder there was a slight scarcely visible sneer resting on his features that morning called forth perhaps by his internal scorn of the noble with whom he had deigned a secret conference but the earl of buchan had done him good service had ably forwarded his revenge and he would not therefore listen to that still voice of scorn soh she is secure and your desires on that head accomplished sir earl he said in continuance of some subject they had been discussing thou hast done us good service and by mine honor it would seem we have done your lordship the same aye muttered the earl whose dark features had not grown a whit more amiable since we last beheld him aye we are both avenged how sir i darest thou place thyself on a par with me angrily retorted edward thinkest thou the sovereign of england can have aught in common with such as thee isabella of buchan or of fife an thou likest that better is debased imprisoned because she hath dared insult our person defy our authority to act treasonably and mischievously and sow dissension and rebellion amid our scottish subjectsfor this she is chastised an it gratify your matrimonial revenge i am glad ont but edward of england brooks no equality with comyn of buchan though it be but equality in revenge buchan bent his knee and humbly apologized well well let it be thou hast served us too faithfully to be quarrelled with for perchance unintentional irreverence the imposition of her childs murder when he lives and is well is the coinage of thine own brain sir earl and thou must reconcile it to thine own conscience we hold ourselves exempt from all such peculiar mercy for we scarce see its wisdom there was a slight bitterness in edwards tone wisdom my sovereign liege deemest thou there is no wisdom in revenge and the brow of the earl grew dark with passion as he spoke have i naught to punish naught to avenge in this foul traitressnaught that her black treachery has extended to my son my heir even to his tender years i would not have her death no let her live and feed on the belief that her example her counsels have killed her own child that had it not been for her he might have lived been prosperous aye and happy now is there no wisdom in such revenge and if there be none save that which my own heart feels i could give your grace another and a better reason for this proceeding speak it in st georges name replied the king of a truth thou art of most clear conception in all schemes of vengeance i might have thought long enough ere i could have lighted on such as this what more simply your grace that by encouraging a little while the report of his death his friends in scotland will forget that he ever existed and make no effort for his rescue which belief wild and unfounded as it is i imagine supports him in his strenuous determination to live and die a traitor to your highness i have no hatred to the boy nay an he would let me could love and be proud of him now his mother cannot cross my path and would gladly see him devoted as myself to the interests of your grace nor do i despair of this he is very young and his character cannot be entirely formed he will tire in time of dark and solitary confinement and gladly accept any conditions i may offer gives he any proof as yet of this yielding mood by mine honor no your highness he is firm and steadfast as the ocean rock then wherefore thinkest thou he will change in time because as yet my gracious liege the foul treacherous principles of his mother have not ceased to work an entire cessation of intercourse between them will show him his mistake at last and this could never be did she know he lived imprisoned guarded as she is she would yet find some means of communication with him and all my efforts would be of no avail let a year roll by and i will stake my right hand that alan of buchan becomes as firm a supporter and follower of king edward as ever his father was is the boy more than mortal and does your grace think life liberty riches honors will not weigh against perpetual imprisonment and daily thoughts of death so spoke the earl of buchan judging as most men others by himself utterly unable to comprehend the high glorious selfdevoted patriotic spirit of his noble son he persevered in his course of fiendlike cruelty excusing it to his own conscience if he had any by the belief it would end but in his sons goodan end indeed he seldom thought of attaining but there was something in the idea of a son an heir and one so prepossessing in appearance as alan of buchan that touched his pride the only point on which his flinty heart was vulnerable so thou thinkest sir earl resumed the king who perhaps in his own secret soul did not entirely think with him meanwhile the stripling may laugh thy parental care to scorn by escaping from iron chains and stone walls and seeking out the arch rebel bruce make up at the swords point for lost time beware sir earl an he be taken again thus in arms against us even thy loyal services will not save his head i should not even ask your graces clemency replied the earl his features assuming a fearful expression as he spoke an he thus turned traitor again to his fathers house spurning mine and your graces favor to join the base murderer of his kinsman he shall be no more to me than others whose treason hath cost their heads but i have no fear of this he cannot escape guarded as he is by alike the most ruthless and the most faithful of my followers and while there if all else fail i will publish that he lives but so poison the ears of his rebel scottish friends against him he will not dare not join them and in his own despite will be compelled to act as befitting his fathers son trust me my liege to thy royal clemency i owe his life be it my duty then to instil into him other principles than those which actuated him before but your own character my lord meanwhile care ye naught for the stain supposed to rest upon it thy plans sound wise and we thank thee for thy loyalty but we would not ye burdened your name with a deed not its own an ye cared for the worlds applause not a whit not a whit your highness countenanced by your graces favor absolved in your opinion from the barbarity others charge me with i care not for them i have been too long mine own consciencekeeper to heed the whispers of the world he added his dark brows knitting closer as he spoke edward smiled grimly be it so then he said my lord of buchan we understand each other an that boy escapes and rejoins the traitors and is taken his head answers for it an ye succeed in making him loyal as yourself as eager a pursuer of the murderous traitor bruce we will give thee the palm for policy and wisdom in our court ourself not excepted and now another question it was reported isabella of buchan joined the rebels court with her two children who and where is the second we have heard but of one a puny spiritless wench as i have heard my liege one little likely to affect your highness and not worth the seeking nay an she hath her mothers influence we differ from thee sir earl and would rather see her within the walls of our court than in the traitors train i remember not her name amid those taken with the bruces wife hast inquired aught concerning her not i your grace carelessly replied the earl of a truth i had weightier thoughts than the detention or interest of a simple wench who if her mother has taught to forget me as her father is not worth my remembering as a child i give you joy of your most fatherly indifference sir earl answered the king with an illsuppressed sneer it would concern you little if she takes unto herself a husband midst your foes the rebel robert hath goodly brothers and the feud between thy house and theirs may but impart a double enjoyment to the union the earl started as if an adder had stung him she dare not do this thing he said fiercely she will notshe dare not a thousand curses light upon her head even if she dreams it nay waste not thy breath in curses good my lord but up an prevent the very possibility of such a thing an it move thee so deeply i say not it is but some such floating rumor has reached my ears i can scarce trace how save through the medium of our numerous prisoners but how obtain informationwhere seek her i pray you pardon me your grace but there are a thousand furies in the thought and scarcely could the consciousness of the royal presence restrain the rage which gathered on the swarthy features of the earl from finding vent in words nay nay my lord let not your marvellous wisdom and sage indifference be so speedily at fault an she be not in margaret bruces train that goodly dame may give thee some information seek her and may be thou wilt learn more of this wench than thou hast since her birth in pity to this sudden interest we grant thee permission to visit these partners of treason in their respective convents and learn what thou canst an she be within thy reach be advised and find her a husband thyself the best find most speedy means of eradicating her mothers counsels buchans reply was arrested on his lips by the entrance of the royal chamberlain announcing that the earl of berwick had arrived in all haste from berwick and earnestly besought a few minutes audience with his sovereign berwick repeated edward half raising himself in his surprise from his reclining posture berwick what the foul fiend brings him from his post at such a time bid him enter haste i charge thee his impatient command was speedily obeyed the earl of berwick was close on the heels of the chamberlain and now appeared his lowly obeisance not concealing from the quick eye of his master that wrath black as a thundercloud was resting on his brow how now said the king what means this unseemly gear sir earl thou must have neither rested spur nor slackened rein methinks an thy garb tell truth and wherefore seekest thou our presence in such fiery haste wouldst thou be private my lord of buchan thou hadst best follow our counsel ere thy interest cools nay your grace bid not yon noble earl depart to grant me hearing i would speak before him aye and the whole court were it needed tis but to lay the sword and mantle with which your highness invested me as governor of the citadel of berwick at your graces feet and beseech you to accept my resignation of the same with wellaffected humility the earl of berwick unclasped his jewelled mantle and kneeling down laid it with his sheathed sword at king edwards feet remaining on his knee art craven fool or traitor demanded edward when his astonishment permitted words what means this speak out and instantly we are not wont to be thus trifled with my lord of berwick wherefore dost thou do this not because i am a craven good my liege replied the nobleman still on his knee for had i been so king edwards penetration would have discovered it ere he intrusted me with so great a chargenor because i am a witless fool unconscious of the high honor i thus tamely resignand not because i am a traitor gracious sovereign for tis from insult and interruption in the arrest of a blasphemous traitor i am here insultinterruption fiercely exclaimed the king starting up who has daredwho loves his life so little as to do this but speak on speak on we listen pardon me your highness i came to tender my resignation not an accusation resumed the wily earl cautiously lashing his sovereign into fury aware that it was much easier to gain what he wished in such moods than as he found him now i came but to beseech your highness to resume that which your own royal hands had given me my authority trampled upon my loyalty insulted my zeal in your graces service derided my very men compelled perforce of arms to disobey me and this by one high in your graces estimation nay connected with your royal self surely my gracious liege i do but right in resigning the high honor your highness bestowed i can have little merit to retain it and such things be but they shall not be sir as there is a god above us they shall not be exclaimed the king in towering wrath and striking his hand on a small table of crystal near him with such violence as to shiver it to pieces by heaven and hell they shall repent this be it mine own son who hath been thus insolent speak out i tell thee as thou lovest thy life speak out drive me not mad by this cautiouslyworded tale who hath dared trample on authority mine own hand and seal hath givenwho is the traitor speak out i charge thee and strengthened by his own passion the king sate upright on his couch clenching his hand till the blood sprung and fixing his dark fiery eyes on the earl it was the mood he had tried for and now artfully and speciously with many additions he narrated all that had passed the preceding day in the castleyard of berwick fiercer and fiercer waxed the wrath of the king fling him in the lowest dungeon load him with the heaviest fetters hands can forge were the words first distinguished when passion permitted articulation the villain the blackfaced traitor it is not enough he hath dared raise arms against me but he must beard me to the very teeth defy me in my very palace throw scorn upon me maltreat an officer of mine own person is there no punishment but death for this foul insolence as there is a god in heaven he shall feel my vengeance ere he reach the scaffoldfeel it aye till death be but too welcome he sunk back exhausted by his own violence but not a minute passed ere again he burst forth and hereford the traitor hereford he dared defend him dared assault thee in the pursuance of thy duty the audacious insolent doth he think forsooth his work in scotland will exempt him from the punishment of insolence of treason as an aider and abettor of treachery he shares its guilt and shall know whom he hath insulted back to thy citadel my lord of berwick see to the strict incarceration of this foul branch of treachery aye and look well about ye lest any seditious citizen or soldier hath by look or word given aught of encouragement or failed in due respect to our proclamation an hereford abet the traitor others may be but too willing to do the like by heaven they shall share his fate bid hereford hither on the instant say naught of having been beforehand with him i would list the insolents own tale rest thee a brief while my lord and our great seal shall insure thee prompt obedience bid sir edmund stanley attend us my lord of buchan i need scarce warn a comyn to be secret on what has passed i would not have the foul insolence cast into our teeth as yet proclaimed begone both of ye we would be a brief space alone the deadly pallor which had usurped the flush of fury on the monarchs cheek afforded such strong evidence of a sharp renewal of his internal pains that both noblemen hesitated to obey the damp of agony stood upon his forehead a moment in large drops then absolutely poured down his cheeks while his gaunt frame shook with the effort to suppress the groan which his throes wrung from him seizing a cordial near him buchan presented it on his knee but edward only waved them both away angrily and impatiently pointing to the door he loved not the weakness of an appalling disease to be witnessed by his courtiers when utterly incapacitated from either the appearance or functions of the sovereign he chose to be alone his pride scarcely brooking even the cares of his young and beautiful wife or the yet wiser and truer affection of his daughters the effects of this interview will be seen in a future chapter chapter xxiii there was an expression of both sorrow and care on the fine and winning features of the princess joan countess of gloucester as she sat busied in embroidery in an apartment of carlisle castle often pausing to rest her head upon her hand and glance out of the broad casement near which she sat not in admiration of the placid scene which stretched beyond but in the mere forgetfulness of uneasy thought long the favorite daughter of king edward perchance because her character more resembled that of her mother queen eleanor than did either of her sisters she had till lately possessed unbounded influence over him not only his affection but his pride was gratified in her for he saw much of his own wisdom penetration and high sense of honor reflected upon her far more forcibly than in his weak and yielding son but lately the change which had so painfully darkened the character and actions of her father had extended even to her her affection for a long time blinded her to this painful truth but by slow degrees it became too evident to be mistaken and she had wept many bitter tears less perhaps for herself than for her father whom she had almost idolized his knightly qualities his wisdom the good he had done his country all were treasured up by her and rejoiced in with neverfailing delight his reputation his popularity were dear to her even as her noble husbands she had not only loved she had reverenced him as some superior being who had come but to do good to leave behind him through succeeding ages an untarnished name enshrined in such love england would be long ere she spoke it without tears and now alas she had outlived such dreams her reverence lingering still had been impaired by deeds of blood her pride in him crushed naught but a daughters love remaining which did but more strongly impress upon her heart the fatal change and now the last blow was given he shunned her scarcely ever summoned her to his presence permitted the wife of a day to tend him in his sufferings rather than the daughter of his former love one hallowed by the memories of her mother the beloved and faithful partner of his youth it was not however these thoughts which entirely engrossed her now not undivided sorrows her sister elizabeth the countess of hereford had just left her plunged in the deepest distress from the extraordinary fact that her husband summoned seemingly in all amity by the king had been arrested by the lord marshal of england as an aider and abettor of treason and was now in strict confinement within the castle not permitted to embrace his wife and children whom he had not seen since his arrival from scotland where he had so gallantly assisted the cause of edward and whence he had but just returned in triumph no other cause was assigned saving having given countenance to treason and leze majeste but that the irritation of the king had prohibited all hope of present pardonshe lady hereford though his own daughter having been refused admission to his presence both the earl and countess of gloucester had anxiously striven to comfort the anxious wife conquering their own fears to assure her that hers were groundless that though from some mysterious cause at present irritated as they knew too well a trifle made him now hereford was too good and loyal a subject for the king to proceed to extremities whatever might have been his fault rumors of the confusion at berwick had indeed reached carlisle and it was to have them confirmed or denied or connected with some appearance of veracity the earl of gloucester had quitted the royal sisters determining to use his influence with his sovereign even to dare his wrath for the release of hereford whose good services in scotland deserved a somewhat different recompense lady hereford too anxious and dispirited to remain long in one place soon departed to seek the youthful margaret of france her fathers beautiful wife and beseech her influence with him either for the pardon of her husband or at least communication with him it was these sad thoughts which engrossed the princess joan and they lingered too on herefords prisoner the brave and noble nigel for both to her husband and herself he had been in his boyhood an object not only of interest but of love his beauty his extraordinary talents had irresistibly attracted them and yet scarcely could they now believe the youthful knight with whose extraordinary valor not only scotland but england rung could be that same enthusiast boy that he had been taken was now a prisoner in berwick castle on whom sentence of death sooner or later would be passed brought conviction but too sadly to their hearts and made them feel yet more bitterly their influence with edward was of no account hast thou succeeded gilbert oh say that poor elizabeth may at least be permitted access to her husband was the countesss eager salutation to her husband as he silently approached her he shook his head sorrowfully alas not even this edward is inexorable possessed by i know not what spirit of opposition and wrath furiously angered against hereford to the utter forgetfulness of all his gallant deeds in scotland but wherefore what can have chanced in this brief period to occasion this but a few days since he spoke of hereford as most loyal and deserving aye that was on the news of kildrummies surrender now forgotten from anger at a deed which but a few years back he would have been the first to have admired that rash madman nigel bruce hath not only trebly sealed his own fate but hurled down this mishap on his captor and briefly he narrated all he had learned it was indeed a rash action gilbert yet was it altogether unnatural alas no the boy had had no spark of chivalry or patriotism about him had he stood tamely by and gloucester she added with bitter tears years back would my father have given cause for thiswould he thus have treated an unhappy woman thus have added insult to misery for an act which shown to other than his rival he would have honored aye not alone the deed but the doer of it if we his own children feel shamed and indignant at this cruelty oh what must be the feelings of her countrymen her friends then thou believest not the foul slander attached to the countess of buchan my joan believe it she answered indignantly who that has looked on that noble womans face can give it the smallest credence no gilbert no tis published by those base spirits so utterly incapable of honor knighthood and patriotism themselves that they cannot conceive these qualities in others particularly in a female breast and therefore assign it to motives black as the hearts which thought them and even if it were true is a kingly conqueror inflicting justice for treason against himself to assign other motives for that justice doth he not lower himselfhis own cause alas yes replied her husband sorrowfully he hath done his character more injury by this last act than any which preceded though men might wish less blood were shed yet still traitors taken in arms against his person justice must condemn but a woman a sad and grieving womanbut do not weep thus my gentle wife he added tenderly can a daughter of edward do other than weep my husband oh if i loved him not if my very spirit did not cling round him so closely that the fibres of both seem entwined and his deeds of wrath of exacting justice fall on me as if i had done them and overwhelm me with their shame their remorse then indeed i might not weep but as it is do not chide me gilbert for weep i must thou art too noblehearted joan he said kindly as he circled her waist with his arm only too noblehearted for these fearful times tis but too sad a proof of the change in thy royal father that he shuns thy presence now even as he once loved it a confusion in the passage and anteroom disturbed their converse and gloucester turned towards the door to inquire the cause tis but a troublesome boy demanding access to her highness the countess my lord was the reply i have asked his name and business questions he deigns not forsooth to answer and looks so wild and distracted that i scarce think it accords with my duty to afford him admittance he is no fit recipient of my ladys bounty good my lord trust me he will but fright her i have no such fear my good baldwin said the princess as on hearing her name she came forward to the centre of the chamber thou knowest my presence is granted to all who seek it an this poor child seems so wild he is the fitter object of my care they are using violence methinks give him entrance instantly the attendant departed and returned in a very brief space followed by a lad whose torn and muddy garments haggard features and dishevelled hair indeed verified the description given he glanced wildly round him a moment and then flinging himself at the feet of the princess clasped her robe and struggled to say something of which the words mercy protection were alone audible mercy my poor child what mercy dost thou crave protection i may give thee but how may i show thee mercy grant me but a few moments lady let me but speak with thee alone i bear a message which i may not deliver to other ears save thine said or rather gasped the boy for he breathed with difficulty either from exhaustion or emotion alone replied the countess somewhat surprised leave us baldwin she added after a moments pause i am privately engaged for the next hour denied to all save his grace the king he withdrew with a respectful bow and now speak poor child what wouldst thou nay i hear nothing which my husband may not hear she said as the eyes of her visitor gazed fearfully on the earl who was looking at him with surprise thy husband ladythe earl of gloucester oh it was to him too i came the brotherinarms of my sovereign one that showed kindness toto sir nigel in his youth ye will not ye will not forsake him now few and wellnigh inarticulate as were those broken words they betrayed much which at once excited interest in both the earl and countess and told the reason of the lads earnest entreaty to see them alone forsake him exclaimed the earl after carefully examining that the door was closed would to heaven i could serve him free him that there was but one slender link to lay hold of to prove him innocent and give him life i would do it did it put my own head in jeopardy and is there none none burst wildly from the boys lips as he sprung from his knees and grasped convulsively the earls arm oh what has he done that they should slay him why do they call him guilty he was not edwards subject he owed him no homage no service he has but fought to free his country and is there guilt in this oh no no save him in mercy save him thou knowest not what thou askest boy how wholly utterly impossible it is to save him he hath hurled down increase of anger on his own head by his daring insult of king edwards herald had there been hope before there is none now a piercing cry escaped the boy and he would have fallen had he not been supported by the countess he looked at her pitying face and again threw himself at her feet canst thou not wilt thou not save him he cried art thou not the daughter of edward his favorite his dearly beloved and will he not list to theewill he not hear thy pleadings oh seek him kneel to him as i to thee implore his mercylife life only the gift of life sentence him to exile perpetual exile what he will only let him live he is too young too good too beautiful to die oh do not look as if this could not be he has told me how you both loved him not that i should seek ye it is not at his request i come no no no he spurns life if it be granted on conditions but they have torn me from him they have borne him to the lowest dungeon they have loaded him with fetters put him to the torture i would have clung to him still but they spurned me trampled on me cast me forthto die if i may not save him wilt thou not have mercy princess daughter of edward oh save him save him it is impossible in the above incoherent words to convey to the reader even a faint idea of the agonized wildness with which they were spoken the impression of unutterable misery they gave to those who listened to them and marked their reflection in the face of the speaker fettersthe lowest dungeontorture repeated gloucester pacing up and down with disordered steps can these things be merciful heaven how low hath england fallen boy boy can it be thou speakest truth as there is a god above it is truth he answered passionately oh canst thou not save him from this is there no justice no mercy riseno no wherefore should i rise he continued clinging convulsively to the knees of the princess as she soothingly sought to raise him i will kneel here till thou hast promised to plead for him with thy royal father promised to use thine influence for his life oh canst thou once have loved him and yet hesitate for this i do not i would not hesitate unhappy boy replied the princess tenderly god in heaven knows were there the slenderest chance of saving him i would kneel at my fathers feet till pardon was obtained but angered as he is now it would irritate him yet more alas alas poor child they told thee wrong who bade thee come to joan for influence with edward i have none now less than any of his court and the large tears fell from the eyes of the princess on the boys upturned face then let me plead for him give me access to edward oh i will so beseech conjure him he cannot he will not say me nay oh if his heart be not of steel he will have mercy on our wretchedness he will pardon he will spare my husband the sob with which that last word was spoken shook that slight frame till it bowed to the very ground and the supporting arm of the countess alone preserved her from falling thy husbandgracious heaven who and what art thou exclaimed the earl springing towards her at the same instant that his wife raised her in her arras and laid her on a couch beside them watching with the soothing tenderness of a sister till voice and strength returned alas i feared there was more in this deep agony than we might see she said but i imagined not dared not imagine aught like this poor unhappy sufferer the saints be praised thou hast come to me thy husbands life i may not save but i can give protection tenderness to theeaye weep weep there is life reason in those tears the gentle voice of sympathy of kindness had come upon that overcharged heart and broke the icy agony which had closed it to the relief of tears mind and frame were utterly exhausted and agnes buried her face in the hands of the princess which she had clasped convulsively within both hers and wept till the wildness of agony indeed departed but not the horrible consciousness of the anguish yet to come gradually her whole tale was imparted from the resolution to follow her betrothed even to england and cling to him to the last the fatal conclusion of that rite which had made them one the anxiety and suffering which had marked the days spent in effecting a complete disguise ere she could venture near him and obtain herefords consent to her attending him as a page the risks and hardships which had attended their journey to berwick till even a prison seemed a relief and rest and then the sudden change that a few days previous the earl of berwick had entered sir nigels prison at the head of five or ten ruffians had loaded him with fetters conveyed him to the lowest and filthiest dungeon and there had administered the torture she knew not wherefore her shriek of agony had betrayed that she had followed them and she was rudely and forcibly dragged from him and thrust from the fortress her brain had reeled her senses a brief while forsaken her and when she recovered her only distinct thought was to find her way to carlisle and there obtain access to the earl and countess of gloucester of whom her husband had spoken much during their journey to england not with any wish or hope of obtaining mercy through their influence but simply as the friends of former years he had spoken of them to while away the tedious hours of their journey and besought her if she should be parted from him on their arrival at berwick to seek them and implore their protection till her strength was restored of herself however in thus seeking them she had thought not the only idea the only thought clearly connected in her mind was to beseech their influence with edward in obtaining her husbands pardon misery and anxiety in a hundred unlookedfor shapes had already shown the fallacy of those dreams which in the hour of peril had strengthened her and caused her to fancy that when once his wife she not only might abide by him but that she might in some manner obtain his liberation she did not indeed lament her fate was joined to hislament she could not picture herself other than she was by her husbands side but she felt how bitterly felt she had no power to avert his fate despair was upon her cold black clinging despair and she clung to the vain dream of imploring edwards mercy feeling at the same moment it was but the ignis fatui to her hearturging lighting impelling her on but to sink in pitchy darkness when approached gradually and painfully this narrative of anguish was drawn from her lips often unconnectedly often incoherently but the earl and countess heard enough to fill their hearts alike with pity and respect for the deep unselfish love unconsciously revealed she had told too her maiden name had conjured them to conceal her from the power of her father at whose very name she shuddered and both those noble hearts shared her anxiety sympathized in her anguish and speedily she felt if there could be comfort in such deep wretchedness she had told her tale to those ready and willing and able to bestow it the following day the barons sat in judgment on sir nigel bruce and gloucester was obliged to join them it was useless both he and the princess felt to implore the kings mercy till sentence was passed alas it was useless at any time but it must have been a colder and harder heart than the princess joans to look upon the face of agnes and yet determine on not even making one effort in his favor at first the unhappy girl besought the earl to permit her accompanying him back to berwick to attend her husband on his trial but on his proving it would but be uselessly harrowing the feelings of both for it would not enable her to go back with him to prison that it would be better for her to remain under the protection of the countess endeavoring to regain strength for whatever she might have to encounter either to accompany him to exile if grace were indeed granted or to return to her friends in scotland she yielded mournfully deriving some faint degree of comfort in the earls assurance that she should rejoin her husband as soon as possible and the countesss promise that if she wished it she should herself be witness of her interview with edward it was indeed poor comfort but her mind was wellnigh wearied out with sorrow as if incapable of bearing more and she acquiesced from very exhaustion the desire that she herself should conjure the mercy of edward had been negatived even to her anxious heart by the assurance of both the earl and the princess that instead of doing good to her husbands cause she would but sign her own doom perchance be consigned to the power of her father and be compelled to relinquish the poor consolation of being with her husband to the last it was better she should retain the disguise she had assumed adopting merely in addition the dress of one of the princesss own pages a measure which would save her from all observation in the palace and give her admittance to sir nigel perchance when as his own attendant it would be denied the idea of rejoining her husband would have reconciled agnes to any thing that might have been proposed and kneeling at the feet of her protectress she struggled to speak her willingness and blessing on her goodness but her tongue was parched her lips were mute and the princess turned away for her gentle spirit could not read unmoved the silent thankfulness of that young and breaking heart chapter xxiv it would be useless to linger on the trial of nigel bruce in itself a mockery of justice as were all those which had proceeded and all that followed it the native nobility of scotland were no subjects of the king of england they owed him homage perchance for lands held in england but on flocking to the standard of the bruce these had at once been voluntarily forfeited and they fought but as scottish men determined to throw off the yoke of a tyrant whose arms had overrun a land to which he had no claim they fought for the freedom of a country for their own liberty and therefore were no traitors but these facts availed not with the ruthless sovereign to whom opposition was treason the mockery of justice proceeded it gave a deeper impression a graver solemnity to their execution and therefore for not one of his prisoners was the ceremony dispensed with sir christopher seaton had been conveyed to the tower with his wife under pretence of there waiting till his wounds were cured to abide his trial and in that awful hour sir nigel stood alone yet he was undaunted for he feared not death even at the hangmans hand his spirit was at peace for he was innocent of sin unbowed for he was no traitorhe was a patriot warrior still pale he was indeed ashy pale but it told a tale of intense bodily anguish they had put him to the torture to force from his lips the place of his brothers retreat that being the only pretence on which the rage of edward and the malice of berwick could rest for the infliction of their cruelty they could drag naught from his lips they could not crush that exalted soul or compel it to utter more than a faint scarcely articulate groan as proof that he suffered that the beautiful frame was wellnigh shattered unto death and now he stood upright unshrinking and there were hearts amid those peers inwardly grieving at their fell task gazing on him with unfeigned admiration while others gloried that another obstacle to their sovereigns schemes of ambition would be removed finding perchance in his youth beauty and noble bearing from their contrast with themselves but fresh incentives to the doom of death and determining even as they sate and scowled on him to aggravate the bitterness of that doom with all the ignominy that cruelty could devise he had listened in stern silence to the indictment and evinced no sign of emotion even when in the virulence of some witnesses against him the most degrading epithets were lavished on himself his family and friends only once had his eye flashed fire and his cheek burned and his right hand unconsciously sought where his weapon should have hung when his noble brother was termed a ribald assassin an excommunicated murderer but quickly he checked that natural emotion and remained collected as before he was silent till the usual question was asked if he had any thing to say why sentence of death should not be pronounced upon him and then he made a step forward looked boldly and sternly around him and spoke in a rich musical voice the following brief though emphatic words ye ask me if i could say aught why sentence of death should not be pronounced nobles of england in denying the charge of treason with which ye have indicted me i have said enough before ye aye before your sovereign i have done nothing to merit death save that death which a conqueror bestows on his captive when he deems him too powerful to live the death of a traitor i protest against for to the king of england i am no subject and in consequence no traitor i have but done that which every true and honorable man must justify and in justifying respect i have sought with my whole heart the liberty of my country the interest of my lawful sovereign and will die asserting the honor and justice of my cause even as i have lived i plead not for mercy for were it offered on condition of doing homage unto edward i would refuse it and choose death protesting to the last that robert bruce and he alone is rightful king of scotland my lords in condemning me to death as a captive taken in war ye may be justified by the law of battles i dispute not the justice of your doom but an ye sentence me as traitor i do deny the charge and say my condemnation is unjust and foul and ye are perjured in its utterance i have said now let your work proceed he folded his arms on his breast and awaited in unbroken silence his doom a brief pause had followed his words the earl of gloucester who from his rank and near connection with the king occupied one of the seats of honor at the upper end of the large hall and had during the trial vainly sought to catch the prisoners eye now reclined back on his seat his brow resting on his hand his features completely concealed by the dark drapery of his cloak in that position he remained not only during the pause but while the fatal sentence was pronounced by the laws of your country and the sentence of your peers so it ran you nigel bruce by manifold acts of rebellion disaffection and raising up arms against your lawful king edward the sovereign of england and scotland and all the realms castles and lordships thereto pertaining are proved guilty of high treason and lese majeste and are thereby condemned to be divested of all symbols of nobility and knighthood which you have disgraced to be dragged on a hurdle to the common gibbet and there hung by the neck till you are dead your head to be cut off your body quartered and exposed at the principal towns as a warning to the disaffected and the traitorous of all ranks in either nation and this is to be done at whatsoever time the good pleasure of our sovereign lord the king may please to appoint god save king edward and so perish all his foes not a muscle of the prisoners face had moved during the utterance of this awful sentence he had glanced fearlessly around him to the last his eye resting on the figure of the earl of gloucester with an expression of pitying commiseration for a moment as if he felt for him for his deep regret in his countrys shame infinitely more than for himself proudly erect he held himself as they led him in solemn pomp from the great hall of the castle across the court to the dungeons of the condemned gazing calmly and unflinchingly on the axe which carried with its edge towards him proclaimed him condemned though his doom was more ignominious than the axe bestowed there was a time when he had shrunk from the anticipated agony of a degradation so complete as thisbut not now his spirit was already lifted up above the honors and humiliations of earth but one dream of this world remainedone sad sweet dream clung to his heart and bound it with silver chains below where was that gentle being he fondly hoped she had sought the friends of his boyhood as he had implored her should they be parted he strove to realize comfort in the thought they would protect and save her the agony of a final parting but he strove in vain one wild yearning possessed him to gaze upon her face to fold her to his heart once but once again it was the last lingering remnant of mortality he had not another thought of life but this and this grew stronger as its hope seemed vain but there was one near to give him comfort when he expected it not wrapped so closely in his dark shrouding mantle that naught but the drooping feather of his cap could be distinguished the earl of gloucester drew near the prisoner and as he paused ere the gates and bars of the prison entrance could be drawn back whispered hurriedly yet emphatically a loved one is safe and shall be so would to god i could do more suppressing with extreme difficulty a start of relief and surprise the young nobleman glanced once on gloucesters face pressed his hands together and answered in the same tone god in heaven bless thee i would see her once only once more if it can be without danger to her it is lifes last link i cannot snap itparted thus they hurried him through the entrance with the last word lingering on his lips and before gloucester could make even a sign of reply early in the evening of the same day king edward was reclining on his couch in the chamber we have before described and surrounded by some few of his favorite noblemen appeared so animated by a new cause of excitement as to be almost unconscious of the internal pains which even at that moment were more than usually intense his courtiers looked on unconcernedly while literally shaking with disease and weakness he coolly and deliberately traced those letters which gave a base and ignominious death to one of the best the noblest loveliest spirits that ever walked the earth and signed the doom of misery and madness to another and yet no avenging hand stretched forth between him and his victim no pang was on his heart to bid him pause be merciful and spare oh what would this earth be were it all in all and what were life if ending in the grave faith thou art the crystal key opening to the spirit the glorious vision of immortality bidding the trusting heart when sick and weary of the dark deeds and ruthless spoilers of this lovely earth rest on thy downy wings and seek for peace and comfort there who waits demanded the king as his pen ceased in its task sir stephen fitzjohn my liege sent by the earl of berwick with the warrant for which he waits he need wait no longer then for it is there two hours before noon the traitor dies we give him grace till then that our good subjects of berwick may take warning by his fate and our bird in the cage witness the end of the gallant so devoted to her cause bid the knight begone my lord of arundel he hath too long waited our pleasure ha whom have we here who craves admittance thus loudly he added observing as the earl lifted the hangings to depart some bustle in the anteroom who is it so boldly demanding speech with us her highness the princess joan countess of gloucester please you my liege replied the chamberlain she will not take denial is it so hard a thing for a daughter to gain admittance to a father even though he be a sovereign interrupted the princess who attended only by a single page bearing her train advanced within the chamber her firm and graceful deportment causing the lords to fall back on either side and give her passage though the expression of their monarchs countenance denoted the visit was unwelcome humbly and earnestly i do beseech your graces pardon for this overbold intrusion she said bending one knee before him but indeed my business could not be delayed my liege and father grant me but a few brief minutes oh for the sake of one that loved us both the sainted one now gone to heaven for the memory of whom thou didst once bless me with fonder love than thou gavest to my sisters because my features bore her stamp my king my father pardon me and let me speak speak on muttered the king passing his hand over his features and turning slightly from her if there were emotion to conceal it thou hast in truth been overbold yet as thou art here speak on what wouldst thou a boon a mighty boon most gracious father one only thou canst grant one that in former years thou wouldst have loved me for the asking and blessed me by fulfilment she said as she continued to kneel and by her beseeching voice and visible emotion effectually confining the attention of the courtiers now assembled in a knot at the farther end of the apartment and preventing their noticing the deportment of the page who had accompanied her he was leaning against a marble pillar which supported the canopy raised over the kings couch his head bent on his breast the short thick curls which fell over his forehead concealing his features his hands too crossed on his breast convulsively clenched the sleeves of his doublet as if to restrain the trembling which had any one been sufficiently near or even imagined him worthy of a distant glance must have been observable pervading his whole frame a boon repeated the king as the princess paused almost breathless with her own emotion a mighty boon what can the countess of gloucester have to ask of me that it moves her thus are we grown so terrible that even our own children tremble ere they speak what is this mighty boon we grant not without hearing tis the boon of life my liege of life thou canst bestow oh while in this world thou rulest viceregent of the king of kings on high combining like him justice and mercy in the government of his creatures oh like him let mercy predominate over justice deprive not of life in the bloom the loveliness of youth be merciful my father oh be merciful forgive as thou wouldst be forgivengrant me the life i crave urged on by emotion the princess had scarcely heard the suppressed interjection of the king which her first words had occasioned and she scarcely saw the withering sternness which gathered on his brow thou hast in truth learnt oratory most sapient daughter he said bitterly thou pleadest well and flowingly yet thou hast said not for whom thou bearest this marvellous interestit can scarce be for a traitor methinks the enemies of edward should be even such unto his children yet tis for one of these mistaken men i plead most gracious sovereign resumed joan intimidated not by his sarcasm oh my father the conquerors triumph consists not in the number of rebellious heads that fall before himnot in the blood that overflows his way magnanimity mercy will conquer yet more than his victorious sword traitor as he seem have mercy on nigel bruce oh give mercy on a bruce may the thunder of heaven blast me when i show it burst furiously from edwards lips as he started upon his couch and gazed on his suppliant child with eyes that seemed absolutely to blaze in wrath mercy on a branch of that house which has dared defy me dared to insult my power trample on my authority upraised the standard of rebellion and cost me the lives of thousands of my faithful subjects mercy on him the daring traitor who even in his chains has flung redoubled insult and treason into our very teeth mercymay the god of heaven deny me all mercy when i show it unto him oh no no my father my father in mercy speak not such terrible words implored the princess clinging to his robe call not the wrath of heaven on thy head think of his youth the temptations that have beset him the difficult task to remain faithful when all other of his house turned astray mistaken as he hath been as he is have mercy compel him to prove to feel to acknowledge thou art not the tyrant he hath been taught to deem thee exile imprisonment allany thing but death oh do not turn from me be thyself the good the magnanimous edward of former days have mercy on thy foe i tell thee never by every saint in heaven i tell thee never shouted the king i will hear no more begone lest i deem my own child part and parcel of the treasons formed against me trouble me not with these vain prayers i will not pardon i have sworn it begone and learn thy station better than to plead for traitors thy husband braved me once beware lest in these pleadings i hear his voice again i tell him and thee that ere tomorrows noon be passed the soul of nigel bruce shall stand in judgment not another day not another hour he lives to blast me with the memory of his treason the warrant hath been signed and is on its way to berwick to give his body to the hangman and his soul to satanhis death is sealed oh no no no shrieked a voice of sudden anguish startling all who heard and even edward by its piteous tones and the form of a page suddenly fell prostrate before the monarch mercy mercy for the love of god have mercy he struggled to articulate but there was no sound save a long and piercing shriek and the boy lay senseless on the ground ha by st george beardest thou me with traitors in my very palace before my very eyes exclaimed the angry monarch as his astonished courtiers gathered round put him in ward away with him i say pardon me your highness but this is needless interposed the princess with a calm majesty that subdued even the irritation of her father and undauntedly waving back the courtiers although perfectly sensible of the imminent danger in which she was placed if there be blame let it be visited on me this poor child has been ill and weakly from many causes terrified almost maddened by sounds and sights of blood i deemed him perfectly recovered or he had not attended me here i pray your grace permit his removal to my apartments the king laid a heavy hand on his daughters arm as she stood beside him and fixed a gaze on her face that would have terrified any less noble spirit into a betrayal of the truth but firm in her own integrity in her own generous purpose she calmly and inquiringly returned his gaze go to thou art a noble wench though an overbold and presuming one he said in a much mollified tone for there was that in the dauntless behavior of his daughter which found an echo in his heart even now deadened as it was to aught of gentle feeling and he was glad of this interruption to entreaties which resolved not to grant had lashed him into fury while her presence made him feel strangely ashamed do as thou wilt with thine own attendants but be advised tempt not thine own safety again thou hast tried us sore with thy illadvised entreaties but we forgive thee on condition they are never again renewed speak not we charge thee what ho sir edmund stanley he called aloud and the chamberlain appeared at the summons here let this boy be carefully raised and borne according to the pleasure of his mistress see too that the countess of gloucester be conducted with due respect to her apartments begone he added sternly as the eyes of joan still seemed to beseech mercy i will hear no morethe traitor dies chapter xxv the shades of advancing night had already appeared to have enwrapped the earth some hours when nigel bruce was startled from an uneasy slumber by the creaking sounds of bolts and bars announcing the entrance of some one within the dungeon the name of his beloved his devoted agnes trembled on his lips but fearful of betraying her to unfriendly ears ho checked himself and started up exclaiming who comes no answer was vouchsafed but the dim light of a lamp placed by the intruder on the floor disclosed a figure wrapped from head to foot in the shrouding mantle of the time not tall but appearing a stout muscular person banishing on the instant nigels scarcelyformed hope that it was the only one he longed to see what wouldst thou he said after a brief pause doth edward practise midnight murder speak who art thou midnight murder thou boasting fool i love thee not well enough to cheat the hangman of his prey replied a harsh and grating voice which even without the removal of the cloak would have revealed to nigels astonished ears the earl of buchan ha i have startled theethou didst not know the deadly enemy of thy accursed race i know thee now my lord of buchan replied the young man calmly yet know i not wherefore thou art here save to triumph over the fallen fortunes of thy foe if so scorn oni care not a few brief hours and all of earth and earthly feeling is at rest to triumphscorn i had scarce travelled for petty satisfaction such as that when tomorrow sees thee in the hangmans hands the scorn of thousands hath buchan no other work with thee thinkest thou dost thou affirm thou knowest naught for which he hath good cause to seek thee earl of buchan i dare affirm it answered nigel proudly i know of naught to call for words or tones as these save perchance that the love and deep respect in which i hold thine injured countess my friendship for thy murdered son hath widened yet more the breach between thy house and mineit may be so yet deem not cruel as thou art i will deny feelings in which i glory at thy bidding an thou comest to reproach me with these things rail on they affect me as little as thy scorn hadst thou said love for her they call my daughter thou hadst been nearer the mark retorted the earl fury rapidly gaining possession of heart and voice but thou art too wise too politic for that aye retorted nigel after a fearful struggle with himself aye thou mayest well add love for agnes of buchan as well as friendship for her brother thinkest thou i would deny ithide it little dost thou know its thrilling its inspiring power little canst thou know how i glory in it cherish linger on it still but wherefore speak thus to thee thou man of wickedness and blood i love thy pure and spotless child rejoice that thou didst so desert so utterly neglect her that thou couldst no more leave a shadow on her innocent heart than a cloud upon her way i love her glory in that love and what is it to thee what is it to me that a child of the house of comyn dare hold commune with a bruce that thou hast dared to love a daughter of my house aye to retain her by thy side a willing mistress when all others of her sex forsook theewhat is it to me did not tomorrow give thee to a traitors doom thy blood should answer thee but as it is villain and slave give her to mewhere is her hidingplace speak or the torture shall wring it from thee thinkest thou such threats will in aught avail thee calmly replied nigel thou knowest not the bruce agnes is no longer a comyn no longer a subject to thy guardianship the voice of god the rites at the altars foot have broken every link save that which binds her to her husband she is mine before god and man is minemine own faithful and lawful wife thou liest false villain furiously retorted buchan the church shall undo these bonds shall give her back to the father she has thus insulted she shall repent repent with tears of blood her desertion of her race canst thou protect her in death thou foolcanst thou still cherish and save her thinkest thou when the hangman hath done his work aye even then she will be cherished loved for nigels sake and for her own there will be faithful friends around her to protect her from thee still tyrant thou canst not break the bonds that bind us thou hast done no fathers part forsaken and forgotten thy children owe thee no duty no obedience thou canst bring forward no plea to persecute thy child in life and in death she is mine mine alone the power and authority thou hast spurned so long can no longer be assumed the love the obedience thou didst never heed nay trampled on hath been transferred to one who glories in them both she is in safetyslay torture as thou wilt i tell thee no more fettered unarmed firm undauntedly erect stood nigel bruce gazing with curling lip and flashing eyes upon his foe the foam had gathered on the earls lip his hand clenching his sword had trembled with passion as nigel spoke he sought to suppress that rage to remember a public execution would revenge him infinitely more than a blow of his sword but he had been too long unused to control lashed into ungovernable fury by the demeanor of nigel even more than by his words the sword flashed from its scabbard was raised and fellbut not upon his foe for the earl of gloucester suddenly stood between them art thou mad or tired of life my lord of buchan he said knowest thou not thou art amenable to the law an thou thus deprivest justice of her victim shame shame my lord i deemed thee not a midnight murderer darest thou so speak to me replied buchan fiercely by every fiend in hell thou shalt answer this begone and meddle not with that which concerneth thee nothing it doth concern me proud earl replied gloucester standing immediately before nigel whose emotion at observing the page by whom he was accompanied though momentary must otherwise have been observed the person of the prisoner is sacred to the laws of his country the mandate of his sovereign on thy life thou darest not injure himthou knowest that thou darest not do thou begone ere i summon those who at the mere mention of assault on one condemned will keep thee in ward till thou canst wreak thy vengeance on naught but clay begone i say i will not sullenly answered the earl unwillingly conscious of the truth of his words i will not till he hath answered me once more he added turning to nigel with a demoniac scowl where is she whom thou hast dared to call thy wife answer me or as there is a hell beneath us the torture shall wring it from thee in safety where thine arm shall never reach her haughtily answered the young nobleman torture what wilt thou torturethe senseless clay hencei defy thee death will protect me from thy lawless power death will set his seal upon me ere we meet again the earl muttered a deep and terrible oath and then he strode away coming in such violent contact against the slight and almost paralyzed form of gloucesters page as he stood in the doorway as nearly to throw him to the ground nigel sprung forward but was held back with a grasp of iron by the earl of gloucester nor did he relinquish his hold till buchan had passed through the doorway till the heavy hinges had firmly closed again and the step of the departing earl had entirely faded in distance now then we are safe he said thank heaven but his words were scarcely heard for the page had bounded within the extended arms of nigel had clung so closely to his heart he could feel nothing see nothing save that slender form could hear nothing but those deep agonized sobs which are so terrible when unaccompanied by the relief of tears for a while nigel could not speakhe could not utter aught of comfort for he felt it not that moment was the bitterness of death torture did he not speak of torture will he not come again were the words that at length fell shudderingly from the lips of agnes nigel nigel if it must be give me up he cannot inflict aught more of misery now fear not lady he dare not hastily rejoined gloucester the torture dare not be administered without consent of edward and that now cannot be obtained he will not have sufficient time he was going to say but checked himself for the agonized look of agnes told him his meaning was more than sufficiently understood nigel he added laying his hand on the young mans shoulder nigel my noble gallant friendfor so i will call thee though i sat in judgment on thee aye and tacitly acquiesced in thy sentenceshrink not oh shrink not now i saw not a quiver on thy lip a pallor on thy cheek nay nor faltering in thy step when they read a doom at which i have marked the bravest blench oh let not that noble spirit fail thee now gloucester it shall not he said with suddenly regained firmness as supporting agnes with his right arm he convulsively wrung the hand of his friend with the other it was but the sight of this beloved one the thoughtno matter it is over agnes my beloved my own oh look on me speak tell me all that hath befallen thee since they tore thee from me and filled my soul with darker dread for thee than for myself to see thee with this noble earl is enough to know how heavy a burden of gratitude i owe him which thou sweetest must discharge yet speak to me beloved tell me all all emulating his calmness remembering even at that moment her promise not to unman him in the moment of trial by vain repinings agnes complied with his request her tale was frequently interrupted by those terrible sobs which seemed to threaten annihilation but nigel could gather from it so much of tenderness and care on the part of the princess that the deepest gratitude filled his heart and spoke in his impassioned words tell her oh tell her if the prayers of the dying can in aught avail her the blessedness of heaven shall be hers even upon earth he exclaimed gazing up in the earls face with eyes that spoke his soul oh i knew her not when in former years i did but return her kindness with silence and reserve i saw in her little more than the daughter of edward tell her on my knees i beseech her pardon for that wrong in my last prayers i shall breathe her name and wherefore didst thou go with her he continued on agnes narrating the scene between the princess and the king alas my gentle one hadst thou not endured enough that thou wouldst harrow up thy soul by hearing the confirmation of my doom from the tyrants own ruthless lipsdidst dream of pardon dearest no thou couldst not nigel nigel i did even at that moment though they told me thou wert condemned that nothing could save thee though the princess besought me almost on her knees to spare myself this useless trial i would not listen to her i would not believe that all was hopeless i dreamed still still of pardon that edward would listen to his noble child would forgive and i thought even if she failed i would so plead he must have mercy he would listen to me and grant my prayer i did dream of pardon but it was vain vain nigel nigel why did my voice fail my eye grow dim i might have won thy pardon yet beloved thou couldst not he answered mournfully mine own sweet agnes take comfort tis but a brief farewell we shall meet where war and blood and death can never enter more i know it oh i know it she sobbed but to part thus to lose thee and by such a death oh it is horrible most horrible nay look not on it thus beloved there is no shame even in this death if there be no shame in him who dies shame she repeated couldst think i could couple aught of shame with thee my own even this dark fate is noble when borne by such as thee nigel held her closer to his heart and for his sole answer pressed a quivering kiss upon her cheek gloucester who had been in earnest commune with the sentinel without the door now returned and informed him that the soldier who was well known to him and who much disliked his present watch had willingly consented that the page whom gloucester had represented as a former attendant of sir nigels though now transferred to his service should remain with his former master on condition that the earl would come for him before the priests and others who were to attend him to the scaffold entered the dungeon as this departure from the regular prison discipline shown as it was to one against whom the king was unusually irritated might cost him his head gloucester had promised faithfully and he offered them the melancholy option of parting now or a few sad hours hence let me do let me stay nigel my husband send me not from thee now exclaimed agnes sinking at his feet and clasping his knees i will not weep nor moan nor in aught afflict thee nigel dearest nigel i will not leave thee now but is it wise is it well my best beloved think if in the deep anguish of tomorrow thy disguise be penetrated thy sex discovered and thy cruel father claim thee dragging thee even from the protection of the princessoh the bitterness of death were doubled then thou thinkest but of me mine own but thy safety thy future peace is all now left for me safety peaceoh do not do not mock me nigelwhere are they for poor agnes save in her husbands grave what is life now that thou shouldst seek to guard it no no i will abide by thee thou shalt not send me hence but tomorrow lady tomorrow interposed gloucester with deep commiseration i would not from any selfish fear shorten by one minute the few sad hours ye may yet pass together but bethink ye i dare not promise to shield thee from the horrors of tomorrow for i cannot fearful scenes and sounds may pass before thee thou mayest come in contact with men from whom thou wilt shrink in horror and though thine own safety be of little worth remember the betrayal of thy sex and rank may hurl down the royal vengeance on the head of thy protectress daughter of edward though she be canst thou be firmwilt thou canst thou await the morrow yes answered agnes the wildness of her former accents subsiding into almost solemnity the safety of thy noble countess shall not be hazarded through me leave me with my husband add but this last mercy to the many thou hast showered on me and the blessing of god will rest on thee and thy noble wife forever she raised his hand to her lips and gloucester much affected placed hers in her husbands and wrung them convulsively together we shall meet again was all he trusted his voice to utter and departed the hours waned each one finding no change in the position of those loving ones the arm of agnes twined around the neck of her beloved her brow leaned against his bosom her left hand clasped his right and his left arm though fettered could yet fold that slender waist could yet draw her closer to him with an almost unconscious pressure his lips repeatedly pressed that pale brow which only moved from its position to lift up her eyes at his entreaty in his face and he would look on those features lovely still despite their attenuation and deep sorrow gaze at them with an expression that spite of his words of consoling love betrayed that the dream of earth yet lingered he could not close his eyes on her without a thrill of agony sharper than the pang of death but the enthusiast and the patriot spoke not at that hour only of himself or that dearer self the only being he had loved he spoke of his country aye and less deplored the chains which bound her then than with that prophetic spirit sometimes granted to the departing dilated on her future glory he conjured agnes for his sake to struggle on and live to seek his brother and tell him that save herself nigels last thought last prayer was his that standing on the brink of eternity the mists of the present had rolled away he saw but the futurescotland free and robert her beloved and mighty king bid him not mourn for nigel he said bid him not waver from his glorious purpose because so many of his loved and noble friends must falltheir blood is their countrys ransom tell him had i a hundred lives i would have laid them down for him and for my country as gladly as unhesitatingly as the one i now resign and tell him dearest how i loved him to the last how the recollection of his last farewell his fervent blessing lingered with me to the end giving me strength to strive for him and die as becomes his brother tell him i glory in my deathit has no shame no terror for it is for him and scotland wilt thou remember all this sweet love wilt thou speak to him these words trust me i will all all that thou hast said they are written here placing her hand on her heart here and they will not leave me even if all else fail and thou wilt say to him mine own that nigel besought his love his tenderness for thee he continued losing the enthusiasm of the patriot in the tenderness of the husband tell him i look to him in part to discharge the debt of love of gratitude i owe to thee to guard thee cherish thee as his own child alas alas i speak as if thou must reach him and yet beset with danger misery as thou art how may this be fear not for me it shall be my husband i will do thy bidding i will seek my king she said for when comfort failed for him she sought to give it hast forgotten dermids words he would be near me when i needed him and he will be my beloved i doubt him not could i but think so could i but know that he would be near to shield thee oh lifes last care would be at an end said nigel earnestly and then for some time that silence more eloquent more fraught with feeling in such an hour than the most impassioned words fell on them both when again he spoke it was on a yet more holy theme the thoughts the dreams of heaven which from boyhood had been his now found vent in words and tones which thrilled to the inmost spirit of his listener and lingered there when all other sense had fled he had lived in an era of darkness revelation in its doctrines belonged to the priests alone faith and obedience demanded by the voice of man alone were all permitted to the laity and spirits like nigels consequently formed a natural religion in which they lived and breathed hallowing the rites which they practised giving scope and glory to their faith he pictured the world on whose threshold he now stood pictured it not with a bold unhallowed hand but as the completion the consummation of all those dim whisperings of joy and hope and wisdom which had engrossed him belowthe perfection of that beauty that loveliness in the material and immaterial he had yearned for in vain on earth and this world of incomparable unshadowed loveliness awaits me he said the superstition of the age mingling for the moment with thoughts which seemed to mark him a century beyond his compeers purchased by that single moment of suffering called death it is mine my beloved and shall be thine and oh when we meet there how trivial will seem the dark woes and boding cares of earth i have told thee the vision of my vigil agnes my beloved again i have seen that blessed spirit aye and there was no more sadness on his pale brow naught naught of earthspiritualized etherealized he hovered over my sleep and with a smile beckoned me to the glorious world he inhabits he seemed to call me to await me and then the shrouding clouds on which he lay closed thicker and thicker round him till naught but his celestial features beamed on me agnes dearest best think of me thus as blessed eternally unchangeably as awaiting thee to share that blessedness not as one lost to thee beloved and peace aye joy een yet shall smile for thee nigel nigel are there such things for the desolate the lone murmured agnes raising her pale brow and looking despairingly in his face oh i will think on thee picture thee in thy thriceglorified home but it will be with all of mortal clinging to me still and the wild yearnings to come to thee will banish all of peace speak not such words to thy poor weak agnes my beloved i will struggle on to bear thy message to my sovereign there lies my path when thou art gone darkness envelops it when that goal is gainedi have no future now save that which gives me back to thee he could not answer and then again there was silence broken only by the low voice of prayer they knelt together on the cold stones he raised her cold hands with his in supplication he prayed for mercy pardon for himself for comfort strength for her he prayed for his country and her king her chained and sorrowing sons and the soft liquid star of morning gloaming forth through heavy masses of murky clouds directly on them as they knelt appeared an angels answer the dawn broke bluer and bluer became the small and heavilybarred casement clearer and clearer grew the damp walls of the dungeons and morning in its sunshine and gladness laughed along the earth closer and closer did agnes cling to that noble heart but she spoke no word he tarries longmerciful heaven grant he be not detained too late she heard her husband murmur as to himself as time waned and gloucester came not and she guessed his thoughts i care not she answered in a voice so hollow he shuddered i will go with thee even to the scaffold but gloucester true to his promise came at length he was evidently anxious and disturbed and a few hurried words told how the earl of berwick had detained him in idle converse as if determined to prevent any private interview with the prisoner even now the officers and priests were advancing to the dungeons their steps already reverberated through the passages and struck on the heart of agnes as a bolt of ice i had much much i wished to say but even had i time what boots it now nigel worthy brother of him i so dearly loved aye even now would die to serve fear not for the treasure thou leavest to my care as there is a god above us i will guard her as my sister they comefarewell thou noble heart thou wilt leave many a foe to mourn thee the voice of the earl quivered with emotion nigel convulsively pressed his extended hand and then he folded agnes in his arms he kissed her lips her brow her cheek he parted those clustering curls to look again and yet again upon her facepale rigid as sculptured marble she uttered no sound she made no movement but consciousness had not departed the words of gloucester on the previous night rung in her ears demanding control and mechanically she let her arms unloose their convulsive grasp of nigel and permitted the earl gently to lead her to the door but ere it opened she turned again to look on nigel he stood his hands clasped in that convulsive pressure of agony his every feature working with the mighty effort at control with the last struggle of the mortal shell with one faint yet thrilling cry she bounded back she threw herself upon his swelling bosom her lips met his in one last lingering kiss and gloucester tore her from his arms they passed the threshold another minute and the officers and guard and priest stood within the dungeon and a harsh rude voice bade the confessor haste to shrive the prisoner for the hour of execution was at hand bearing the slight form of the supposed page in his arms gloucester hastily threaded the passages leading from the dungeon to the postern by which he had intended to depart his plan had been to rejoin his attendants and turn his back upon the city of berwick ere the execution could take place a plan which from his detention he already found was futile the postern was closed and secured and he was compelled to retrace his steps to a gate he had wished most particularly to avoid knowing that it opened on a part of the court which from its commanding a view of the scaffold he justly feared would be crowded he had paused but to speak one word of encouragement to agnes who with a calmness appalling from the rigidity of feature which accompanied it now stood at his side he bade her only hold by his cloak and he hoped speedily to lead her to a place of safety she heard him and made a sign of obedience they passed the gate unquestioned traversed an inner court and made for the great entrance of the castle there unhappily their progress was impeded the scaffold by order of edward had been erected on the summit of a small green ascent exactly opposite the prison of the countess of buchan and extending in a direct line about half a quarter of a mile to the right of the castle gates which had been flung wide open that all the inhabitants of berwick might witness the death of a traitor already the courts and every vacant space was crowded a sea of human heads was alone visible nay the very buttresses and some pinnacles of the castle which admitted any footing although of the most precarious kind had been appropriated the youth the extraordinary beauty and daring conduct of the prisoner had excited an unusual sensation in the town and the desire to mark how such a spirit would meet his fate became irresistibly intense already it seemed as if there could be no space for more yet numbers were still pouring in not only most completely frustrating the intentions of the earl of gloucester but forcing him by the pressure of multitudes with them towards the scaffold in vain he struggled to free himself a passage in vain he haughtily declared his rank and bade the presumptuous serfs give way some indeed fell back but uselessly for the crowds behind pushed on those before and there was no retreating no possible means of escaping from that sight of horror which gloucester had designed so completely to avoid in the agony of disappointment not a little mixed with terror as to its effects he looked on his companion there was not a particle of change upon her countenance lips cheek brow were indeed bloodless as marble and as coldly still her eyes were fascinated on the scaffold and they moved not quivered not even when the figure of an aged minstrel in the garb of scotland suddenly stood between them and the dread object of their gaze their expression changed not she placed her hand in his she spoke his name to her conductor but it was as if a statue was suddenly endowed with voice and motion so cold was the touch of that hand so sepulchral was that voice she motioned him aside with a gesture that compelled obedience and again she looked upon the scaffold the earl welcomed the old man gladly for the tale of agnes had already prepared him to receive him and to rely on his care to convey her back to scotland engrossed with his anxiety for her and whenever that permitted him speaking earnestly to the old man gloucester remained wholly unconscious of the close vicinity of one he was at that moment most desirous to avoid the earl of buchan in the moment of ungovernable rage had indeed flung himself on horseback and galloped from the castle the preceding night intending to seek the king and petition that the execution might be deferred till the torture had dragged the retreat of agnes from nigels lips the cool air of night however had had the effect of so far dissipating the fumes of passion as to convince him that it would be wellnigh impossible to reach carlisle obtain an interview with edward at such an unseasonable hour and return to berwick in sufficient time for the execution of his diabolical scheme he let the reins fall on his horses neck to ponder and finally made up his mind it was better to let things take their course and the sentence of the prisoner proceed without interruption a determination hastened by the thought that should he die under the torture all the ignominy and misery of a public execution would be eluded the night was very dark and misty the road in some parts passing through woods and morasses and the earl too much engrossed with his own dark thoughts to attend to his path lost the track and wandered round and round instead of going forward this heightened not the amiability of his previous mood but until dawn his efforts to retrace his steps or even discover where he was were useless the morning however enabled him to reach berwick which he did just as the crowds were pouring into the castleyard and the heavy toll of the bell announced the commencement of that fatal tragedy he hastily dismounted and mingled with the populace they bore him onward through another postern to that by which the other crowds had impelled gloucester finding the space before them already occupied these two human streams of course met and conjoined in the centre and the two earls stood side by side gloucester as we have said wholly unconscious of buchans vicinity and buchan watching his anxious and sorrowful looks with the satisfaction of a fiend revelling in his being thus hemmed in on all sides and compelled to witness the execution of his friend he watched him closely as he spoke with the minstrel but tried in vain to distinguish what they said he looked on the page too and with some degree of wonder though he believed it only mortal terror which made him look thus natural in so young a child but afterwards that look was only too fatally recalled sleepless and sad had been that long night to another inmate of berwick castle as well as to nigel and his agnes it was not till the dawn had broken that the countess of buchan had sunk into a deep though troubled slumber for it was not till then the confused sounds of the workmen employed in erecting the scaffold had ceased she knew not for whom it was upraised what noble friend and gallant patriot would there be sacrificed she would not could not believe it was for nigel for when his name arose in her thoughts it was shudderingly repelled and with him came the thought of her childwhere oh where was shewhat would be her fate the tolling of the bell awoke her from the brief trance of utter unconsciousness into which from exhaustion she had fallen she glanced once beneath her the crowds the executioner at his post the guard already round the scaffold too truly told the hour was at hand and though her heart turned sick with apprehension and she felt as if to know the worst were preferable to the hour of suspense she could not look again and she would have sought the inner chamber and endeavor to close both ears and eyes to all that was passing without when the earl of berwick suddenly entered and harshly commanded her to stir not from the cage it is your sovereigns will madam that you witness the fate of the traitor so daring in your cause he said as with a stern grasp he forced her to the grating and retained his hold upon her arm that you may behold in his deserved fate the type of that which will at length befall the yet blacker traitor of his name it is fitting so loyal a patriot as thyself should look on a patriots fate and profit thereby aye learn how a patriot can diehow when his life may no more benefit his country and his kin he may serve them in his death calmly and proudly she answered it is well perchance when my turn cometh i may thank thy master for the lesson now rudely forced upon me the hour will come when the blood that he now so unjustly sheds shall shriek aloud for vengeance on me let him work his willi fear him not be silent minion i listen not to thy foul treason said the earl hoarse with suppressed passion at the little effect his sovereigns mandate produced when he had hoped to have enforced it midst sobs and tears and she was silent for her eye had caught one face amidst the crowd that fascinated its gaze and sent back the blood which had seemed to stagnate when the idea that it was indeed nigel now about to suffer had been thus rudely thrust upon hersent it with such sudden revulsion through its varied channels that it was only with a desperate struggle she retained her outward calmness and then she stood to the eye of berwick proud dignified collected seemingly so cold that he doubted whether aught of feeling could remain or marvelled if the mandate of edward had indeed power to inflict aught of pain but withinoh the veriest tyrant must have shuddered could he have known the torture there she saw she recognized her child she read naught but madness in that chiselled gaze she saw at a glance there was no escaping from beholding to the dreadful end the fate of her beloved before behind on every side the crowds pressed round yet from the slightly elevated position of the scaffold failing to conceal it from her gaze the earl of gloucester she perceived close at her side as if protecting her but if indeed she was under his care how came she on such a spot at such a timedid he know her sex or only looked on her as a favored page of nigels and as such protected yet would not the anguish of that hour betray her not alone to him but to that dark and cruel man whom she also marked beside her and who did he once know her would demand the right of a father to give her to his care and oh how would that right be exercised would the murderer of his son his heir have pity on a daughter but it would be a vain effort to picture the deep anguish of that mothers heart as in that dread moment she looked upon her child knowing feeling her might of grief as if it had been her own wellnigh suffocated with the wild yearning to fold her to her maternal bosom to bid her weep there to seek to comfort to soothe by mingling her tears with hers to protect to hide her misery from all save her mothers eyeto feel this till every pulse throbbed as to threaten her with death and yet to breathe no word to give no sign that such things were lest she should endanger that precious one yet more she dared not breathe one question of the many crowding on her heart she could but gaze and feel she had thought when they told her that her boy was dead that she had caused his death there was little more of misery fate could weave but at that moment even alan was forgotten it was her own wretchedness she had had then to bear for he was at rest but now it was the anguish of that dearer self her sole remaining childand oh a mothers heart can better bear its individual woes than those that crash a daughter to the earth a sudden rush amidst the crowd where a movement could take place the heavy roll of muffled drums and the yet deeper more wailing toll of the funeral bell announced that the prisoner had left the dungeon and irresistibly the gaze of the countess turned from her child to seek him perchance it was well for the preservation of her composure that the intervening crowd prevented her beholding him till he stood upon the scaffold for hardly could she have borne unmoved the sight of that noble and gallant formbeloved alike as the friend of her son the betrothed of her daughter the brother of her kingdegraded of all insignia of rank chained to the hurdle and dragged as the commonest the vilest criminal exposed to the mocking gaze of thousands to the place of execution she saw him not thus and therefore she knew not wherefore the features of agnes had become yet more rigid bore yet more the semblance of chiselled marble he stood at length upon the scaffold as calmly majestic in his bearing as if he had borne no insult suffered no indignity his beautiful hair had been arranged with care on either side his face and still fell in its long rich curls about his throat and so beautiful so holy was the expression of his perfect features that the assembled crowds hushed their very breath in admiration and in awe it seemed as if the heaven on whose threshold he stood had already fixed its impress on his brow every eye was upon him and all perceived that holy calmness was for one brief minute disturbed but none save three of those who marked it knew or even guessed the cause the countess had watched his glance as at first composedly it had wandered over the multitude beneath and around him and she saw it rest on that one face which in its sculptured misery stood alone amidst thousands and she alone perceived the start of agony that sight occasioned but speedily even that emotion passed he looked from that loved face up to the heaven on which his hopes were fixed in whose care for her he trustedand that look was prayer she saw him as he knelt in prayer undisturbed by the clang of instruments still kept up around him she saw him rise and then a deadly sickness crept over her every limb a thick mist obscured her sight sense seemed on the point of deserting her when it was recalled by a sound of horrora shriek so wild so long so thrilling the rudest spirit midst those multitudes shrunk back appalled and crossed themselves in terror on one ear it fell with a sense of agony almost equal to that from whence it came the mother recognized the voice and feeling sight hearing as by an electric spell returned she looked forth again and though her eye caught the noble form of nigel bruce yet quivering in the air she shrunk not she sickened not for its gaze sought her child she had disappeared from the place she had occupied she saw the earl of gloucester making a rapid way through the dispersing crowds a sudden gust blew aside his wrappingcloak the face of her child was exposed to her view there was a look of death upon her brow and if the earl of berwick had lingered to note whether indeed this scene of horror would pass unnoticed unfelt by his prisoner he was gratified at length for isabella of buchan lay senseless on her prison floor chapter xxvi and she is in safety gilbert inquired the princess joan the evening of the day following the execution lifting her eyes swimming in tears to her husbands face they were sitting alone in their private apartments secured from all intruders by a page stationed in the anteroom and the earl had been relating some important particulars of the preceding day i trust in heaven she is and some miles ere now on her road to scotland was his answer i fear for nothing save for the beautiful mind that fragile shell contains alas my joan i fear me that has gone forever better oh better then that faintingfit had indeed been death she said that the thread of life had snapped than twisted thus in madness yet thou sayest her purpose seemed firm her intellect clear in her intense desire to reach scotland would this be thinkest thou were they disordered i think yes for hadst thou seen as i the expression of countenance the unearthly calmness with which this desire was enforced the constant though unconscious repetition of words as these to the king to the king my path lies there he bade me seek him perchance he will be there to meet me thou too wouldst feel that when that goal is gained her husbands message given sense must fail or life itself depart but once for a few brief minutes i saw that calmness partly fail and i indulged in one faint hope she would be relieved by tears she saw old dermid gaze on her and weep she clung to his neck her features worked convulsively and her voice was choked and broken as she said we must not tarry dermid we must not wait to weep and moan i must seek king robert while i can there is a fire on my brain and heart which will soon scorch up all memory but one i must not wait till it has reached his words and burned them up toooh let us on at once but the old mans kindly words had not the effect i hoped she only shook her head and then as if the horrible recollection of the past flashed back a convulsive shuddering passed through her frame and when she raised her face from her hand its marble rigidity had returned alas alas poor sufferer exclaimed the princess in heartfelt sorrow i fear indeed if such things be there is little hope of reason i would thou hadst conveyed her here perchance the soothing and sympathy of one of her own sex had averted this evil t doubt my kind joan replied her husband thy words had such beneficial power before because hope had still possession of her breast she hoped to the very last aye even when she so madly went with thee to edward now that is over hope is crushed when despair has risen thou couldst not have soothed it would have been but wringing thy too kind heart and exposing her to other and heightened evils the princess looked up inquiringly knowest thou not buchan hath discovered that his daughter remained with nigel bruce as his engaged bride at kildrummie and is even now seeking her retreat vowing she shall repent with tears of blood her connection with a bruce i did not indeed how came this how i know not save that it was reported buchan had left the court on a mission to the convent where the countess of carrick and her attendants are immured and in all probability learnt this important fact from them i only know that at the instant i entered the prisoners dungeon buchan was demanding at the swords point the place of her retreat incited to the deadliest fury at nigels daring avowal that agnes was his wife merciful heaven and agnes what did she i know not for i dared not absolutely dared not look upon her face her husbands selfcontrol saved her for he stood and answered as calmly and collectedly as if indeed she were in the safety he declared her father brushed by nay wellnigh stumbled over her as he furiously quitted the dungeon glared full at her but knew her not but i dared not again bring her here it was in too close vicinity with the king and her cruel father for her present state of mind must have betrayed every disguise and thinkest thou he could have the heart to injure her separated as she is by death from the husband of her love aye persecute her as he hath his wife and son joan i would rather lose my own right hand than that unhappy girl should fall into her fathers power confinement indeed though it would add but little real misery to her present lot yet i feel that with her present wild yearnings to rejoin the bruce to fulfil to the very utmost her husbands will it would increase tenfold the darkness round her the very dread of her father would unhinge the last remaining link of intellect joan shuddered god in mercy forefend such ill she said fervently i would i could have seen her once again for she has strangely twined herself about my heart but thou hast judged wisely my gilbert her safety is too precious to be thus idly risked and this old man canst thou so trust himwill he guide her tenderly and well aye i would stake my life upon his truth he is the seer and minstrel of the house of bruce and that would be allsufficient to guarantee his unwavering fidelity and skill he has wandered on foot from scotland to look on his beloved master once again to watch over as a guardian spirit the fate of that masters devoted wife and he will do this i doubt not and discover carricks place of retreat were it at the utmost boundaries of the earth i only dread pursuit pursuit and by whom by her father men said he was close beside me during that horrible hour though i saw him not if he observed her traced to her lips that maddening shriek it would excite his curiosity quite sufficiently for him to trace my steps and discovery were then inevitable but did he do thishast seen him since no he has avoided me but still for her sake i fear him i know not how or when but there are boding whispers within me that all will not be well now i would have news from thee is hereford released yes coupled with the condition that he enters not my fathers presence until easter he is deeply and justly hurt but more grieved at the change in his sovereign than angered at the treatment of himself no marvel for if ever there were a perfect son of chivalry one most feelingly alive to its smallest point of honor it is humphrey bohun so spoke gilbert de clare earl of gloucester unconscious that he himself had equal right to a character so exalted that both scottish and english historians would emulate each other in handing his name down to posterity surrounded by that lucid halo of real worth on which the eye turns again and again to rest for relief from the darker minds and ruder hearts which formed the multitude of the age in which he lived the duties of friendship were performed in his preservation of the person and constant and bold defence of the character of the bruce the duties of a subject in dying on the battlefield in service for his king the boding prognostics of the earl of gloucester were verified ere that day closed while still in earnest converse with his countess a messenger came from the king demanding their instant presence in his closet the summons was so unusual that in itself it was alarming nor did the sight of the earl of buchan in close conference with the monarch decrease their fears as soon as a cessation of his pains permitted the exertion buchan had been sent for by the king the issue of his inquiries after his daughter demanded and all narrated his interview with sir nigel dwelt upon with all the rancor of hate edward had listened without making any observation a twinkle of his still bright eye an expression about the lips alone betraying that he not only heard but was forming his own conclusions from the tale and you have no clue no thought of her retreat he asked at length abruptly when the earl ceased not the very faintest your grace had not that interfering gloucester come between me and my foe i had forced it from him at the sharp swords point gloucesterhumph muttered the king yet an so bloody was thy purpose my good lord his interference did thee no ill how was the earl accompaniedwas he alone if i remember rightly alone your grace no by my faith there was a page with him a pageha and what manner of man was he man your highness say rather a puny stripling with far more of the woman about him than the man ha again uttered the king looked he so weaklydid thy fury permit such keen remark not at that time your highness but he was with gloucester compelled to witness the execution of this black traitor and he looked white statuelike and uttered a shriek forsooth likely to scare back the villains soul even as it took flight gloucester cared for the dainty brat as if he had been a son of your highness not a page in his household for he lifted him up in his arms and bore him out of the crowd humph said edward again in a tone likely to have excited curiosity in any mind less obtuse on such matters than that of the scottish earl and thou sayest he added after some few minutes pause this daring traitor so lately a man would tell thee no more than that thy daughter was his wife and in safetyout of thy reach buchan answered in the affirmative and thou hast not the most distant idea where he hath concealed her none your highness then i will tell thee sir earl and if thou dost not feel inclined to dash out thine own brains with vexation at letting thy prey so slip out of thy grasp thou art not the man i took thee for and edward fixed his eyes on his startled companion with a glance at once keen and malicious the white and statuelooking page with more of woman about him than the man was the wife of this rank villain sir nigel bruce and thy daughter my lord of buchan the earl of gloucester may perchance tell thee more the earl started from his seat with an oath which the presence of majesty itself could not restrain the dulness of his brain was dissolved as by a flash of lightning the ghastly appearance the maddening shriek the deathlike faint all of which he had witnessed in gloucesters supposed page nay the very disturbed and anxious look of the earl himself gave truth and life to edwards words and he struck his clenched fist against his brow and strode up and down the royal closet in a condition as frantically disturbed as the monarch could possibly have desired and then hastily and almost incoherently besought the kings aid in sifting the matter to the very bottom and obtaining repossession of his daughter entreating leave of absence to seek out gloucester and tax him with the fact edward whose fury against the house of brucewhether man woman or child noble or serf belonging to themhad been somewhat soothed by the ignominious execution of nigel had felt almost as much amused as angered at the earls tale and enjoyed the idea of a man whom in his inmost heart he most thoroughly despised having been so completely outwitted and for the time so foiled the feud between the comyn and the bruce was nothing to him except where it forwarded his own interests he had incited buchan to inquire about his daughter simply because the occupation would remove that earl out of his way for a short time and perhaps if the rumor of her engagement with one of the brothers of the bruce were true set another engine at work to discover the place of their concealment the moment buchan informed him it was to nigel she had been engaged with nigel last seen his acute penetration recalled the page who had accompanied the princess when she supplicated mercy and had he heard no more would have pointed there for the solution of the mystery incensed he was and deeply at the fraud practised upon him at the karl and countess of gloucester daring to harbor nay protect and conceal the wife of a traitor but his anger was subdued in part by the belief that now it was almost impossible she could escape the wardance of her father and his vengeance would be more than sufficient to satisfy him nay when he recalled the face and the voice it was so like madness and death and he was moreover so convinced that now her husband was dead she could do him no manner of harm that he inwardly and almost unconsciously hoped she might eventually escape her fathers power although he composedly promised the earl to exercise his authority and give him the royal warrant for the search and committal of her person wherever she might be anger that gloucester and his wife should so have dared his sovereign power was now the prevailing feeling and therefore was it he commanded their presence determined to question them himself rather than through the still enraged buchan calmly and collectedly the noble pair received alike the displeasure of their sovereign and the illconcealed fury of buchan they neither denied the charge against them nor equivocated in their motives for their conduct alarmed they were indeed for the unhappy agnes but as denial and concealment were now alike impossible and could avail her nothing they boldly nay proudly acknowledged that which they had done and openly rejoiced it had been theirs to give one gleam of comfort to the dying nigel by extending protection to his wife and are ye not traitorsbold presuming traitorsdeserving the chastisement of such bearding me thus in my very palace wrathfully exclaimed edward know ye not both are liable to the charge of treason aye treasonand fear ye to brave us thus my liege we are no traitors amenable to no such charge calmly answered gloucester far far more truly faithfully devotedly your graces subjects than many of those who had shrunk from an act as this that in so doing we were likely to incur your royal displeasure we acknowledge with deep regret and sorrow and i take it no shame thus on my knee to beseech your highnesss indulgence for the fault but if you deem it worthy of chastisement we are ready to submit to it denying however all graver charge than that of failing in proper deference to your grace all other charge by st edward is not that enough answered the king but in a mollified tone and thou minion thou whom we deemed the very paragon of integrity and honor hast thou aught to say did not thy lips frame falsehood and thy bold looks confirm it my father my noble father pardon me that in this i erred answered joan kneeling by his side and despite his efforts to prevent it clasping his hand and covering it with kisses yet i spoke no falsehood uttered naught which was not truth she was ill and weakly she was wellnigh maddened from scenes and sounds of blood i had besought her not to attend me but a wifes agony could not be restrained and if we had refused her the protection she so wildly craved had discovered her person to your highness would it have availed thee aught a being young scarce past her childhoodmiserable maddened wellnigh to death her life wrapt up in her husbands which was forfeited to thee the wife of a traitor the offspring of a traitress connected on every side with treason and canst ask if her detention would have availed us aught joan joan thy defence is but a weak one answered the king sternly but he called her joan and that simple word thrilled to her heart as the voice of former years and her father felt a sudden gush of tears fall on the hand he had not withdrawn and vainly he struggled against the softening feelings those tears had brought it was strange that angered as he really was the better feelings of edward should in such a moment have so completely gained the ascendency perhaps he was not proof against the contrast before him presented in the persons of buchan and gloucester the base villainy of the one the exalted nobility of the other alike shone forth the clearer from their unusually close contact in general edward was wont to deem these softening emotions foolish weaknesses which he would banish by shunning the society of all those who could call them forth their candid acknowledgment of having deserved his displeasure and submission to his will however so soothed his selflove his fondness for absolute power that he permitted them to have vent with but little restraint agnes might have been the wife of a traitor but he was out of edwards way the daughter of a traitress but she was equally powerless linked with treason but too much crashed by her own misery to be sensible of aught else surely she was too insignificant for him to persevere in wrath and alienate by unmerited severity yet more the hearts which at such moments he felt he valued despite his every effort to the contrary so powerfully was he worked upon that had it not been for the illrestrained fury of buchan it was possible the subject would have been in the end peaceably dismissed but on that earls reminding him of his royal word the king commanded gloucester to deliver up his charge to her rightful guardian and all the past should be forgiven the earl quietly and respectfully replied he could not for he knew not where she was wrath gathered on edwards brow and buchan laid his hand on his sword but neither the royal commands nor buchans muttered threats and oaths of vengeance could elicit from gloucester more than that she had set off to return to scotland with an aged man not three hours after the execution had taken place he had purposely avoided all inquiries as to their intended route and therefore not any crossquestioning on the part of the king caused him to waver in the smallest point from his original tale or afforded any evidence that he knew more than he said get thee to sir edward cunningham my lord of buchan and bid him draw up a warrant for the detention and committal of these two persons wherever they may be the king said and away with thee and a trusty troop with all speed to berwick make inquiries of all who at that particular hour passed the gates and be assured thou wilt find some clue take men enough to scour the country in all directions provide them with an exact description of the prisoners they seek and tarry not and thou wilt yet gain thy prize living or dead we resign all our right over her person to thee and give thee power as her father to do with her what may please thee best away with thee my lord and heaven speed thee my liege and father oh why hast thou done this exclaimed the princess imploringly as with a low obeisance to the king and a gesture of triumph at the earl of gloucester buchan departed hath she not borne misery enough nay we do but our duty to our subjects in aiding fathers to repress rebellious children replied the king of a truth fair dame of gloucester thy principles of filial duty seem somewhat as loose and light as those which counselled abetting protecting and concealing the partner of a traitor wouldst have us refuse buchans most fatherly desire surely thou wouldst not part him from his child forever and forever exclaimed the princess fervently great god in heaven that such a being should call that monster father and owe him the duty of a child but oh thou dost but jest my father in mercy recall that warrantexpose her not to wretchedness as this peace replied the king sternly as thou valuest thine own and thy husbands liberty and life breathe not another syllable speak not another word for her or double misery shall be her portion we have shown enough of mercy in demanding no further punishment for that which ye have done than that for ten days ye remain prisoners in your own apartments answer not we will have no more of this the earl of buchan meanwhile had made no delay in gaining the necessary aids to his plan ere two hours passed he was on his road to berwick backed with a stout body of his own retainers and bearing a commission to the earl of berwick to provide him with as many more as he desired he went first to the hostelry near the outskirts of the town where he remembered gloucester had borne the supposed page there he obtained much desirable information an exact description of the dress features and appearance of both the page and his companion of the former indeed he recollected allsufficient even had the description been less exact the old minstrel had attracted the attention of many within the hostel and consequently enabled buchan to obtain information from various sources all of which agreed so well that he felt sure of success backed by the warrant of edward he went to the civil authorities of the town obtained four or five technically drawnup descriptions of the prisoners and intrusted them to the different officers who with bands of fifty men he commanded to search every nook and corner of the country round berwick in various directions he himself discovering they had passed through the scotch gate and appeared directing their course in a westerly direction took with him one hundred men and followed that track buoyed up by the hope not only of gaining possession of his daughter but perhaps of falling in with the retreat even of the detested bruce against whom he had solemnly recorded a vow never to let the sword rest in the scabbard till he had revenged the murder of his kinsman the red comyn some words caught by a curious listener passing between the page and minstrel and eagerly reported to him convinced him it was robert bruce they sought and urged him to continue the search with threefold vigor slowly and sadly meanwhile had the hours of their weary pilgrimage passed for the poor wanderers and little did they imagine as they threaded the most intricate paths of the borders of scotland that they were objects of persecution and pursuit though the bodily strength of agnes had wellnigh waned though the burning cheek and wandering too brightly flashing eye denoted how fearfully did fever rage internally she would not pause save when absolutely compelled she could neither sleep nor eat her only cry was to the kingbring me but to king robert while i may yet speak her only consciousness that she had a mission to perform that she was intrusted with a message from the dead all else was a void dark shapeless in which thought framed no image mind not a wish insensibility it was not alas no that void was woe all woe which folded up heart and brain as with a cloak of fire scorching up thought memory hopeall that could recall the past vivify the present or vision forth the future she breathed indeed and spoke and clung to that aged man with all the clinging helplessness of her sex but scarce could she be said to live all that was real of life had twined round her husbands soul and with it fled the old man felt not his advanced age the consciousness of the many dangers hovering on their way his whole thought was for her to bring her to the soothing care and protection of the king and then he cared not how soon his sand run out when wandering in the districts of annandale and carrick before he had arrived at berwick he had learned the secret but most important intelligence that king robert had passed the winter off the coast of ireland and was supposed to be only waiting a favorable opportunity to return to scotland and once more upraise his standard this news had been most religiously and strictly preserved a secret amid the few faithful adherents of the bruce who perhaps spoke yet more as they hoped than as a fact well founded for some days their way had been more fatiguing than dangerous for though the country was overrun with english a minstrel and a page were objects far too insignificant in the present state of excitement to meet with either detention or notice not a week had passed however before rumors of buchans parties reached the old mans ears and filled him with anxiety and dread the feverish restlessness of agnes to advance yet quicker on their way precluded all idea of halting save in woods and caverns till the danger had passed without informing her of all he had heard and the danger he apprehended he endeavored to avoid all towns and villages but the heavy rains which had set in rendered their path through the country yet more precarious and uncertain and often compelled him most unwillingly to seek other and better shelter at strathaven he became conscious that their dress and appearance were strictly scrutinized and some remarks that he distinguished convinced him that buchan had either passed through that town or was lingering in its neighborhood still turning sick with apprehension the old man hastily retraced his steps to the hostel where he had left agnes and found her for the first time since their departure sunk into a kind of sleep or stupor from exhaustion from which he could not bear to arouse her watching her for some little time in silence his attention was attracted by whispering voices only separated from him by a thin partition they recounted and compared one by one the dress and peculiar characteristics of himself and his companion seeming to compare it with a written list then followed an argument as to whether it would not be better to arrest their progress at once or send on to the earl of buchan who was at a castle only five miles distant how it was determined dermid knew not for the voices faded in the distance but he had heard enough and it seemed indeed as if detention and restraint were at length at hand what to do he knew not night had now some hours advanced and to attempt leaving the hostel at such an unseasonable hour would be of itself sufficient to confirm suspicion all seemed at rest within the establishment there was no sound to announce that a messenger had been dispatched to the earl and he determined to await as calmly as might be the dawn the first streak of light however was scarce visible in the east before openly and loudly so as to elude all appearance of flight he declared his intention of pursuing his journey as the weather had already detained them too long he called on the hostess to receive her reckoning commanded the mules to be saddled all of which was done to his surprise without comment or question and they departed unrestrained the old man too much overjoyed at this unexpected escape to note that they were followed by two englishmen the one on horseback the other on foot anxiety indeed had still possession of him for he could not reconcile the words he had overheard with their quiet departure but as the day passed and they plunged thicker and thicker in the woods of carrick and there was no sign of pursuit or even of a human form he hailed with joy a solitary house and believed the danger passed the inmates received them with the utmost hospitality the order for their detention had evidently not reached them and dermid determined on waiting quietly there till the exhausted strength of his companion should be recruited and permit them to proceed an hour and more passed in cheerful converse with the aged couple who owned the house and who with the exception of one or two servants were its sole inhabitants the tales of the minstrel were called for and received with a glee which seemed to make all his listeners feel young again agnes alone sate apart her delicate frame and evident exhaustion concealing deeper sufferings from her hosts who vied with each other in seeking to alleviate her fatigue and give bodily comfort if they could offer no other consolation leaning back in a large settle in the chimney corner she had seemed unconscious of the cheerful sociability around her when suddenly she arose and advancing to dermid laid a trembling hand on his arm he looked up surprised hist she murmured throwing back the hair from her damp brow hear ye no sound all listened for a time in vain again she said tis nearer more distinct who comes with a troop of soldiers here it was indeed the heavy trampling of many horse at first so distant as scarcely to be distinguished save by ears anxious and startled as old dermids but nearer and nearer they came till even the inmates of the house all huddled together in alarm agnes remained standing her hand on dermids arm her head thrown back her features bearing an expression scarce to be defined the horses hoofs mingled with the clang of armor rung sharp and clear on the stones of the courtyard they halted the pommel of a sword was struck against the oaken door and a nights lodging courteously demanded the terror of the owners of the house subsided for the voice they heard was scotch the door was thrown open the request granted with the same hospitality as had been extended to the minstrel and the page on the instant there was a confused sound of warriors dismounting of horses eager for stabling and forage and one tall and stately figure clad from head to foot in mail entered the house and removing his helmet addressed some words of courteous greeting and acknowledgment to its inmates a loud exclamation burst from the minstrels lips but agnes uttered no sound she made one bound forward and dropped senseless at the warriors feet chapter xxvii it was on a cool evening near the end of september that a troop consisting of about thirty horse and as many on foot were leisurely traversing the mountain passes between the counties of dumfries and lanark their arms were well burnished their buff coats and halfarmor in good trim their banner waved proudly from its staff as bright and gay as if it had not even neared a scene of strife and there was an air of hilarity and gallantry about them that argued well for success if about to commence an expedition or if returning told with equal emphasis they had been successful that the latter was the case was speedily evident from the gay converse passing between them their allusions to some late gallant achievement of their patriot sovereign their joyous comparisons between good king robert and his weak opponent edward ii of england marvelling how so wavering and indolent a son could have sprung from so brave and determined a sire for scotsmen as they were they were now free and could thus afford to allow the hammer of their country some knightly qualities despite the stern and cruel tyranny which to them had ever marked his conduct they spoke in laughing scorn of the second edwards efforts to lay his fathers yoke anew upon their necks they said a just heaven had interfered and urged him to waste the decisive moment of action in indolence and folly in the flatteries of his favorite to the utter exclusion of those wiser lords whose counsels if followed on the instant might have shaken even the wise and patriot bruce yet they were so devoted to their sovereign they idolized him alike as a warrior and a man too deeply to allow that to the weak and vacillating conduct of edward they owed the preservation of their country it was easy to perceive by the springy step the flashing eye the ringing tone with which that magic name the bruce was spoken how deeply it was written on the heart the joy it was to recall his deeds and feel it was through him that they were free their converse easily betrayed them to be one of those wellordered though straggling parties into which king roberts invading armies generally dispersed at his command when returning to their own fastnesses after a successful expedition to the english border the laugh and jest resounded as we have said amongst both officers and men but their leader who was riding about a stones throw ahead gave no evidence of sharing their mirth he was clad from head to foot in chain armor of a hue so dark as to be mistaken for black and from his wearing a surcoat of the same color unenlivened by any device gave him altogether a somewhat sombre appearance although it could not detract in the smallest degree from the peculiar gracefulness and easy dignity of his form which was remarkable both on horseback and on foot he was evidently very tall and by his firm seat in the saddle had been early accustomed to equestrian exercises but his limbs were slight almost to delicacy and though completely ensheathed in mail there was an appearance of extreme youth about him that perhaps rendered the absence of all gayety the more striking yet on the battlefield he gave no evidence of inexperience as a warrior no sign that he was merely a scholar in the art of war there only did men believe he must be older than he seemed there only his wonted depression gave place to an energy a fire second to none amongst the scottish patriots not even to the bruce himself then only was the naturally melancholy music of his voice lost in accents of thrilling power of imperative command and the oldest warriors followed him as if under the influence of some spell but of his appearance on the field we must elsewhere speak he now led his men through the mountain defiles mechanically as if buried in meditation and that meditation not of the most pleasing nature his vizor was closed but short clustering curls of a raven blackness escaped beneath the helmet and almost concealed the white linen and finely embroidered collar which lay over his gorget and was secured in front by a ruby clasp a thick plume of black feathers floated from his helmet rivalling in color the mane of his gallant charger which pawed the ground and held his head aloft as if proud of the charge he bore a shield was slung round the warriors neck and its device and motto seemed in melancholy accordance with the rest of his attire on a field argent lay the branch of a tree proper blasted and jagged with the words ni nom ni paren je suis seul rudely engraved in norman french beneath his helmet bore no crest nor did his warcry on the field amiot for the bruce and freedom offer any clue to the curious as to his history for that there was some history attached to him all chose to believe though the age was too full of excitement to allow much of wonderment or curiosity to be expended upon him his golden spurs gave sufficient evidence that he was a knight his prowess on the field proclaimed whoever had given him that honor had not bestowed it on the undeserving his deeds of daring unequalled even in that age obtained him favor in the eyes of every soldier and if there were some in the court and camp of bruce who were not quite satisfied and loved not the mystery which surrounded him it mattered not sir amiot of the branch or the lonely chevalier as he was generally called went on his way unquestioned said not sir edward bruce he would meet us hereabouts at set of sun were the first words spoken by the knight as on issuing from the mountains they found themselves on a broad plain to the east of lanark bearing sad tokens of a devastating war in the ruined and blackened huts which were the only vestiges of human habitations near the answer was in the affirmative and the knight after glancing in the direction of the sun which wanted about an hour to its setting commanded a halt and desired that while waiting the arrival of their comrades they should take their evening meal on the instant the joyous sounds of dismounting leading horses to picquet unclasping helmets throwing aside the more easily displaced portions of their armor shields and spears took the place of the steady tramp and wellordered march flinging themselves in various attitudes on the greensward provender was speedily laid before them and rare wines and other choice liquors fruits of their late campaign passed gayly round an esquire had at the knights sign assisted him to remove his helmet shield and gauntlets but though this removal displayed a beautifully formed head thickly covered with dark hair his features were still concealed by a species of black mask the mouth chin and eyes being alone visible and therefore his identity was effectually hidden the mouth and chin were both small and delicately formed the slight appearance of beard and moustache seeming to denote his age as some oneandtwenty years his eyes glancing through the opening in the mask were large and very dark often flashing brightly when his outward bearing was so calm and quiet as to afford little evidence of emotion some there were indeed who believed the eye the truer index of the man than aught else about him and to fancy there was far more in that sad and lonely knight than was revealed it was evident however that to the men now with him his remaining so closely masked was no subject of surprise that they regarded it as an ordinary thing which in consequence had lost its strangeness they were eager and respectful in their manner towards him offering to raise him a seat of turf at some little distance from their noisy comrades but acknowledging their attention with kindness and courtesy he refused it and rousing himself with some difficulty from his desponding thoughts threw himself on the sward beside his men and joined in their mirth and jest hast thou naught to tell to while away this tedious hour good murdoch he asked after a while addressing a grayheaded veteran aye aye a tale a tale thou hast seen more of the bruce than all of us together repeated many eager voices and knowest yet more of his deeds than we do a tale an thou wilt but of no other hero than the bruce the bruce echoed the veteran see ye not his deeds yourselves need ye more of them but there was a sly twinkle in his eye that betrayed his love to speak was as great as his comrades to hear him have ye not heard aye and many of you seen his adventures and escapes in carrick hunted even as he was by bloodhounds his guarding that mountain pass one man against sixty aye absolutely alone against the galwegian host of men and bloodhounds glen fruin loudun hill aberdeen the harrying of buchan charging the treacherous foe when they had to bear him from his litter to his horse aye and support him there springing up from his couch of pain and suffering and depression agonizing to witness to hurl

would ye more the harrying of buchan tell us of that loudly exclaimed many voices while some others shouted the landing of the brucetell us of his landing and the spirit fire at turnberry head the strange woman that addressed him now which am i to tell good my masters laughingly answered the old man when the tumult in a degree subsided a part of one and part of the other and leave ye to work out the rest yourselves truly a pleasant occupation say shall it be thus yet stay what says sir amiot as you will my friends answered the knight cheerily but decide quickly or we shall hear neither i am for the tale of buchan there was a peculiarly thrilling emphasis in his tone as he pronounced the word for i was not in scotland at the time and have heard but disjointed rumors of the expedition the veteran looked round on his eager comrades with an air of satisfaction then clearing his voice and drawing more to the centre of the group your worship knows he began addressing sir amiot who stretched at full length on the sward had fixed his eyes upon him though their eagle glance was partly shaded by his hand that our good king robert the bruce determined on the reduction of the north of his kingdom advanced thereto in the spring of accompanied by his brother lord edward that right noble gentleman the earl of lennox sir gilbert hay sir robert boyd and others with a goodly show of men and arms for his successes at glen fruin and loudun hill had brought him a vast accession of loyal subjects and they were needed your worship of a truth for the traitorous comyns had almost entire possession of the castles and forts of the north and thence were wont to pour down their ravaging hordes upon the true scotsmen and menace the king till he scarcely knew which side to turn to first your worship coming i have heard from the low country can scarcely know all the haunts and lurkingplaces for treason the highlands of our country present how hordes of traitors may be trained and armed in these remote districts without the smallest suspicion being attached to them till it is wellnigh too late and the mischief is done well to drive out these black villains to free his kingdom not alone from the yoke of an english edward but a scottish comyn good king robert was resolvedand even as he resolved he did inverness the citadel of treason and disloyalty fell before him her defences and walls and turrets and towers all dismantled and levelled so as to prevent all further harborage of treason her garrison marched out the ringleaders sent into secure quarters and all who hastened to offer homage and swear fidelity received with a courtesy and majesty which i dare to say did more for the cause of our true king than a comyn could ever do against it other castles followed the fate of inverness till at length the north even as the south acknowledged the bruce not alone as their king but as their deliverer and savior it was while rejoicing over these glorious successes the lords and knights about the person of their sovereign began to note with great alarm that his strength seemed waning his brow often knit as with inward pain his eye would grow dim and his limbs fail him without a moments warning and that extreme depression would steal over his manly spirit even in the very moment of success they watched in alarm but silently and when they saw the renewed earnestness and activity with which on hearing of the approach of comyn of buchan sir john de mowbray and that worst of traitors his own nephew sir david of brechin he rallied his forces advanced to meet them and compelled them to retreat confusedly to aberdeen they hoped they had been deceived and all was well but the fell disease gained ground at first he could not guide his chargers reins and then he could not mount at all his voice failed his sight passed they were compelled to lay him in a litter and bear him in the midst of them and they felt as if the void left by their sovereigns absence from their head was filled with the dim shadow of death nobly and gallantly did lord edward endeavor to remedy this fatal evil lennox hay even the two frasers who had so lately joined the king seemed as if paralyzed by this new grief and hung over the bruces litter as if their strength waned with his sternly nay at such a moment it seemed almost harshly lord edward rebuked this weakness and conducting them to slenath formed some strong entrenchments of which the bruces pavilion was the centre intending there to wait his brothers recovery ah my masters if ye were not with good king robert then ye have escaped the bitterest trial ye know not what it was to behold himthe savior of his country the darling of his people the noblest knight and bravest warrior who ever girded on a swordlie there so pale so faint with scarce a voice or passing sigh to say he breathed the hand which grasped the weal of scotland the arm that held her shield lay nerveless as the dead the brain which thought so well and wisely for his fettered land lay powerless and still the thrilling voice was hushed the flashing eye was closed the foes were close around him and true friends in tears and woe beside his couch were all alike unknown ah then was the time for warriors tears for men of iron frame and rugged mood to soften into womans woe and weep men term lord edward bruce so harsh and stern one whom naught of grief for others or himself can move they saw him not as i have it was mine to watch my sovereign when others sought their rest and i have seen that rugged chieftain stand beside his brothers couch alone unmarked and struggle with his spirit till his brow hath knit his lip become convulsed and then as if twere vain all vain sink on his knee clasp his sovereigns hand and bow his head and weep tis passed and over now kind heaven be praised yet i cannot recall that scene unbind the folds of memory unmoved the old man passed his rough hand across his eyes and for a brief moment paused his comrades themselves affected sought not to disturb him and quickly he resumed days passed and still king robert gave no sign of amendment except indeed there were intervals when his eyes wandered to the countenances of his leaders as if he knew them and would fain have addressed them as his wont then it was our men were annoyed by an incessant discharge from buchans archers which though they could do perhaps no great evil yet wounded many of our men and roused lord edwards spirit to resent the insult his determination to leave the entrenchments and retreat to strathbogie appeared at first an act of such unparalleled daring as to startle all his brother leaders and they hesitated but there never was any long resisting sir edwards plans he bears a spell no spirit with a spark of gallantry about him can resist the retreat was in consequence determined on to the great glee of our men who were tired of inaction and imagined they should feel their sovereigns sufferings less if engaged hand to hand with the foe in his service than watching him as they had lately done and dreading yet greater evils ye have heard of this daring retreat my friends it was in the mouth of every scotsman aye and of englishman too for king robert himself never accomplished a deed of greater skill the kings litter was placed in the centre of a square which presented on either side such an impenetrable fence of spears and shields that though buchan and de mowbray mustered more than double our number they never ventured an attack and a retreat apparently threatening total destruction from its varied dangers was accomplished without the loss of a single man at strathbogie we halted but a short space for finding no obstruction in our path we hastened southward in the direction of inverury there we pitched the tent for the king and taking advantage of a natural fortification dispersed our men around it still in a compact square soon after this had been accomplished news was received that our foes were concentrating their numerous forces at old meldrum scarcely two miles from us and consequently we must hold ourselves in constant readiness to receive their attack well the news that the enemy was so near us might not perhaps have been particularly pleasing had they not been more than balanced by the convictionfar more precious than a large reinforcement for in itself it was a hostthe king was recovering yes scarcely as we dared hope much less believe it the disease which had fairly baffled all the leechs art which had hung over our idolized monarch so long at length showed symptoms of giving way and there was as great rejoicing in the camp as if neither danger nor misfortune could assail us more a new spirit sparkled in every eye as if the awakening lustre in the bruces glance the still faint yet thrilling accents of a voice we had feared was hushed forever had lighted on every heart and kindled anew their slumbering fire one day lord edward the earl of lennox and a gallant party were absent scouring the country about half a mile round our entrenchments and in consequence one side of our square was more than usually open but we did not think it signified for there wore no tidings of the enemy well this day the king had called me to him and bade me relate the particulars of the retreat which i was proud enough to do my masters and which of you would not be speaking as i did with our gallant sovereign as friend with friend aye and does he not make us all feel this burst simultaneously from many voices does he not speak and treat us all as if we were his friends and not his subjects only thine was a proud task good murdoch but which of us has good king robert not addressed with kindly words and proffered hand right right joyously responded the old man still i say that hour was one of the proudest in my life and an eventful one too for scotland ere it closed king robert heard me with flashing eye and kindling cheek and his voice as he burst forth in high praise and love for his daring brother sounded almost as strong and thrilling as was its wont in health just then a struggle was heard without the tent a scuffle as of a skirmish confused voices clashing of weapons and warcries up started the king with eagle glance and eager tone my arms he cried bring me my arms ha hear ye that and sure enough st david for de brechin and down with the bruce resounded so close that it seemed as if but the curtain separated the traitor from his kinsman and his king never saw i the bruce so fearfully aroused the rage of the lion was upon him hear ye that he repeated as despite my remonstrances and these of the officers who rushed into the tent he sprang from the couch and with the rapidity of light assumed his longneglected armor the traitorous villain would he beard me to my teeth by the heaven above us he shall rue this insolence bring me my charger beaten off say ye i doubt it not my gallant friends but it is now the bruces turn his kindred traitors are not far off and we would try their mettle now nay restrain me not these folk will work a cure for methere i am a man again and as he stood upright sheathed in his glittering mail his drawn sword in his gauntleted hand a wild shout of irrepressible joy burst from us all and caught up by the soldiers without the tent echoed and reechoed through the camp the sudden appearance of the bruces charger caparisoned for battle standing before his masters tent the drums rolling for the muster the lightning speed with which sir edward bruce lennox and hay after dispersing de brechins troop as dust on the plain galloped to the royal pavilion themselves equally at a loss to understand the bustle there all prepared the menatarms for what was to come eagerly did the gallant knights remonstrate with their sovereign conjure him to follow the battle in his litter rather than attempt to mount his charger they besought him to think what his life his safety was to them and not so rashly risk it lord edward did entreat him to reserve his strength till there was more need the field was then clear the foes had not appeared but all in vain their eloquence the king combated it all we will go seek them brother cheerily answered the king we will go tell them insult to the bruce passes not unanswered on on gallant knights our men wax impatient hastening from the tent he stood one moment in the sight of all his men removing his helmet he smiled a gladsome greeting oh what a shout rung forth from those iron ranks there was that noble face pale attenuated indeed but beaming on them in all its wonted animation confidence and love there was that majestic form towering again in its princely dignity seeming the nobler from being so long unseen again and again that shout arose till the wild birds rose screaming over our heads in untuned yet exciting chorus nor did the fact that the king strengthened as he was by his own glorious soul had in reality not bodily force enough to mount his horse without support take from the enthusiasm of his men nay it was heightened and excited to the wildest pitch for scotland and freedom shouted the king as for one moment he rose in his stirrups and waved his bright blade above his head for bruce and scotland swelled the answering shout we formed we gathered in compact array around our leaders loudly clashed our swords against our shields we marched a brief while slowly and majestically along the plain we neared the foe who with its multitude in terrible array awaited our coming we saw we hurled defiance in a shout which rent the very air quicker and yet quicker we advanced on onwe scoured the dusty plain we pressed we flew we rushed upon the foe the bruce was at our head and with him victory we burst through their ranks we compelled them at the swords point to turn and fight even to the death we followed them foot to foot and hand to hand disputing every inch of ground they sought to retreat to flybut no five miles of scottish ground five good broad miles was that battlefield the enemy lay dead in heaps upon the field the remainder fled and the king exclaimed the knight of the mask half springing up in the excitement the old mans tale had aroused how bore he this days wondrous deedwas not his strength exhausted anew aye what of the king repeated many of the soldiers who had held their very breath while the veteran spoke and clenched their swords as if they were joining in the strife he so energetically described the king my masters replied murdoch why if it could be he looked yet more the mighty warrior at the close than at the commencement of the work we had seen him the first in the charge in the pursuit we had marked his white plume waving above all others where the strife waxed hottest and when we gathered round him when the fight was done he was seated on the ground in truth and there was the dew of extreme fatigue on his browhe had flung aside his helmetand his cheek was hotly flushed and his voice as he thanked us for our gallant conduct and bade us return thanks to heaven for this great victory was somewhat quivering but for all that my masters he looked still the warrior and the king and his voice grew firmer and louder as he bade us have no fears for him he dismissed us with our hearts as full of joy and love for him as of triumph on our humbled foes no doubt responded many voices but buchan mowbray de brechinwhat came of themwere they left on the field they fled loving their lives better than their honor they fled like cowards as they were the two first slackened not their speed till they stood on english ground de brechin ye know held out angus as long as he could and was finally made captive aye and treated with far greater lenity than the villain deserved he will never be a randolph a randolph not a footboy in randolphs train but is more randolph than he but thou sayest buchan slackened not rein till he reached english ground he lingered long enough for yet blacker treachery if rumor speaks aright was it not said the kings life was attempted by his orders and by one of the comyns own followers ha escaped sir amiots lips say they this but he evidently had spoken involuntarily for the momentary agitation which had accompanied the words was instantly and forcibly suppressed aye your worship and it is true replied the veteran it was two nights after the battle all the camp was at rest i was occupied as usual by my honored watch in my sovereigns tent the king was sleeping soundly and a strange drowsiness appeared creeping over me too confusing all my thoughts at first i imagined the wind was agitating a certain corner of the tent and my eyes half asleep and half wakeful became fascinated upon it presently what seemed a bale of carpets only doubled up in an extraordinary small space appeared within the drapery it moved my senses were instantly aroused slowly and cautiously the bale grew taller then the unfolding carpet fell and a short wellknit muscular form appeared he was clothed in those padded jerkins and hose plaited with steel which are usual to those of his rank the steel however this night was covered with thin black stuff evidently to assist concealment he looked cautiously around him i had creeped noiselessly and on all fours within the shadow of the kings couch where i could observe the villains movements myself unseen i saw a gleam of triumph twinkle in his eye so sure he seemed of his intended victim he advanced his dagger flashed above the bruce with one bound one shout i sprang on the murderous wretch wrenched the dagger from his grasp and dashed him to the earth he struggled but in vain the king started from that deep slumber one moment gazed around him bewildered the next was on his feet and by my side the soldiers rushed into the tent and confusion for the moment waxed loud and warm but the king quelled it with a word the villain was raised pinioned brought before the bruce who sternly demanded what was his intent and who was his employer awhile the miscreant paused but then as if spellbound by the flashing orb upon him confessed the whole aye and more that his master the earl of buchan had sworn a deep and deadly oath to relax not in his hot pursuit till the lifeblood of the bruce had avenged the death of the red comyn and that though he had escaped now he must fall at length for the whole race of comyn had joined hands upon their chieftains oath the brow of the king grew dark terrible wrath beamed from his eyes and it seemed for the moment as if he would deliver up the murderous villain into the hands that yearned to tear him piecemeal there was a struggle brief yet terrible then he spoke and calmly yet with a bitter stinging scorn and this is buchans oath he said ha doth he not bravely my friends to fly the battlefield to shun us there that hireling hands may do a deed he dares not for this poor fool what shall we do with him death deathtorture and death what else befits the sacrilegious traitor burst from many voices pressing forward to seize and bear him from the tent but the king signed them to forbear and oh what a smile took the place of his previous scorn and i say neither torture nor death my friends he tried what are we sunk so low as to revenge this insult on a mere tool the instrument of a villainous master no no let him go free and tell his lord how little the bruce heeds him that guarded as he is by a free peoples love were the race of comyn as powerful and numerous as englands self their oath would avail them nothing let the poor fool go free a deep wild murmur ran through the now crowded tent and so mingled were the tones of applause and execration we knew not which the most prevailed and shall there be no vengeance for this dastard deed at length the deep full voice of lord edward bruce arose distinct above the rest shall the bruce sit tamely down to await the working of the villain oath and bid its tools go free filling the whole land with welltrained murderers shall buchan pass scathless to weave yet darker more atrocious schemes brother no frankly rejoined the king we will make free to go and visit our friends in buchan and there an thou wilt thou shalt pay them in coin for their kindly intents and deeds towards us but for this poor fool again i say let him go free misery and death god wot we are compelled to for our countrys sake let us spare where but our own person is endangered and they let him free my masters unwise as it seemed to us none could gainsay our sovereigns words sullen to the last the only symptom of gratitude he vouchsafed was to mutter forth in answer to the bruces warning words to hie him to his comrades in buchan and bid them an they feared fire and devastation to fly without delay aye only thus mayest thou hope to exterminate the traitors pity none spare none the whole district of buchan is peopled by the comyn bound by this oath of blood and thus he departed and spoke he truth demanded sir amiot hoarsely and with an agitation that had others more suspicious been with him must have been remarked although forcibly and painfully suppressed spoke he truth methought the district of buchan had only within the last century belonged to the comyn and that the descendants of the countess margarets vassals still kept apart loving not the intermixture of another clan said they not it was on this account the countess of buchan had exercised such influence and herself beaded a gallant troop at the first rising of the bruce an the villain spoke truth whence came this change why for that matter your worship it is easy enough explained answered murdoch and trust me king robert set inquiries enough afloat ere he commenced his scheme of retaliation had there been one of the lady isabellas own followers there one who in her name claimed his protection he would have given it not a hair of their heads would have been injured but there were none of these your worship the few of the original clan which had not joined him were scattered all over the country mingling with other loyal clans their own master had hunted them away when he came down to his own districts just before the capture of his wife and son he filled the tower of buchan with his own creatures scattered the comyns all over the land with express commands to attack hunt or resist all of the name of bruce to the last ebb of their existence he left amongst them officers and knights as traitorous and spirits wellnigh as evil as his own and they obeyed him to the letter for amongst the most inveterate the most treacherous and most dishonorable persecutors of the bruce stood first and foremost the comyns of buchan ah the land was changed from the time when the noble countess held sway there and so they felt to their cost it was a grand yet fearful sight those low hanging woods and glens all in one flame the spring had been particularly dry and windy and the branches caught almost with a spark and crackled and sparkled and blazed and roared till for miles round we could see and hear the work of devastation aye the coward earl little knew what was passing in his territories while he congratulated himself on his safe flight into england it was a just vengeance a deserved though terrible retaliation and the king felt it as such my masters he had borne with the villains as long as he could and would have borne with them still had he not truly felt nothing would quench their enmity and in consequence secure scotlands peace and safety but their utter extermination and all the time he regretted it i know for there was a terrible look of sternness and determination about him while the work lasted he never relaxed into a smile he never uttered a jovial word and we followed him our own wild spirits awed into unwonted silence there was not a vestige of natural or human life in the districtall was one mass of black discolored ashes utter ruin and appalling devastation not a tower of buchan remains allsayest thou all said sir amiot suddenly yet slowly and with difficulty left not the bruce one to bear his standard and thus mark his power has not your worship remarked that such is never the bruces policy three years ago he had not force enough to fortify the castles he took from the english and leaving them standing did but offer safe harbors for the foe so it was ever his custom to dismantle as utterly to prevent their reestablishment and if he did this with the castles of his own friends who all as the douglas saith love better to hear the lark sing than the mouse squeak it was not likely he would spare buchans but there was one castle i remember cost him a bitter struggle to demolish it was the central fortress of the district distinguished i believe by the name of the tower of buchan and had been the residence of that right noble lady the countess isabella and her children nay from what i overheard his grace say to lord edward it had formerly given him shelter and right noble hospitality and a dearer more precious remembrance still to his noble heartit had been for many months the happy home of his brother sir nigel and we know what magic power all associated with him has upon the king and had it not been for the expostulations of lord edward his rough yet earnest entreaty methinks that fortress had been standing yet that sternness terrible to behold for it ever tells of some mighty inward passions conquered again gathered on our sovereigns brow but he turned his chargers head and left to lord edward the destruction of the fortress and he made quick work of it you will scarce find two stones together of its walls he counselled right echoed many voices the eagerness with which they had listened and now spoke effectually turning their attention from their mysterious leader who at old murdochs last words had with difficulty prevented the utterance of a deep groan and then as if startled at his own emotion sprung up from his reclining posture and joined his voice to those of his men he counselled and did rightly they repeated it would have been an ill deed to spare a traitors den for such softening thoughts could we but free the countess isabella she would not want a home in buchannay the further from her cruel husbands territories the better and for her childrenthe one poor innocent is cared for and the other aye my masters and trust me that other was in our sovereigns heart as forcibly as the memories he spoke that which we know now concerning him was then undreamed of it was only faintly rumored that lord douglas had been deceived and alan of buchan had not fallen by a fathers hand or at least by his orders that he was in life in close confinement my old ears did catch something of this import from the king as he spoke with his brother what import asked sir amiot hoarsely only your worship that for the sake of the young heir of buchan he wished that such total devastation could have been spared if he were really in life as rumor said it was hard to act as if he were forgotten by his friends and what was sir edwards reply first that he doubted the rumor altogether secondly that if he did return to the king his loss might be more than made up and thirdly that it was more than probable that young as he was if he really did live the arts of his father would prevail and he would purchase his freedom by homage and fidelity to england ha said he soand the king did not then think with him nay declared he would stake his right hand that the boy young as he was had too much of his mothers noble spirit for such a deed it was well the stake was not accepted for by st andrew as the tale now goes king robert would have lost as the tale now goes thou unbelieving skeptic replied one of his comrades laughing has not the gallant been seen recognizedis he not known as one of king edwards minions and lords it bravely but hark there are chargers pricking over the plain hurrah sir edward and lord james and on came a large body of troopers and infantry even as he spoke up started sir amiots men in eager readiness to greet and join their armor and weapons they had laid aside were resumed and ere their comrades reached them all were in readiness sir amiot attended by his esquires and a page galloped forward and the two knights perceiving his advance spurred on before their men and hasty and cordial greetings were exchanged we should perhaps note that sir amiots manner slightly differed in his salutation of the two knights to lord edward bruce he was eager frank cordial as that knight himself to the other whom one glance proclaimed as the renowned james lord douglas there was an appearance of pride or reserve and it seemed an effort to speak with him at all douglas perhaps did not perceive this or was accustomed to it for it seemed to affect him little and lord edwards bluff address prevented all manifestation of difference between his colleagues even if there existed any ready to mount and ride why thats well he cried we are beyond our time but it is little reck we need but spur the faster which our men seem all inclined to do what news why none since we parted save that his grace has resolved on the siege of perth without further delay nay but that is news so please you replied sir amiot when i parted from his grace there was no talk of it there was talk of it but no certainty for our royal brother kept his own counsel and spoke not of this muchdesired event till his way lay clear before him there have been some turbulent spirits in the campyour humble servant this black lord and randolph amongst themwho in truth conspired to let his grace know no peace by night or day till this object was attained but our prudent monarch gave us little heed till his wiser brain arranged the matters we but burned to execute and what think you fixed this resolve simply that for a time we are clear of english thieves and norman rogues and can march northward and sit down before perth without fear of being called southward again edward will have enow on his hands to keep his own frontiers from invasion twill be some time ere he see the extent of our vengeance and meanwhile our drift is gained aye it were a sin and crying shame to let perth remain longer in english hands rejoined douglas strongly garrisoned it may be but what matter what matter why tis great matter replied sir edward joyously what glory were it to sit down before a place and take it at first charge no give me good fighting tough assault and brave defence think you i would have so urged the king did i not scent a glorious struggle before the walls strongly garrisoned i would not give one link of this gold chain for it were it not but a truce to this idle parley we must make some miles ere nightfall sir knight of the branch do your men need further rest if not give the word and let them fall in with their comrades and on whither demanded sir amiot as he gave the required orders where meet we the king in the glen of auchterader south of the erne lady campbell and isoline await us there with the troops left as their guard at dumbarton so you perceive our friend lord douglas here hath double cause to use the spur times like these afford little leisure for wooing and such lovestricken gallants as himself must een make the most of them and trust me for doing so laughingly rejoined douglas scoff at me as you will edward your time will come not it answered the warrior glory is my mistress i love better to clasp my true steel than the softest and fairest hand in christendom to caress my noble steed and twine my hand thus in his flowing mane and feel that he bears me gallantly and proudly wherever my spirit lists than to press sweet kisses on a rosy lip imprisoned by a womans smile nay shame on thee replied douglas still jestingly thou a true knight and speak thus were there not other work to do i would een run a tilt with thee to compel thee to forswear thy foul treason against the fair better spend thy leisure in wooing isoline trust me she will not be won ere wooed how now sir knight of the branch has the fiend melancholy taken possession of thee again give her a thrust with thy lance good friend and unseat her come soul of fire as thou art in battle why dost thou mope in ashes in peace thou speakest neither for nor against these matters of love wilt woo or scorn the little god perchance both perchance neither replied the knight and his voice sounded sadly though he evidently sought to speak in jest he had fallen back from the side of douglas during the previous conversation but the flashing eye denoted that it had passed not unremarked he now rode up to the side of lord edward keeping a good spears length from lord james and their converse turning on martial subjects became more general their march being performed without any incident
