a valiant ignorance a valiant ignorance a novel by mary angela dickens author of cross currents a mere cypher etc thy gold is brass prince hohenstiel schwangau in three volumes vol ii london macmillan co and new york a valiant ignorance chapter i the oppressive autumn weather continued for the next week and more but the atmosphere in the house at chelsea gradually cleared at least the electrical disturbances which had as a matter of fact culminated in julians departure for the club subsided as the days went on julian gradually recovered his spirits his temper which had given way so suddenly and completely under the strain put upon it by the unprecedented thwarting to which he had been subjected recovered its careless easiness the injured expression of moodiness disappeared wholly from his face and his manner resumed its buoyancy nevertheless the life of the present autumn was by no means the life of the past spring partly of course the different framework was responsible life especially at this particular moment when winter society was as yet hardly formed consisted by no means wholly of a social existence it was in fact distinctly slack and heavy on social lines as compared with the high pressure of the season and the introduction into the routine of life of a certain number of hours of regular work on julians partthe first practical acknowledgement in the house in queen anne street that work had anything to do with lifecould not fail to alter the tone to some extent but there was a subtle change in julian himself which was hardly to be accounted for on such broad lines he had recovered his normal mental temperature indeed but the interval of disturbance seemed to have had some indefinable effect upon him he had recovered himselfbut it was himself with a difference it was almost impossible to narrow the difference into words to say that he was colder to his mother or that he stood deliberately aloof from her would not have been true but there was a touch of independence about his whole personality which was new to it a certain suggestion of a separate life and separate interests such as must inevitably come to a man sooner or later which seemed to tinge his intercourse with hersuperficially the same as it remainedwith something of carelessness and even a hint of unconscious patronage if the change was felt by mrs romayne she made no sign or at least entered no protest after the little explanation which had taken place in the railway carriage she had utterly ignored the cloud which his moodiness had created and she ignored its passing away when julian was at home she was always bright and pleasant always charmed to have him with her always ready to let him go her little jokes at his expense in his new character of a worker were full of tact her playful allusions to her own solitary days were always light and gay nevertheless the characteristics which the ten weeks of their absence from town had brought to her face grew and intensified during the ten days that followed their return her eyes grew more restless her mouth more sensitive as though the strained sharpened look of anxiety which haunted her face during the hour which preceded julians return and during the whole evening when as happened several times in the course of that ten days he dined out went deep enough to leave lasting tokens of its presence her questions as to his work and the new friends the new haunts consequent upon it seemed to come from her lipsfar less selfconfident in expression in these daysalmost in spite of herself they were always uttered with a playfulness which hardly masked a slight nervousness underneath a nervousness which seemed to be a reminiscence of that first evening she was sitting alone in her drawingroom one afternoon towards the end of the second week of their return she had a book in her hand and a teatable before her but she had neither poured herself out any tea nor could she be said to be reading every two or three minutes her attention seemed to wander her eyes would stray vaguely about the room and she would rise and move restlessly across it to give some wholly unnecessary touch to a drapery or a glass of flowers once she had seated herself at her writingtable to begin a trivial note but the impulse had failed to carry her through and she had returned to her chair and her book it was halfpast four and she was expecting julian he had dined out on three consecutive nights and was doing so again tonight and in reply to her laughing protest against never seeing him he had promised carelessly to come home and have afternoon tea with her the doorbell rang at last and as the drawingroom door opened she lifted a smiling face with a gaily approving comment on his punctuality good boy she began then she broke off and laughed lightly though the brightness of her face suddenly ceased to be genuine the figure on the threshold was that of marston loring thank you he said i am glad you think so the observation was not intended for you im sorry to tell you returned mrs romayne as she rose to receive him and im afraid even if i applied it to you you would hardly condescend to accept it how do you do when did you come back sit down and let me give you some tea loring sat down accordingly with a mute witness in his manner of doing so to a certain amount of intimacy both with the room and its mistress but that touch of admiring deference which had marked his demeanour during the early stages of his acquaintance with mrs romayne was still present with him and was rendered only the more effective by the familiarity with which it was now combined thanks he said a cup of tea is a capital idea but i dont think its quite kind of you to say that i wouldnt condescend to the epithet good boy i should like to have it applied to me of all things it would be such a novelty and so wholly undeserved he spoke in that tone of sardonic daring on which a great deal of his social reputation rested and mrs romayne answered with a laugh no doubt it would she said with that very slight and unreal assumption of reproof with which such a woman invariably treats the tacit confessions of a man of lorings reputation you only want the epithet then because you know you dont deserve it she handed him the tea as she spoke with a shake of her head and added but tell me now when did you come back and where have you been ive been to the engadine he answered why i dont know unless that for six weeks at least of my life i might fully appreciate the charms of london i dont admire glaciers snow mountains bore me altitudes are always more or less wearisome and society au naturel is not to be tolerated i reached town the day before yesterday marston loring was faultlessly dressed it was impossible to associate his attire with anything but piccadilly and the best clubs and the best drawingrooms his face with its halfcynical halfwearied expression was in its less individual characteristics one of the typical faces of the society of the day his voice and manner wellbred callous and entirely unenthusiastic were the voice and manner of that world where emotion is so entirely out of fashion that its existence as an ineradicable factor of healthy human nature is hardly acknowledged his presence and his cynical coldblooded talk seemed to do mrs romayne good her face and manner hardened slightly as though her nerves were braced and something of the pinched restless look of anxiety faded its very nice of you to come and see us so soon she exclaimed with genuine satisfaction town has really been abominably empty these last ten days i suppose we came back rather too soon but it seemed time that julian should get to work really ive hardly seen a soul it is a deadly time of year assented loring with a quick look at her but im grateful to it if it makes my presence welcome to you of course i called at once i was rather afraid you might be still away we came back ten days ago answered mrs romayne accepting and putting aside his little compliment with a mocking gesture as a form of words entirely conventional julian has been quite lost without you he is looking very well i think and is working amazingly the introduction of julians name into the conversation had in neither case come from julians friend but this time it appeared to strike loring as incumbent upon him to pursue the topic the approving words with which you received me were intended for him i suppose he said carelessly youre expecting him there was a moments pause while mrs romayne turned her head as if involuntarily and listened intently that haunted look coming suddenly back into her eyes the moment passed and she turned to loring again with a quick selfconscious glance and an unreal laugh im expecting him yes she said im ridiculous enough to make that very obvious im afraid im so glad he wont miss you he doesnt generally come in at this hour this is a treatfor me she laughed and loring said with mock solemnity of interest indeed i really had to be quite plaintive this morning she went on in the same tone on the subject of not seeing him for four days except at breakfast he has made a good many new acquaintances already it seems and has to dine out a good deal really commented loring his tone was quite unmoved and mrs romayne did not see the expression in his shrewd shallow eyes as she spokean expression of amused curiosity he dines at his club i suppose he enquired indifferently after a moment yes or at some other fellows club laughed his mother legal institutions i suppose there was a brief silence one of those silences which come when one branch of a conversation is felt to be exhausted and then loring finished his tea put down his cup and settled himself into a comfortable attitude i forget whether you were taken with the ibsen craze last season mrs romayne he said we shall all have to tie wet towels round our headsit wont be becoming im afraidand give ourselves up to solitary meditation i hear he is to be the thing this winter they tell me ibsen repeated mrs romayne reflectively obviously searching in her memory for some ideas to attach to the name which she was as obviously conscious of having heard before ibsen oh yes with a sudden flash of inspiration oh yes of course that dolls house man that everybody talked of going to see just at the end of the season the first of those startling pictures of human nastiness which have since exercised criticism to so great an extent and which may or may not be revelations had taken a wonderful hold upon a certain section of society and had become as mrs romaynes words implied almost the fashion in the preceding june society is always inclined to be literary and intellectual or rather to an assumption of those qualities in the winter it was with a sense of the absolute duty of priming herself beforehand that mrs romayne continued with every appearance of the deepest interest ah no im sorry to say i was never able to spare an evening everybody told me all about it though it must have been awfully clever and interesting but you see just at that time one has so much on hand there was that dreadful bazaar too bythebye have the pomeroys come back yet do you know mr loring mr loring believed that they had not and after a little discussion of their probable plans mrs romayne returned to the subject of ibsen are they going to bring out a new play of his did you say she said carelessly so i hear answered loring an extraordinary piece of work with a tremendous theory in it of course the idea is the influence of heredity mrs romayne started slightly a strange flash leapt up in her eyes and as it died out quenched as it seemed by iron resolution it left a curious expression on her face it was an expression in which a light scornthe normal attitude of the shallow fashionable woman towards deep questions of any kindseemed to be battling indomitably for a place against something which was hardly to be held at bay by no means to be suppressed heredity she said and the ring of her voice matched the expression of her face its rather an interesting subject continued loring indolently scientific questions in their social aspects were just becoming fashionable its wonderful how long we have stopped short at the inheritance of roman noses and violent tempers and plain facts of that kind without getting to anything more subtle yes i suppose it is answered mrs romayne there was a hard restraint in her voice which loring took for preoccupation and laid to the account of her expectation of julian she was sitting with her back to the light and he could not see the expression of her face its awfully consoling dont you know he went on in the same tone to feel that one can lay all ones little failings to the account of some dead and gone ancestor with a scientific mind i dont notice bythebye that even the greatest and most enthusiastic scientists show any tendency to refer their virtues and talents back i presume they are always selfdeveloped mrs romayne laughed as she was obviously intended to do but her laugh was rather harsh do you know i think scientific men are a dreadful race she said they think that they know so much better than everybody else and that what they know is so immensely important as a rule you know its about something that they really cant know anything about and if they could it would be a great deal better not to bother about it she spoke with a confident conclusive superiority which is only possible perhaps in that section of society to which knowledge and brainpower are among the minor and entirely unimportant factors of lifeexcept when the knowledge is knowledge of the world and the brainpower that which has adapted itself to the requirements of society but the superiority in her tone rang strained and false she seemed to be forcing the attitude on herself even more than on loring and there was a faint ring of defiance in her voiceutterly inconsistent and incompatible with the words she spoke the combination was curiously suggestive of that consuming fear which denies the very existence of that by which it is created loring however was too fully occupied with a cynical appreciation of the humorous aspect of the wholesale condemnation of learning by crass ignorance to detect anything beneath the surface an enigmatical smile touched his lips theres a great deal of penetration in what you say he said of course there would be but i think youre a little sweeping perhaps when you say that they dont really know anything take heredity for instance its an actual fact capable of demonstration that but lorings eloquence was broken short off at that moment the door opened and julian romayne came into the room mrs romayne started to her feet at the sight of him with a strange hardly articulate sound which was almost a gasp of relief though it passed unnoticed by either of the two men as julian advanced quickly to loring how are you old man he said pleasantly awfully glad to see you back again this is the reward of merit you see said mrs romayne as loring replied in the same tone you come home to tea with your mother and you find a friend will you have some tea sir her face was still a little odd and unusuallooking especially about the eyes and the touch which she laid upon julian as if to enforce her words was strangely clinging and nervous in its quick pressure the talk drifted in all sorts of directions after that all more or less personal either to the speakers or to mutual acquaintances as the moments passed lorings eyes were fixed once or twice with momentary intentness on the younger man that new touch of independence about julian did not belong only to his manner with his mother it was just perceptible towards the friend whom he had hitherto admired with boyish enthusiasm loring rose to go at last and as he did so he turned to julian if it were not that i dont like to propose your deserting mrs romayne he said i should ask you if you wouldnt come and keep me company over a lonely dinner at the club julian i suppose you dont want to get rid of him by any chance he continued turning to mrs romayne mrs romayne and julian laughed simultaneously julian with a little touch of embarrassment im sure my mother has no objection to getting rid of me said julian rather hastily but unfortunately im engaged engaged said loring lucky fellow to have engagements at this time of year his tone was a little satirical and julian who was following him out of the room flushed slightly his colour was still considerably deeper than usual when he dashed upstairs after seeing loring out and put his head in at the drawingroom door im afraid i must be off directly dear he said carelessly i was awfully sorry to get in so late but allardyce wanted me an hour later julian was dining at a restaurant dining simply and dining alone having finished his dinner and smoked a cigarette glancing once or twice at his watch as he did so he took his hat and coat and strolled out it was nearly a quarter past eight and the only light was of course the light of the streetlamps and the gas in the shop windows he passed along piccadilly not quickly but with the deliberate intention of a man who has a definite destination until he came to a certain sidestreet then he turned out of piccadilly and slackening his steps sauntered slowly up on the righthand pavement he had walked up to the end of the street casting sundry glances back over his shoulder as he did so and was turning once more as though to saunter down the street again when the figure of a woman entered at the piccadilly end as soon as he saw her julian threw away his cigar and quickening his steps went to meet her the face she raised to his was the face of the girl on whose behalf he had interfered in piccadilly ten days before and her first words were uttered in the soft musical voice that had thanked him then have you been waiting she said im sorry the tone of the few words with which he answered together with the expression with which he looked at her showed as clearly as volumes of explanation could have done where and how the new julian was being developed only a minute or two he said a lonely fellow like me doesnt mind waiting a few minutes for the chance of a talk as ive told you before she looked up at him with simple pitying eyes and a certain wistfulness of expression too it seems so sad she said softly but youll make friends in london soon im sure have you been working very hard today have you been working very hard is the more important question he said turning his eyes away from those candid brown ones with to do him justice a certain passing shame in his own im afraid theres no need to ask that you look awfully tired clemence she shook her head with a pretty brisk movement of reassurance oh no she said its not been at all a hard day it never seems hard you know when we dont have to stay late unless something goes wrong in the workroom and i dont think that happens very often there was a simple genuine content in the tone and manner in which the words were spoken which taken in conjunction with the colourlessness of the face the tired look about the eyes and the poor worn dress told a wonderful little story of patience and serenity of spirit all that julian romayne knew of clemence brymerthe brief and very simple outline of her life as she had told it to himwas comprised in a few by no means uncommon facts she was a hand in one of the big millinery establishments and had worked at the same place for the last two years before that time she had lived from her childhood first with a married brother and then when he died with his widow and children from a certain touch of reserve in her manner of speaking of those particular years julian had gathered that they had been hard ones the marriage of the brothers widow and her departure to australia had left clemence alone in london her parents she told julian had come from cambridgeshire and one of her faint recollections of her father who had died when she was only five years old was of sitting on his knee in their little attic room in london and being told by him about his country home her mother had died when she was a baby and all her scanty recollections seemed to centre round the father who as she said simply had been a very good man the simple trust and confidence in her face as she raised it to julian now was a curious contrast to the nervous halffrightened uncertainty of her glance at him on that night in the spring when they had shared for those two or three minutes the shelter of the same portico but paradoxical as it seems at first both expressions were the outcome on different lines of the same moral characteristic clemence though there was that about heras her face testifiedwhich kept her in all unconsciousness and innocence strangely aloof and apart from her world had not spent her life in london without learning to know its dangers but the very purity which made the glances which she was forced to encounter in the streets at night a distress to her which made the very proximity of an unknown gentleman an uneasiness to her which made theoretical evil in short a terror to her rendered her singularly incapable of recognising its existence on any but the baldest lines her confidence was quickly won because though she was conscious of a world of evil about her it was as a something large and black and obvious that she regarded it brought into contact with herself anything fairseeming was touched by the whiteness of her own temperament and with such unconscious extraneous aid the thinnest veil was enough to hide from her anything behind her confidence once won might be destroyed but could hardly be shaken something in julians face and manner had won it for him and the outline of his circumstances which he had given her had won him something elseher pity exactly by what motive he had been actuated in his statements to her julian would have found it rather hard to say as a matter of fact he never asked himself the question before the end of their first walk together he had presented himself to her as a medical student living entirely alone in london having no female friends or even acquaintances and wearying often of the rough masculine companionship of his fellows on these grounds he had asked her when they parted at the end of a little povertystricken street near the farther end of the hammersmith road whether he might meet her now and again and walk home with her she had hesitated for an instant and then had assented very simply you havent had to work late for four nights now she said as they turned their backs upon piccadilly and began to walk steadily in the opposite direction shall you have to tomorrow night do you think she lifted her eyes to his face as she spoke and as he looked down and met them it would have been clear to an onlooker what was the charm that those long evening walks possessed for julian in the girls clear eyes there was admiration and absolute reliance in the look with which he answered them there was conscious superiority and protection just at the moment when he was sore and smarting with a sense of humiliation and futility when in his newlyaroused angry discontent all intercourse with women of his own class had become a farce and an inanity to him accident had thrown it into his power to create for himself as it were a world in which all that had suddenly revealed itself as lacking in his actual life should be lavished upon him for his acquaintance of piccadilly he had absolutely no surroundings except such as he chose to give himself the julian romayne of society the nonentity the figurehead as he had muttered angrily to himself had no existence for her it was julians own private julian a personality developed side by side with the sudden and violent readjustment of his conception of his relations with the world who was looked up to listened to respected and deferred to during the hours walk which lay between that sidestreet out of piccadilly and a certain little street out of the hammersmith road a vague undefined craving for preeminence and admiration had risen in him with his realisation of his dependence and the reflected nature of the light with which he shone in society to a weak nature in which that craving has once stirred it matters little by what means it is met so that it is to some extent satisfied the walk of tonight was a repetition of the walks that had preceded it the talk a little more intimate and a little more personal in tone than any of its predecessors as that of each of the latter in its turn had been in the course of the day something had occurred to remind clemence of her father and her fathers old home and in intervals of julians talk about himself she told him a good deal about her thoughts of that little country place of how there had been brymers here for generations and generations you must have been puritans once said julian laughing as he often laughed at some little grave turn of her speech as he looked into the sweet serious face workgirl as she was she seemed to have acquired neither the talk nor the voice of her kind the simple form of her words her accent and her gentle voice seemed to belong to a past quiet and full of a modest dignity of which the london of the nineteenth century hardly knows you would have made an awfully jolly little puritan clemence i dont know she said simply i was so little when father died but he felt it dreadfully ive heard when he came to london it nearly broke his heart why did he do it then said julian lightly he thought he ought returned the girl you see there was nothing to do at feldbournenothing but ploughing and country things you know and father thought a man ought to do somethingthat everything was meant to go on and get better you knowand that every man ought to help ought to work so of course he was obliged to come you see they had come to the end of the road now where they always said good night and as she spoke she was standing still looking simply into his face he looked at her for a moment with something in his eyes which seemed to be struggling vaguely into life side by side with the careless mockery of his set he was obliged to come because he thought he ought he said do you always do what you think you ought clemence i try she said simply every one tries i suppose he laughedthe laugh that was so like his mothersbut not quite so freely as usual and held out his hand i dont know about that he said good night clemence good night she said he hesitated a moment he never went to meet her without a firm and definite intention of sealing their parting with a kiss but he had never done so yet and he did not do it now good night he said again rather lamely and then they parted she going quickly and quietly down the street he passing out of it into the noise and bustle of the hammersmith road once there he paused as though undecided its too early to go home he said to himself ill go down to the club for a bit there were a good many men in the clubroom when he entered it half an hour laterand julianquite another young man to the julian who had walked to the hammersmith roadwas discussing the latest society topic with much animation over a whisky and seltzer when loring to whom he had nodded at the other end of the room strolled up to him cigar in hand dinner been a failure he enquired there was nothing particular about the words and the tone in which they were uttered was singularly almost significantly devoid of expression but there was a keen satirical expression in his eyes as he fixed them on julian julian started slightly at the words and a curious flash of expression passed across his face more or less he said with a careless frankness that seemed just a trifle excessive who was the man i dont think you know him said julian his carelessness bordering on defiance loring smiled his smile was never particularly pleasant and at this moment it was unusually cynical i know a good many men too he observed chapter ii the slight alteration in julian of which marston loring was conscious and a subtly evinced consequence of that alterationnamely that intimacy with the son no longer involved of necessity even an introduction far less intimacy at the mothers househad no effect whatever upon lorings relation with mrs romayne unless indeed it might be said to emphasize his position as friend of the house during the three weeks which followed immediately upon his first call after his return to town he saw at least as much of mrs romayne as he had done in the course of any previous three weeks since julians first introduction of him though the young man was no longer an obvious and tangible link between them he dined in queen anne street a few days after his return but except on that occasion it chanced that he hardly ever met mrs romayne and julian together he met the latter often enough at one or other of the clubs or about town on the former he called as in duty bound after the dinner and again and yet again at short intervals she had consulted him about a purchase of old oak with which she wished to surprise julian and the purchase seemed to necessitate in his eyes frequent consultation he also happened to meet her once or twice when she herself was paying calls she was always apparently pleased to see him more pronounced perhaps when she met him among other people than when she received him alone but still always more or less present there was a certain eager unconscious assertion of something like intimacy with him about her manner marston loring was quick to observe the new note and he prided himself likewise on the caution with which he refused to allow it even the value he believed it to possess he caught her quick recognition of his presence her tendency to draw him always into the conversation in which she happened to be engaged the tacit assumption of mutual interests and understanding lurking in her voice and he sifted and dismissed these things cynically as probably meaningless but astute as he was he never thought of them in connection with the constant references to julian the questions as to julians doings with which her conversations with him were full of these latter he took hardly any accountexcept for an occasional sardonic smile clever as he thought himself there were vast tracts of human nature to which he had no clue in the very existence of which he disbelieved consequently it was not surprising that he should now and then mistake cause for effect at about noon on a bright cold october day he got out of a hansom at twentytwo queen anne street with a certain cynical expectancy on his face the weeks which had passed since mrs romayne and julian returned to town on that close september day had brought on winter and had settled winter society fairly into its grooves and on the previous evening marston loring and mrs romayne had met at a dinnerparty mrs romayne had been alone to enquiries made for her son and regrets at his absence she had replied with a gaiety which became absolutely feverish as the evening wore on that he was unfortunately engaged throughout the evening as though some kind of strain were acting upon her selfcontrol all the characteristics of her demeanour towards loring had been slightly exaggerated loring had detected before he had exchanged two sentences with her that she was not herself that she was unstrung and nervous and arguing on totally false premises he had come to a totally false conclusion she had pressed him restlessly about the commission he was doing for her and he had twisted it this morning into an excuse for coming to see her when he knew she would be at home it is an unheardof hour i know he said as she rose to receive him with an exclamation of surprise but i want a little more detail and one or two measurements before i can execute your orders satisfactorily he had seen before she spoke that the weakness of the night before from whatever cause it had arisen had passed away the lines about her face were set into a determined uncompromising cheerfulness and her voice as she spoke conveyed the same impression it is more than kind of you and i am very glad to see you she said im always glad to see julians friend you know the last words with a laugh you dont happen to have met him this morning i suppose loring signified without a hint of sarcasm that it was more common not to meet the man one would wish to meet in the temple than to meet him and mrs romayne laughed again i know she said but one gets an absurd impression that men doing the same thing in the same place must be always coming across one another its very ridiculous of course you and he have always had a knack of finding one another out though i suppose you are quite one anothers greatest chums arent you is chum still the word bythebye i believe so returned loring carelessly yes he continued in a different tone i dont know when ive taken to any one as i took to julian there was a little gesture halfmocking half involuntary which accepted the words as a personal compliment and mrs romayne said with a smile you are a curious pair of friends too are you not julianher voice in uttering the name seemed to have acquired a new tenderness in the past month and lingered over it now evidently unconsciously and involuntarilyjulian is such a boy and you area great deal older than you ought to be she shook her head at him with a reproving laugh and he answered in his most blas manner im a man of the world you see i knew it all through and through before julian had left school i hope you wouldnt have preferred another boy for his chum there was a daring and a challenge in his tone which made the question personal rather to himself than to julian but mrs romayne took it from the other point of view quite the contrary she said quickly another boy would not have been at all the thing for him i am delighted to think that his mentor is a wise one i rely on you mr loring do you know she stopped abruptly the last words uttered suddenly and involuntarily had seemed curiously charged with a meaning which could not get itself expressed she paused an instant and then half as though she wished to laugh some impression away half as though she wished the words to have significance she added youll remember that wont you shall we go down and see about the fittings she rose as she spoke and led the way down to julians room the room was already as perfect as might be only a great restlessness an irrepressible and incessant impulse to give pleasure to its occupant could have dictated further improvements and as mrs romayne talked and explained the same restless instinct of service expressed itself in sundry little involuntary touches to trifles about the roomabout julians chair and his writingtable the doorbell rang at length and her face over which that new and weaker expression had stolen hardened suddenly im afraid i must send you away now she said turning to loring ive made an appointment for this morning to get through some bothering business you understand now just what i want though dont you i think so answered loring reflectively it would have been strange indeed if he had not understood by this time but im sorry i must go im sorry too said mrs romayne lightly i hate business and it loses none of its solemnity i can assure you when it is transacted by my connexion dennis falconer he is my trustee you know loring smiled he did not detect anything behind her words and it struck him always as perfectly natural that mrs romayne and her connexion should be somewhat antagonistic i should imagine he would be a rather ponderous man of business he said the parlourmaid entered at this moment to announce that mr dennis falconer was in the drawingroom and as they left the room mrs romayne turned again to loring to tell you the truth i find him rather ponderous at all times she said with a laugh didnt you say once that altitudes were oppressive well i must go and be oppressed she held out her hand as she spoke and then paused oh bythebye she said julian wants you to come and dine one day next weekonly hes so much engaged which day will suit you thanks answered loring i shall be charmed his face was quite impassive as he spoke but he was wondering nevertheless whether julian had as yet heard of the invitation from what he had observed lately he fancied that julian had reasons of his own for avoiding home engagements i am engaged on tuesday and thursday he continued but on any other day i shall be delighted did julian have a successful evening yesterday mrs romayne had explained to him on the previous night with forced merriment that her son was dining with a fellow he says yes i think so she answered lightly i dont know which fellow it was you know well then i will send you a note they had moved out into the hall as they talked and now as she paused at the foot of the stairs he shook hands again and went out of the house as she turned and went up to the drawingroom dennis falconer was standing waiting by the fire most punctual of men she said airily as they shook hands how do you do dennis falconer had by this time had five months of inaction and illhealth and the fact that he was heartily weary of both by no means served to soften the natural tendency of his manner towards reserve and severity in settling down to london life for the winter too the fact that he was no longer a new lion gave an added tinge of monotony to existence for him honestly unconscious as he was of this truth the days went very heavily with him he was conscious of having come to a dreary bit of his lifes journey and he endured it conscientiouslyif with rather selfconscious selfrespect an added gravity and silence seemed to him under the circumstances by no means to be deprecated under these circumstances the contrast between him and mrs romayne as they exchanged the trivialities of the situation was inexpressible and it was not surprising that they touched almost instantly upon the business which was the cause of their interview it was not a long affair it turned upon mrs romaynes desire to have rather more ready money at her command and dennis falconer having explained the situation to her having stated his views evidently conscientiously compelled thereto and having entered a formal protest against her instructions returned to his pocket the notebook to which he had been referring as if to emphasize the close of the matter then he paused mrs romayne had drawn a quick slight breath of relief at his action but the breath seemed to suspend itself for an instant on this pause and the eyes with which she watched his were very bright and intent as your only near relative he began with formal gravity and as your sons only near relative i feel myself bound to take this opportunity of approaching a subject which has been in my thoughts for some time any man of ordinary knowledge and experience of the world having regard only to the most ordinary circumstances would tell you that so large an allowance as you make your son is not an advisable thing for any young man mrs romayne had listened with her expression veiled and repressed into an intent vigilance and as he finished a dull flushwhich was none the less hot and significant because it had not the vivid intensity of the angry flush of youthcrept into her face and her eyes glittered her tone as she spoke witnessed to a strong selfcontrol and an intense determination not to abandon her position or to lessen by one jot the distance she had set between them i am sorry you think so she said carelessly i think so emphatically he returned i should think so for any young man for william romaynes son mrs romayne had been gathering up some papers from the table with light careless movements she rose now rather suddenly but still carelessly what seemed to him almost shameful callousness quickened falconer into what he thought a righteous disregard for all conventionality he too rose but his movement was no response to hers rather it seemed to crush and dominate its suggestion of easy dismissal with the implacable austerity of a reality not to be put aside he stood looking at her forcing her by the suddenly asserted superiority of his mans determination and mental weight to meet his grave condemning eyes does your son know what his father was he said in a low stern voice he had forced down the barrier he had annihilated the distance and she faced him with glittering eyes that dull flush all over her face its mask gone no she said and from her hard defiant voice also all artificiality had dropped away he knows nothing of his danger he has no safeguards and he has money at his command which would be temptation to any young man think what you are doing for a couple of seconds they confronted one another separated by no conventionalities man and woman with the common memory of a common horror between them holding them together in spite of every obstacle which temperament and habit mental and moral could interpose then with a tremendous effort the womans strength reasserted itself and by sheer force of her will she thrust away the horrible reality which he had forced upon her she laughed i really dont know what we are talking about she said i am sure you mean most kindly as to my spoilt boys allowance but we wont trouble to discuss it so good of you to take the trouble to think of itand so unnecessary for a moment falconer gazed at her almost petrified with amazement and disgust his perceptive and imaginative faculties had not developed with the passing of years his mental processes were slow and for all their ghastly exaggeration he accepted the careless shallow artificiality of her tone and manner and the smiling unfeelingness of the rebuff she had given him exactly as they appeared upon the surface it was some seconds even before he thoroughly realised how ruthlessly and completely she had imputed to him all the attributes of a meddler and as he did so an added distance touched the uncompromising sternness which had gradually settled down upon his face i beg your pardon he said and the formal unmeaning words seemed in their enforced condescension to her level to carry with them a lofty condemnation which was even contempt good day he added stiffly and then not seeing apparently the hand she extended to him with a hard smiling goodbye he left the room mrs romaynes face remained curiously blanchedlooking all the afternoon as though she had received some kind of shock she spent the afternoon in paying calls and whenever she returned alone to her carriage there crept back into her eyesbright and eager as she talked and laugheda certain haunting questioning not to be driven quite away by any simulation of gaiety as her afternoons work drew to a close her eyes were no longer quite free from it even as she made her attractive conversation and when she rose to bring her last visit to an end she was looking very tired she was just shaking hands with her hostess when mrs halse was announced to spare herself one iota of what she considered her social dutyeven when that duty took the form of civility to a woman she dislikedwas not mrs romaynes way with exactly the exclamation of pleasure and surprise which the situation demanded she waited pleasantly desirous of exchanging greetings with the newcomer while mrs halse bore down vociferously upon the mistress of the house mrs halse had only very recently returned to town and there was all the excitement of novelty about her appearance she was a good deal louder even than usual partly as the result of this excitement and partly as the result of absence from town and she had also grown considerably stouter announcements of this fact lamentations and explanations mingled with her greetings of her hostess and were still upon her lips when she turned to mrs romayne abominable isnt it she said pouring out her words as fast as they would come and without waiting for any answers such a trial i suppose i shall have to go in for turkish baths or something horrible of that sort and how is everybody how is that wicked young man of yours mrs romayne i heard of his goings on at the ponsonbys bythebye do tell him that hilda newton is engaged to be married so good for him no doubt he thinks she is pining away a very good match tooyoung compton rich and goodlooking rather a fool but dont tell master julian that master julians mother was smiling so charmingly that it was with some difficulty that mrs halse who with the assistance of miss newton had guessed the substance of the conversation which had actually taken place between the mother and son in the railway carriage during their journey from norfolk had some slight difficulty in restraining the ejaculation cat really was the suave answer miss newton is really engaged and so well so glad such a charming girl yes ill tell julian certainly his heart will be brokentemporarily fortunately his fancies are as ephemeral as they are numerous goodbye so glad to have seen you she pressed mrs halses hand cordially as she spoke and pursued her graceful way to the door julian was dining out again that night and her lonely evening apparently affected his mothers nerves at any rate julian received a message the next morninga sundayto the effect that she had slept badly and was resting but would see him at lunch and at lunchtime accordingly she appeared she laughed at his halfcareless halfaffectionate enquiries calling herself quite rested and quite well and after his first enquiries as to her health julian relapsed into rather moody silencesilence with which his mother had apparently nothing to do that tone of independence which had come to him and which was sometimes hardly perceptible could hardly have been more strongly evidenced than by his one or two spasmodic efforts to pass out of his own lifewhere something was evidently not to his likinginto the life they shared such a state of things is always more or less disturbing to the mental atmosphere more or less according to the sensitiveness of the person upon whom it acts and as mrs romayne sat opposite julian the furtive glances which she cast at his moody preoccupied face became more and more anxious and restless a tentative uncertain tone in her manner of dealing with him which had developed during the last month increased moment by moment and her voice and laugh as she chatted to himignoring his indifferent reception of her little bits of newsbecame moment by moment more forced and unreal that her nerves and her selfcontrol were not so reliable as they had once been was evident in the fact that she took refugeas was not unusual with her in these daysin painful exaggeration her bright little flow of talk stopped at last however and julian making no attempt to fill the gap there was total silence it was broken again by mrs romayne and she was talking now evidently for talkings sake as though she was no longer capable of weighing her words but in her intense desire to penetrate the vague atmosphere which she could not challenge was making her advances blindly i met mrs halse yesterday she began gaily did i tell you fortunately i only encountered her for a few moments or i doubt whether i should be alive to tell the tale she paused and julian smiled absently they had finished lunch and he had risen and strolled to the fire with a cigarette and he was thinking vaguely as her voice broke in upon his meditationsor perhaps rather feeling than thinkingthat his mother was rather artificial all society women were artificial he had thought once or twice lately and the word was acquiring a new significance to him she bestowed an immense amount of conversation upon me in the course of those few minutes continued mrs romayne in the sprightly tone which her son was beginning to hear for the first time as something jarring amongst other things she told me a little piece of news which will interest you yes said julian indifferently a fellow didnt always want to be entertained he was saying to himself irritably it was a nuisance his thoughts had wandered completely and he was going over a fruitless hour which he had spent alone walking up and down a certain sidestreet off piccadilly on the previous eveningan hour which was accountable for his gloomy humour this morningwhen he became aware of his mothers voice saying with insistent gaiety well sir arent you brokenhearted julian started and made a futile effort to realise what his mother had said the necessity for the effort and its failure proved by no means soothing to him and he said rather impatiently im awfully sorry mother but im afraid i didnt hear he didnt hear echoed mrs romayne in mock appeal to heaven and earth to witness the fact she too had made an effort and a failure and the result with her was to increase her nervous recklessness five weeks ago he was ready to eat his poor little mother because she prevented his proposing to this young woman and now when i tell him shes engaged he doesnt even hear perhaps youve forgotten hilda newtons very existence my lord who is her successor julian flushed angrily and his goodlooking face took a sullen expression shes not likely to have a successor as you call it he said a fellow doesnt care to have that kind of thing happen twice his mother broke into a thin nervous laugh you dont mean to say it rankles still she said gaily is this the reason of your devotion to work and fellows you silly old boy you ought to be thoroughly glad of your escape by this time i think i shall follow dennis falconers advice and cut down your allowance to teach you reason shall i the jest dragged in as it was had a forced ring about it perhaps it bore allunconscious testimony to the oppressively insistent power of that haunting questioning of yesterday but julian knowing nothing of this was simply conscious of everincreasing irritation from her voice and manner i dont see what business my allowance is of dennis falconers he said gruffly and then side by side with his growing sense of his mothers artificiality there grew in him an overmastering desire for another womans presencea simple presence to which social subtleties and affectation were unknown why hadnt clemence met him yesterday evening how could he tell when he would see her again tomorrow he could not meet her then his reflections paused as it were absorbed in a vague sense of discomfort and discontent until a fresh thought stole across them a thought which presented itself by no means for the first time that day why should he not go and see her this afternoon after all why should he not he never had done such a thing butdid it mean so much as it seemed to mean and if it did why not i dont see either his mother said and julian smiled grimly as he thought how little she knew the question she was answering its our business isnt it and its my private business to find you a nice wifenot yours at all you understand these last words with a laugh she must be pretty i supposegood style at any rateand she must be rich and she must have the makings of a good hostess in her really i think i must begin to look her out dont you think julian interrupted her he was hardly conscious that he was doing so he had hardly heard her words but the atmosphere of the perfectly appointed room with its artificial mistress had suddenly become absolutely intolerable to him and he had answered his own question suddenly and recklessly im going out mother he said ive got some calls to make and its getting late you wont go out this afternoon i know goodbye he was gone almost before she had realised that he was going to mrs romayne it was a repetition of their first evening at home together in the autumn the nervous excitement under which she had been acting died suddenly away and she realised what had happened realised it and sat for a moment staring at it as it were her hands clenched on the tablecloth her face haggard and drawn to julian it was no repetition it was a new departure sudden and unpremeditated and as he walked away from his mothers house his face was alight and eager with excitement and determination chapter iii on finding himself condemned to twelve months in london dennis falconer had debated the question of where he should live at some length and had finally decided on returning to some rooms in the neighbourhood of the strand in which he had been wont to establish himself during his temporary residences in london for the past fifteen years it was not a fashionable part of london falconer was a richer man now than he had been fifteen years before and there were sundry luxuries to be had in those quarters of london where wealthy bachelors congregate which were not recognised so far south of piccadilly it was also natural to him to think twice before he abandoned the idea of living where it was the proper thingof the hourto live but he was known and respected in his old rooms he would be received there with deferential delight he would be of the first importance in his landladys estimation and these things little as he knew it had a distinct influence on his decision the two rooms which he occupied on the first floor bore a strong likeness to the majority of firstfloor rooms in the same street occupied by single gentlemen these gentlemen were not as a rule of the class who think it worth while to impress their artistic character upon the room in which they live as a whole indeed they might have been said to lack artistic character here and there was a more inveterate smoker newspaperreader or novelreader as the case might be the sign manual of whose tastes was not to be obliterated but as a rule it was the landladys taste that reigned supreme and monotonous dennis falconers rooms were no exception to the rule the furniture was very comfortable very solid and very ugly in the style of thirty years ago an artistic temperament would have modified the whole appearance of the room insensibly and necessarily in the course of a week but falconer was not even conscious that anything was wrong he was as nearly devoid of sthetic sense even on its broadest lines as it is possible for a civilised man to be and the state of mind which takes pleasure in the tone of curtains and carpets and the form of tables chairs or china was to him incomprehensible and consequently a little contemptible on a november morning with an incipient yellow fog hanging about the appearance of the room in which breakfast was waiting for him was calculated to cast a gloom over a temperament never so little open to such influences and dennis falconer as he opened his bedroom door and came slowly out looked as though his mental atmosphere was already sufficiently heavy he always breakfasted punctually at nine oclock and he never went to bed before one it simply never occurred to him to make any concession to the emptiness of his present life by spending more than seven hours out of the twentyfour in sleep even if he had been physically able to do so and there were days when the intervening seventeen hours hung on his hands with an almost unendurable weight he had never been a man who readily made friends and his tendency in this direction had steadily decreased as he grew older so that the few men with whom he was intimate were friends of his early manhood and as it happened none of these intimates were in england at the moment he was absolutely incapable of forming those cheery unmeaning acquaintanceships which make the savour of life to so many unoccupied men he was one of those men with whom no one thinks of becoming familiar who is vaguely supposed either to have a private and select circle of friends or to be sufficient for himself whose demeanour correct selfcontained and a trifle formal seems to hold the world at a distance consequently his intercourse with his fellowcreatures was limited by his present life to slight conversation on the topics of the day at his club or in various drawingrooms where he paid grave stiff calls or attended stately functions cut off from his own particular work he had no interests and no pursuits it was a dreary life in truth and it was little wonder that falconers expression grew rather more austere with every week the sentiments of a man of his temperament towards a world in which there seemed so little place for him and from which he could derive so little satisfaction would inevitably tend towards stern disapproval on this particular morning the sense of dreariness was very heavy upon him on the previous day he had had an interview with the great doctor to whose fiat he owed his detention in london the great doctor had been indefinite and unsatisfactory had looked grave and talked vaguely about troublesome complications and a possible necessity of complete repose falconer had made no sign of discomposure had taken his leave with his usual courteous gravity and had left the consultingroom with a cold chill at his heart the cold chill was about it still this morning as he walked to his window before going to the breakfasttable and stood there looking blankly out what he was really looking at was the prospect before him if as the doctor had hinted he should have to lie up for a time a lodging and a nurse or a hospital solitude and confinement in either case he sighed heavily and turning as though with the instinct to turn away from his troubles he sat down to the table poured out his coffee and took up the letters lying by his plate there were only twoone in a commonlooking envelope directed in an illiterate hand the other in a clear characteristic mans hand at the sight of which his face brightened perceptibly aston he said to himself and opened it quickly his friendship for the little doctor which time had only served to strengthen was perhaps the most genial sentiment of dennis falconers life and dr astons absence in india at this particular period had been a bitter disappointment to him he had hoped for some time that the doctors plansalways of a somewhat erratic naturemight bring him back to london shortly and as his eyes fell on the first sentence of the letter a slight sound of intense relief escaped him an eloquent testimony to his present loneliness dr aston began by telling him that he would be in england before christmas the letter was long and interesting it abounded in bits of vivid description and shrewd observation and its comments on falconers proceedings were keen and kindly its recipient allowed himself to become absorbed in it to the total neglect of his breakfast and his expression was lighter than it had been for weeks when he came upon these sentences towards the close of the letter bythebye in the latest intelligence of london societyall is fish in the shape of human nature that comes to my net as you know and i study that curious institution carefully whenever i get the chancei constantly nowadays come across the name of a mrs romayne the charming mrs romayne and her goodlooking son is the usual formula it is not by any chance the little woman with whom i got myself and you into such a terrible fix years and years ago at nicewilliam romaynes widow is it any relation i should like to know what became of that little woman if you can tell me she had stuff in her and whether the boy has dreed his weird yet falconer laid down the letter abruptly and turned to his breakfast his face stern and uncompromising his interview with mrs romayne now a fortnight old had accentuated markedly his grim disapprobation of her and the strong feeling of reprobation that stirred him then had so little subsided that the least touch was enough to reendow it with vigorous life stuff in her he muttered with a world of contempt in the curt ejaculation stuff in her if aston only knew he glanced at the letter again and a certain disapproval personal to the writer expressed itself in the grave set of his lips as he reread the words about julian his whole mental and moral attitude was antagonistic to and inclined to condemn what he characterised now as astons dangerous theories he passed with what seemed to him practical sense from astons extravagance to a stern consideration of the heinousness of such a life and education as julians for a young man in julians position julians position rightly considered involved in his eyes a reaping in obscurity humility and sombreness of life of the harvest of shame and disgrace which his father had sown and that there was anything inconsistent between this view of the case and his condemnation of dr astons theories he was utterly unaware he applied himself to his breakfast still meditating on mrs romayne and the probable consequences of her callousness and then he took up the other letter and opened it at the opening of his last expedition one of the men attached to it had met with a disabling accident and had been sent home the man had been with falconer on a previous expedition and when the latter returned to england he had made enquiries about him and had finally and with no little difficulty traced him out to find him crippled for life and in a state of abject poverty falconer according to his narrow and orthodox lights as strictly conventional in their way as were mrs romaynes in hers was a good man the letter he was reading now from the wife of this man was written by a woman by whom he was regarded as a kind of providence to be reverenced indeed not loved but to be reverenced with all her heart she and her husband had been rescued by him from despair all that medical skill could do for the man had been done at his expense the pair had been settled by him in a small house in camden town where mrs dixon a brisk capable woman was to let lodgings to this house falconer had been once or twice to see the crippled man and he was not now surprised to receive from the wife the informationconveyed in a style in which natural loquacity struggled with awe of her correspondentthat the husband had had one of the bad attacks of suffering to which he was liable and that if mr falconer could spare half an hour dixon would take it very kind with his duty falconer smiled grimly at the words if mr falconer could spare half an hour his whole day was practically at dixons disposal he would go up to camden town that afternoon he decided he almost wished he had thought of going before and as the thought crossed his mind the remembrance of what might possibly be lying in wait for himself in the not very distant future made him rise abruptly and thrust his letters into his pocket it was about twelve oclock when he left his rooms and walked slowly away in the direction of clubland he usually got through an hour or so at his club before lunch reading the papers and so forth the threatening fog of three hours earlier had rolled away and there were gleams of wintry sunshine about which made walking pleasant dr astons letter had cheered falconer considerably the feeling too that he had a definite occupation for his afternoon and an occupation which was not invented was invigorating and altogether he was in better spirits than he had been for many a day he was walking up waterloo place when his eyes which could not forego even in a london street their trained habits of keen accurate observation lighted on marston loring who was coming down waterloo place on the opposite side of the road loring was a man dennis falconer particularly disliked and after one disapproving glance he was looking away when he saw the other suddenly stop with a movementand evidently an exclamationof surprise and welcome in the same instant he became aware that julian romayne had turned out of a sidestreet and was greeting his friend apparently with effusion falconers brow clouded involuntarily the instinct of kin was so strong in him that there was a certain touch of personal feeling little as he wished it in his connection with the romaynes which made the thought of them particularly disagreeable to him and here for the second time today the young man and his mother were forced upon his notice he pursued his way up the street watching julian grimly and as he passed still on the opposite pavement the corner where the two young men were standing julian happened to look across saw him and made a ready courteous gesture of salutation falconer returned it stiffly enough and walked on julian turned to loring with a laugh old bear he said i wish hed take himself off to africa or somewhere hes a regular wet blanket to have about well old fellow and whats the news julian was looking very fresh vigorous and full of life there was a curious suggestion about him of alertness which was not without a certain excitement and his tone and manner as he spoke were almost superabundantly frank and loquacious ten days before loring had received a note from mrs romayne telling him that julian was going for a weeks holiday to brighton and that the alteration in his room must be completed if possible in his absence it is a sudden idea with him apparently she had written but do let us take advantage of it if loring had had his own private notion on the subject of this sudden idea on julians part he had made no sign to julians mother he had paid in silence his cynical tribute to the maternal wisdom which had presumably recognised the fact that if freedom is not granted it will be snatched three days had now passed since julians return but it had happenedhe himself could perhaps have told howthat until this saturday afternoon he and loring had not met there was nothing in his face and manner at this moment however but the most lively even demonstrative satisfaction and without giving loring time to answer his question he went on with an ease and gaiety which were very like and yet unlike his mother where were you off to the club come and have some lunch with me do i want to tell you how firstrate i think my room i hear youve taken no end of trouble over it it was awfully jolly of you old man glad you like it returned loring nonchalantly yes i think its nice but it was mrs romayne who took the trouble he was studying julian keenly though quite imperceptibly as he spoke the young mans manner was assumedof that loring was quite aware but what exactly did it hide what exactly was the secret he debated this question calmly with himself throughout the lunch which they took together a little later on interposing question and remarks the while into julians flow of fluent talk and laughter about brighton in particular julian was full of chatter and as he wound up a vivacious description of his doings there loring commented mentally he hasnt been to brighton at all aloud he said as genially as nature ever allowed him to speak well its very jolly to see you back again my boy do you know weve seen next to nothing of one another lately and i vote we turn over a new leaf eh what are you going to do this afternoon now he was leaning back in his chair lighting a cigarette as he spoke and apparently his attention was wholly claimed by the process as a matter of fact however he was studying julians face intently and his sense of annoyance was not untinged with admiration when not a muscle of that goodlooking face moved julian leant back and crossed his legs airily i promised to go to the eastons im sorry to say he said its an awful bore we might have done a theatre together now the eastons were mutual acquaintances of the two men but it so happened that they had taken irremediable offence against loring over some detail connected with the bazaar and it was no longer possible for him to call upon them julian was of course aware of the fact and loring smiled cynically at what he recognised as a very clever move a pity he said composedly better luck another time well youre not in any hurry anyway not a bit assented julian cheerfully disposing of himself in a most comfortable and stationary attitude but a moment later he sprang to his feet by jove he exclaimed i nearly forgot ive got a commission to do for my mother in bond streetshop closes at two can i do it a hurried reference to his watch assured him that he would just do it and with a hasty farewell he dashed out of the room loring did not propose to accompany him it was not worth while he told himself and he smiled sardonically as julian departed i shall find out he said to himself of course i shall find out the question is is it worth while to wait or shall i play my game with what i know the attached friend of the boy warning his mother in timehe smiled again very unpleasantlyor the sympathising friend of the mother having made a terrible discovery which is the better pose the latter i think yes the latter ill wait until ive made my discovery he dropped the end of his cigarette into an ashtray sat for a moment more in deep thought and then rose and strolled slowly away chapter iv julian meanwhile hailed a passing hansom sprang into it and told the man to drive not to bond street but to the athenum camden town there was an air about him as of one who plumes himself on having done a clever thing and as he settled himself for his long drive there was a curious excitement and radiance in his face when the cab reached its destination at last he jumped out and walked rapidly and eagerly away it was not a neighbourhood likely to be familiar to a young man about town but julian pursued his way with the certainty of a man who had followed it several times before in about ten minutes he turned into a neat and respectable little street consisting of two short rows of small houses with diminutive bow windows to the firstfloor rooms about halfway down he stopped at a house on the righthand side and knocked with a quick decided touch he was an object of the deepest interest as he stood upon the little doorstep to a brisk curiouslooking woman who was standing in the groundfloor window of the house opposite but her opportunity for observation was brief the door was opened almost immediately and with a pleasant greeting to the woman who stood aside he passed her and ran upstairsa course of action evidently expected of him he opened the door of the front room on the first floor and went eagerly in here i am he cried did you expect me so soon standing in the middle of the room as though she had suddenly started from her chair with her hands outstretched towards him was clemence and on the third finger of that thin left hand there shone a bright gold ring her face was a delicate rosy red as though with sudden joy just touched with shyness and all the beauty which had been latent in her tired workworn face seemed to have been touched into vivid almost startling life by the hand of a great magician by contrast with the face she turned to julian now the large eyes deep and glowing the mouth trembling a little with tenderness the face of a month ago pure and sweet as it had been would have looked like the inanimate mask of a dormant soul the soul was awake now quivering with consciousness womanhood had come with a purity and beauty beyond any possibility of girlhood looking at her face now it was easy to see by what means alone the latent strength of her character might be developed he drew her into his arms with an eager confident touch and she yielded to him completely clinging to him with the colour deepening in her face as he kissed it boyishly again and again it was a fortnight only since he had kissed her first i was watching for you she said softly i heard your step he laughed exultantly and kissed her again i thought youd be watching he said though im earlier than i told you do you know much earlier i say clemence how jolly the room looks it was a small room furnished and decorated in the simplest and cheapest style as great a contrast as could well be imagined to the rooms to which he was accustomed but it was very clean and very comfortablelooking and there was a homelike restful atmosphere about it which might well have radiated from the slender figure in the plain dress with that shining weddingring and lovely flushing face she smiled a very sweet pleased little smile do you think so really she said i am so glad it is that beautiful basketchair you sent and the flowers she glanced as she spoke at a pot of chrysanthemums standing on a little table in the window then she turned to him again her eyes a little deprecating do you think you ought to spend so much money she said shyly julian laughed and flung his arm round her as he surveyed the little room with a vivid air of proprietorship here he was master here his word was law here he was in a world of his own making and his only fellowcreature was his subject it looks jolly he pronounced again as a final dictum now come and sit down clemence and tell me what youve been doing since yesterday he settled himself into the armchair by the fire with a lordly air as he spoke adding come and sit on this stool by me like the sweetest girl in the world clemence hesitated hardly perceptibly hers was a nature to which trivial endearments came strangely almost painfully she had not yet learned to caress in play and there was an innate unconscious personal dignity about her to which trivial selfabasement was unnatural but almost before she was conscious of her reluctance there swept over her like a great wave of hot sweetness the remembrance that she was his wife it was her duty to do as he wished she came softly across the room sat down on the stool he had drawn out and laid her cheek against his arm it was a trivial action very quietly performed but it was instinct with the beauty of absolute selfabnegation and as if as her physical presence touched him something of her spirit touched him too a sudden quiet fell upon the exultant selfsatisfied boy at whose feet she sat not for the first time by any means there stole over julian a vague uneasiness a vague realisation of something beyond his ken something in the light of which he shrank unaccountably from himself his hand closed round the womans hand lying in his with a touch very different from the boyish passion of his previous caresses and for a moment he did not speak then he said slowly and in a low dreamy voice clemence i cant think why you should ever have loved me the hand in his thrilled slightly and the head on his shoulder was just shaken clemence could not tell him why she loved him the bald outline she could trace as most women can trace it she could look back upon her first sense of reliance her pity her admiration her sense of strange delightful companionship but the why and wherefore of it the mystery which had given to this young man and no other the key of her soul this was to her as a miracle as indeed there is always something miraculous in it even when it seems most natural to account for love to say that in this case it is natural in this case it is unnatural is to confess ignorance of the first great attribute of lovethat it is supernatural and divine there was another silence a longer one this time and the strange spell sank deeper into julians spirit he said nothing it would have been a relief to him to speak to reduce to words or indeed to definite consciousness the vague trouble that oppressed him but its outlines were too large and too vague for him it was in truth a sense of total moral insolvency but he could not understand it as such having no moral standpoint clemence neither moved nor spoke her hand lay motionless in his her cheek rested against him her beautiful eyes looked straight before them with a dreamy almost awestruck gaze at last with a desperate determination to thrust away so unusual an oppression julian moved slightly and began to talk he wanted to get back his sense of superiority and his voice accordingly took its most boyish and masterful tone you havent told me what youve been doing clemence he said have you given notice at your bonnet shop as i told you clemence lifted her head and sat up clasping her hands lightly on the arm of his chair no she said gently i thought i would ask you to think about it again i would so much rather go on if you didnt mind for one thing what could i do all day she looked up into his face as she spoke with deprecating pleading eyes which were full of submission too and the submission was very pleasant to julian i do mind he said authoritatively i cant have it clemence i cant always see you home dont you see and i wont have you about at night alone besides i dont choose that you should work but i do so want to she said laying her hand timidly and beseechingly on his it will be so difficult for you to keep us both you will overwork yourself im so afraid oh wont you let me help ive always worked you know it doesnt hurt me you dont want to forget that youve married a workgirl do you she smiled at him as she spoke one of her sweet rare smiles and he kissed her impetuously dont talk nonsense he said imperiously i cant allow it and thats all about it how do you suppose i could attend to my work when im kept at the hospital in the evening if i were thinking all the time of you alone in the streets no you must give notice on monday she looked at him wistfully for a moment he was condemning her to long days of idleness to constant uneasiness and selfreproach on his behalf to a certain loss of selfrespect but selfsacrifice was instinctive with her very well she said simply the little victory the assertion of authority restored julians spirits completely and he plunged into discursive talk more or less egotistical it was all necessarily founded on falsehood and it would have been a delicate question to decide when his talk ceased to be consciously untruthful and became the expression of a fictitious julian in whom the real julian absolutely believed the afternoon wore on the winter twilight fell bringing with it a slight return of the fog of the morning two hours had passed before julian moved reluctantly and said that he must go i shall come tomorrow he said taking her face between his hands and kissing it well go out into the country if its fine i wish it were summertime have you ever seen the river clemence not in the country she said it must be nice how much youve seen do you know i often think that you must wish sometimes i was a lady i dont know anything and i havent seen anything and she faltered and he rose laughing and drawing her up into his arms any one can know things he said lightly and any one can see things but no one but you can be clemence do you see oh what a bore it is to have to go he was lingering undecidedly as though a little pressure would have scattered his resolution to the winds and seated him once more in the chair he had just quitted but since he had said that he must go it never occurred to clemence to ask him to stay if it were not his duty he would never leave her if it was his duty now how could she hold him back tomorrow will come she said looking into his face with a brave smile i dont believe you want me to stay he returned half laughing half vexed dont i she said simply and he caught her in his arms again what a shame he said there goodbye are you coming to the door she shook her head ill stay here she said and watch you from the window i see you farther so ah its rather foggy im so sorry youll look up goodbye she lifted her face to his and kissed him tenderly and shyly and he left her standing by the window julian ran downstairs let himself out and stood for a moment on the doorstep as he realised the disagreeable nature of the atmosphere at the same instant the door of the house opposite opened and a man came out attended to the threshold by a woman she caught sight of julian instantly and said something to the man as he stood in the shadow in a deferential whisper julian shook himself confounded the fog and then glanced up at the window from which the light streamed on his face he waved his hand turned away and walked rapidly down the street pulling up his coat collar as he went as he went dennis falconer slowly descended the two steps of that opposite house and slowlyvery slowlyfollowed him chapter v goodbye so glad to have seen you what dear mrs ponsonby are you going to run away too so kind of you to come out on such an afternoon goodbye it was a friday afternoon and friday was mrs romaynes day this particular friday had been about as unpleasant atmospherically as it is possible for even a november day to be short of actual dense fog it had been very dark and a drizzling raina dirty rain toohad fallen unceasingly under these circumstances it was rather surprising that any one should have ventured out even in the most luxurious brougham than that mrs romaynes visitors should have been comparatively few in number the departure of the ladies to whom her farewells had been spoken and with whom she had been exchanging social commonplaces for the last quarter of an hour left her alone and as she returned to her chair by the dainty teatable and poured herself out a cup of tea she had apparently very little expectation of further callers though it was only just past five oclock for when the doorbell rang a few minutes later she paused and a look of surprise crossed her face she put down her cup with a little sigh which was more a concession made to the dictum of conventionality that callers are a bore than an expression of real feeling and then as the door opened she rose with a touch of genuine satisfaction my dear mrs pomeroy she exclaimed how sweet of you to come out on such a shocking day really you must have had an intuition of my forlorn condition i think maud dear how are you she had given her left hand to the girl in a familiar caressing way as she retained mrs pomeroys right hand and now she drew the elder lady with charming insistence towards a large invitinglooking chair indicating to the daughter with a pretty gesture that she was to take a low seat near the table it is an ill wind that blows no one any good she continued gaily as mrs pomeroy greeted her placidly it is really too delightful to get you all to myself like this how seldom one gets the chance of a cosy chat and how very seldom it comes with the people of all others with whom one would thoroughly enjoy it youll have some tea wont youoh yes you really must it is so much more friendly she laughed as she spoke and turned to the girl sitting demurely on the low seat near her with a tacit claim on her sympathy and comprehension which was very fascinating miss pomeroys pretty expressionless lips smiled sweetly and her mother who was always ready to yield to pressure where a cup of tea was concernedthat soothing beverage being forbidden her by her medical authoritiesanswered contentedly well thanks yes i think i will one really wants a cup of tea on a day like this doesnt one mrs pomeroy had rarely been known to leave a statement unqualified by a question it is really very disagreeable weather isnt it not that it seems to trouble you at all mrs pomeroy smiled one of her slow amiable smiles as she spoke i am so glad to see you looking so much better mrs romayne laughed i am very well indeed thanks she said but ive not been ill that i know of dear mrs pomeroy mrs pomeroy shook her head gently i thought do you know when i first came home that you looked as though your holiday had been a little too much for youso many peoples holiday is a little too much for them dont you think and how is your boy very hard at work we hear mrs romayne smiled mrs pomeroys opinion as to her looks had been quite correct and it was only within the last fortnight that they had altered for the better within that fortnight her brightness and vivacity had ceased to beas they had been for weeks beforewholly artificial something of the look of nervous strain had gone out of her eyes and her face was altogether less sharpened her smile now was genuine and her voice was strangely tender and contented very hard she said i have had to get used to a great deal of absence on his part he has gone down to brighton today until monday he needs a little fresh air of course it is so long since he has been shut up as he is now you must miss him very much said mrs pomeroy placidly mrs romayne did not answer directly except with a laugh i am almost inclined to envy mothers with daughters she said smiling at miss pomeroy again i wonder nowa sudden idea had apparently struck mrs romaynei wonder whether you would lend me your daughter now and then and i wonder whether she would consent to be lent i should be delighted said mrs pomeroy with vague amiability and an equally vague glance at her daughter and im sure maud will be delighted too wont you maud delighted assented maud with pretty promptitude well then we must arrange it some time or other declared mrs romayne gaily perhaps you would come and spend a week with me maudthat would be charming but she did not press the point letting the subject drop with apparent carelessness and talking about other things always keeping the girl in the conversation turning to her now and then with a pleasant familiar word or a gesture which was lightly affectionate the mother and daughter had risen to take leave when she said carelessly oh bythebye maud dear have you anything to do tomorrow afternoon ive been bothered into taking two tickets for a matine a charity affair you know but they say it will be rather good it would be so nice of you to come with me it will be very nice of you to take me was the response thank you very much a minute or two more passed in the arrangement of the place and hour for meeting and then mrs pomeroy drifted blandly out of the room followed by her daughter and mrs romayne was again alone she walked to the fireplace this time and putting one foot on the fender stood looking down her face intent and satisfied just the right sort of girl she said to herself just the right sort of girl she was wearing the little gold bangle which julian had given her on her birthdaythe one which miss pomeroy had helped him to chooseand she was turning it on her wrist with tender contemplative touches she was so absorbed in her reflection that she did not hear the servant come into the room or notice for the moment that the girl was standing beside her with a letter she started at last and looked up took the letter and opened it carelessly without looking at it as the woman took away the teatable dear cousin hermia unless i hear from you to the contrary i propose to call on you tomorrow saturday at three oclock on a matter of grave importance faithfully yours dennis falconer mrs romaynes face had changed slightly as she began to readchanged and hardenedand as she finished she drew the letter through her fingers with a gesture of mere impatience which was somehow belied by the look in her eyes something of that strained look had come back into them she could not see him tomorrow she was saying to herself briefly she was not going to put off maud pomeroy dennis falconer must fix another time and she would write him a line at once she walked quickly across to her writing table sat down drew out a sheet of paper and took up a pen and then she paused ten minutes later her note was written and on its way to the post but it was not directed to dennis falconer it began my dear maud and it told miss pomeroy that business had turned up which would make it impossible for mrs romayne to go to the theatre on the following afternoon and that she enclosed the tickets hoping that maud might be able to use them exactly on the stroke of three on the following afternoon the doorbell rang mrs romayne was alone in the drawingroom apparently lazily and pleasantly enough occupied with the latest number of the latest society paper and as the sound reached her ear her lips hardened into a thin straight line and her eyes flashed for a moment with a look of antagonism which was almost defiant then the servant announced mr falconer dennis falconer was looking very pale there was little colour even in his lips and his face was set and stern he took the hand mrs romayne held out to him and replied to her greeting in the briefest possible phrase with no softening of a something curiously solemn and inexorable about his demeanour though his eyes rested on her for an instant with a singular expression he disliked and despised the woman before him and yet at that moment he pitied her sit down she said i am charmed to see you though do you know you have chosen an inopportune moment i had a very pleasant engagement for this afternoon and i nearly put you off so i hope the business is really very grave her voice was lightness itself and that very lightness with the almost unusual loquacity with which she had received him seemed to witness to the presence in her mind of a recollection which she was determined to ignorethe recollection of their last interview in that very room there was an air about her of having entrenched herself behind a barrier which she defied him to pass of being resolute this time against surprise or against any other method of attack it is very grave said falconer and in contrast with her voice his rang with stern heaviness i must ask you to prepare yourself for bad news bad news she echoed sharply as her eyes fixed on his face grew suddenly bright and keen ohmoney i suppose her voice jarred a little though she spoke very lightly no said falconer his tone was absolutely uncompromising on his unsympathetic and unimaginative mind the effect of her manner was to obliterate his sense of pity beneath a consciousness of the retributive justice of the moment before her not money she said with a little unreal laugh well thats a comfort at any rate her hand had clenched itself suddenly round the arm of her chair on his monosyllable and now she paused a moment almost as though her breath had failed her before she said with affected carelessness and if notwhat her back was towards the light and falconer could not see her face i will answer your question if you will allow me with another he said have you noticed anything unusual in the course of the past monthor morein the conduct of your son in the instants dead silence that followed a slight creaking sound made itself audible and then died away the clenched hand on the bar of mrs romaynes chair had passed slowly round it with such intense pressure as to produce the sound then she answered him as he had previously answered her in a monosyllable no she said there was a desperate effort in her voice at carelessness at nonchalance at astonishment but it was penetrated through and through with all her past antagonism towards and defiance of the man before her accentuated into fierce repudiation falconers voice as he answered her seemed to confront that defiance with inexorable fate that is almost unfortunate he said sternly in that case i fear that what i have to tell you must fall with double and treble severity as coming upon you unawares will you not think again has he not been absent from home a good deal have his absences been satisfactorily accounted for have you ever provedhe paused laying stress upon the last wordhave you ever proved such accounts as given by himself correct with a valiant effort the power of which falconer must have appreciated had he been able to penetrate beyond the ghastly artificiality of the result mrs romayne rallied her forces and strove to throw his words back upon him to defend and entrench herself once and for all with the only weapon she knew she broke into a thin tuneless laugh what an absolutely gruesome catechism she cried really it would take me weeks of solitary confinement and meditation among the tombsisnt there a book about that bythebyebefore i could approach it in a duly sepulchral spirit do you know it would be an absolute relief to me if you could come to the point i am taking it for granted you see that there is a point which is no doubt a compliment which its infinitesimal nature hardly deserves produce the poor little thing for heavens sake the point is this said falconer grimly and concisely your sons life as you know it is a lie he has a sordid version of what is known as an establishment he is living with a workgirl in camden town there was a choked strangled sound and mrs romaynes figure seemed to shrink together as though every muscle had contracted in one simultaneous throb her face could falconer have seen it was rigid and blank except for her eyes for that first instant she looked as a patient might look who having suspected himself of a deadly disease having congratulated himself on the subsidence of his symptoms and known hope learns from his physician that that subsidence of obvious symptoms was in itself only a more dangerous symptom still and that he is indeed doomed her eyes were the eyes of a woman who looks despair full in the face but with no human being who keeps hold of life and reason can the vivid agony of such a vision endure for more than an instant it dulls by reason of its very insupportableness time is an empty word where mental suffering is concerned and the secondhand of the tall clock in the corner had traversed its dial only once before a kind of film passed over those agonised eyes and mrs romayne spoke in a thin hoarse voice and the man so close to her was conscious of nothing but a short pause and was revolted accordingly how do you know even in that moment the instinct of defiance of him personally could not wholly yield and lingered in her voice i have an old servant who lives in camden town he is an invalid and i occasionally visit him his wife is a garrulous woman and thinking that i have some claim on her gratitude considers it necessary to inform me as to all her own and her neighbours affairs visiting the husband last friday week i found the wife greatly excited and alarmed for the reputation of the streetin which she lets lodgingsby the appearance in the house opposite of a couple whose relations to one another had instantly been suspected by their landlady and her neighbours though they passed as newlymade man and wife with a sudden low cry of inexpressible horror and dismay mrs romayne sprang to her feet flinging out her hands as though to keep off something intolerable to be borne no no she cried breathlessly no no not that not married it would be ruin ruin ruin no no dennis falconer paused freezing slowly into what seemed to him surely justifiable abhorrence of the woman before him what if he knew in his heart that such a marriage would indeed mean ruin to a young man so bald a trampling down of the moral aspect of the position before the practical was not decent it was for a womanand that woman the young mans motherto be overwhelmed by the moral horror to the exclusion of every other thought and it was the practical alone that had drawn any show of emotion from mrs romayne i am sorry to have agitated you he said and his voice was cold and cutting as steel i have no doubt in my own mind that they are not married i had better perhaps continue to give you the facts in order chance led to my seeing the young man in question as he was leaving the house i recognised your son i proceeded to make enquiries he passes as a medical student under the name of roden the girl isor wasa hand at one of the big millinery establishments from her affectation of innocence and simplicity the woman who has most opportunity of observing her is inclined to think the very worst of her a quick hissing breathan unmistakeable breath of reliefparted mrs romaynes white lips she had sunk down again in her chair and was grasping it now with both hands as she leant a little forward trembling in every limb then it is not likelyit is not likely that he has married her she said in a low rapid tone to herself rather than to falconer as it seemed go on there is very little more to be said returned falconer icily they have occupied the roomsthat is to say the girl has occupied them visited every day by your sonfor three weeks now the woman has discovered that they had been somewhere in the country together for a week previously you will of course be able to recall his absence from home yesterday he took her away into the country again they are to return on monday he stopped and as though she were no longer conscious of his presence mrs romaynes head was bowed slowly lower as if under some irresistible weight until her forehead rested on her hand stretched out still upon the arm of her wide chair she lifted her face at last white and haggard as twenty added years of life should not have made it and rose helping herself feebly with the arm of her chair like a woman whose physical strength is broken falconer rose also he was utterly alienated from her he was conscious of only the most distant pity but he felt that it was incumbent on him to say something i regret very much that it should have fallen to my lot to break this to you he said stiffly and awkwardly i fear that coming from me he hesitated and paused from out the past confusing almost numbing him a vague and ghastly influence had risen suddenly upon him to strain that strange intangible and awful cord of common knowledge by which he and the woman before him were bound together revolt against it or deny its presence as they might under the touch of that influence his last words had come from him almost involuntarily he had not known whither they tended he could bring them to no conclusion mrs romayne looked him in the eyes holding now to a table by which she stood but with no weakness in her ashen face she seemed to be concentrating all her force into one final repudiation of him she ignored his words as though he had not spoken i will ask you to leave me now she said and her voice thin and toneless though it was left her completely mistress of the situation she made no movement to shake hands he hesitated a moment then bowed and left the room chapter vi its a jolly little place enough i think its lovely there was a certain tone of regret of lingering reluctant farewell in both voices though in julians case it was light and patronising in clemences dreamy and tender as julian spoke he shifted his position slightly as he leant against the iron railing by which they stood and let his eyes wander over the scene before them with condescending approval they were standing on the somewhat embryonic seafront of what a few years before had been a fishing village and was now struggling rather inefficiently to become a wateringplace such season as the place could boast was entirely confined to the summer months to the frequenters of winter resorts it was absolutely unknown consequently its intrinsic charms at the momentin all the lassitude and monotony left by departed glorymight have been considered conspicuous by their absence but it was a glorious winters day a slight sprinkling of snow had been frozen on the roofs of the somewhat depressedlooking houses and on the unsightliness of the unfinished seafront and brilliant sunshine almost warm in spite of the keen frosty air was glorifying alike the deserted little town the country beyond and the sparkling dancing sea the frosty invigorating brightness found a responsive chord in julians heart this morning he was not always so susceptible to such simple natural influences he was in a good humour with the place he had spent two wholly satisfactory days theretwo days moreover which had had much the same influence upon his moral tone as a change to bracing air and simple wholesome food would have on a physique accustomed to dissipation his survey ended finally with clemences face she was standing at his side looking out over the sea her eyes intent and full of feeling her beautiful face flushed and still absorbed by the mysterious charm of the ceaseless movement and trouble of the bright water stretching away before her what are you looking at clemence he said boyishly she lifted her eyes to his quite gravely and simply only the sea she said it is so beautiful i feel as if i never could leave off looking at it it makes me feeloh i cant tell you but it is like something great and strong to take away with one she looked away again oh i wish i wish we need not go she said with a little sigh i wish we neednt returned julian he had been dimly conscious of something in her eyes and voice which made her previous words simple as they seemed almost unintelligible to him and he caught at her last sentence as containing an idea to which he could respond its an awful nuisance isnt it and do you know it is time we started never mind well come down again soon they stood for another moment clemence looking out at the sunny sea julian taking another careless comprehensive view of the whole scene and then as though those last looks had contained their respective farewells they turned with one accord and walked away in the direction of the railway station and as if in turning her back upon the sunlit sea she had turned her back also upon something less definite and tangible a certain gravity and wistfulness crept gradually over clemences face as they went crept over it to settle down into a sadness most unusual to it as the train carried them quickly away towards london julian sitting opposite her was vaguely struck by her expression are you awfully sorry to go back clemence he said she started slightly and looked at him with a faint smile i suppose i am she said we have been very happy havent we there was a wistful regret in her voice which touched him somehow and he answered her demonstratively with a cheery and enthusiastic augury for the future clemence smiled again again rather faintly i know she said i mean i hope so onlyi dont know whats the matter with me i feel as ifsomething were finished julian broke into a boyish laugh her depression was by no means displeasing to him it was a tribute to his importance to her dependence on him and the necessity for cheering her up implied the exercise of that superiority and authority in which he delighted why what a dear little goose you are clemence he said leaning forward to take her hands in his a friday to monday cant last for ever you know but it can be repeated again and again why i shall be up every dayevery single day i promise you i shouldnt wonder if i found i could spend the evening with you tomorrow wont that console you she did not answer him but she took one of his hands in hers and pressed it to her cheek his consolation had hardly touched that strange oppression which weighed upon her and julian in high feather and quite unaware that only his voice was heard by her his words passing her by unheeded had been talking at great length about all the happiness before them when she said in a hesitating faraway voice could youcould you come home with me this afternoon julian paused a moment the question was hardly the response his words had demanded then he said decisively quite impossible i am sorry to say i would if i could you know dear but its quite impossible she gave his hand a little quick pressure i know of course she murmured gently she paused a moment and then said in a low voice rather irrelevantly as it seemed julianhis name still came rather hesitatingly from her lipsdo you thinkdo you like mrs jackson mrs jackson was the name of the woman whose rooms julian had taken for her and he started slightly at the question shes not a bad sort he said with rather startled consideration at least she seems all right isnt she nice to you clemence dont you like the rooms oh yes yes she said quickly almost as though she reproached herself for saying anything that could suggest to him even a shadow of discontent on her part i like them so very very much it is onlyi dont know what exactly somehow i dont think mrs jackson is quite a nice woman she had spoken the last words hesitatingly and with difficulty almost as though they came from her against her will julian glanced at her quickly what makes you think that clemence he said with judicial masterfulness have you any reason i mean but clemence was hardly able to define even in her own pure mind what it was that jarred upon her in her landladys manner and to julian she was utterly unable to put her feelings into words her hasty disclaimer and her hesitating beginnings and falterings however served to remove the misgiving which had stirred him lest some knowledge of his own real life should have come to the womans knowledge he was the readier to let himself be reassured and to dismiss the subject in that the train was slackening speed for the last time before reaching london and he intended to move into a firstclass smoking carriage at the approaching station julian was well aware of the risks of discovery involved in these journeys with clemence and though he faced them nonchalantly enough he used wits with which no one who knew him only in his capacities of man about town and budding barrister would have credited him to reduce them to a minimum to be seen emerging from a thirdclass carriage at victoria station was a wholly unnecessary risk to run and he avoided it accordingly you mustnt be fanciful clemmie he said now in a lordly and airy fashion ive no doubt mrs jackson is a very jolly woman as a matter of fact look here dear would you mind if i went and had a smoke now it isnt much further you know and one mustnt smoke in hospital you see clemence was very pale when he joined her on the platform at victoriajoined her after a quick glance round to see whether he must prepare himself for an encounter with an acquaintance and she did not speak only looked up at him with a grave steady smile which made her face sadder than before his announcement of his intention of putting her into a hansom drew from her an absolutely horrified protest she would go in an omnibus she told him hurriedly or in the underground she had never been in a cab it would cost so much but when he overruled her a little impatientlyit was not yet dark and he did not wish to remain longer than was necessary with her in victoria stationshe submitted timidly with a sudden slight flushing of her cheeks a fourwheeler julian she murmured pleadingly as they emerged into the station yard with a lofty smile at what he supposed to be nervousness on her part he signified assent with a little condescending gesture and stopped before a waiting cab here you are he said jump in she got in obediently and as he shut the door she turned to him through the open window goodbye julian she said in a low sweet voice goodbye he said cheerily smiling at her her face in its dingy frame looked whiter sweeter and more steadfast than ever and it made a curiously sudden and distinct impression on julians mental retina then the cab turned lumberingly round and he moved smartly away he did not see that as the cab turned that sweet white face appeared at the other window and followed him with wide wistful eyes until the moving life of london parted them julian was on his way to the club he had a vague disinclination to the thought of going home the house in chelsea was always more or less distasteful to him now and he had no intention of going thither before it was necessary it was nearly dark by the time his destination was reached and as his hansom drew up a few yards from the club entrance he could only see that the way was stopped by a carriage from which two ladies and a gentleman had just emerged it was the younger of the two ladies who glanced in his direction and said in a pretty uninterested voice isnt that mr romayne marston loring was the man addressed and he shot a keen considering glance at the speakermiss pomeroy the fact that her eyes had noticed julian when his quick ones had not trivial as it was was not without its significance to the man whose stockintrade so to speak was founded on clever estimate and appreciation of trifles was miss pomeroy not so entirely unobservant a nonentity as she was supposed to be he asked himself not for the first time or was there another reason for her quickness in this instance so it is he said hullo old fellow julian came eagerly up to the group as it paused for him on the club steps and shook hands in his pleasantest manner with mrs pomeroy i do believe its a ladies afternoon he exclaimed gaily what luck for me how do you do shaking hands with miss pomeroy id actually forgotten all about it and ive only just come up from brighton loring you must ask me to join your party old man tell him so miss pomeroy please whether strict veracity is to be imputed to a young man who professes unbounded satisfaction at finding fashionable ladies teas in full swing at his club when he has just come off a journey is perhaps doubtful but julian threw himself into the spirit of the moment with a frank gaiety and enthusiasm which was not to be surpassed the greater number of the ladies who were sipping club tea as if it were a hitherto untasted nectar and gazing at club furniture as though it were provision for the comfort of some strange animal were acquaintances of his and as he moved about among them his passage seemed to be marked by merrier laughs a quicker fire of the jokes of the moment and brighter faces than prevailed elsewhere he was enjoying himself so thoroughly apparently that he was unable to tear himself away and when he left the club at last he sprang into a hansom and told the driver to put the horse along he and his mother were dining out together and he had left himself barely sufficient time to dress he ran up the steps flinging the driver his fare let himself in with his latchkey and proceeded to his room up two steps at a time when he emerged thence twenty minutes later in evening dress he was congratulating himself on having done the trick capitally and well up to time he was a little surprised therefore as he came downstairs to find his mothers maid waiting for him outside the drawingroom door with the information that mrs romayne was already in the carriage and he ran hastily downstairs put on his overcoat and proceeded to join her im awfully sorry dear he said with eager apology i thought it was earlier the fact is i was awfully late getting in i found ladies teas going on at the clubso awfully stupid of me to forgetyou might have liked to goand it was rather good fun how are you dear he had let himself into the brougham as he spoke had shut the door and seated himself by the figure he could only dimly see sitting rather back in the corner so that little or no light fell on the face he had kissed his mother hardly stemming the flood of his eloquence for the purpose and he now hardly waited for her word or two of reply before he plunged once more into eager amusing talk he did not give his mother time to do more than answer monosyllabically and it followed that her silence did not strike him he sprang out when the carriage stopped to give her his hand but before he had given his instructions to the coachman and followed her into the house she had disappeared into the ladies cloakroom consequently it was not until she came to him as he waited to follow her into the drawingroom that he really saw her as his eyes rested on the figure coming towards him he suddenly saw not it but a sweet white face with wistful eyes looking at him from out of a dingy frame chapter vii always excellently dressed mrs romaynes appearance at that moment was brilliant almost excessively brilliant it seemed for a small dinnerparty her frock was of the most pronounced type of fulldress and she wore diamonds not many but so disposed as was her reddishbrown hair as to make the greatest possible effect but the detail which had caught her sons experienced eye and which had brought before him by some unaccountable law of contrast that other womans face lay in the fact that tonight for the first time his mother was slightly made up the colour on her cheeks the bright effectiveness of her eyes was the result of art it made her look haggard julian decided with careless indifferent distaste and then he was following her into the room she had hardly paused to speak to him apparently she imagined that they were late they were widely separated at dinner and were not thrown together as it happened during the whole evening but mrs romaynes personality was a factor in the party not to be ignored that night she was delightful everybody said it was a very select little dinner and society romps went on afterwards romps to which mrs romayne contributed her full share and to julian that newly acquired sense of his mothers artificiality was accentuated as the evening passed on into something like repugnance a repugnance which when he was seated with her at last in the brougham and driving home produced in him a strong disinclination to rouse himself to an assumption of vivacity and made him occupy himself with his own thoughts so exclusively that he never noticed that his mother uttered not a single word good night mother he said absently as they stood together in the hall he was stooping to kiss her when she stopped him with a slight peremptory gesture i want to speak to you she said her voice was tense and a little hoarse without another word without so much as glancing at him she passed him and led the way to his smokingroom turned up the lamp with a quick hard gesture and then turned and faced him all the colour had faded from julians face and he had followed her slowly with the first sound of her voice the conviction had come to him that he was discovered there were certain weaknesses in him hitherto undeveloped by the circumstances of his life but radical factors in his character morally speaking he was a coward his hour had come and he was afraid to meet it he came just inside the door and stood leaning against the writingtable confronting his mother but neither looking at her nor speaking tell me where you have been since friday she said low and peremptorily and then she stopped herself abruptly putting out her hand as though to prevent him from speaking as a spasm of pain distorted her face no she said in a hoarse breathless way no dont youll tell me a lie dont i know she had put out her hand and was steadying herself by the high oak mantelpiecepart of her recent present to julianbut her face was rigid and set and her eyes full of a strange indefinable agony which she seemed to be all the while holding desperately at bay never left the pale downcast almost sullen face opposite her with a determined wrench and setting in motion of all his faculties julian pulled himself together so far as to take refuge in that sure resort of the deficient in moral couragean assumption of jaunty and lighthearted noncomprehension perhaps he had never in his life been more like his mother than he was at that moment as he threw back his head and answered with an affected gaiety which was somewhat hollow and unsuccessful what do you know dear youre coming it rather strong arent you i know that you have been living with a common workgirl somewhere in camden town for a month or more the words were spoken in the same hoarse voice which rang now low as it was with an intolerable disgust but its expression seemed to affect julian not at all the words themselves were occupying all his perception a quick frown of consideration appeared on his forehead as though some relief or reprieve had come to him bringing with it possibilities the skilful turning to account of which called into play his mental faculties and in so doing strung up his nerve he dropped his artificiality of manner and seemed to brace himself to meet the emergency in which he found himself the situation had evidently suddenly altered its character for him he was no longer cowed by it there was a pausea pause in which mrs romaynes eyes seemed to dilate and contract and dilate again under the suffering to which she allowed expression in neither tone nor gesture and then there came from julian four awkward hardly audible words jerked out rather than spoken with long pauses intervening how do you know a short sharp breath came from mrs romayne and then she said with cold decisiveness though it seemed that nothing would take that hoarseness from her voice it matters very little how i know that i know by one chance that some one else may know by another some one else again by anotherthe details in each case when the chances are innumerable are nothing have you lived all this time in london not to know that discovery is inevitableto wonder how when it comes there was a bitterness a keenness of scorn in her voice which stung him like a lash and he answered hotly after all mother we are not living in arcadia we dont talk about these things and im awfully sorry im sure that this should have come to your knowledge im awfully sorry to offend you but hang it all im not worse than lots of fellows about his tone had gathered confidence and defiance as he went on and it seemed to shake her a little her hold on the mantelpiece tightened and she spoke quickly and rather nervously its very likely she said i dont want to argue the principle with you young men have their own ideas i know but how many young mendrop out how many young men with good positions good chances somehow or other get into bad odour get to be not receivedor if they are received it is with certain reservationsthrough this kind of thing oh of course i dont say its inevitable there are lots of men about as you say but its an awful risk in the case of a young man like you with no title to the position you hold in society but youryour personality dont you see it is a double and treble risk it is playing with edged tools it is holding a knife to your own throat you would go under so horribly easily she paused abruptly as though the image before her eyes were too terrible to her to be pursued further and tried to moisten her dry lips on which the touch of paint had cracked now showing how white they were beneath the ghastliness of the incongruity between her manner and the superficialities of which she spoke was indescribable julian did not speak he was moving one foot to and fro slowly over the carpet at which he gazed immovably and his mother went on almost immediately you must give it up julian she said incisively i will do anything that is necessary in the way of money i dont want to be hard upon you anything the girl wants you shall have but you must break with her at once she paused again but still julian did not speak still he did not raise his eyes she went on with a growing insistence in her voice which went hand in hand with a growing agony of appeal if you dont see the necessity now you must believe me when i tell you that you willyou will look dear your life is surely not so dull that you need run after such distraction as that you shall marry if you want to you shall marry any one you like but you mustyou must give this up julian she stopped for a moment and her voice grew thin almost faint as she pressed so heavily on the carving by which she held that her hand was bruised and blackened julian i am not telling you what it has been to me to know that you have deceived me i am not going to try and make you feeli dont want you to feel it dearwhat it has been to me to go over your homelife of the last few weeks and know that you have lied to me at every turnto me who have only wanted to make you happy i wont reproach you perhaps young men think it a kind of righta kind of right she repeated the sentence unfinished as it was as though it contained an idea to which she clung it is not for my saketo spare my feelings that i tell you you must give it up it is for your own julian my boy you must believe me her words quivering with entreaty died away her eyes full of supplication were fixed on his and julian spokespoke without lifting his eyes from the ground suppose i married her he said in a low shamefaced voice what the monosyllable rang out sharp and vibrating and mrs romayne all softness or relaxation struck from her face and figure in one sudden bracing of every muscle stood staring at him out of eyes alive with horror supposei marriedher supposing thati will tell you you would have to keep her and yourself you would have no more of my money and you would never be acknowledged in my house again her low voice was like fine cold steel and she paused then quite suddenly as though the horror kept at bay in her eyes had leapt up and mastered her in an instant she flung out her hands wildly crying julian julian you are not married tell me tell me you are not married and julian white to the very lips said low and hurriedly no there was a long silence with a choked hysterical cry mrs romayne dropped into a chair near her and covered her face with her hands julian drew out his pockethandkerchief and mechanically wiped his forehead at last he began in a nervous uneven voice mother look here iyou dont quite understand me isheitsits not the kind of girl you think he stopped and drew his hand desperately before his eyes that innocent white face in its dingy frame what did it want before his eyes now how could he get on if he kept looking at it sheweit was my fault mother look here i ought mrs romayne took her hands away from her face and clenched them together you shall not she said in a low steady voice sheshewas an awfully good girl dont you know shes notof course shes not one of our sort butshe would learn mother after all why not nothing else cancan make it right nothing else can ruin you completely was the steady answer you shall never do it if i can prevent it i have told you what i would do think it well over think what it would mean to you to have not one farthing but what you can earn to be cut by every one who knows you to be without a chance of any kind i told you that if you married i would disown you now i tell you something else break off this miserable connection and you shall have as i said anything in reason to give the girl in compensation once and for all refuse to do so and i will cut off your allowance until you come to your senses mother he cried fiercely by heaven mother you can take your choice was the unmoved answer her face was sharp and haggard the artificial colour stood out on it in great patches throwing into relief the vivid pallor beneath she had thrown aside her cloak as though the physical oppression was unbearable to her and the contrast between her face and her gorgeous dress with its glittering ornaments was horrible a smothered oath broke from the young man and lifting his right hand he began to rub it slowly up and down the back of his head as an expression of heavy fierce cogitation settled down upon his face to his unutterable surprise as he made the gesture there stole over his mothers face an expression of such deadly terror as he had never before seen he stopped involuntarily and she staggered to her feet holding out two quivering imploring hands for the first time in his life julian was using a gesture habitual in his dead father for the first time in his life looking into her sons face mrs romayne saw there the face of william romayne my boy she gasped my boy dont do that dont look like that for heavens sake for heavens sake she swayed for a moment to and fro and then fell heavily forward into his arms chapter viii a bitter east wind which was taking sufficiently depressing effect upon all london was dealing with peculiar grimness with redburn street camden town the neat little houses in that dreary grey dryness looked sordidly wretched there was something deserted and hopeless about them no one was to be seen except that at a firstfloor window about halfway down a womans figure was standing and as dennis falconer turned into the street his footsteps rang with heavy distinctness on the glaring pavement he strode slowly and steadily along and his solitary figure as it stood out with that peculiar sharpness of outline which is a characteristic production of east wind harmonised absolutely with the sombreness of the background his face was full of sombre purpose grave and stern it was about three oclock in the afternoon of wednesdaytwo days after julians return home on the morning of the preceding day julian and his mother had had a second interview which had ended in his giving a sullen and reluctant assent to her demands and in the evening dennis falconer had received from mrs romayne a brief almost peremptory note begging him to come to her he had gone to queen anne street accordingly severely unsympathetic but also severely reliable early on wednesday morning he had found mrs romayne in a feverish agony of agitation beyond even the power of her will to conceal or wholly to control her voice painfully thin and sharp her gestures restless nervous irritable her utterance hard and rapid had all testified to a strained tense excitement before which all her artificiality was utterly submerged and in which falconer himself was obviously regarded by her solely as the one instrument at hand to her necessity her whole soul seemed to be set upon the immediate termination of the affair as she called it it affected her evidently in only one way she looked at it from only one point of view as something to be finished up put away buried out of sight it was the thought of delay in the doing of this only that appeared to torture her of the affair itself with all its terrible significance its inevitable consequences she had as far as falconer could divine no adequate conception the girl must be bought off must be sent away must be sent right out of the country in caseand here came the one agonised sense of a possible consequence which falconer could detectin case julian should marry her after all it was evidently the haunting terror of such a contingency which had driven her to send for falconer it was obvious though she seemed to be striving hard to conceal it even from herself that she could not trust her son that she could find no rest in the promise she had wrung from him what she had to say to falconer was in effect that some one else must see the girl the arrangement to be surely effected must be brought about by a third person who would set about the business promptly and act decidedly it was this service which she wanted of falconer and falconer after a moments grave selfcommuning agreed to render it he was as far removed from sympathy with her in this her hard agonised reality as he had been from the artificial woman of the previous months or from the real woman of eighteen years before he considered her point of view in the present instance absolutely revolting in her but no man could question the practical sense of what she said or the advisability of the course she proposed and his conception of his obligations as her sole male relative and trustee was too intimately intertwined with his sense of duty and selfrespect to allow him to entertain even for a moment the possibility of refusing to act for her he had stood by her side impelled by that sense of duty gravely reliable and unsympathetic eighteen years before the irony of fate decreed that it was for him and for him only to act for her now to him it was simply the stern dictate of moral necessity to be obeyed as such accordingly he had received her instructions offering now and again a grim practical suggestion with a stern air of businesslike reserve had undertakenbeing at the bottom of her opinion as to the desirability of instant measuresto see the girl that same afternoon and he was walking down redburn street now in the pitiless east wind to carry that undertaking into effect he reached the house knocked and asked briefly for mrs roden the landlady whose sentiments towards her lodgers had developed rapidly in consequence of the enquiries which falconer had felt it his duty to make received his words with a sniff expressive of contempt and then informed him with a stare of insolent curiosity that she was hupstairs and led the way thither evidently urged to that act of civility solely by a hope of finding out something she was a coarse vulgarlooking woman with small red eyes which glittered expectantly as she flung the door open and announced in a loud and denunciatory voice eres a gentleman but if she had hoped for startling revelations she was disappointed dennis falconer advanced into the room with stern composure the figure in the window turned quickly but quietly to meet him and mrs jackson was obliged to shut the door upon the two clemence was looking very pale the vague shadow which had fallen upon her as she journeyed up to london two days before had deepened into a wistful questioning sadness she had not seen julian since she parted from him at victoria station on the previous day she had received a note from him which told her that work kept him from her for that day but that he would come as soon as he was able there was nothing to distress or alarm her in the fact itself more than once before a similar disappointment had come to her and even though the second day brought her no letter the blank merely meant as she assured herself hour by hour that she would see him before the day was done but strive against it as she might and did she had spent the past twentyfour hours weighed down by a sense of trouble utterly undefined utterly as it seemed to her without reason she had borne her burden with mute patience reproaching herself as for ingratitude and an inordinate desire for active happiness and struggling bravely to conquer it but neither arguing about it nor denying it as a less simple and straightforward nature would have done and now the appearance of falconer seemed suddenly to focus and define her vague distress the sudden conviction that julian was ill and that this gentleman had come from him to tell her so held her still and silent in a pang of cruel realisation and anticipation the light as she moved had fallen full upon her face and as he saw it a certain shock passed through dennis falconer he had seen her figure and even her face in the distance more than once but he had never before seen it with any distinctness and for the first instant the simplicity and purity of its beauty with the expression deepened by the strange shadow through which the past two days had led her clashed almost painfully with that idea of the girl which had grown during his conversation with mrs romayne into a kind of fact for him the next moment however he had reconciled appearances and realities as he conceived them with the grim reflection that there is no vice so vicious as that which wears an innocent face and in doing so had quenched what might have been perception beneath a weight of narrow truism no greeting of any kind passed between them all clemences faculties were absorbed in her dread falconer was busied with the process of reconciliation the strange little silence was broken eventually by falconer and he spoke with the unbending sternness and distance which that process and its conclusion had naturally accentuated i am here as the representative of julian rodens nearest relative and guardian he said it had been arranged between himself and mrs romayne on the suggestion of the latter that the girl if she did not already know it should be kept in ignorance of julians real name the statement was slightly overcoloured since julian was of age and his mother was no longer his guardian in any legal sense but to stern moralists of falconers type to whom the pretty little falsenesses of life are wholly to be condemned a slight misstatement in such a case is frequently permissible the brief uncompromising words had seemed to him to set the key of the interview beyond mistake he was consequently slightly taken aback by their effect every trace of colour died out of clemences face and two great dilated eyes gazed at him for an instant in dumb agony before she whispered hes notdead falconer made a slight almost contemptuous negative gesture he had no intention of being imposed upon by theatrical arts and as clemence her selfcontrol shattered by the sudden relief turned instinctively away and pressed her face down on the arm with which she had caught at the curtain for support he went on with immoveable sternness my business has to do with his life not his death the main point is very simple and i will put it to you at once absolute ruin lies before him is he or is he not to embrace it he saw her start and she lifted her face quickly and turned it to him all quivering and unstrung from her recent suffering and quite white he is in trouble she cried low and breathlessly oh what is it what has happened dennis falconers patience was approaching its limits and he spoke curtly and conclusively i think we may dispense with this kind of thing he said it can serve no purpose as everything is known i come now from his mother with full power to act for her he was interrupted a burning colour the colour of such paralysing surprise as can take in hardly the bare statement much less the consequent developements and inferences had rushed suddenly over clemences face dyeing her very throat his mother she exclaimed his mother her tone dropped as she repeated the words into a strange uncertain murmur in which incredulity acceptanceas a kind of experimentand something that was almost fear were inextricably blended the fear alone caught falconers ear his lips were parted to resume his speech with grim decisiveness in the conviction that she understood at last that nothing was to be gained by trifling with him when she said as though he had had nothing to do with her previous words go on please he looked at her again and was struck by a new look in her face as he had been struck by a new tone in her voice she was evidently going to drop all theatricalities he told himself perhaps you were not aware that he is practically under the control of his mother he said that is to say he is dependent on her for every penny he spends it is quite out of the question that he should make money at the barby his own profession that is to sayfor two or three years at least consequently the cutting off of the allowance made him by mrs roden will mean for him absolute penury she was staring at him staring at him out of two wide intense brown eyes with such a helpless bewilderment in her face that she seemed to be quite dazed she put her hand to her head as he paused with a feeble uncertain gesture but she did not speak and falconer went on severely i conclude that he has not represented these facts to you as they stand they are facts nevertheless you will therefore understand that his allowance withdrawn he will be entirely without the means of supporting you you may possibly consider that some shifty means might be found which by putting him in possession of small sums of money would enable him for a time to defy his mother let me point out to you something of what such a course would involve julian roden is a young man with a good position in societyi mean he is accustomed to be made much of by men and women who are his equals he has chances and opportunities of which he intends no doubt to avail himself all this in taking such a step he would throw away for ever social intercourse future career would go with his income at his mothers word now i will ask you only how long you could hope to depend on him in such circumstances how long it would be before his only feeling for the woman whom he had allowed to drag him down and to destroy all his hopes in life would degenerate into sheer repugnance and for how long he would care to keep her he paused and after a moments dead silence clemence spoke in a weak eager almost desperate voice there must be some mistake itit cant bethe same the words seemed to falconer a mere miserable subterfuge and he answered very sternly there is not the faintest possibility of mistake julian roden has owned the whole affair to his mother who taxed him with it on her discovery oh wait a minute wait a minute there was a ring of such intolerable pain such shame and anguish in the voice that falconers attention heavy and prejudiced as it was was arrested by it dimly and uncertainly and for the first time the girl before him appeared to him not simply as a representative of a degraded sisterhood but as a woman he looked at her for a moment as she stood with her face buried in her hands quivering from head to foot with a severe kind of pity i will tell you as briefly as may be what i am charged to say he said gravely but not ungently mrs roden is determined to break off her sons disgraceful connection with you at the cost of any suffering to herself or to him she is willing to believe that her son is to be considered in some sort as the more guilty party of the two in having acted as the tempter and she has no wish to deal otherwise than generously by you but there are conditions he paused again over the slender bowed womans figure before him there had gradually crept as he spoke a stillness like the stillness of death and now as he waited for her to speak clemence slowly lifted her head and looked at him looked at him with dull sunken eyes which seemed the only living points in a face out of which all life and expression seemed to have been crushed by a rigid haggard mask conditions she repeated her voice was hollow and had a monotonous faraway sound and the word seemed to have no meaning for her a sense of vague discomfort took possession of dennis falconer a dim sense that he was not being met as he had expectedas he had a right to expectdisturbed and annoyed him he had no idea that what he was chiefly discomposed by was a hazy consciousness that a touch of unconscionable respect for the woman who as he believed was utterly unworthy of respect was mingling with his already sufficiently unorthodox sense of pity but he entrenched himself in a triple armour of stiffness the conditions are these he said you will give your written word as under penalties for having obtained money by false pretences to leave england on a given date and by a given route and not to return to england within the next ten years mrs roden in return will pay you the sum of five hundred pounds if you refuse these terms and roden submits to his mother you will simply be the poorer by five hundred pounds if you induce him to defy his mother the consequences i have already described to you will inevitably ensue he waited for her answer steadily fortifying himself against being surprised at anything she might say but no answer came that strange stricken face was still turned full towards him but he had an uneasy sense that he was not seen by the great dull dark eyes he felt too that as she stood there with her hands tightly clasped together she was not thinking even remotely of the choice he had set before her though he knew that she had heard his words and understood them it was with an instinctive desire to rouse her to bring back some expression to her face that he said with an awkward gentleness which was quite involuntary there is no need for you to decide hastily you understand the alternative thoroughly no doubt i will leave you my address and you can write me your answer he felt in his pocket for his cardcase and the movement seemed to rouse her she stopped him with a slight motion of her hand theres no need she said as though the act of speaking had brought her back from somewhere far away and as though the claims of the moment were gradually becoming present to her she paused as if to gather force and to close upon herself a certain strangely fine reserve which seemed at once to hedge her about and hold her aloof from the man to whom she spoke and then she spoke very quietly i dont want any money if it is better that he should be free of me he shall be free thats all you are making a mistake returned falconer quickly there was something about the dignity of her manner which made him feel curiously impotent and small as though in the presence of an unknown power greater than himself and the sense increased the touch of irritation he had already experienced his tone was no longer coldly stern it was insistent and annoyed you should consider your future if you accept mrs rodens offer and leave england with a small capital you will have a chance of beginning life again the step you have lately taken may be your first step on the downward pathi conclude that it is you should reflect how difficult it is to pause there with a little money you may establish yourself in a respectable business and in the course of time you may even redeem your unfortunate past not a muscle of the still pale face moved it seemed to have grown strangely older and stronger in the course of the short interview and it listened to him with an air of courteous patience which seemed to set an impassable distance between them the perfect steadiness of her voice as she replied was the steadiness not of composure but of reserve it is quite impossible she said then i am sorry to have to say that i consider you both foolish and ungrateful said falconer with increasing severity you put it entirely out of our power to do anything for you am i to understand that you refuse to leave england i dont know i must think still the same distant unmoved patience you will do well to think was falconers reply and to put away from you in doing so a false pride which is entirely misplaced i will give you twentyfour hours for consideration and tomorrow afternoon i will call and see you again on second thoughts it had occurred to falconer that it would be a false step to give her his name and address i shall hope to find that you have come to a sensible decision he paused a moment and she made a slight gesture of acquiescence rather as though his words were indifferent to her than in any token of assent to what he said he added a stiff formal good afternoon and as her lips moved mechanically as if to frame the words in answer he turned and left the room as though his presence and his words had been so mere a drop in the deep waters of suffering which held her that his withdrawal affected her not at all clemence stood for the moment just as he left her hardly conscious as it seemed that he was gone then as though the sense that she was alone had come to her gradually she dropped feebly into a chair and let her face fall heavily forward upon the table chapter ix the hand crept round the clock the swift november twilight fell and still she did not move only her clasped hands stretched themselves out as if in prayer she was not praying though the attitude was instinctive and unconscious a blind mute appeal she was simply stunned the room grew darker and darker until its only light was a ray from the streetlamp outside falling straight across the bowed head and then there was a ring at the bell and a slow step upon the stairs clemence knew the step well though she had never before heard it fall like that as it fell upon her ear now a strong shiver ran all through her and her hands were drawn sharply to cover her face the door was opened and her face was pressed down still more tightly clemence what all in the dark why clemence the masterful rather aggressively cheerful young voice stopped abruptly and julian romayne stood still against the door he had closed behind him listening listening to a low pitiful sound which seemed to fill the very airthe sound of a womans heartbroken crying at the first tone of his voice great scalding tears had started to clemences eyes suddenly and without warning a low choking sob had shaken her from head to foot and she was crying now with the hopeless abandonment of suddenly loosened grief there was a moment during which the only sound in the room was the sound of her quivering sobs julian stood quite still on the first instant there leapt into his face such a look of fierce vindictive anger as absolutely transformed it the look faded slowly into a kind of bitter background and a hard sullenness settled itself upon itsettled with some difficulty as it seemed for his lips twitched a little then he advanced into the room and broke the silence and the roughness in his tone seemed to defy something within himself he made no attempt to light the gas the lamp outside made it possible to move about and apparently he did not care for further illumination come clemence he said whats the matter he had not approached her on the contrary he was on the other side of the room looking down at her across the lodginghouse table she did not raise her head or move as she replied indeed the choked broken words were rather the expression of the mingled shame and pity with which she was crushed than a definite answer to his words oh julian julian julian apparently the tone of her voice affected him in spite of himself for his face twitched again and he spoke more harshly still whats the matter i say she stretched her hands out to him across the table still without lifting her face in an unconscious gesture of appeal oh dont she cried beseechingly and piteously dont dear dont pretend any more ii know the hands thrust deep down into julians pockets were clenched fiercely and his teeth were set together as a look rose in his eyes which they had never held before my mother he said she answered only with a slight shivering gesture but it was enough with his young face white to the lips with passionate resentment julian turned brusquely away and took two blind strides to the window with a muttered oath there was a long silence julian stood at the window staring blankly out into the darkness with hard eyes clemence was indeed as she believed herself to be his wife how it had come about how he had drifted into anything so far from his vague thoughts in his first meetings with her he could not have said what it was that had shaped and moulded his intention into something so much purer and more manly than his own nature he only now and then felt faintly and indefinitely when he touched it as he could touch it rarely and densely in the woman from whose higher nature it emanated he had married her with that reckless carelessness for the future which seems almost abnormal but which is not an uncommon characteristic of weakness and now he was quite incapable of facing and enduring the legitimate consequences of his action he had lied to his mother to save himself from the heavier penalty with which she threatened him and his suggestion as to the possibility of his marrying the girl she believed him to have ruined had been a miserable consciously degraded attempt at cutting the gordian knot he had lied to his mother again deliberately and without compunction at their second interview giving her a promise which he knew to be an empty form in his word to break with the girl who was his wife he had come to clemence today intending to arrange for that temporary suspension of intercourse with her which was inevitable as a blind to his mother by telling her that he was obliged to go abroad immediately for an indefinite period now as he stood there in the dark little room with his eyes fixed on the solitary gaslamp outside he was gradually realising that it was all over his mother had sent had possibly come herself to clemence he supposed and clemence had of course declared herself his wife his plans were all upset his carefully made calculations were no longer of any avail it was all over his brain gradually ceased to busy itself he was staring darkly at penury humiliation ostracismnot thinking of them or feeling them but just contemplating them with a stupid mental gaze gradually a sense of his surroundings began to return to him he became conscious that it was a streetlamp at which he was looking that there was a dark little street before him that there was a dim room behind him and then from that room a low sound came to himfaint exhausted longdrawn sobs as of a woman who has wept herself into quiet he began to listen for them and count them involuntarily then they began to hurt him each one seemed to stick something into his heart at last he walked across almost mechanically and laid his hand tentatively on her shoulder its all right clemence he said huskily its all right dear after all you know you are my wife all right he was conscious of a vague idea that it was the supposition he had allowed that had cut her so cruelly there was another moments pause and then clemence slowly lifted her head and looked at him for the first time her face was white and exhaustedlooking with her tears and her eyes luminous and inexpressibly mournful seemed to look through the pale goodlooking young features above her into the poor cramped soul they hid i she said what does it matter about me julian its you oh my dear my dear its you itits awkward returned julian gloomily his consciousness of the prospect before him seemed to quicken and writhe at what he supposed to be her realisation of it its loss of everything practically of course one will be cut right and left and where money is to come from he was interrupted by a low cry clemence had drawn a little back as though to see him better and was looking up at him with her delicate eyebrows drawn together in intense painful perplexity and wonder oh julian she said and her low voice had for the first time a ring of reproach in it oh julian it isnt that dear it isnt that what does that matter what does it matter echoed julian with an angry laugh her words in the total want of comprehension the total incapacity for sympathy with his position to which they witnessed seemed to him to throw into sudden glaring relief the class distinction which lay between them and the sense of it came upon him jarring and overwhelming like an earnest of all he had done for himself it matters a good deal let me tell you clemence it mattersas you cant understand you know it matters just everything butcompared she said in a low quick tone a bright pained light in her eyes i knowi know of course that there is a great deal i cant understand butcompared compared with what in heavens name said julian angrily compared withyourself julian she cried laying a tender clinging touch on his arm compared with your own truth oh dont you know its that its only that that has been so dreadful to methat made me feel as if my heart was breaking its thinking that youve been false dear that youve said whats not true acted whats not true oh its that that i cant bear for you my dear my dear he stood looking down not at her face but at the worn trembling hand holding his in such a clasp of love and shameshame for him as he vaguely felt suspended between wrath and a certain cold creeping feeling which he could not analyse but which seemed to be gradually turning him into a horrible shadow it was an involuntary unwilling concession to this feeling as one might throw a sop to an oncoming allthreatening monster that he muttered awkwardly iim sorry i deceived you clemence deceived me there was an emphasis on the pronoun which seemed to lift her far above him in its absolute unconscious selfabnegation me oh it isnt that it doesnt matter who it is or how many people it is its the thing itself its the meaning to yourself andand heaven above julian dear you believe in heaven above dont you clemences creed was very simple the attitude of the spirit which heaven above had given her was not an affair of many words you know its oneself that matters it isnt what one has or the friends one has that make the differencetheyre not anything really its oneself she paused a moment but he did not speak he was still looking heavily down at the hand on his arm and she went on again her voice trembling with earnestness julian theres that at the bottom of everything in all kinds of life it doesnt matter whether ones rich or poor it doesnt matter whether people think well of uswe cant always make them and we cant all be rich but we can all be good dear heaven means us all to be good dont you think oh if it didnt if it wasnt that that mattered most of all down at the bottom what would the world come to be like and why should anybody go on living julian romayne was very young far down in his nature in that awful inextricable tangle which because it is so awful and so far beyond his reach man struggles so insanely to reduce to his poor little level to define and label and explain away but which remains in spite of him a mystery of god there was that strange affinity for noble thoughts and things which is the sign manual of his part in man never wholly withdrawn by its creator from the earth it is in the young that that instinctive affinity is most easily reached and touched and the simple ignorant unworldly wordswords which could have touched in julian no reasoning powerswere the medium which reached it now clemence had reached it more than once or twice before and its feeble stirring in response had quickened it and rendered it in some poor and infinitesimal degree sensitive to her touch he drew his arm sharply from those clinging pleading hands and turned away leaning his arm on the mantelpiece so that she could not see his face that cold creeping feeling which seemed to sap all his reality had stolen over his whole personality and he was held numb and paralysed in the clutch of an alldominating question was it really as she said his own life his own world had faded into shadows as of a very dream strange distorted shapes conceptions so new to him that they wore a weird and ghostly air of unreality seemed to be rising round him pressing him into nothingness was it as she said he did not speak and after a moment clemence went on very tenderly very delicately as though in her intense sympathy and feeling for the suffering she ascribed to him by intuition she dreaded to hurt him further diffidently and with difficulty because she was so little used to clothing in words all that to her was most real and vital in life youyou must think of the future dear i knowi know that you can hardly bear to look at the past but itit is past it hasnt been you really i know it cant have been andit will wear out of your life at last dear byby truth you will tell your mother that we are marrieda scarlet agonising colour dyed her face for an instantperhaps you have told her already and perhaps perhaps she will forgive you if notwhy if not perhaps thethe pain will help to wear it out my dearest her voice and the expression of the sweet white face she lifted to him had changed subtly as she spoke her great pity and sorrow for him had developed a strange new phase in her love for him it had become tenderer deeper she had lost her reverence for him but her love had triumphed over the loss and through the pain and victory it had won higher ground and become the love of sympathy and consolation but julian hardly heard her last words his attention had stopped as it were at those preceding them you will tell your mother that we are married had clemence not told then was it possible that she had not mentioned it that his mother did not know even now that there was still hope the thought arrested the current of his thoughts in an instant the possibilities the thought suggested all the tangible definite advantages it held swept over those faintly quickened perceptions in a sudden wave of excitement numbing them on the instant the things which had been realities to him as long as he had had any consciousness took to themselves substance once again and pressed about him life and the world resumed their normal complexion and he lifted his head quickly and turned do you meanhave you seen my mother whom have you seen do you mean that you have said nothing there was a pause as clemence looked at him for a moment confused and startled it seemed by his manner there was a wonderful unconscious touch of dignity in her gentle manner as she answered i never thought of it was it my mother no a gentleman julian moved abruptly with a low exclamation and began to walk rapidly up and down the little room absorbed in eager thought clemence watched him with a puzzled surprised look in her eyes and a little touch of reserve creeping over her face at last he stopped suddenly and began to speak looking anywhere but on her face look here clemence im afraid this sounds an awfully blackguardly thing to suggest but youll see its necessary it wont do for me to tell my mother just yet to tell you the truth she is frightfully set against my marrying i am done for all round as soon as she knows and it would be just cutting our own throats to tell heryet you know you see he went on hurriedly evidently anxious to prevent her speaking you see as i am ive got very good prospects in a few years if all goes well i shall be making heaps of money at the bara fellow that is well known you know can always get onand then it will be all right and simple meanwhile you see i have plenty of money and we can be together almost as much as we like quietly you know whereas if we burst it all up now we shall just starve and be out of it all our lives dont you see he stopped awkwardly but for the moment he had no answer clemence had listened to him the expression of her face changing from wonder to incredulity from incredulity to agony from agony to the look of a creature stricken to death she lifted her hand in the silence slowly and heavily to her head julian saw the gesture though he could not see her face and its heaviness somehow increased his discomfort you see its only common sense he said impatiently you mean that you want to go on living a double lifethat you dont want dont mean to try to do right the voice was not like the voice of the clemence he knew it was low distinct and stern and she spoke very slowly i mean that i dont want to ruin myself out of hand he said harshly dont be foolish clemence ruin she said in the same tone you dont know what real ruin means i dont know how to make you understand im not clever enough but i can tell you just this i would rather die than have it as you say for your sake not for my own only i would rather die until your mother knows the truth i wont even see you or speak to you again as to taking a penny of your money i would starve first her tone vibrating with intensity of meaning was quite low she was not declaiming or protesting she was simply making her stand at a proposition so terrible to her that it had carried her beyond the bounds of emotion for the moment julian was startled and aghast you dont mean that he said clemence thats nonsense its truth she said steadily you must choose she was standing facing him her slight figure erect and straight as he had never seen it her face was white as death and set into strange fine lines quite new to it all the softness about her mouth was being gradually pressed out as the latent strength developed as it seemed with every breath she drew it was as though the crisis in its sudden demand upon her forces was transforming her as she grappled with it transforming her into a woman before whom julian felt himself shrink into utter contemptibility he took the only means he knew to reassert himself and lost his temper deliberately well then i do choose he cried violently youre a foolish girl who doesnt understand clemence and byandby youll own i was right as to not taking my money thats absurd you know you must but im not going to ruin both of us for absurd fancies he stopped hoping she would answer and give him some advantage but she stood silent gazing at him with stern searching eyes as though she were trying in vain to reconcile the man before her with the man she loved julian felt her gaze though he could not see it and he went on hotly trying as it were to gather round him the rags of his old authority and superiority you dont suppose clemence he said that i propose this because i like it its not a nice thing for a man to propose to his wife i can tell you i should have hoped you would have understood that but after all its only for a time and it wont make any real difference to youthings will be just as they have been and if you cant feel about it as i do you must remember its because youve got a great deal to learn still and you must believe that what i say is right anyway youre my wife you know and youre bound to obey me im bound to obey you in all things that its right you should ask but im not bound to do what would be dragging you down and me too i cant make you do whats right it wouldnt do you any good for me to tell your mother but until you do it will be as i said then its you who part us he cried passionately you dont love me clemence you cant ever have loved me there was a moments pause and then her answer came in a strange still voice i do love you she said i love you so that i would give my life to blot out what youve said a dead silencea silence in which julian romayne seemed to feel something pulling and straining at his heartstrings then with a reckless desperate effort he tore himself away from its influence and spoke it cant be helped then he said fiercely and defiantly you must go your own way until you come to your senses some day perhaps youll be grateful to me for refusing to make fools of us i wouldnt have believed it of you clemence you make me almost sorry that i ever saw you now look here ive put it to you from every point of view ive tried as hard as ever i can to make you understand and if you wont you wont as to the money of course i cant hear of your not taking that i shall send you so much regularly every monthit wont be very much either but itll be enough to keep youand of course youll have to spend it but you need not be afraid that i shall want to see you again until you come to a more sensible frame of mind he waited but again there was no answer and again some influence from her still presence discomfited him and made him hurry on im going now he said roughly goodbye clemence he made a movement as though to go without a tenderer farewell but quite suddenly his heart failed him he turned again and took her into his arms impulsively and tenderly clemmie he said brokenly i sayclemmie her arms were round his neck pressing him closely and more closely with a desperate agonised pressure and a long clinging kiss was on his cheek dont keep me waiting long she whispered hoarsely you will do it at last i know i know you will butdont keep me waiting long she released him and drew herself gently out of his arms and julian turned and stumbled out of the room and down the stairs the most consciously contemptible young man in london and with no strength to act upon his consciousness chapter x you admire it mrs romayne it strikes you as true ah but that is very charming of you a confused babel of voicesthat curious indefinable sound which is shrill though its shrillness would be most difficult to trace harsh though it arises from the voices of wellbred men and women and absolutely unmeaningwas filling the two rooms from end to end and the soft light diffused by cleverly arranged lamps fell upon groups of smartly dressed women and men equally correct in their attire on male lines it was about five oclock not a pleasant time on a gusty sleety november afternoon if nature is allowed to have her own way but inside these rooms it was impossible to do anything but ignore nature the air was so soft and warmfaintly scented too with flowersand the colour so rich and delicate the rooms themselves were a curious hybrid between the fashionable and the artistic that is to say they were not arranged according to any conventional tenets and there were various really beautiful hangings bits of old brass bits of old oak and bits of old china about but all these though very cleverly arranged were distinctly posed the larger of the two rooms was obviously a studio rather too obviously perhaps since the fact was impressed by a certain superabundance of artistic prettinesses charming little arrangements in hangings palms or what not composed at every turn with the constantly shifting groups the unconventionalism in short was as carefully arranged as was the attitude of the host of the hour as he stood leaning against a large easel mysteriously curtained talking to mrs romayne he was a painter and a clever painter he had married a clever wife and as a result of the working of their respective brains towards the same goal he had become the fashion everybody went to the stormonteades affairs whether the affair in question was a little dinner a little evening or a little teapartymrs stormonteade always affixed the diminutive consequently everybody was obliged to go a fact which if carefully thought out will lead to some rather curious conclusions and the little teaparties particularly in the winter were considered particularly desirable functions one of these teaparties was going on now mr stormonteade himself was a tall goodlooking man who had nearly succeeded by dint of careful attention to his good points in conveying the impression that he was a handsome man he had fine eyes really remarkably fine as he was well aware when they were earnest and they were looking now with a deep intensity of meaning which was their normal expression into mrs romaynes face his mouth was not so admirable except when he smiled and consequently his thin lips were slightly curved his figure was too thin and the touch of picturesqueness about his pose and about his velvet coat redeemed it but his closelycurling hair was cut short and trim and showed the excellent shape of his head to the best advantage he had come up to mrs romayne only a minute or two before at the conclusion of a song a very little very fashionable music was always a feature of the stormonteades entertainments and good peoplethe phrase in this connection representing clever professionals possessed of the social ambition of the daywere glad to sing or play for them and she had begun to speak of a little picture of his which was one of the themes of the moment mrs romayne was dressed from head to foot in carefully harmonised shades of greengreen was the colour of the seasonwith a good deal of soft black fur about it her bonnet became her to perfection her face was so animated that in the soft light a certain haggard sharpness of contour was hardly perceptible her smiles and laughs as she exchanged greetings and chat were always ready if they left her eyes quite untouched her attention was apparently as free and disengaged as were the gay little gestures with which she emphasized her talk there was absolutely nothing about her which could have suggested to the ordinary observer anything beyond the surface of finished society woman which she was presenting so brightly to the world but on the previous evening she had had a note from falconer written immediately after his interview with the girl telling her only that he was to have a second interview and would see her on the following day that day was now drawing to a close and she had as yet heard nothing further it enchanted me she said now but then your things always do enchant me you know bythebye people say that you are going to do a big picture i hope that is not so little bits are so much more fascinating mr stormonteade smiledthe tender comprehending smile that was one of his charms no it is not true he said one is so fettered with a large work but little things represent the inspiration the feeling of the moment if they have any value it lies in that they had a distinct financial value though it is doubtful whether the dealers would have recognised the source ah the feeling of the moment said mrs romayne with pretty fervour that is what one so seldom gets isnt it and it is so delightful then she broke off with a charming smile to shake hands with mrs halse brought by the constant shifting of the groups into her vicinity mrs romayne was an excellent listener and reputed a good talker though she had probably never said a witty or a clever thing in her life but she was never exclusive she was always so to speak more or less in touch with the whole room and ready to extend her circle ive been making for you for hours she said gaily ah the word was an exclamation of pleased surprise as she suddenly became aware of a girls figure behind mrs halse a girls figure much better dressed than had been its wont and very erect with a latent touch of triumph and excitement on the pretty face it was miss hilda newton i did not know you were in london went on mrs romayne holding out her hand with gracious cordiality she is staying with me on most important business said mrs halse mrs halse had accommodated herself to her increasing portliness by this time and had apparently thought it necessary to increase the exuberance of her manner proportionately her voice and the laugh with which she spoke were equally loud trousseau you must know she is to be married directly after christmas and when i heard it i wrote and said shed better come straight to me and then i could see that she got the right things of course as shes to live in town she must have the right things you know of course assented mrs romayne gaily and airily and you are very busy the last words were addressed to hilda newton whose hand mrs romayne still held there was a curious mixture of resentment defiance and triumph in the girls face as she confronted the suave smiling countenance of the elder woman which just touched her voice as she answered very busy indeed she was conscious of a desire so to frame her answer as to suggest the position in society which was to be hers on her marriage but she could think of no words in which to do it and where is master julian broke in mrs halse delicacy and tact had never been more than names with her as her fibre mental and physical coarsened she was beginning to think it quite unnecessary to maintain even a bowing acquaintance with these qualities and her strident voice expressed a great deal that hilda newton would like to have expressed he must be made to come and offer his congratulationsor perhaps hilda will compound with him for a particularly handsome weddingpresent he knows talbot compton of course otherwise they must be introduced he is not here this afternoon im sorry to say returned his mother smiling mr stormonteade if he could have recognised the feeling of the moment in this particular crisis might have learnt a lesson on several points he has turned into a tremendously hard worker you know an astonishing fact isnt it i tell him he has secret intentions of taking the bench by storm she was laughing and looking idly away across the room when quite suddenly she stopped just inside the doorway shaking hands with mrs stormonteade and having evidently just arrived was dennis falconer and as she caught sight of him there flashed into her eyes through all the superficial brightness of her face something which was like nothing but a sheer agony of hunger it came in an instant and it was gone in an instant as he turned away from his hostess and caught her eye she made him a light gesture and smile of greeting and turned again to mrs halse and mrs halse was not even conscious of a pause its almost too astonishing dont you know said that vociferous lady with a laugh i dont half believe in these sudden transformations if i were you i should make him produce his work every night for inspection its my belief he is getting into mischief these hardworking young men are such frauds she laughed loudly and at that moment accident brought falconer on his way across the room to a standstill a few paces from her he had evidently intended to pass the little group but mrs halse frustrated his intention with a peremptory gesture she claimed his attention and as he drew nearer she said boisterously now dont you agree with me mr falconer arent these good hardworking boys the greatest scamps going falconer was looking very severe and impassive he shook hands with mrs halse and then turned perforce to mrs romayne taking her hand with an almost solemn gravity which contrasted sharply with the careless gaiety with which she extended it i didnt expect to see you this afternoon she said lightly stupid of me though every one comes to the stormonteades i did not expect to meet you he answered sternly i have called at queen anne street he had been astounded at not finding her at home he was distinctly of opinion that afternoon teas were not for a woman who should be sitting in sackcloth and ashes and the sight of her had shocked not only his sense of propriety but some deeper sense of the reality of the crisis at which he was assisting perhaps mrs romayne understood that her presence at the little teaparty scandalised him for there was a strange bitter smile on her lips before she turned to mrs halse and said with a rather hard strained ring in her gay voice youll get no support from my cousin i assure you mrs halse he was a most praiseworthy her voice was drowned in a ringing chord on the piano and as the prelude to a song filled the room she made a mocking gesture expressive of the impossibility of making herself heard and turning her face towards the singer as she stood by falconers side she composed herself to listen her face grew rather set and fixed in its lines of animated attention as the song went on and when it ceased her comments were of the indefinitely delighted order she made them very easily and brightly however and then she turned carelessly to falconer are you thinking of staying long she said lightly i rather want to talk to you do you knowthis unfortunate man is my man of business you must know mrs halseand i thought perhaps that i could drive you somewhere i shall be happy to go whenever you like was the grave answer mrs romayne laughed lightly oh i dont want to take you away immediately she said youve only just come im afraid in a little while she smiled and nodded to him and to mrs halse and miss newton and moved away to speak to some other people about a quarter of an hour later falconer who was a somewhat grim ornament to society in the interval saw her coming smiling towards him ready she said thats very nice of you suppose we go then he followed her out of the room and down the stairs her flow of comments and laughter never ceasing put her into her carriage and got in himself home she said sharply to the coachman the door banged they rolled away into the darkness and the wet and her voice stopped suddenly they rolled along for a few minutes in total silence shut up alone with her like that the isolation and quiet following so suddenly on the crowd and noise of a moment before falconers only conscious feeling was one of almost stupid discomfort her sudden silence too had an indefinable but very unpleasant effect upon him at last he said with awkward displeasure i was going to write to you i she lifted her hand quickly and stopped him when we get in she said in a quick tense voice you can come in it is just six it need not take long i am quite at your service she leant back in her corner with a sharp breath of relief and neither moved nor spoke again until the carriage drew up at her own door she opened the door with a latchkey and moved quickly across the hall to the foot of the stairs motioning to falconer to follow her then she stopped abruptly and turned a servant was just crossing the hall to the diningroom where the preliminary preparation for a dinnerparty could be seen is mr julian in said mrs romayne sharply not yet maam if he should come in before i go to dress tell him that i am engaged she turned again and went on to the drawingroom now she said in a breathless peremptory monosyllable facing falconer as he shut the door she did not attempt to sit down herself or to invite falconer to do so all her senses seemed to be absorbed in the desperate anxiety with which her face was sharp and haggard she looked ten years older than she had looked in mr stormonteades studio falconer answered her directly with no preliminary formalities i saw thethe young woman yesterday he began but i was unable to bring about any arrangement i gave her twentyfour hours for consideration and this afternoon i called to see her again yes yes i found that she had left the house this morning leaving no address left the erect tense figure confronting him staggered back a step as though a heavy blow had fallen upon it and mrs romayne caught desperately at the back of a chair leftand you dont know where she is youve settled nothing weve no hold over her the words had come from her in hoarse gasping sentences each one growing in intensity until the last vibrated with an agony of very despair but falconers face grew grimmer as he listened how it was he could not have told but a strange uncomfortable remembrance of the girl he had seen on the previous day which had haunted him at more or less inopportune moments ever since seemed to rise now and accentuate all his usual antagonism to the woman who was talking of her i think you need not distress yourself he said stiffly perhaps i had better tell you at once that your son knows no more of her whereabouts than we do the drawn look of despair relaxed on mrs romaynes face relaxed into an agony of questioning doubt doesnt know she said sharply julian doesnt know the landlady of the house continued falconer a very unpleasant and loquacious woman was eager to inform me that on the arrival of your son yesterday afternoon about an hour after i saw the young woman there was a quarrel between them and that he left the house in anger today very shortly before my arrival he returned and was astonished to find that the young woman was gone he demanded her address and was furious to find that it was not known i think there is no room for doubt that the young woman has left him the colour was coming back to mrs romaynes face slowly and in burning patches and her clutch on the chair was almost convulsive left him she said under her breath left him there was a moments pause and then she said in a harsh highpitched concentrated tone do you meanfor good why why should she i am sorry to have to say it to you said falconer slowly but i fear the case against your son is even blacker than it appears on the surface i think it more than possible that he deceived the young woman the slowlyformed convictionand it became conviction only as he spoke the wordswas the result of that vague and disturbing impression made on falconer on the preceding day by the young woman it had worked slowly and almost without consciousness on his part but it had refused to die out and it had attained the only fruition possible to it in his last words and you believe that she is really gone that there is nothing more to fear from her it was the same absorbed intent tone and her eyes fixed eagerly on falconer now were hard and glittering the terrible significance of his words with all the weight of tragedy they held seemed to have passed her by to have no existence for her it was as though the sense in her which should have responded to it was numbed or nonexistent and falconer scandalised and revolted replied sternly i think you need have no anxiety on that score she has disappeared of her own free will and your son upon reflection will probably be glad to accept so easy a solution of what he doubtless recognises by this time as a troublesome complication there was a rigid and utterly antipathetic condemnation of julian in his voice he had judged the young man and sentenced him as vicious to the core and for all his experience he held too rigidly to his narrow conception to consider the possible effect upon youth and passion of so sudden and total a thwarting my only fear he continued is that serious injustice has been done the young woman is by no means the kind of young woman i was led to believe her i have grave doubts as to whether it was not our duty to enforce a marriage upon your son instead of negativing the suggestion the words were probably rather more than he would have been prepared to stand to had they been put to a practical issue and he had spoken them though he hardly knew it more from a severe desire to arouse what he called in his own mind some decent feeling in the woman to whom he spoke than from any other reason from that point of view they failed completely it was a bright light of triumph that flashed into mrs romaynes eyes as she said quickly and in an eager vibrating tone which seemed less an answer to him personally than to the bare fact to which he had given words fortunately there is no more fear of that the tall clock standing in a corner of the room chimed the threequarters as she spoke and she started as she heard it it is a quarter to seven she said and i have people to dinner you have nothing else to tell me have you nothing to advise nothing was the grim answer you do not thinkwould it be a good thing do you think to have the girl traced so that we could always be sure you need take no further trouble in the matter in my opinion if you should observe anything in your sons conduct to revive your uneasiness the question must of course be reconsidered you will observe him closely no doubt there was a moments curiously dead silence and then it was broken by a strange halflaugh no doubt said mrs romayne no doubt another pause and then she turned and glanced at the clock i must go she said thank you she held out her hand and he just touched it as though conventionality alone compelled him i have considered myself bound in duty in the matter he said stiffly good night no touch of artificiality returned to her manner even in dismissing him it remained hard and practical her intense absorption in the subject of their interview did not yield by so much as a hairs breadth and she remained absolutely impervious to any thought of the man before her his slight cold touch of her hand the sternness of his obvious condemnation of her were evidently absolutely unobserved by her good night she returned and as he left her without another word she crossed the room rapidly and went upstairs to dress for dinner the dinnerparty of that evening was unanimously declared by the guests to be quite the most delightful mrs romayne had ever given the dinner the flowers all the arrangements were perfection of course but even when this is the case the go of a dinnerparty may be a variable or even a nonexistent quality and it was the go of this particular occasion that was so remarkable all the component parts of the party seemed to be animated and fused into one harmonious whole by the spirits of the hostess and host mrs romayne was so charming so bright so full of vivacity julian who put in his appearance only just before the announcement of dinner was so boyish so lively so ingenuous he was a little pale when he first appeared and the lady he took down to dinner reproached him with working too hard but as the evening wore on he gained colour the relations between himself and his mother had always been quite one of the features of mrs romaynes entertainments but those relations had never been more charmingly accentuated than they were tonight until he came gaily in among her guests that evening julian and his mother had not met since that second interview which had prompted her summons to falconer julian had dined out on both the intervening evenings and it was easily to be arranged under these circumstances if either of the pair so willed it that fortyeight hours should go by without their coming in contact with one another and an onlooker aware of the circumstances of their last meeting and watching the mother and son through the evening now might have reflected that the laws of heredity seldom operate exclusively through one parent good night dear mrs romayne such a delightful evening how i do envy you that dear boy of yours its the greatest pleasure to see you two together the speaker was a goodnatured old lady and she had thought it no harm to put into words what her fellowguests had only thought she was the last departure and mrs romayne followed her to the top of the stairs with a laughing deprecation of the words which was very fascinating and then turned back into the drawingroom with another good night as julian prepared to attend the old lady to her carriage the hall door shut with a bang and then there was a moments pause the mother in the drawingroom above and the son in the hall below stood for an instant motionless a subtle change had come over mrs romaynes face the instant she found herself alone it had sharpened slightly and an eager haggard anticipation was striving to express itself in her eyes only to be resolutely veiled but to julians face as he stood with his hand still resting on the hall door there came a great and sudden alteration all the light and gaiety died out of it before a wild fierce expression of rebellion and distaste repressed almost instantly by a pale sullen look of determination he moved and mrs romayne hearing his step moved slightly also he came up the stairs and as he came he seemed to force back into his face the easy smile it had worn all the evening its been a great success hasnt it dear he said lightly as he crossed the drawingroom threshold a great success she said in the same tonethough in her case it rang a little thin an instants silence followed and then she laid her hand airily on his arm her lips were white and dry with agitation and she knew it she wondered desperately whether her voice rang as unnaturally in julians ears as it did in her own as she said with what she meant for perfect ease dear boy let us say our final words upon that wretched business tonight and wake up clear of it tomorrow may i be happy about you thats all there is to be said isnt it she tried to smile but she knew the effort was a ghastly failure and again she wondered whether julian saw she need not have feared julian was busy with his own histrionic difficulties and had neither sight nor hearing for her you may be quite happy little mother he said and the frank tenderness of his tone and manner were only very slightly overaccentuated ive made up my mind to do as you wish and i wont make such a fool of myself again they were standing close together looking each into the others face and he patted her hand as it lay on his arm as he finished yet between them parting them as seas of ice could not have parted them there lay a shadow beneath which love itself survives only as the cruellest form of torture the shadow of the unspoken with its chill unmoveable dead weight against which no man or woman can prevail the hand on julians arm trembled a little the terrible presence which is never recognised except by those to whom its chill is as the chill of death was making itself vaguely felt about his mothers heart she let her eyes stray from his face with a painful tremulous movement and her fingers tightened round his arm it is all over she murmured in a low voice it is all over really as her selfcommand failed her his seemed to strengthen he patted her hand again reassuringly and said confidently yes dear indeed ive only got to beg your pardon and i do that with all my heart he stooped and kissed her tenderly and as he did so she seemed to rally her forces with a tremendous effort she returned his kiss with a pretty effusive embrace though her lips were as cold as ice i grant it freely she said and if ive felt obliged to bewell shall we say rather autocraticfor once in a way you must forgive me too eh but the unspoken terrible reality as it is was to be touched by no such ghastly travesty julians laugh was only a firmer echo of his mothers gay artificiality of tone but as she heard it her lips turned whiter still thats of course he said of course then its all settled she responded gaily well draw a veil over the past from tonight and behave better in the future good night dear boy she kissed him again patted him lightly on the shoulder and moved away on the threshold she stopped turned and blew him a kiss over her shoulder forgiveness and oblivion from tonight she said and there was a strange defiant gaiety in her voice with another smile and a nod she went upstairs and as she went her face grew lined and drawn like the face of an old woman and the defiance that had lurked in her voice stared out of her eyes halfwild and reckless chapter xi it was a bright spring day one of those days on which the freshness and renewal of life which only spring knows and for the sake of which even the cold monotony of winter is endurable seem to be in the very air and to radiate with the light itself even in london where natures broadest effects only can be felt there was a sense of exuberance which was almost excitement the sun shone with a brightness which seemed to shed oblivion over past darkness the air was quickening and stirring with vague and limitless possibilities it is rather a notable arrangement which makes the quickening of life in one of the least natural systems in the world london society simultaneous with natures great awakening it presents a suggestion of combined travesty patronage and unconscious testimony to that affinity between man and nature which nothing can wholly destroy which if worked out with a certain amount of latitude to a fantastic imagination will have a rather bewildering effect upon the focus of things in general but it is nevertheless a fact that on this particular day in may very many of the impulses stirring in nature had their strangely distorted counterparts in the impulses of society society like nature had discarded its winter garments its winter habits society like nature was restless with fresh beginnings fresh hopes fresh tendencies the resemblance lay on the surface the contrast was farther to seek it was about three oclock in the afternoon and a certain section of societya gathering at least very fairly representative of a certain sectionwas surging in a goodtempered aimless demoralised way in a very fashionable church in kensington some of the demoralisation was due to the occasiona smart weddingbut the gaiety and the general air of readiness to be pleased which prevailed were as certainly the outcome of the wider spirit of the hour as were the smart spring gowns and the quantities of spring flowers carried or worn by the women the bridal party had left the church and a general exodus was in progress progress rendered rather slow by reason of the difficulties attendant on the bringing together of carriages and owners and involving a considerable crush inside the church door in the middle of this crush allowing himself to be pushed and drifted along towards the door was a man who was apparently too fully occupied in casting keen comprehensive and reconnoitring looks about him and in returning the gestures of greeting and welcome which returned his glances on all sides to take much heed as to the manner or direction of the movement imposed upon him by the moving crowd it was marston loring and as he finally emerged into the air he was lightly clapped on the shoulder by lord garstin who a few yards in front of him during their compressed passage out of the building had waited for him on the pavement glad to see you back loring he said heard last night of your arrival how are you not sorry to be back returned loring nonchalantly as he shook hands ive come to the conclusion though in the course of the last halfhour that six months is a mere nothing are you walking round to the house asked lord garstin so am i let me have your news as we go marston loring had spent the winter at the cape his departure had been alluded to among his smart acquaintances as a sudden affair more or less indefinitely connected in their minds with that business of which loring was understood to be a devotee to loring himself it had been by no means a sudden thing that is to say the necessity for it had been gradually growing up about him in his professional life much against his will though it had reached a crisis somewhat unexpectedly he had been absent six months and this was practically his social reappearance but looking at him as he turned into the street with lord garstin it would have been difficult to believe that he had been away at all far less that he had passed through any striking experiences of men and life his keen cynical unpleasant face was entirely unaltered his manner was perfectly calm and unmoved if he had his observations to make on his return if the result of those observations was rather exciting than indifferent to him interest and emotion were still entirely outside his pose the talk between the two men however as they passed along the streets was such talk as passes when one of the two is occupied in picking up dropped threads and the other is well calculated and well satisfied to help him in the process in his heart of heartsif such a spot could have been reached in himlord garstin would probably have confessed to little personal liking for loring his cordiality was the result of considerably involved workings of social politics just at this moment in particular with the prestige fresh upon him of sundry smart magazine articles on cape affairs which he had sent home from time to time and which had been a good deal talked about marston loring was distinctly a man to be noticed and encouraged details connected with the wedding at which they had just assisted were naturally the first topics that presented themselves it was hilda newtons wedding she had been married with much circumstance from mrs halses house and before loring left england it had been said that she was to be married at christmas at her own home in yorkshire about a month before the day fixed for the wedding however the aunt with whom she lived had died the wedding had perforce been postponed and when it became possible to consider another date mrs halsein the absence of any near relation to the brideelecthad taken the matter in hand a very nice affair shes made of it commented the elder man as he finished his explanation interspersed with discursive items of news of all sorts appertaining to society and its doings a little loud of course that goes without saying and really nowadays its rather the thing a pretty girl in her way mrs compton and talking of pretty girls maud pomeroy looked well theyve been at cannes since the end of january only just back like yourself so i heard answered loring indifferently bythebye i didnt see the romaynes arent they in town ive not had time to look any one up yet of course but i thought i should see julian today lord garstin paused a moment before he answered they were there he said i saw them come in youll see them at the house no doubt the little womans been invisible for two or three days illrather bad somebody said ill echoed loring and there was a genuine surprise in his tone which no information yet bestowed upon him had evoked really he paused a moment and then said with his own peculiar smile and how is julian does the hardworking line hold out lord garstin smiled more pleasantly than loring had done and shrugged his shoulders pretty well i suppose he said i met his chief the other night and he was not enthusiastic hes a nice boy though youre a great chum of his arent you loring loring nodded then let me give you a hint to have an eye to his proceedings at the club cards are all very well you know but a boy like that should be moderate you might be able to talk to him about it i gave his mother a hint a few weeks ago shes a nice little woman see what you can do will you ive got an idea that the foolish fellow doesnt play only at the club they were close to mrs halses house as lord garstin finished and his last words were spoken quickly and significantly loring answered only by a slight movement of his eyebrows and then they were in the hall being swept on by a seething crowd to pay their respects to the hostess and the bride loring old man how are you loring and lord garstin had been thrown together again after offering their congratulations and they were standing side by side julian romayne was close beside them having come up from behind through the crowd unperceived his hand eagerly even demonstratively outstretched thinking things over in private later on marston loring thought with a cynical smile that if he had not previously realised his six months absence he might have done so when young romaynes voice fell on his ear the change in it though subtle was so markedto the man who had not heard it in course of transitionthat it seemed to place years rather than months between their last meeting and the present and it amply prepared loring for what he saw when he turned round all alteration in manner and appearance consists rather in the accentuation or modification of original characteristics than in the developement of fresh ones consequently it is very seldom noticed by a casual observer when intercourse is unbroken to lord garstin and to dozens of his other acquaintances julian romayne was still a nice boy just as his goodlooking features were still the young features of a year ago to loring the difference in face was as perceptible as was the difference in the young mans whole personality and the keynote of the difference lay in the absence of genuineness in both in the deliberate assumption in the present of what had been natural and uncalculated in the past julians face had grown thinner and harder and the boyish smile which was in consequence no longer perfectly harmonious was a trifle overaccentuated while the bright ingenuous glance of his eyes had grown extraordinarily like his mother his manner was the gay young manner which had gained him so many friends with just that touch of exaggeration added to it which artificiality gives his cordiality as he wrung lorings hand was ratherlike the demonstrative welcome in his voiceadmirably adjusted to meet the requirements of the moment than an expression of the man himself he was very carefully dressed with a particularly dainty flower in his buttonhole back again at last old fellow he said buoyantly by jove what an age it is since you went and have you had a good time when did you reach home tell us all about it youve no idea how glad i am to have him back lord garstin he added greeting the elder man with a boyish halflaughing apology for his exuberance which was very effective his manner to lord garstin was as charming as ever rather more so indeed as its frank deference had acquired a polish derived from sundry little artistic touches such as only calculation and intention can bestow you seem to have managed very well without me returned loring with goodhumoured satire the world seems to have used you pretty fairly im glad to see ive only been back about fortyeight hours or i should have looked you up of course i hope mrs romayne is here i hope she is better said lord garstin with genuine concern we have all been desolated over her illness julian who had nodded lightly to loring turned to lord garstin with a bright affectionate laughalso very like his mothersand to lorings quick and alert perception an added touch of artificiality became apparent in his manner as he said it has been desolating hasnt it its very good of you to say so though thanks i am delighted to say she is all right again we had a terrific encounter as to whether she should or should not come to the affair and she carried the day being perfectly restored to health she didnt see the force of allowing herself to be shut up and coddled by a silly boy the light highpitched voice somewhat thin as was the characteristic laugh with which the words were spoken came from directly behind julian and as loring who had seen her coming stepped forward to meet her mrs romayne with a passing shake of her sons arm stretched out her hand with graceful cordiality welcome back mr loring she said i thought your first visit would have been to this goodfornothing boy but i am very glad to meet you here all the same lord garstin she continued as she turned to shake hands i believe you were enquiring after my health i cant allow good breath to be wasted in that way i assure you it has been much ado about nothing and i am perfectly ridiculously well she laughed as she finished but a certain strained insistence had grown in her tone as she spoke as though her desire to impress the fact she stated was strong enough to undermine her control of her voice but loring looking at her was too fully occupied in criticising her appearance to notice the tone of her voice there must have been some society fraud at the bottom of her reported illness he decided and that was why she was so anxious to pass it over for certainly he had never seen her look better she was admirably dressed and she was very slightly and skilfully made up a condition new to him in her and one of which marston loring emphatically approved in women past their first youth he told himself moreover that either his impression of her had been fainter than the reality or else she had actually gained in what he could only define to himselfand define roughly and inadequately as he was well awareas grip there was the faintest flavour of nerve and concentration behind her admirable society manner which gave it a wonderful piquancy in the eyes of her observer a flavour which was evidently quite unconscious and involuntary and had its origin in ingrain character loring admired powerof a certain classin women in his interest in her expression and his mental comments on itdetermined as they could not fail to be by his own characterhe was deceived by her cleverly arranged colouring into ignoring the almost painful thinness of her face nor did he understand how hollow and sunken those glittering eyes would have been less cleverly treated she replied gaily to lord garstins gallant reception of her assurance and then turned again to loring with an easy interested question on his voyage you are not the only returned traveller today she said as he answered her bythebye julian i was on the way to send you into the other room there is some one there you will like to see she smiled significantly up at him patting his arm as she spoke and julian answered with boyish eagerness in the other room he said well perhaps i ought just to say how do you do you know oughtnt i loring old fellow we shall meet again of course what are you going to do afterwards we might go down to the club together and he must come and dine with us mustnt he mother suppose you arrange it and with a comprehensive gesture and another ill just say how do you do i think he disappeared in the crowd mrs romayne turned with a shrug of her shoulders and a pretty expressive grimace to the two men poor boy she laughed what a thing it is to be young and what a tantalising spectacle a wedding must be under the circumstances a pretty wedding wasnt it an ugly wedding would be rather a refreshing change dont you think suggested loring one has seen a good many pretty ones if you come to think of it youre not in the least changed by six months in africa returned mrs romayne shaking her head at him prettily now tell me really have you had a good time out there the question was friendly and interested after a society fashion but the interest was entirely on the surface and the little talk that followed about lorings experiences was joined in as a matter of course by lord garstin it lasted until mrs romayne said lightly and now i suppose i ought to follow julians example and just say how do you do dont you know i have only seen mrs pomeroy in the distance as yet she nodded and moved away stopping constantly on her way through the rooms to exchange scraps of conversation until she came to where mrs pomeroy amiable inert and smiling as though she had been sitting there for the last three months was holding a small court she welcomed mrs romayne as she had welcomed all comers so glad to see you she said placidly such a long time and how are you so immensely pleased to have you back again said mrs romayne enthusiastically there was a ring of genuineness in her voice which the fashionable exaggeration of her speech hardly warranted and you really only arrived yesterday miss newtonmrs compton i meanwas in a dreadful state of mind the other day lest her bridesmaid should fail her and how is maud how sweet she looked quite the prettiest of the six where is she she was here just now returned mauds mother as though that were quite a satisfactory answer to the question and then as an afterthought she added vaguely i think she went to have an ice your son took her ah said mrs romayne smiling then there is one perfectly happy person in the house mrs pomeroy only smiled with vague blandness evidently the relations between the romaynes and the pomeroys had developed extensively before the departure of the latter for cannes and as evidently they were quite undisturbing to miss pomeroys mother the bridesmaids dresses were very nice i think she said with amiable irrelevancy i was afraid they sounded trying but it has been very pleasant altogether hasnt it i wish we were going to stay in town we had a shocking crossing a keen attention had sprung into mrs romaynes eyes and for an instant it seemed as though all the society gaiety died from her face leaving exposed the hard almost fiercely determined foundation on which it was imposed then the foundation disappeared again to stay in town she echoed lightly why are you not going to stay in town dear mrs pomeroy unfortunately not was the answer my sister who lives in devonshirei think you have heard me speak of heris ill and has begged me to go and see her so we are going for a week or ten days i am sorry to say i am sorry to hear said mrs romayne with pretty concern just at the beginning of the season too its rather hard on poor maud isnt it yes it is hard on poor maud isnt it was the undisturbed response there was a moments pause and then under her paint a burning colour crept up to the very roots of mrs romaynes hair and her eyes shone my dear mrs pomeroy she began gaily but speaking rather quickly too and in a higher pitch than was usual with her dont you remember months ago promising to lend me maud for a little while this is the very opportunity of course she lowered her voice a little i wouldnt propose it if you did not know quite as well as i do how the land lies but as i think we two old mothers are of one mind on that point i shant scruple let maud come to me if she will while you are in devonshire oh of course it neednt mean anythingits an old promise you know and she and i are great friends on our own account talk of the angels she went on gaily nodding towards a slim white figure coming towards them with julian in its immediate wake maud pomeroy was looking as pretty and as proper as she had looked every day since she had emerged from the schoolroom but there was a little flush on her face which was not habitual to her she returned mrs romaynes greeting with the grateful cordiality so pretty from a girl to an older woman evinced as was her wont more by manner than by speech and indeed mrs romayne gave her little time for speech your mother has been telling me of this dreadful devonshire business she said and ive had what i flatter myself is a happy thought i want you to come to me maud dear while your mother is away you know you promised ages ago to let yourself be lent to me for a little while and this is the very opportunity isnt it it would not have been the thing under the circumstances that any one of the trio should glance at julian consequently no one noticed the curious flash of expression that passed across his face as his mother spoke maud pomeroy hesitated and looked dutifully at her mother its very kind of mrs romayne maud dear isnt it said mrs pomeroy with noncommittal amiability it is sweet of her responded maud prettily well then do let us consider it settled i shall enjoy it of all things when do you go dear mrs pomeroy tomorrow week oh it will be too tantalising to whisk maud away when she had just begun to enjoy herself wouldnt it maud miss pomeroy hesitated again and the colour on her cheeks deepened by just a shade she did not glance at her mother this time thank you very much she said at last but shant i be a nuisance to you there was just the touch of charmingly conventional demur in her tone which made her submission seem as all her actions seemed the result of a gentle easily influenced temperament mrs romayne assured her merrily that she would indeed be a terrible nuisance but that she herself would do her best to bear it and then rose her eyes very bright i must run away now she said im so delighted that weve settled it let me know when to expect you then dear goodbye mrs pomeroy ill take every care of your child and return her when you want heronly dont let it be too soon i neednt take you away sir she continued turning to julian he had been standing by ever since that flash had passed over his face with an expression of eager interest in the discussion i dare say youre not in any hurry no you need not even come downstairs with me i see mr loring hell take care of me im sure mr loring who was within hearing as the tone of the words impliedindeed they were more than half addressed to himcame up promptly for how long may i have that privilege he said she explained to him lightly as he shook hands with mrs pomeroy and her daughter and then with another farewell and a pretty affectionate au revoir to julian she turned away with him he put her into her carriage and she held out her hand with a gesture of thanks and farewell thanks she said her tone and manner alike were very friendly and familiar in the exaggerated style which had certainly grown on her and they seemed to imply something beyond the superficial interest to which she had kept perforce in her society intercourse with him it is so pleasant to see you again when will you come to see me quietly before you are hard at work you know tomorrow now tomorrow happens to be a free day with me come to tea good bye chapter xii ten minutes after mrs romaynes departure julian was standing before mrs pomeroy his whole demeanour typical of the man who lingers knowing that he should linger no longer what a nuisance appointments are he said with a boyish frankness of discontent which was irresistible i wish i could stay a little longer but i know i oughtnt he laughed quite ruefully and fixed a pair of ardent eyes on miss pomeroys demurely averted face its been such an awfully jolly affair hasnt it and its so awfully jolly to have you in town againthis with delightful deference to mrs pomeroy well i really must go you know goodbye perhaps you wont be staying very much longer if you stay here bemoaning yourself very much longer we shall probably leave before you do suggested miss pomeroy with the rather faint smile which was the only sign of amusement she ever gave and which always accompanied her own mild witticisms julian turned to her eagerly now thats awfully unkind he said you wont bully me like that in queen anne street will you the term bullying was so profoundly inapplicable to miss pomeroys words that its use suggested a certain amount of arrangement rather than absolute spontaneity about julians speech but exaggeration was the fashion and not to be commented on come in a very kind frame of mind wont you he went on pleadingly am i a very violent person the girl answered with the same smile goodbye she held out her hand as she spoke and julian took it with laughing reluctance you are an absolutely heartless person he said daringly to dismiss me like this however i suppose you are right if you didnt dismiss me i probably shouldnt go and i really ought you know youve told us that before now do it was the answer goodbye goodbye returned julian with mock meekness he shook hands again which seemed hardly necessary and then he turned away but the necessity which enforced his departure had apparently slackened its pressure on him by the time he actually left the house as he walked away down the street there was no sign about him of that haste which should characterise a man who has lingered to the risking of an appointment or who has indeed any engagement in immediate prospect the bride and bridegroom had already left and people were beginning to go and until he reached the end of the street in which was mrs halses house he was passed every instant by carriages to whose occupants his hat had to be smilingly lifted then he turned into a main thoroughfare and hailed a hansomstill not in the least like a man in a hurry he gave the cabman an address in the temple and was driven away his face as he went would have been a curious study to any onlooker possessed of the key to its expression to any onlooker who could have detected the constant struggle for dominance between something that seemed to lie behind its new artificiality and that artificiality itself evidently maintained under an instinctive sense of the chances of observation it was not until he turned his key in the lock of a set of chambers in the temple that the boyish vivacity died wholly out of his face he went into his roomhe shared the chambers with another embryo barristershutting the door behind him and as he did so he seemed to have shut in not the lighthearted young fellow who had paid the cabman in the street below but another man altogether no one looking at him now could doubt that this was the real julian romayne of today as certainly as that lighthearted young fellow had been the real julian romayne of a year ago this was a man with a hard angry face a face on which the anger stood revealed not as the expression of the moment but as the normal expression of a mind always sore always at war always fiercely implacable the room was plainly almost barely furnished and there was no trace of any of the luxury that surrounded him in queen anne street his smart carefully gotup figure looked absolutely incongruous among such unusual surroundings as he crossed to the window and flinging himself down in a shabby easychair lighted a cigarette he threw his cigarettecase on the table and then drew out of the breastpocket of his coat a couple of letters he had read them before evidently but as evidently they had lost none of their interest for him he read them both through attentively and as he did so there came to his mouth a set which his mother could she have seen it would have recognised instantly which any one indeed must have recognised who had ever seen his dead father both the letters dealt with money matters one was from a bookmaker the other from a broker whose name was far from bearing an unblemished character in the city and both referred to large sums of money recently made on the turf and on the stock exchange by julian romayne he flung the last on the table as he finished it and there was an expression in his eyes of reckless rebellious triumph not good to see its a good haul he said half aloud a good haul now with what ive got already he rose and went across to the writingtable unlocked a drawer and taking out various papers began to make rapid calculations thenhis eyes hard and intent on his workhe stretched out his hand and felt in the drawer for another paper he took out an envelope and drew out the letter it contained without glancing at it a folded paper fell out as he did so and as though the slight sound had roused him he glanced at it quickly and from it to the open letter in his hand apparently it was not the letter to which he had intended to refer for his face changed suddenly and completely i cant take your money try and understand that i cantclemence his fingers tightened upon the thin sheet of paper until the knuckles whitened and the eager calculation vanished utterly from his face overwhelmed as it seemed by the fierce tumult of warring passions that struggled now in every line impotent anger which was the more violent for something within itself which was not anger reckless defiance a wild raging desperation behind all which was nearly hatred all these emotions were faintly shadowed forth on his face as he stared down at the few simple words all these emotions had been surging in his heart during the six months that were gone and it was their unceasing strife and tumult which was rousing into life the new julian romayne latent for so many years it was to that which was least broadly painted on his face that all these passionate forces owed their life as with a wild animal wounded by a dart and feeling that dartlodged in his sidepricking and piercing him who plunges wildly hither and thither chafing and striving in blind brute fashion to rid himself of the sensation he cannot understand and in his very efforts presses in the cause of his pain increases his sufferings and again redoubles his struggles and his fury not knowing that he is his own tormentor so it had been in a sense with julian romayne during the last six months the dart in his case was doubleedged its edges were the strange weak reality of his love for clemence and a stinging sense of shame it had lodged in that almost inanimate better part of his nature he had left that little room in camden town smarting and wincing under it and it had never ceased to prick him since scarcely less blind and ignorant under such circumstances than a beast having no understanding in his total want of all principle except the principles of worldly wisdom with his utterly dormant moral perceptionhis morality such as it was being the merest matter of habit and conventionalitythe effect on him of the smart was first the developement in him of a blind unreasoning resentment and then as anger proved of no avail a passionate rousing and rising of all his latent forces in repudiation of his discomfort to charge upon some one else the difficulties which he had created for himself to provide some object against which his blind sense of wrath and rebellion could pit itself was a primary instinct with such a nature as julians so situated and that object was ready to his hand the first article in the faith of the new julian romayne was the belief that he had been forced into his present position by his mother that he had been parted from his wife by his mother that he had been covered with humiliation by his mother every fresh stab every movement of revolt as that twoedged dart pressed itself deeper into his consciousness with every struggle he made for freedom added something to the account he held against her increased the bitterness of his resentment against her and brought it one degree nearer to hatred his love for her in spite of its charm of expression had been the merest boyish sentiment with no roots deeper than those afforded by easy companionship and apparent indulgence founded on habit and expediency rather than on respect real devotion would have seemed out of place in the atmosphere of affectation and superficiality in which he had been reared and he had known only its travesty on this the first real conflict between his will and hers that travesty showed itself for what it was and shrivelled into nothingness to free himself from her control became the one object and desire of his life in doing this and in doing this only to his distorted perceptions lay release from the stinging goading misery of his present life and to do this one means only was adequatemoney with money at his command the victory as he conceived it would be his some centre some mainspring had necessarily to grow up in the confused strivings and blind desperate impulses of a newlyawakened nature and gradually that centre had declared itself in an unreasoning determination to make money but there were in julian romayne tendencies latent or nearly so throughout his youth and early manhood manifested during those easy untempted periods only in a slight superficiality a slight want of perception as to the boundary line between truth and falsehood but radical factors in his being in the shock and jar of the mental struggle and quickening involved in the continued presence in his consciousness of that remorseless dart these tendencies leapt into overstimulated life and grew strengthened and developed with the unnatural rapidity of such life until his whole character seemed to be overshadowed by them in julian romaynes being woven in and out with the threads which had hitherto seemed so pliable and colourless those threads of all shades from pure white to dark grey which make up character in every man were sundry grim black threadsthreads such as are only to be plucked out when the very hearts blood of the man has spent itself in the struggle and when in that struggle he has come very near to god it may be that the sins of the fathers are indeed visited on the children in this sense in the dictation of the form taken by that struggle with evil which is every mans portion and sometimesfor purposes of which no man may presume to judgein the exceptional agony of that struggle julian romayne the son of a liar and thief and moreover of a woman whose morality was the morality of conventionality and nothing more had an instinctive faculty for an instinctive inclination towards dishonesty of word and deed such a twist of his moral consciousness as had been predicted for him a little child of five years old by dr aston had lain dormant among the possibilities of his being throughout the nineteen years that intervened it was this inheritance which in the sudden upheaval of his moral nature had awakened asserted itself and seized as it were the first place in his nature throughout his boyhood easy as it had been untouched by any strong passion or desire he had lied now and again naturally and instinctively he had lied to save himself trouble to save himself some slight reproachas he had lied to his mother on the subject of his visit to alexandria to save himself from the confession of having forgotten her commission he had lied to clemence from first to last and the first prick of that dart which was now his constant companion had touched him when he first felt shame for those lies but there was a reckless calculating deception about his life now which went deeper and meant more he lied to his mother with every word and action and with the unreasoning cruelty of his mental attitude towards herthere is nothing towards which a man can be so heartless as the object to which he has transferred his own wrongdoinghe hugged his deception of her and revelled in the sense of independence and power it gave him the endless deception which the fundamental falsity of his present life necessitated radiated on every side to please his mother as he told himself with an ugly smile he had flirted with miss pomeroy in the early part of the winter untila certain distance in her manner to him meltinghe had hailed her departure for cannes as a blessed reprieve he had flirted with her this afternoon at mrs halses excited by the news contained in the two letters he had since reread reckless in the prospect of release they brought nearer to him and with a certain delight in the daring defiance of consequences he had lied to lord garstin when that goodnatured mentor had let fall a warning word as to the bad form of gambling he lied to his coach when his frequent absences were commented on in that desperate craving for money in which all the passion of his life was centering itself dishonesty of deed was the natural and inevitable corollary of dishonesty of word the possession of money was his one object in life his conscience as to the means by which that money was to be obtained he deliberately put into abeyance for the time being he had become possessed in the course of the last six months of some thousands not one of which had been earned by honest work much of which had come to him by more than questionable means that twoedged dart must have been finely tempered that it never seemed to blunt the dormant life in that higher part of him to which it had penetrated must have been life indeed that it should throb and quiver stronger and stronger side by side with all that was lowest and worst in him making the struggle grow always fiercer and goading him on and on the dart owed its edge the life its growing sensitiveness to a touch which lay always on julians consciousness haunting him night and day not to be driven away or obliterated not to be crowded out of his soul by any stress of evil passion a white light on the soiled tangled web of his life which shone steadily in the strength of a power no struggle of his could touch was the thought of clemence clemence who had trusted him clemence hoping longing loving him as he knew in every wretched fibre clemence for whose presence he longed at times with a heartsickness of longing which reacted in a very orgy of passionate bitterness he had received a note from her a few days after her disappearance telling him in a few simple words that she had got work that she relied on him not to drive her out of it by trying to see her until he was ready as she phrased it again and again a reckless impulse to see her and force his will upon her had seized him but something had always held him back again and again he had sent her money always to have it returned to him with a little line of hope or patience in the reception of those notes in the writhing love and longing and shame they stirred in him the dart went home and tortured him indeed he crushed the sheet of common notepaper almost fiercely in his hand now and thrust it away to the back of the drawer from which it had come he caught up the paper which had fallen from itthe cheque he had sent her three days beforeand tore it savagely into fragments then he swept the papers on which he had been busy unheedingly into a drawer locked it sharply and rose white to the very lips it cant be long now he muttered it shant be men make their piles in a dayin an hour why should not i it shant be long he stood for a moment his hand clenched his features compressed his eyes full of a sullen fire then he turned sharply away and left the room there was no trace of any fire about him however except the harmless irradiation of youth and good spirits when he opened the door of his mothers drawingroom a few minutes before their dinnerhour he had spent the intervening hour at his club the most lightly goodnatured and thoroughly easygoing and irresponsible young man there and there was precisely the same character about him now as he crossed the room to his mother chapter xiii there had been a slight sudden movement as julian opened the door as though mrs romayne had changed her attitude quickly she was leaning forward now looking at an illustrated paper but the cushions behind her were tumbled and crushed as if she had been leaning back on them and leaning heavily she was wearing a teagown and she seemed to keep her face rather carefully in shadow rather an amusing party wasnt it she said lightly looking up as he came in everybody goes to that womans i cant imagine why well and is there any news sir im afraid not returned julian gaily ive spent an hour at the club to try and pick up some crumbs for you but there was nothing going the manner of each to the other was precisely the same now that they were alone together as it had been when they addressed one another incidentally in the course of general conversation the very familiarity between them had a flavour of artificiality about it and that flavour was mainly given strangely enough by mrs romayne rather than by julian it was her manner not his that lacked ease and overdid the spontaneity they chatted brightly about men and things but she never asked him a single personal question though at any incidental allusion let fall by him as to his doings a faint contraction of the muscles about her eyes gave her a hungry concentrated look as of a creature catching at a crumb it seemed to be in a great measure that tendency to keen intentness of expression which had so greatly altered her face you see ive been lazy she said lightly indicating her dress with a slight gesture as they sat down to dinner they were going out in the evening and she usually dressed before dinner on such occasions i really couldnt be bothered to dress before the lamplight was full on her face now and julian his attention drawn to her by the words saw that she looked frightfully haggard and worn under her paint and her little air of gaiety paint had ceased to be an appendage of full dress with her since her three days illness the combination added a touch of repulsion to his feeling towards her but his tone as he answered her was the tone of affectionate concern overelaborated by the merest shade only youve not overtired yourself i hope dear he said i dont believe you ought to go out again tonight do you know mrs romaynes thin fingers were tearing fiercely at the pockethandkerchief in her lap as he spoke and her eyes were bright with pain it seemed as though her ears had caught that subtle shade of overelaboration though they must have been quick indeed to do so but she answered almost before he had finished speaking in a rather highpitched tone of eager determination silliest of boys she said the topic is threadbare i am quite well oh it is very evident that my retiring to bed for a day or two is an unparalleled event or you would not be quite so slow in grasping the fact that it is possible to recover after such a terrific crisis now do promise not to talk any more about what you dont in the least understand the merriment of her tone was fictitious even to julians unheeding ear but he took it up with a mental shrug of his shoulders it was not his fault he told himself if she would overdo herself for the sake of a little excitement he told himself the same thing carelessly enough when he put her into her carriage two or three hours later it was early mrs romayne had declared the party to be insufferably dull and had stayed only half an hour during which time she had been as vivacious and attractive as usual but towards the end her eyes had become feverishly bright and julian as he took her out could feel that she was trembling from head to foot are you coming home she said to him well if you dont mind dear i was thinking of going to look up loring at the club a breath of relief parted mrs romaynes lips and she answered hastily apparently she had no desire for her sons company on her way home go by all means she said of course i dont mind she pulled up the window almost abruptly nodding to him with a smile the singular ghastliness of which was presumably referable to some effect of gaslight then as the carriage rolled away she sank back and let her face relax into an expression of utter weariness with a little gasping catch of her breath as of deadly physical exhaustion his words about loring had been a mere figure of speech on julians part but he did intend to go to the club and he carried his intention into effect he glanced round the smokingroom as he went in to see if loring was there but the fact that he was not visible in no way affected his serenity he was so altered from the boy of a twelvemonth before and his intercourse with loring had been so completely suspended during the period of his developement that their friendship seemed now to belong to some previous phase of his existence it was his sense that he had passed utterly out of touch with the man with whom he had once been intimate together with a conviction that lorings keen perceptions would be by no means a desirable factor in his surroundings at the moment that had dictated his demonstration of delight at lorings reappearance an outward show of enthusiasm was a very effective blind in his opinion his manner was regulated on the same principle on lorings appearance in the smokingroom about half an hour later he was on his way to the cardroom and he was anything but pleased at the frustration of his plans in that direction but his reception of loring indicated rather that he had spent the last halfhour in watching for him here you are at last old man he cried i thought youd turn up some time or other what became of you this afternoon i never saw you after you disappeared with my mother the two men had met close to the door and they were still standing loring as blas and imperturbablelooking as usual with his observant eyes on julians face i didnt care to spoil sport he returned with a significant smile you seemed to be particularly well employed julian laughedthe conscious not illpleased laugh which belonged to his part such contingencies were all incidental to the situation oh come old boy he said deprecatingly then he laughed again and added i suppose my mother said something to you no returned loring quietly i happen to have eyes you see dont make magnifying glasses of them then was the laughing retort now then there are several fellows here who have been asking for you but as julian glanced round he became aware that the room chanced to be almost empty loring understood at the same time that he had wished to make the conversation general and impersonal and a slight smile touched his lips marston loring had various reasons of his own for not intending to allow himself to be eluded by julian romayne the change in the young man alone would have excited his curiosity and sundry details which had already come to his knowledge notably one across which he had stumbled in the city that morning had quickened that curiosity his suspicions of the preceding autumn that there was something behind julians life as it appeared on the surface were by no means forgotten by him his departure for africa had taken him out of the way of the crisis but he more than half suspected that a crisis there had been the connection between the present and the past and the means by which it could be most advantageously applied to the furtherance of his own ends were the problems he had set himself to solve were rather in luck he said we can have a quiet chat together he established himself lazily and comfortably as he spoke as julian with much apparent satisfaction flung himself into another chair and took out his cigarcase julians questions followed one another thick and fast his interest in his friends life during the last six months seemed to be inexhaustible in its intelligence and sympathy he had a great deal to tell too and he told it so fluently and gaily as almost to disguise the fact that the allusions to his own doings were of the most superficial type but at last there was a pause julian was pulling out his watch and saying something about going home when loring lighted a fresh cigar and opened the proceedingsas he conceived them i heard of you in the city this morning he said nonchalantly there was no pause in the movement with which julian returned his watch to his pocket nothing absolutely to betray the fact that the words were a surprise to him yet they were a surprise and an exceedingly unpleasant one his transactions in the city he had arranged to keep secret that their nature should become known was eminently undesirable and he had decided that the fact itself would be inconsistent with his pose before the world that loring should be the man to unearth them was exceptionally unfortunate did you he said lightly and who was saying what of me in the citya vague locality bythebye the introduction of your name was accidentalaccidents will happen you know even in adamss office is that a definite locality enough to please you julian burst into a boyish laugh and flung himself back in his chair he carried his cigar to his lips as he did so not noticing apparently that it had gone out loring noticed it however what a fellow you are loring he cried youve not been in england three days before you unearth a poor chaps most private little games i say youll keep it dark wont you i wouldnt have it come round to my mother you know shes so awfully generous to me and it might hurt her feelings there was an ingenuous frankness and confidence in his voice which gave to the whole affair the aspect of a youthful escapade loring smiled as he answered i wouldnt have a hand in hurting mrs romaynes feelings for the world he paused a moment and then added carelessly as if the whole transaction was the merest matter of course been doing much julian shook his head no of course not he said lightly only a little occasional lark dont you know i leave the big things to clever fellows like you bythebye loring id no idea you did anything in that way loring puffed slowly at his cigar before he answered im an old hand he said nonchalantly i wait for certainties my boy he paused again to tell you the truth he said slowly fastening a keen cleverlyveiled gaze on julians face i did not ask the question altogether idly it occurred to me that if you had made anything worth mentioning you might be on the lookout for a means ofwell well put it mildly and sayincreasing it there was considerable meaning in lorings voice careless as it was julian became very still and into his eyes there crept an eager hungry light which harmonised ill with the fixed nonchalance of the rest of his features as he answered with a laugh i dont know the fellow who could refuse to admit that soft impeachment were all in the same boat as far as that goes i take it you havent got a good thing up your sleeve old man have you loring smiled ambiguously most good things would come to an untimely end if every one with a finger in them spread them abroad my boy he observed since it cant concern you personallyif youve no capitalwell say no more about it a certain amount of lorings practice dealt with financial affairs he was no mean authority on city matters and there was something about his manner indescribably provocative julian leaned forward with a movement of irrepressible eagerness is it really a good thing he said he spoke with a quick lowtoned directness which put aside the fencing of the previous dialogue and replied not to what loring had said but to what he had implied loring looked him full in the face and answered laconically and significantly rather the hungry light was burning fiercely in julians eyes and he turned his face away from loring and began to fidget with an ashtray lying on the table by him capital he said what do you call capital now oh anything between ten thousand and fiveandtwenty thousand said loring carelessly there was a silence julians brain was working feverishly and loring was well content to let it work at last julian began to speak in a low rapid tone with the air of one who has made up his mind to frank confidence he had intended to keep loring at arms length he had decided now to play a bolder game and use him look here loring he said i may as well make a clean breast of it i have gone a bit farther than i said you see as i told you my mothers most awfully generous and i wouldnt let a hint of this get to her for the world but a man doesnt like to feel that hes dependent on his mother for everything dont you knowespecially if hes thinking of marrying you know what it is when one once begins to feel the money come in ive gone on you seeas lots of fellows doand ive got a tidy little pile of course im very keen on making it more beforewell before i propose dont you know and if you can give me a lift up i shall be eternally obliged he stopped and loring smoked for a minute or two in silence at last he said slowly i understand its natural of course well i dont stand alone in the affair to tell you the truth theres another man to be consulted but ill talk the matter over with him and if i can manage to get you in you may be sure i will you shall have a line in a day or two or ill see you again loring dropped the end of his cigar into the ashtray and rose chapter xiv the clock in mrs romaynes drawingroom chimed the halfhourhalfpast fourand mrs romayne glanced up as she heard it she was alone sitting at her writingtable answering invitations she was looking better than she had looked on the preceding dayless haggard and physically stronger she answered and put aside the last invitationcard and then she drew out a letter in a straight clear girls writing it was signed affectionately yours maud pomeroy and it bore reference to miss pomeroys prospective visit to her mrs romayne glanced through it the vigour of her face seeming to accentuate as she did so and then proceeded to write a few cordial affectionate lines in answer she was just directing the envelope when a servant came in with tea mrs romayne rose send these letters to the post she said she glanced at the clock again as she spoke and at that moment the frontdoor bell rang left alone mrs romayne moved quickly to the lookingglass and took an anxious critical look at herself it was as though she had learnt to distrust her appearance the inspection however proved satisfactory apparently and as she turned quickly away as she heard steps upon the stairs there was a selfdependence and sense of power in the bright expectant keenness of her eyes mr loring announced the servant and mr loring followed his name into the room i am very glad to see you said mrs romayne advancing to meet him this is a much better way of welcoming a friend than our meeting yesterday i think i shall celebrate the occasion by saying not at home to any one else julian will be in perhaps and he will like to have you to himself not at home dawson she added in conclusion there was a verve and brightness about her manner which was not exactly its usual vivacity and which faintly suggested the presence of some kind of special excitement in her mind lorings perceptions were in a state of rather abnormal acuteness the situation had meanings for him which had braced up his forces not inconsiderably he detected that inward excitement about mrs romayne instantly and he was convinced also though he could hardly have given a reason for the conviction that there was not the smallest chance of julians appearance both circumstances he reckoned as points in his favour in the game he was going to play its very charming of you he said do you know this is the first time i have really felt that coming back to london meanssomething he took the chair she had indicated to him on the other side of the little teatable as he spoke and there was nothing lame or unfinished about the words spoken as he spoke them his eyes were fixed upon mrs romayne but she was pouring out tea with so intent a look on her face as almost to suggest preoccupation she did not look up nor did the tone of his voice reach her except superficially apparently for she replied with a pleasant friendly laugh i should hope it did mean something indeed she said friends should count for something surely especially when they have really taken the trouble to miss you very much have you had such an unusually fascinating time in africa then she handed him a cup of tea and as he rose to take it from her he answered well not exactly that im afraid i dont believe in fascinating times you know perhaps i am too much of a pessimist he spoke with that tone of personal revelation and confidence which is always more or less attractive to a woman coming from a man and mrs romayne responded with the gentle loftiness of sympathy which the position demanded ive often been afraid you felt like that she said and it is really quite wrong of you dont you know you ought to be such a particularly wellsatisfied person i suppose you are horribly ambitious now tell me has your business gone off as well as you hoped i have been so interested in your delightful articles does anything go off as well as one had hoped was the reply spoken with a cynical smile indeed but with a certain daring deprecation of her disapproval which was not unattractive no i ought not to carp he continued quickly i have every reason to be satisfied his tone implied considerably more in the way of success and latent possibilities about his present position than the words themselves conveyed and mrs romayne answered with cordial delicatelyexpressed congratulations which drifted into a species of general questionings as to his doings less directly personal but implying that he might count on her sympathy if he chose to confide in her in greater detail this was no part of lorings plan however he led by almost imperceptible degrees away from the subject and before very long they were talking london gossip as though he had never been away the only perceptible result of his absence evincing itself in the touch of additional intimacy which his return seemed to have given their relations necessarily at mrs romaynes instigation the talk touched here and there and byandby an enquiry from loring after a mutual friend elicited a crisper laugh than usual and an expressive movement of the eyebrows from mrs romayne havent you heard she said oh its an old story now of course well they dont come to town this season i believe lady ashton suffers fromneuralgia she laughed again and then in response to a cynical and incredulously interrogative ejaculation from loring she clasped her hands lightly on her knee and went on with the animation of a woman who has a good story to tell and enjoys telling it she contracted the complaint they say in a poky little church in kensington into which gladys ashton strolled one morning and got herself married oh dear no her mother wasnt there thats one of the points of the affair and lord rochdale wasnt there either gladys ashton jilted rochdale after all after all assented mrs romayne gaily after all that poor womans trouble after the quite pathetic way in which she has slaved to catch him she gets a letter from the ungrateful girlat an afternoon tea too heaps of people thereto say that she is mrs bob stewart baccarat bob you wretched men at the clubs call him dont you that was enough to induce convulsions let alone neuralgia commented loring they both laughed and the laugh was succeeded by a moments silence then loring said casually what has become of your cousin falconer among other people bythebye i dont hear anything of him and his grim presence was hardly to be overlooked have you any little escapade of his to reveal now mrs romayne laughed a little harshly unfortunately not she said his absence is due to the most characteristically orthodox causes he was ill about three months ago he went into a hospital sort of placeone of those new thingsand he was rather bad now hes somewhere or other recovering i fancy he wont be in london again yet loring received the news with a comment as indifferent as his question had been and then there fell a second silence lorings eyes very keen and calculating were fixed upon the carpet on mrs romaynes face was an accentuation of the intent preoccupied look which had lain behind all her previous gaiety the two faces suggested curiously that the man and woman alike felt individually and each irrespective of the other that something in the shape of a prologue was over and that the real interest of the interview might begin the silence was broken by mrs romayne she pushed the teatable further from her and leaned back in her chair as she said casually did you and julian meet at the club last night loring followed her example and took an easier and more careless pose yes he said we had an hours talk together i was very glad i had looked in i hardly expected to find him there mrs romayne laughed and the sound was rather forced oh she said lightly he is a tremendous clubbist all young men go through the phase dont you think she paused a moment and her voice sounded as though her breath was coming rather quickly as she said carelessly you find him a good deal altered i dare say six monthsshe paused her breath was troublesomesix months makes such a difference at his time of life she finished loring looked at her he had long ago decided that when a woman was made up it was of very little use to direct observation to anything but her eyes yes he said reflectively as though debating a question already existing in his mind and answering it for the first time he is altered i supposeyes i suppose six months must make a difference a sharp breath as at a sudden stab of pain had parted mrs romaynes lips at his first words and he saw a hard defiant brightness come into her eyes i was very glad to seewell may one allude to what one could not help seeing yesterday he went on in another and much lighter tone one may allude to it confidentially returned mrs romayne and her tone was rather highpitched and uneven not otherwise i am sorry to sayat present did julian say anything about it her tone as she asked the question was carelessness itself but her fingers were tightly clenched round her handkerchief as she waited for the answer a word or two returned loring i inferred that it was only a question of time has it been going on long all the winter she answered and again there was that little forced laugh you see unfortunately she has been away i had hoped that it would have come off before she went away but it didnt she stopped rather abruptly and loring watching her keenly said you think it is time he should marry i thinkwell yes i suppose i do dont you agree with me you young men are so apt to get into mischief you know i suppose i can hardly deny the general principle answered loring with a slight smile though it is some time since i have been a young man in any practical sense but as to julian i hardly know but you must know returned mrs romayne quickly and with an affected laugh and you must know in the first place that im relying on you for a good deal of cooperationoh of course not in these delicate affairs a certain shade of attentionjust that attention which might become gravely or gaily sympathetic according to the demand made upon himappeared in lorings manner he replied to her last words with a gesture of mock deprecation which answered the tone in which they were spoken but a quiet reliable interest touched his voice as he spoke which seemed to respond rather to the possibilities of the situation you have only to command me he said there was a hungry intentness about mrs romaynes mouth now and about her clenched hand which only a tremendous effort and the sacrifice of all reality of tone could have kept out of her voice to tell you the truth she said lightly there was rather a catastrophe in the autumn a girl you know silly boythe usual thing i fancy it has upset him a good deal in every way and there is nothing like marriage for settling a young man down after such an affair she paused as thoughwhile her confidence in her statement and the point of view from which she had presented the matter stood in no need of confirmationshe yet craved to hear it subscribed to by another voice and loring nodded with grave attentive assent quite so he said sententiously now of course she continued of course a woman cant know all the ins and outs of a young mans life even when shes his mother its out of the question and to be very frank with youthere was something painful now about the lightness of her tonehis mother had to be rather autocratic and the boy didnt much like it consequently i cant feel sure thatwell that she knows even as much as she might about his affairs now thats why im confiding in you in this expansive way i want you to look after him for me loring changed his position and nodded again gravely and comprehendingly i understand he said slowly i understand the statement was true in far wider sense than mrs romayne could be aware of there was a moments silence during which he seemed to deliberate deeply on the facts presented to him watched intently by mrs romayne and then he roused himself as it were i wont say that your confidence in me gives me great pleasure he said because i hope you know that i will simply say that i will do all i can the words were admirably spoken with a gentleness and consideration of tone and manner which were all the more striking from their contrast with his usual demeanour and they carried an impression of strength and sympathy such as no woman could have resisted a strange spasm as of intense relief passed across mrs romaynes face and for the moment she did not speak then she said low and hurriedly i have heard that he plays and itit worries me a boy will often listen to a friend whom he respects andandi rely on you i consider myself honoured a pause followed and then loring continued with an easy seriousness which was very reassuring i am very glad to know all this for it gives me a key without which i might have blundered considerably to return confidence for confidence and to assure you that i really have some power to help you i will say that i made a little discovery about julian yesterday which perplexed me a good deal i shall know now how to act if he must speculate he was interrupted the daintily coloured face before him changed suddenly and terribly a ghastly reality that lay behind that expression of carelessness seemed on the instant to crash through all veils and masks as mrs romayne rose to her feet with a hoarse cry her face drawn and working her hands stretched out as though to ward off something unendurably horrible no she gasped and she was absolutely fighting and struggling for breath as though something clutched at her throat not that oh good heavens not that you must stop it you must prevent it he must not he must not do you hear me he must not there are some natures which not even contact with throbbing vibrating reality can touch or thrill and loring surprised indeed had risen also cynical imperturbable and coolheaded as usual by jove he said to himself critically who would have thought she had it in her the choked agonised voice stopped abruptly and he met her eyes wild and fierce in their desperate command and said quickly and soothingly i will do anything you wish i assure you you have only to speak i am grieved beyond all words to have distressed you so i had no idea a hoarse laugh broke from mrs romayne and she turned away with a strange gesture almost as though it were herself she derided and loring was forgotten by her clasping her hands fiercely over her face loring paused a moment and then went on smoothly there is nothing to disturb you i assure you in what i was going to say most young men have a turn for dabbling in speculation at some time or other and though i know some ladies have a horror of it i dont think you would find that there is much foundation for that horror he stopped somewhat abruptly he had suddenly remembered that he was speaking to the widow of william romayne of whose final collapse he knew the outline he looked at the woman before him with her hidden face her figure rigid and tense from head to foot and thought to himself callously how curious these survivals of emotion were she did not move or speak and he went on with a tone of delicate sympathy no doubt if you really think it well to stop it with a high hand it can be done i ought to say that i have rather broken confidence in revealing julians doings as he is very anxious that you should not think him dissatisfied or ungrateful and did not wish you to hear of them a shiver shook the bowed figure from head to foot im afraid i thought more of reassuring you than of him i thought that if you knew that he and i were in the same affair and that he would act solely on my advice you would perhaps feel happier about him but the answer he wanted the answer which would have enabled him to continue his reassurances on the purely personal line was not forthcoming mrs romayne neither spoke nor moved he had no intention of risking his position by foolhardiness so he adjusted his line of argument to the darkness in which her silence left him as i said however he continued gently if you prefer to talk to him on the subject and ask him to give it up no doubt he will do so rather than distress you and if you lay your commands on me to that effect i will certainly refuse to go any further with him but may i say that i think you would be wiser to let things take their course it is not a good thing to thwart a young man in the frame of mind you have hinted at as being julians at present if you can conquer your horror of the idea i am sure you will be better satisfied in the end there was a dead silence at last mrs romayne raised her head slowly not turning her face towards loring but looking straight before her as though utterly oblivious of his personal presence there was a strange fleeting dignity about her drawn face with its wide ghastly eyes the dignity which comes from horror confronted take their course she said in a still faraway voice she paused a moment and then went on in the same tone you think this isinevitable the last word came with a strange ring i think that any attempt at its prevention would be most undesirable said loring it might leadof course it is not very likely but still it is possibleto private speculations on master julians part very well then there was a curious hard steadiness in her tone as of one who perforce concedes a point to an adversary and braces every nerve afresh to face the new situation thus created that is like you exclaimed loring admiringly the tone of her voice had passed him by you will be glad i know now let me say again how awfully sorry i am to have distressed you and then ill go youll be glad to get rid of me she did not seem to hear the words but as his voice ceased she turned her face slowly towards him with a vague uncertain look upon it as though her consciousness was struggling back to him and the life he represented across a great gulf she looked at him a moment and then that dignity and a strange pathos which that groping look had possessed gave way before a ghastly smile im afraid ive been making myself most ridiculous she said and there was a difficult uncertain sprightliness about her weak voice so awfully sorry im rather absurd about speculation old memories with which i neednt bore you youll look after my boy then thanks she held out her hand as she spoke with a little affected gesture but as he placed his hand in it her fingers closed with an icy clutch and now do you know i must send you away too bad isnt it but there is such a thing as dressing for dinner quite so returned loring gaily it is very good of you to have been bothered with me so long goodbye goodbye she answered youll report progress of course certainly were a pair of conspirators are we not when mrs romayne came down to dinner that night her face was as haggard as though the interval intervening had held for her another three days illness but the hard determination in her eyes was more intense than ever end of vol ii f m evans and co limited printers crystal palace se
