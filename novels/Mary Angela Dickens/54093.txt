dhte room of one of the best hotels in nice a large room gay and attractive according to its kind as fresh paint bright decoration and expanse of looking glass could make it from end to end were ranged small tables varying in size but uniform in the radiant spotlessness of their white cloths and the brightness of their silver china or glass and to and fro between the tables and from the tables to the door moved active waiters whose one aim in life seemed to be the anticipation of the wishes of the visitors for whose pleasure alone they apparently existed it was early and djeuner proper was hardly in full swing as yet but a good many of the tables were occupied and a subdued hum of conversation pervaded the air a hum compounded of the high pitched chatter of american women and the quick eager volubility of french tongues backed by a less pronounced but perfectly perceptible undercurrent of german and english the whole diversified now and then by a light laugh the sounds were subdued because the room was large and sparsely filled but they were gay the smiling alacrity of the waiters was apparently at once a symptom of and a subtle tribute to the humour of the hour there were sundry strongly marked faces here and there among the little groups middle aged men to whom neither ambition nor care could have been empty words middle aged women with lines about their faces not lightly come by young girls with the vague desire and unrest of youth young men with its secrets and its aspirations but all individuality of care anxiety or desire seemed to be in abeyance for the time being enjoyment somewhat conventional well dressed enjoyment of the kind that rather covers up trouble as not the thing than disperses it was evidently the order of the day it was within three days of the carnival and the visitors who were crowding into nice came one and all with fixedly and obviously light hearted intention the link between the little letter not little by any means in a material sense since its capitals sprawled and staggered over a large sheet of foreign letter paper and the smart pleasure seeking atmosphere of the nice table dhte room was a woman who sat at a little table by one of the open windows and she was much more easily to be identified arguing from her appearance and manner with her present surroundings than with the images conjured up by the blotted letter in her hand she was a small woman with a very erect little figure the trimness of which was accentuated by the conventional perfection of the dress she wore it was not such a dress as would commend itself to the fashionable woman of to day at that date eighteen hundred and seventy two tailor made garments for ladies were not but it had won a glance of respect nevertheless from every woman in the room in the course of the few minutes which had elapsed since its wearer had entered her hair was fair very plentiful and very fashionably dressed her eyes were blue her colouring pale if she had had no other claims on a critics attention no more marked characteristics she might have been called rather pretty she was rather pretty as a matter of fact but her prettiness was dwarfed and put out of sight by the stronger influence of her manner and expression as she sat there reading her letter neither moving nor speaking she was stamped from head to foot as far as externals went as one of a type of woman which commands more superficial homage than perhaps any other the woman of the world the self possession the quiet unquestioning assurance even the superficiality of her expression in its total absence of intellectuality or emotionalism spoke to character the narrow character truly which is cognisant only of shallow waters knows them and reigns in them but it was a noticeable feature about her that even this character had gone to the accentuation of the type in her as to her age it would have been extremely difficult to guess it from her appearance her face was quite unworn evidently such emotions as she had known had gone by no means deep and yet it was not young there was too much knowledge of the world about it for youthfulness as a matter of fact she was twenty six years old she was sitting alone at the little table by the window and her perfect freedom from nervousness or even consciousness of the admiring glances cast at her emphasized her perfect self possession a waiter smiling and assiduous even beyond the smiling assiduity with which he had waited at other tables appeared with her breakfast and as he arranged it on the table she replaced the blotted letter in its envelope with a certain lingering touch that was apparently quite unconscious and contrasted rather oddly with her self possessed face the envelope was addressed in a womans writing to mrs william romayne htel florian nice it was one of a pile and she took up the others and looked them through they all bore the same name there are no letters for mr romayne she said to the waiter carelessly the voice was rather thin and as would have been expected from her face slightly unsympathetic but it was refined and well modulated her french was excellent the waiter thus questioned showed a letter a business like looking letter in a blue envelope which he had brought in on his tray and presented it with a torrent of explanation and apology it had arrived last night before the arrival of monsieur and madame and with unheard of carelessness but with quite amazing carelessness indeed it had been placed in a private sitting room ordered by another english monsieur who had arrived only this morning by the valet of this english monsieur it had been given to the waiter this moment only by the waiter it was now given to madame with ten million desolations that such an accident should have occurred monsieur had seemed so anxious for letters on his arrival if madame would have the goodness to explain madame stopped the flood of protestations with a little gesture however it might affect monsieur the accident did not appear to disturb her greatly indeed it was inconceivable that she should be easily ruffled let mr romayne have the letter at once she said and send him also a cup of coffee and an english newspaper the waiter signified his readiness to do her bidding with the greatest alacrity took the letter from her with an apologetic bow laid by her side a newspaper for madames own reading as he said and retired left once more alone madame proceeded to breakfast in a dainty leisurely fashion ignoring the newspaper for the present and drawing from the envelope in which she had replaced the childish little epistle a second letter it was a long one and she read it placidly as she went on with her breakfast my dear hermia it ran julian has just accomplished the enclosed with a great deal of pride and excitement the wild scrawls that occur here and there were the result of imperative demands on his part to be allowed to write all by himself the dear pet is very well and grows sweeter every day i believe you were to meet mr romayne at mentone on the second i think he said and to go on to nice the next day so i hope you will get this soon after you arrive there i hope the change will do mr romayne good he came here to see julian yesterday and i did not think him looking well nor did father he only laughed when father told him so we were so glad to get your last letter you are not a very good correspondent are you but of course you were going out a great deal in paris and had not much time for writing you seem to have had a delightful time there dennis falconer came back last week he has been away nearly a year you know he is very brown and has a long beard which is rather becoming the royal geographical are beginning to think rather highly of him father is told and he will probably get something important to do before long father wanted him to come and stay here but he has gone back to his old chambers not very cousinly of him i think you dont say whether you are coming to london for the season i asked mr romayne but he said he did not know what your plans were i do so hope you will come though i am afraid i should not be pleased if the spirit should move you to settle down in england and demand julian however i suppose that is not very likely with much love dear hermia your very affectionate cousin frances falconer mrs romayne finished the letter which she had read with leisurely calm as though her interest in it was by no means of a thrilling nature and then opened and glanced through the others which were waiting their turn they were of various natures one or two came from villas about nice and consisted of more or less pressing invitations one was from a well known leader of society in rome a long chatty letter which the recipient read with evident amusement and interest there were also one or two bills at which mrs romayne glanced with the composure of a woman with whom money is plentiful breakfast and correspondence were alike disposed of at last and by this time the room was nearly full the laughter and talk was louder now the atmosphere of gaiety was more accentuated outside in the sunshine in the public gardens a band was playing mrs romayne was alone it is true and her voice consequently added nothing to the pervading note but her presence solitary as it was was no jarring element she was not lonely her solitude was evidently an affair of the moment merely she was absolutely in touch with the spirit of the hour and no laughing excited girl there witnessed more eloquently or more unconsciously to the all pervading dominion of the pleasures of life than did the self possessed looking little woman to whom its pleasures were also its businesses the only businesses she knew she had gathered her letters together and was rising from her seat with a certain amount of indecision in her face when a waiter entered the room and came up to her some ladies wishing to see madame were in the salon he said and he handed her as he spoke a visiting card bearing the name lady cloughton underneath the name was written in pencil an unconscionable hour to invade you but we are going this afternoon to la turbie and we hope we may perhaps persuade you to join us the ladies are in the salon you say said mrs romayne glancing up with the careless satisfaction of a woman to whom the turn of events usually does bring satisfaction perhaps because her demands and her experience are alike of the most superficial description in the salon madame returned the waiter three ladies and two gentlemen he was conducting her obsequiously across the room as he spoke and a moment later he opened the door of the salon and stood aside to let her pass in a little well bred clamour ensued upon her entrance greetings questions and answers as between acquaintances who had not met for some time and met now with a pleasure which seemed rather part and parcel of the gaiety to which the atmosphere of the dining room had witnessed than an affair of the feelings all mrs romaynes five visitors were apparently under five and thirty the eldest being a man of perhaps three or four and thirty addressed by mrs romayne as lord cloughton the youngest a pretty girl who was introduced by the leader of the party presumably lady cloughton herself quite a young woman as my little sister they were all well dressed they were all apparently in the best possible spirits and bent upon enjoyment and gay little laughs interspersed the chatter incessantly breaking from one or the other on little or no apparent provocation eventually lady cloughtons voice detached itself and went on alone we heard you were here she said from a man who is staying here we are at the franais you know and we said at once supposing mrs romayne is not engaged for to morrow so many people dont come you see until the day before the carnival and consequently of course one has fewer friends and fewer engagements and this week is not so full dont you know supposing she has no engagement for to morrow we said how pleasant it would be if she would come with us to la turbie we have to make mr romaynes acquaintance you know so charmed to have the opportunity i hope he is well fairly well thanks replied his wife he has been in london all the winter his business always seems to take him to the wrong place at the wrong time and either the climate or his work seems to have knocked him up a little he seems to have got into a shocking habit of sitting up all night and staying in bed all day at least he has acted on that principle during the week we have been together he is actually not up yet mrs romayne smiled as she spoke her husbands shocking habits apparently sat very lightly on her in fact there was something singularly disengaged and impersonal in her manner of speaking of him altogether her visitor received her smile with a pretty little unmeaning laugh and went on with much superficial eagerness he may perhaps be up in time for our expedition though we thought of starting in about two hours time they say the place is perfectly beautiful at this time of year perhaps you know it no returned mrs romayne oddly enough i have never been to nice before i have often talked of wintering here but i have always eventually gone somewhere else are you here for the first time she added turning to the young man whom she had received as mr allan and who evidently occupied the position of mutual acquaintance between herself and her other visitors he was answering her in the affirmative when lord cloughton struck in with a cheery laugh hes been here two days and he has come to the conclusion that nice is a beastly hole mrs romayne he said this afternoons expedition is really a device on our part for cheering him up he let himself be persuaded into putting some money into a new bank and the new bank has smashed have you seen the papers now allan hasnt lost much fortunately it isnt that that weighs upon him but he is oppressed by a sense of his own imbecility arent you old fellow the young man laughed freely enough perhaps i am he said so would you be cloughton wouldnt he mrs romayne and dont tell me you wouldnt have done the same because any fellow would in my place however if mrs romayne is more likely to join us this afternoon if the proceedings are presented to her in the light of a charity im quite willing to pose as an object take pity on me mrs romayne do i shant pity you answered mrs romayne lightly you dont seem to me to be much depressed and your misfortunes appear to be of your own making but i shall be delighted to go with you this afternoon she continued turning to lady cloughton and i feel sure that mr romayne will also be delighted that is quite charming of you exclaimed lady cloughton rising as she spoke well then i think if we were to call for you yes we will call for you in two hours from now so glad you can come the little boy quite well so glad in two hours then au revoir there was a flutter of departure a chorus of bright meaningless last words and mrs romayne stood at the head of the great staircase waving her hand in farewell as her visitors with a last backward glance and parting smiles and gestures disappeared from view she stood a moment watching some people in the hall below whose appearance had struck her at dinner on the previous evening and as she looked idly at them she saw a man come in an englishman evidently just off a journey and not a gentleman as she decided absently and go up to a waiter who was standing in the dining room doorway the englishman evidently asked a question and then another and another and finally the waiter glanced up the stairs to where mrs romayne stood carelessly watching and obviously pointed her out to his interlocutor asking a question in his turn the englishman after looking quickly in mrs romaynes direction shook his head in answer and walked into the dining room with a vague feeling of surprise and curiosity mrs romayne turned and moved away she retraced her steps evidently intending to go upstairs but as she passed the open door of the drawing room she hesitated her eyes caught by the bright prospect visible through the open windows which looked out over the public gardens and the blue mediterranean her ears caught by the sounds from the band still playing outside she re entered the room crossed to the window and stood there looking out with inattentive pleasure the dialogue she had witnessed in the hall quite forgotten as she thought of her own affairs she thought of the immediate prospects of the next few weeks wholly satisfactory prospects they were to judge from her expression she thought of the letters she had received that morning mentally answering the invitations she had received she thought of the acquaintances who had just left her and of the engagement she had made for that afternoon and then as if the necessity for seeing her husband on the subject had by this means become freshly present to her she turned away from the window and went out of the room and up the staircase on her way she chanced to glance down into the hall and noticed the englishman to whom the waiter had pointed her out leaning in a reposeful and eminently stationary attitude against the entrance she would ask who he was she resolved idly she went on until she came to a door at the end of a long corridor outside which stood a dainty little pair of walking shoes and a pair of mans boots she glanced at them and lifted her eyebrows slightly a characteristic gesture and then opened the door it led into a little dressing room from which another doorway on the left led evidently into a larger room beyond the glimpse of the latter afforded by the partly open door showed it dim and dark by contrast with the light outside apparently the blind was but slightly raised there was no sunshine in the dressing room either though it was light enough and as mrs romayne went in and shut the door she seemed to pass into a silence that was almost oppressive the band the strains of which had reached her at the very threshold was not audible in the room in shutting the door she seemed to shut out all external sounds and within the room was absolute stillness the contrast however made no impression whatever upon mrs romayne she was by no means sensitive evidently to such subtle influence she glanced carelessly through the doorway into the dim vista of the bedroom beyond and going to the other end of the dressing room knelt down by a portmanteau and began to search in it with the uncertainty of a woman whose packing is done for her by a maid she found what she wanted sundry dainty adjuncts to out of door attire one of which a large lace sunshade required a little attention she took up an elaborate little case for work implements that lay on the table and selected a needle and thread and a thimble and perhaps the dead silence about her oppressed her a little unconsciously to herself for she hummed as she did so a bar or two of the waltz she had shut out as she shut the door then with the needle moving deftly to and fro in her white well shaped hands she moved down the dressing room and standing in the light for the sake of her work she spoke through the doorway into the still dark bedroom the cloughtons have been here william she said the people i met in rome this winter i think i told you didnt i they wanted us to go to la turbie with them this afternoon and i said we would that is to say i only answered conditionally for you of course will you go there was no answer no sound of any kind not so much as a stir or a rustle to indicate that the sleep of the man hidden in the dimness beyond and only sleep surely could account for his silence was even broken by the words addressed to him yet the voice which proceeded from the serene well appointed little figure standing in the sombre light of the dressing room with its attention more or less given to the trivial work in its hands was penetrating in its quality though not loud mrs romayne paused a moment listening then with that expressive movement of her eyebrows she went back again to the dressing table she had left took up a little pair of scissors which were necessary to give the finishing touch to her work gave that finishing touch with careless deliberation studied the effect with satisfaction and then laid down the sunshade and returned to the doorway into the bedroom she stood on the threshold this time and the darkness before her and the sombre light behind her seemed to meet upon her figure the silence and stillness all about her seemed to claim even the space she occupied william she said crisply william again there was no answer no sound or stir of any sort or kind and for the first time the silence seemed to strike her she moved quickly forward into the dimness william are you asleep her eyes had fallen on the bed and she stopped suddenly for it was empty she paused an instant and in that instant the silence seemed to rise and dominate the atmosphere as with a grim and mighty presence before which everything shallow or superficial sank into insignificance all that was typical and conventional about the woman standing in the midst of the stillness arrested by she knew not what suddenly seemed to stand out jarring and incongruous as though unreality had been met and touched into self revelation by a great reality then it subsided altogether and only the simplest elements of womanhood were left the womanhood common to the peasant and the princess as the wife took two or three quick steps forward she turned the corner of the bed that hid the greater part of the room from her and then staggered back with a sharp cry at her feet partly dressed there lay the figure of the man to whom she had been talking his right hand dropped straight by his side clenched a revolver his face a handsome face probably an hour ago was white and fixed his eyes were glassy on the floor beside him lay an open letter a letter written on blue paper william romayne was asleep indeed his wife might tear at the bell rope the hotel servants might hurry and rush to and fro even the recently arrived englishman might render his assistance but it was all in vain william romayne was beyond their reach chapter ii the long railway journey from paris to nice was nearly over the passengers jaded and tired out for the most part after a night in the train were beginning to rouse to a languid interest in the landscape to become aware that dawn and the uncomfortable and unfamiliar early day had some time since given place to a fuller and maturer light and to consult their watches reminding themselves or one another as the case might be that they were due at nice at twelve fifteen alone in one of the first class carriages was a passenger who had accepted the situation with the most matter of fact indifference from first to last he had made his arrangements for the night with the skill and deliberation of an experienced traveller and as the morning advanced he had composed himself as comfortably as circumstances permitted in a corner of his carriage now and then casting a keen comprehensive glance at the country through which he was being carried these glances however were evidently instinctive and almost unconscious for the most part he gazed straight before him with a preoccupied frown and a grave and anxious expression in marked contrast with his physical imperturbability he was a man of apparently three or four and thirty tall rather lean than thin and very muscular looking his face and the right hand from which he had pulled off the glove were bronzed a deep red brown and he wore a long brown beard but he was not otherwise remarkable looking his eyes indeed were very keen and steady but the rest of his face conveyed the impression that he owed these characteristics rather to trained habits of material observation than to general intellectual depths the mouth was firm and strong but neither sensitive nor sympathetic and the straight well cut nose was as distinctly too thin as the rather high forehead was too narrow on a much worn travelling bag on the seat beside him was the name dennis falconer the train steamed slowly into the station at nice at last the traveller stepped out on to the platform and the shade of grave preoccupation which had touched him seemed to descend on him more heavily and all absorbingly as he did so he was walking down the platform looking neither to the right nor the left when he was stopped by a quick exclamation from a little wiry man with a shrewd clever face who had just come into the station falconer as im alive he cried well met my boy the gravity of the younger mans face relaxed for the moment into a smile of well pleased astonishment dr aston he exclaimed why i was thinking of looking you up in london id no idea you were abroad the other man laughed a very pleasant jovial laugh im taking a holiday he said i dont know that ive any particular right to it but i dont know these places and i took it into my head that i should like to have a look at a carnival in nice and you my boy just back from africa you are i know youve come for the carnival by way of a change eh falconers face altered no he said gravely and with a good deal of restraint ive not come for pleasure very much the reverse im sorry to say he paused apparently intending to say no more on the subject but the keen kindly interest in his hearers face or something magnetic about the man influenced him in spite of himself i dont know whether the facts about this bank business are known here yet he said but if they are youll understand aston when i tell you that i and my old uncle are the only male relations of william romaynes wife a quick flash of grave intelligence passed across dr astons face he hesitated and glanced dubiously at the younger man when did you leave london he said abruptly yesterday morning was the somewhat surprised reply youve come in good time my boy said dr aston very gravely mrs romayne wants a relation with her if ever she did in her life was her husband ever a friend of yours dennis i have never met him i know very little even of his wife what is it doctor william romayne shot himself yesterday morning a short sharp exclamation broke from falconer and then there was a moments total silence between the two men as the sudden unspeakable horror in falconers face resolved itself into a shocked almost awestruck gravity i am thankful to have met you he said at last in a low stern voice and i am more than thankful that i came he held out his hand as he spoke as though what he had heard impelled him to go on his way and dr aston wrung it with warm sympathy we shall meet again he said let me know if i can be of any use i am staying at the franais grave and stern but not apparently shaken or rendered nervous by the news he had heard or by the prospect of the meeting before him as a sympathetic or emotional man must have been dennis falconer strode out of the station grave and stern he reached his destination and enquired for mrs romayne his question was answered by the proprietor himself supplemented by half audible ejaculations from attendant waiters in a tone in which sympathetic interest familiarity and even a certain amount of resentment were inextricably blended monsieur would see madame romayne cette pauvre madame of a demeanour so beautiful yes even in these frightful circumstances so beautiful and so distinguished monsieur had but just arrived from england monsieur had then perhaps not heard monsieur was aware he was a kinsman of madame monsieur would then doubtless appreciate the so great inconvenience occasioned the hardly to be reckoned damage sustained by one of the first hotels in nice by the event monsieur would see madame at once but yes madame was visible there was in fact a monsieur with her even now an english monsieur from the english scotland yard madame had sent but monsieur was indeed in haste monsieur left no possibility of doubt on that score the waiter told off by a wave of the proprietors hand on the vigorous demonstration to that effect evoked by the mention of the monsieur from scotland yard had to hasten his usual pace considerably to keep ahead of those quick firm footsteps and it was almost breathlessly that he at last threw open a door at the end of a long corridor mr romaynes name is public property in connection with the affair then in london since yesterday morning the words spoken in a hard thin womans voice came to falconers ear as the door opened and the waiters announcement a kinsman of madame passed unheeded as he moved hastily forward into the room it was a small private sitting room evidently by no means the best in the hotel with his back to the door stood a young man in an attitude of professional calm rather belied by a certain nervous fingering of the hat he held which seemed to say that he found his position a somewhat embarrassing one facing him and indirectly facing the door stood mrs romayne she was dressed in black from head to foot but the gown she wore was one that she had had in her wardrobe very fashionably made with no trace of mourning about it other than its hue emphasized perhaps by the incongruity of her conventional smartness but a result of the past twenty four hours independent of any such emphasis all the more salient points of her demeanour of the day before seemed to be accentuated into hardness her perfect self possession as she faced the young man before her it was the man she had noticed on the previous morning questioning the waiter was hard her perfect freedom from any touch of emotion or agitation was hard her face a little sharpened and haggard and reddened slightly about the eyelids apparently rather from want of sleep than from tears was very hard her eyes brighter than usual and her rather thin mouth were eloquent of bitterness rather than desolation of spirit she turned quickly towards the door as falconer entered and looked at him for an instant with an unrecognising stare then as he advanced to her without speaking and with outstretched hand something that was almost a spasm of comprehension passed across her face settling into a stiff little society smile it is dennis falconer isnt it she said holding out her hand to him i ought to have known you at once i am very glad to see you my uncle thought we decided yesterday morning dennis falconer hesitated and stopped he was thrown out of his reckoning taken hopelessly aback as it were by something so entirely unlike what he had expected as was her whole bearing though indeed he had been quite unconscious of expecting anything but mrs romayne remained completely mistress of the situation it is very kind of you she said with the same hard composure it was very kind of my uncle she hesitated hardly perceptibly and then said the lines about her mouth growing more bitter you have heard falconer bowed his head in assent and she turned toward the young man who had drawn a little apart during this colloquy this gentleman comes from scotland yard she said perhaps you will be so kind as to go into matters with him i do not understand business or legal details mr falconer will represent me she added to the young man who bowed with an alacrity that suggested as did his glance at falconer that the prospect of conferring with a man rather than a woman was a distinct relief to him then before falconers not very rapid mind had adjusted itself to the situation she had bowed slightly to the young man and left the room chapter iii three days before the name of william romayne had been widely known and respected throughout europe as the name of a successful and distinguished financier now it was the centre of a nine days wonder as the name of a master swindler detected a bank established in london within the last twelve months in connection with a company offering an exceptionally high rate of interest had suddenly suspended payment the circumstances were so ordinary and the explanation offered so plausible that at first no suspicion of underhand dealings presented itself it was in connection with the first whispers which ran like wildfire through financial london of something beneath the surface that it first became known that william romayne had some connection as yet undefined by rumour with the bank in question a fact hitherto quite unknown the whispers grew with rapidity which was almost incredible even to the whisperers into a definite and authentic shout of accusation and with the exposure of an outline of such daring and ingenious fraud as had not been perpetrated for many a day another fact had become public property the exposure had been brought about by an incredibly short sighted blunder on the part of the master mind by which the whole affair had been conceived william romaynes was the master mind and william romayne in trying to overreach alike his dupes and his confederates had overreached himself his own hand had created the clue which had led eventually to the ruin of the scheme he had originated his death with the news of which the london stock exchange was ringing only a few hours after it was known in nice was the forfeit paid by a strong nature to which success in all its undertakings was the very salt of life mrs romayne on leaving the sitting room passed along the passages to her own room not that which she had entered twenty four hours before to consult with her husband as to the pleasure expedition of the afternoon her face and manner altering not at all her composure was evidently neither forced nor unreal the emotion created in her by the tragic circumstances through which she was living was obviously not the heartbroken shame and despair naturally to be attributed to a wife so situated but a bitter and burning resentment had william romayne passed away in the ordinary course of nature or by any violent accident his widow would have mourned him with conventional lamentation and with a certain amount of genuine regret he had committed suicide as the letter lying by his side revealed to his wife even while she hardly realised that he was indeed dead as his only way of escape from the consequences of fraud on the brink of detection and his widows attitude to his memory under these circumstances was the natural outcome of the character of their married life hermia stirling at nineteen had been a pretty practical matter of fact girl with her rather shallow nature somewhat prematurely matured she had been an orphan from her babyhood and having no near relations in england her nineteen years of life had been lived under varied auspices resulting in more desultory education moral as well as mental than was good for her the most impressionable of those years however those from fourteen to nineteen had been passed with connections of her mothers young and wealthy society women with no ideas beyond society life and with little perceptible principle but that of social expediency hermia was just nineteen just out and taking to the life before her with the ease and zest of a born woman of the world when one of these ladies died and the other married and went away to america with her husband at this juncture the girls guardian her fathers only brother returned from india to settle in london with his only child a girl two years older than hermia and it was obvious that his home must be also hermias but neither old mr falconer nor his daughter had the slightest taste or capacity for fashionable life and before she had spent six months with them the world had become to hermia an insufferably dull and tiresome place she had known william romayne in society he was rich he was handsome and he was very popular there was that indefinable something about him manner magnetism or tact which constitutes a kind of dominating charm he was not the less somebody in that he was vaguely understood to be a business man of some sort with dealings in shares and stocks all over the world a locality which lent a picturesque haziness to his affairs consequently when he followed hermia into her new life and asked her to marry him she passed over the fact that he was five and twenty years her senior and consented with the practical promptitude of a nature for which romance and sentiment were not for eighteen months she and her husband had lived in a large house in eaton square entertaining and being entertained through two brilliant seasons which took away any girlishness which hermia had ever possessed and gave her qualities which she admired infinitely more she found her husband very pleasant very easy to live with and after the first six months quite unexacting his business took him into the city every day at this time though as his wife said complacently he was not the least like the ordinary city man but at the end of the season which followed on the birth of their child he announced that he would have to spend certainly six months possibly more in america he showed no ardent desire to take his wife with him and his wife had no desire whatever to go she wanted to spend the rest of the summer at one of the fashionable health resorts and to winter in rome such an arrangement was accordingly made between them in the simplest most matter of fact way arguing no shadow of ill will on either side and during the four years which had elapsed since then husband and wife had each gone his or her own way meeting when occasion served for a month or two at a time now in london now in paris now in rome and presumably finding the arrangement mutually satisfactory the little boy had been left for the most part to the care of mrs romaynes cousin frances falconer mrs romayne regarded him with the careless half dormant affection of a woman to whom her child owes nothing but bare life to whom its arrival in the world has been rather a tiresome interlude merely in her round of pleasures and pursuits who has had no time since and has seen no occasion to make time to give it that care which other people as it seemed to her could give it quite as well as she and who is waiting vaguely until it shall be grown up to find it interesting that her husbands business had taken him in the course of those four years into every corner of the globe where the passing of money from hand to hand is elevated into a science mrs romayne knew and with that fact her knowledge of his affairs began and ended he made her an ample allowance whenever they met she found him the same handsome rather callous but withal fascinating man clever with a cleverness which she could appreciate the cleverness which made money and held a position in society and she had asked nothing more of him her regard for him if regard that could be called which was more truly indifference had been founded on appreciation of his success before failure before the social disgrace which must be the lot of a detected swindler and suicide it disappeared totally and instantaneously to be replaced by a burning sense of personal outrage and insult it was late in the afternoon before she left her room again dennis falconer received a message to the effect that mrs romayne was sure that he must be tired and begged that he would not think of her until he had lunched and rested when she did reappear she was in widows weeds and the contrast between her dress with its tragic significance of desolation and her face untouched with feeling was inexpressible dennis falconer was in the sitting room when she entered it his sense of duty was largely developed and he was also keenly sensible of the moral aspect of the affair with which he was brought into such close contact the first of these senses kept him in waiting in anticipation of the appearance of the woman for whose assistance he was there and the second weighed so heavily upon him that the publicity of the hotel smoking room would have been intolerable to him under the circumstances he rose quickly as mrs romayne came in a look of slight constraint on his face dennis falconer had no near relation and perhaps this absence of close ties to england had had something to do with his adoption of the life of a traveller and explorer in connection with the royal geographical society old mr falconer mrs romaynes uncle was his second cousin only though the younger man had been brought up to address him as uncle but in so small a clan distant relationship counts for more than in a family where first cousins and brothers and sisters abound and there was nothing strange to dennis falconer or to mrs romayne in the fact of his coming to her support even though they hardly knew one another but falconer had been chilled and even repelled by her manner of the morning and he was very conscious now of having his cousins acquaintance to make and of approaching the process with a vague prejudice against her in his mind this prejudice was not dissipated by her first words spoken with a suavity somewhat low in pitch truly but with a tacit ignoring of the significance of their meeting which seemed to the man she addressed to whom society life with its obligations and conventionalities was practically an unknown quantity simply jarring and unsuitable i hope you are rested she said i suppose though that to such a traveller as you are the journey from london to nice is nothing i hear from frances constantly about your exploits and she tells me that we are to expect great things of you what a long time it is since we met she sat down as she spoke with a hard little smile and falconer murmured something almost unintelligible thinking that his manner arose from mere embarrassment instinct dictated to her to set him at his ease and with no faintest comprehension of his attitude of mind she proceeded to chat to him about his own affairs asking him questions which elicited coherent answers indeed but answers which grew terser and sterner until she thought indifferently that her cousin was a rather heavy person at last there came a pause a pause during which falconer gazed grimly and uncomfortably at the floor and when mrs romayne broke it it was with a different tone and manner hard and matter of fact the detective told you more than he told me possibly she said if there is anything more for me to hear i should like to hear it you had better i think read this letter mr romayne received it yesterday morning she handed him that letter written on blue paper which had lain by the dead mans side and falconer took it in silence the letter was from one of william romaynes confederates it was the desperate letter of a desperate man who knew himself to be addressing the man to whom he was to owe ruin and disgrace the crisis had evidently been so wholly unexpected that detection was actually imminent before the criminals recognised it as even possible the gist of the letter was contained in the statement that before it met the eyes of the man for whom it was intended the whole scheme would be exploded falconer read it through his face very stern he finished it and refolded it still in silence and mrs romayne said in a dry thin voice it bears out as you see what the detective no doubt told you that there was so little ground for suspicion three days ago that he was sent out merely to watch and without even a warrant he found a telegram waiting for him here from his authorities yesterday morning he told me so answered falconer distantly and constrainedly handing her back the letter as he spoke without comment there is not the faintest possibility of hushing it up i conclude she asked in the same hard voice falconer looked at her for a moment the indefinite disapprobation of her which had been growing in him almost with every word she said taking form in his face in a distinct expression of reprobation not the faintest he said emphatically nor do i see that such a possibility is in any way to be desired she glanced at him with a quick movement of her eyebrows she did not speak however and a silence ensued between them one of those uncomfortable silences eloquent of conscious want of sympathy it was broken this time by falconer who spoke with formal politeness and restraint you will wish to get away from this place as soon as possible no doubt he said there may be some slight delay before we are put into possession of the papers and other effects at present in the hands of the authorities here but i will of course do all i can to hasten matters thanks she said the papers oh you mean mr romaynes papers are there any do you think a will i suppose the will if there is one will be so much waste paper i fear said falconer with uncompromising sternness there is no chance of any property being saved even if it was possible to wish for such a thing but there may be papers nevertheless in fact no doubt there must be and you will of course wish to have them yes said mrs romayne thoughtfully yes of course she paused a moment and then added in a dry constrained voice do you mean me to understand that i am absolutely penniless was your own money in your own hands or in mr romaynes in mr romaynes then i fear there can be no doubt that such is the case falconer spoke very stiffly and distantly and mrs romayne rose from her chair a little abruptly and walked to the window when she turned to him again it was to speak of the formalities necessary with the nice authorities and a few moments later the interview was ended by the appearance of dinner during the few days that followed the distance between them which that first interview established so imperceptibly but so certainly never lessened it grew indeed with their contact with one another to falconer mrs romaynes whole attitude of mind her whole personality was simply and entirely antipathetic that a woman under such circumstances should speak and act and think as mrs romayne spoke and acted and as far as he could tell thought with so little sense of any but the social aspect of her husbands crime with so little realisation of the ruin that crime had brought to hundreds of innocent people with so little moral feeling of any kind was in the highest degree reprehensible to him having assumed a mental attitude of reprehension he stopped short his perceptions were not sufficiently keen to allow of his understanding that some pity might be due also suffering is not always to be estimated by the worth of the object through which it is inflicted not often indeed in this world where the sum of mans suffering is out of all proportion greater than the sum of mans spirituality mrs romaynes conception of life might be in the last degree narrow and selfish and as such it might be in the highest degree to be deprecated but such as it was it was all she had and within its limits her life was now in ruin her aims and ends in life might be of the poorest and deserving of unsparing condemnation but she had nothing beyond and the pain of their overthrow was to her dormant sensibility not so very disproportionate to the suffering inflicted on a more sensitive organisation by the shattering of higher hopes mrs romayne for her part found her cousin with the reserve and formality of demeanour which the situation developed in him simply a tiresome and uncongenial companion he was very attentive to her his manner as she acknowledged to herself more than once with a heavy sigh was excellent and he managed her difficult and painful affairs with admirable strength and tact she learnt in the course of those few days to respect him and depend on him in spite of herself and even against her will but it was not surprising that the end of their enforced dual solitude should be looked for more or less eagerly by both parties they were almost entirely dependent on one another for companionship falconer it is true saw dr aston once or twice but of mrs romaynes acquaintances not one had even left a card of condolence upon her neither the cloughtons nor any other of the pleasure seekers who had previously been so anxious for her society showed any sign of being aware of her existence under her present circumstances the form taken by falconers first allusion to the probable limits of their detention in nice had created in both of them by one of those vague chains of idea which are so unaccountable and so often experienced a tendency to think and speak of the termination of that detention when they did speak together on the subject as when the papers are given up there was some question at one time as to whether or no even the private papers of william romayne would be returned to his widow and these same papers thus surrounded by an element of painful uncertainty and at the same time elevated into a kind of order of release obtained in the minds of both a fictitious importance on their own account mrs romayne found herself thinking about them conjecturing about them even dreaming about them until at last when they were actually placed in her hand they possessed a curious fascination for her it was about midday when she and falconer returned from their final appearance before the authorities she stood in the middle of the room holding the large shabby despatch box lately handed to her with a grave private papers madame the noise of the carnival floated in at the window in striking contrast with the two sombre figures i think i will go and look them over she said in a low rather surprised voice you would like to go out perhaps please dont think about me i will spend the day quietly indoors he answered her courteously and she left the room slowly with her eyes fixed curiously on the despatch box in her hand chapter iv mrs romayne carried the despatch box to her bedroom and set it down on a small table she and falconer were leaving nice on the following morning and her maid was just finishing her packing mrs romayne inspected the womans arrangements gave her sundry orders and then dismissed her left alone she made one or two trifling preparations for the journey on her own account and when these were completed to her satisfaction she drew the table on which she had placed the despatch box to the open window and seated herself she drew the box towards her and unlocked it and there was nothing in her face as she did so but the hard resentment which had grown upon it during the last few days just touched by an indefinite and equally hard curiosity the interest which those papers possessed for her had been created by purely artificial means intrinsically they were nothing to her the position which the possession of them had occupied in her thoughts lately was the sole source of the impulse under which she was acting now under any other circumstances she might hardly have cared to look at them she raised the lid and paused a moment looking down at the compact mass of papers within with a sudden vague touch of more personal interest the box was nearly full the various sets of papers were carefully and methodically fastened together and endorsed evidently upon a system mrs romayne hesitated a moment and then took out a packet at random it consisted of bills all bearing dates within the last six months all sent in by leading london tradesmen and all for large amounts mrs romayne glanced at the figures and her eyebrows moved with an expression of slight surprise which was almost immediately dominated by bitter acceptance and comprehension she opened none however until she came to one bearing the name of a well known london jeweller she read the name and the amount of the bill and paused then a new curiosity came into her eyes and she unfolded the paper quickly the account was a very long one and as her eyes travelled quickly down it taking in item after item a dull red colour crept into her face and her eyes sparkled with contemptuous resentment she was evidently surprised and yet half annoyed with herself for being surprised two thirds of the items in the bill in her hand were for articles of jewellery not worn by men and not one of these had ever been seen by william romaynes wife she stuffed the paper back into its fastening tossed the bundle away and took another packet from the box with quickened interest it consisted of miscellaneous documents all likewise connected with her husbands life in london during the past winter but of no particular interest the next packet she opened was of the same nature and with that the top layer of the box came to an end the papers below were evidently older of varying ages indeed to judge from their varying tints of yellow disarranging a lower layer in taking out the packet nearest to her hand mrs romayne saw that there were older papers still beneath and realised that the box before her contained the private papers of many years probably all the private papers which william romayne had preserved throughout his life she opened the packet she had drawn out hastily and with an angry glitter in her eyes it consisted of businesslike looking documents not likely as it seemed to be of any interest to her she glanced through the first unheedingly enough and then as she reached the end something seemed suddenly to touch her attention she paused a moment with a startled incredulous expression on her face and began to re read it slowly and carefully she read it to the end again and her face as she finished was a little pale and chilled looking she freed another paper from the packet almost mechanically with an absorbed preoccupied look in her eyes opened it and read it with a strained hardly comprehending attention which grew gradually and imperceptibly as she went on from paper to paper into a kind of stupefied horror she finished the thick packet in her hands and then she paused lifting her pale face for a moment and gazing straight before her with an indescribable expression on its shallow hardness as though she was realising something almost incredibly bitter and repugnant to her and was stunned by the realisation then her instincts and habits of life and thought seemed to assert themselves as it were and to dominate the situation her expression changed the stupefied look gave place to what was little deeper than bitter excitement a patch of angry colour succeeded the pallor of a moment earlier and her eyes glittered turning to the despatch box again she proceeded to ransack it with a hasty eagerness of touch which differed markedly from the careless composure of her earlier proceedings paper after paper was torn open glanced through sometimes even re read with a feverish attention and tossed aside sometimes with a sudden deepening of that angry flush sometimes with a movement of the lips as though an interjection formed itself upon them always with a heightening of her excitement until one packet only remained at the bottom of the box mrs romayne snatched it out and then started slightly as she saw that it did not consist as the majority of the others had done of business papers but of letters in a womans handwriting nor was it so old as many of the papers she had looked at some of which had borne dates twenty five years back she opened it with a sudden hardening of her excitement which seemed to mark the change from almost impersonal to intensely personal interest she saw that the date was that of the second year after her marriage that each letter was annotated in her husbands writing and then she began deliberately to read her lips very thin and set her eyes cold and hard she read the letters all through with every comment inscribed on them and by the time she laid the last upon the table her very lips were white with vindictive feeling strangely incongruous on her little conventional face she sat quite still for a moment and then rose abruptly and stood by the window with her back to the table looking out upon the evening sky the strength of feeling died out of her face however in the course of a very few minutes leaving it only very white and rather strange looking as though she had received a series of shocks which had made a mark even on material so difficult to impress as her artificial personality and she turned by and by and contemplated the table littered now with documents of all sorts as though she saw not the actual heaps of papers but something beyond them contemptible and disgusting to her beyond expression then suddenly she moved forward crammed the papers indiscriminately into the despatch box forced down the lid and carried the box out of the room down the stairs towards the sitting room where she had left dennis falconer it was an impulse not wholly consistent with the self reliance of her ordinary manner but that manner had been acquired in a world where shocks and difficulties were more or less disbelieved in face to face with so unconventional a condition of affairs mrs romaynes conventional instincts were necessarily at fault and there being no strong motive power in her to supply their place it was only natural that she should relieve herself by turning to the man on whom the past few days had taught her to rely dennis falconer was not in the sitting room when she opened the door but as she stood in the doorway contemplating the empty room he came down the corridor behind her were you looking for me he said with distant courtesy as he reached her he made a movement to relieve her of the box she carried and as he did so he was struck by her expression is there anything here you wish me to see he said quickly and gravely yes she said she spoke in a dry hard voice about which there was a ring of excitement which made him look at her again and realise vaguely that something was wrong he followed her into the room and she motioned to him to put the box on the table i have been looking them over she said indicating the papers with a gesture and i have brought them to you they are very interesting she laughed a bitter crackling little laugh and the disapproval in ambush in dennis falconers expression developed a little do you wish me to go over them now and with you he enquired stiffly not with me i think thank you she answered the novel excitement about her manner finding expression once more in that harsh laugh one reading is enough but now if you dont mind there are business points on which i may possibly be mistaken she did not look as though she spoke from conviction and i should like you to read them i will go out into the garden it is quite empty always at this time and i want some air her tone and the glance she cast at the despatch box as she spoke made it evident that it was not closeness of material atmosphere alone that had created the necessity i will read them now certainly if you wish it he returned then as she took up a book which lay on a table with a mechanical gesture of acknowledgement he opened the door for her and she went out of the room he came back to the table drew up a chair and opened the despatch box two hours later dennis falconer was still sitting in that same chair his right hand which rested on the table clenched until the knuckles were white his face pale to the very lips beneath its tan in his eyes fixed in a kind of dreadful fascination on the innocent looking piles of papers before him there was a look of shocked almost incredulous horror which seemed to touch all that was narrow and dogmatic about his ordinary expression into something deep and almost solemn the door opened and he started painfully it was only the waiter with preliminary preparations for dinner and recovering himself with an effort falconer rose and slowly almost as though their very touch was repugnant to him began to replace the papers in the box he locked it and then left the room carrying it with him dinner was served and mrs romayne had been waiting some two or three minutes before he reappeared he was still pale and the horror had rather settled down on to his face than left it but it had changed its character somewhat the breadth was gone from it it was as though he had passed through a moment of expansion and insight to contract again to his ordinary limits mrs romayne was standing near the window the excitement had almost entirely subsided from her manner leaving her only harder and more bitter in expression than she had been three hours before she glanced sharply at falconer as he came towards her with a constrained conventional word or two of apology answered him with the words his speech demanded and they sat down to dinner it was a silent meal mrs romayne made two or three remarks on general topics and asked one or two questions as to their journey of the following day and falconer responded as briefly as courtesy allowed on his own account he originated no observation whatever until dinner was over and the final disappearance of the waiter had been succeeded by a total silence mrs romayne was still sitting opposite him one elbow resting on the table her head leaning on her hand as she absently played with some grapes on which her eyes were fixed falconer glanced across at her once or twice evidently with a growing conviction that it was incumbent on him to speak and with a growing uncertainty as to what he should say this latter condition of things helped to make his tone even unusually formal and dogmatic as he said at last sympathy i fear must seem almost a farce she glanced up quickly her eyes very bright and hard sympathy she said drily i dont know that there is any new call for sympathy is there after all things are very much where they were a kind of shock passed across falconers face a materialisation of a mental process what we know now he began stiffly what we knew before was quite enough interrupted mrs romayne when one has arrived violently at the foot of the precipice it is of no particular moment how long one has been living on the precipices edge while nothing was known mr romayne was only on the precipices edge and as no one knew of the precipice it was practically as though none existed directly one thing came out it was all over he was over the edge nothing could make it either better or worse she spoke almost carelessly though very bitterly as though she felt her words to be almost truisms and falconer stared at her for a moment in silence then he said with stern formality as though he were making a deliberate effort to realise her point of view you imply that mr romaynes fall his going over the edge of the precipice if i may adopt your figure consisted in the discovery of his misdeeds do you mean that you think it would have been better if nothing had ever been known mrs romayne raised her eyebrows of course she said amazedly then catching sight of her cousins face she shrugged her shoulders with a little gesture of deprecating concession oh of course i dont mean that mr romayne himself would have been any better if nothing had ever come out she said impatiently the right and wrong and all that kind of thing would have been the same i suppose but i dont see how ruin and suicide improve the position she rose as she spoke and falconer made no answer mrs romayne had touched on the great realities of life the everlasting mystery of the spirit of man with its unfathomable obligations and disabilities had touched on them carelessly patronisingly as all that kind of thing she was as absolutely blind to the depth of their significance as is a man without eyesight to the illimitable spaces of the sky above him to falconer her tone was simply scandalising he did not understand her ignorance he could not touch the pathos of its limitations and the possibilities by which it was surrounded the grim irony of such a tone as used by the ephemeral of the immutable was beyond his ken i have several things to see to upstairs mrs romayne went on after a moments pause i shall go up now and i think if you will excuse me i will not come down again we start so early good night good night he returned stiffly and with a little superior contemptuous smile on her face she went away chapter v dennis falconer had been alone for nearly an hour when his solitude was broken up by the appearance of a waiter who presented him with a card and the information that the gentleman whose name it bore was in the smoking room the name was dr astons and after a moments reflection falconer told the waiter to ask the gentleman to come upstairs falconer had spent that last hour in meditation which had grown steadily deeper and graver it seemed to have carried him beyond the formal and dogmatic attitude of mind with which he had met mrs romayne back to the borders of those larger regions he had touched when he sat looking at william romaynes papers and there was a warmth and gratitude in his reception of dr aston when that gentleman appeared that suggested that he was not so completely sufficient for himself as usual the smoking room is very full i imagine he said as he welcomed the little doctor my cousin has gone to bed and i thought if you didnt mind coming up doctor we should be better off here dr astons answer was characteristically hearty and alert knowing it to be falconers last night at nice he had come round he said just for a farewell word and to arrange if possible for a meeting later on under happier circumstances a quiet chat over a cigar was what he had not hoped for but the thing of all others he would like he settled himself with a genial instinct for comfort in the arm chair falconer pulled round to the window for him accepted a cigar and prepared to light it glancing now and again at the younger mans face with shrewd kindly eyes which had already noticed something unusual in its expression dr aston and dennis falconer had met some six years before in africa under circumstances which had brought out all that was best in the young mans character and dr aston had been warmly attracted by him being a particularly shrewd student of human nature he had taken his measure accurately enough subsequently and knew as certainly as one man may of another where his weak points lay and how time was dealing with them but his kindness for and interest in dennis falconer had never abated perhaps because his insight did not as so much human insight does stop at the weak points dennis falconer for his part regarded dr aston with an affectionate respect which he gave to hardly any other man on earth there was a short silence as the two men lit their cigars and then dr aston with another glance at falconers face broke it with a kindly delicate enquiry after mrs romayne falconer answered it almost absently but with an instinctive stiffening so to speak of his face and voice and there was another pause the doctor was trying the experiment of waiting for a lead he was just deciding that he must make another attempt on his own account when falconer took his cigar from between his lips and said with his eyes fixed on the evening sky im always glad to see you doctor but i never was more glad than to night a sound proceeded from the doctor which might have been described as a grunt if it had been less delicately sympathetic and falconer continued ive been trying to think out a problem and it was one too many for me the origin of evil he was thoroughly in earnest and nothing was further from him than any thought of lightness or flippancy but there was a calm familiarity and matter of course acquaintanceship with his subject about his tone that produced a slight quiver about the corners of the little doctors mouth he did not speak however and the movement with which he took his cigar from between his lips and turned to falconer was merely sympathetic and interested of course i know its an unprofitable subject enough continued falconer almost apologetically we shall never be much the wiser on the subject struggle as we may but still now and then it seems to be forced on one it has been forced on me to day apropos of william romayne suggested dr aston so delicately that the words seemed rather a sympathetic comment than a question yes returned falconer we have been looking through his private papers he paused a moment and then continued as if drawn on almost in spite of himself you knew him by repute i dare say doctor he had one of those strong personalities which get conveyed even by hearsay a clever man striking and dominating universally liked and deferred to yet he must have been as absolutely without principle as this table is without feeling he struck the little table between them with his open hand as he spoke and then as though the expression of his feelings had begotten as is often the case an irresistible desire to relieve himself further he answered dr astons interested ejaculation as if it had been the question the doctor was at once too well bred and too full of tact to put there were no papers connected with this last disgraceful affair of course those as you know i dare say were all seized in london its the mans past life that these private papers throw light on light did i say it was a life of systematic cold blooded villainy for which no colours could be dark enough he had uttered his last sentence involuntarily as it seemed and now he laid down his cigar and turning to dr aston began to speak low and quickly they are papers of all kinds he said letters business documents memoranda of every description and two thirds of them at least have reference to fraud and wrong of one kind or another not one penny that man possessed can have been honestly come by his business was swindling every one of his business transactions was founded on fraud he can have had no faith or honesty of any sort or kind he was living with another woman before he had been married a year all that womans letters he deceived her abominably and its fortunate that she died are annotated and endorsed like his business memoranda evidently kept deliberately as so much stored experience for future use dr aston had listened with a keen alert expression of intent interest his cigar was forgotten and he laid it down now as if impatient of any distraction and leant forward over the table with his shrewd kindly little eyes fixed eagerly on falconer human nature was a hobby of his falconers confidence or more truly perhaps the manner of it had swept away all conventional barriers and the elder man asked two or three quick penetrating questions how far back do these records go he asked finally they cover five and twenty years i should say returned falconer the first note on a successful fraud must have been made when he was about four and twenty why even then when he was a mere boy he must have been entirely without moral sense yes said the doctor with a certain dry briskness of manner which was apt to come to him in moments of excitement that is exactly what he was my boy it was that in conjunction with his powerful brain that made him what you called just now dominating it gave him vantage ground over his fellow men he was as literally without moral sense as a colour blind man is without a sense of colour or a homicidal maniac without a sense of the sanctity of human life an expression of rather horrified and entirely uncomprehending protest spread itself over falconers face romayne was not mad he objected with that incapacity for penetrating beneath the surface which was characteristic of him i never even heard that there was madness in the family you would find it if you looked far enough without a doubt answered the doctor decidedly this is a most interesting subject dennis and its one that its very difficult to look into without upsetting the whole theory of moral responsibility and doing more harm than enough i dont say romayne was mad as the word is usually understood but all you tell me confirms a notion i have had about him ever since this affair came out he was what we call morally insane ill tell you what first put the idea into my head it was the extraordinary obtuseness the extraordinary want of perception of that blunder of his that burst up the whole thing look at it for yourself it was a flaw in his comprehension of moral sense only possible in a man who knew of the quality by hearsay alone he must have been a very remarkable man i wish i had known him i have heard the term moral insanity of course said falconer slowly and distastefully ignoring the doctors last purely sthetic sentence but it has always seemed to me doctor if youll pardon my saying so a very dangerous tampering with things that should be sacred even from science i cannot believe that any man is actually incapable of knowing right from wrong the difficulty is said the doctor drily that the words right and wrong sometimes convey nothing to him as the words red and blue convey nothing to a colour blind man and the endearments of his wife convey nothing to the lunatic who is convinced that she is trying to poison him he paused a moment and then said abruptly are there any children falconer glanced at him and changed colour slightly yes he said slowly one boy the keen shrewd face of the elder man softened suddenly and indescribably under one of those quick sympathetic impulses which were dr astons great charm heaven help his mother he said gently falconer moved quickly and protestingly and there was a touch of something like rebuke in his voice as he said doctor you dont mean to say that you think you believe in heredity i suppose interrupted the doctor quickly well at least you believe in the heredity you cant deny that a child may or rather must inherit not only physical traits and infirmities but mental tendencies likes dislikes aptitudes incapacities or what not be consistent man and acknowledge the sequel though its pleasanter to shut ones eyes to it i admit put the theory of moral insanity out of the question for the moment if you like say that romayne was a pronounced specimen of the common criminal why should not his child inherit his fathers tendency to crime his fathers aptitude for lying and thieving as he might inherit his fathers eyes or his fathers liking for music if he had had a turn that way youre a religious man falconer i know you believe i take it that the sins of the fathers shall be visited on the children how can they be visited more heavily than in their reproduction you mark my words my boy that little child of romaynes unless he inherits strong counter influences from his mother or some far away ancestor will go the way his father has gone and may end as his father has ended there was a slight sound by the door behind the two men as dr aston finished finished with a force and solemnity that carried a painful thrill of conviction even through the not very penetrable outer crust of dogma which enwrapped dennis falconer and the latter turned his head involuntarily the next instant both men had sprung to their feet and were standing dumb and aghast face to face with mrs romayne she was standing with her hand still on the lock of the door as if her attention had been arrested just as she was entering the room she had apparently recoiled for she was pressed now tightly against the door her face was white to the very lips and a vague thought passed through falconer that he had never seen it before it was as though the look in her eyes as she gazed at dr aston had changed it beyond recognition there was a moments dead silence a moment during which dr aston turned from red to white and from white to red again and struggled vainly to find words a moment during which falconer could only stare blankly at that unfamiliar womans face then while the two men were still utterly at a loss mrs romayne seemed gradually to command herself as if with a tremendous effort gradually as he looked at her falconer saw the face with which he was familiar shape itself so to speak upon that other face he did not know he saw her eyes change and harden as if with the effort necessitated by her conventional instinct against a scene he saw the quivering horror of her mouth alter and subside in the hard society smile he knew well only rather stiffer than usual as her face was whiter and then he heard her speak with a little movement of her head in civil recognition of dr astons presence she said to falconer my book is on that table will you give it to me please her voice was quite steady though thin almost mechanically falconer handed her the book she asked for and with another slight inclination of her head before dr aston had recovered his balance sufficiently to speak she was gone the door closed behind her and a low ejaculation broke from the doctor then he drew a long breath and said slowly thats a remarkable woman falconer drew his hand across his forehead as though he were a little dazed i think not he said stupidly not when you know her ah returned the doctor with a shrewd glance at him and you do know her if falconer could have seen mrs romayne an hour later he would have been more than ever convinced of the correctness of his judgement the preparations for departure were nearly concluded she had dismissed her maid and was finishing them herself with her usual quiet deliberation though her face was very pale and set but it might have perplexed him somewhat if he had seen her when everything was done stop short in the middle of the room and lift her hands to her head as though something oppressed her almost more heavily than she could bear end as his father ended she said below her breath ruin and disgrace she turned and crossed the room to where her travelling bag stood and drew from it a letter thrust into a pocket with several others it was the blotted little letter which began my dear mamma and when she returned it to the bag at last her face was once again the face that dennis falconer did not know chapter vi there are two diametrically opposed points of view from which london life is regarded by those who know of it only by hearsay that from which life in the metropolis is contemplated with somewhat awestruck and dubious eyes as necessarily involving a continuous vortex of society and dissipation and that which recognises no so called society life except during the eight or ten weeks of high pressure known as the season both these points of view are essentially false in no place is it possible to lead a more completely hermit like life than in london in no place is it possible to lead a simpler and more hard working life on the other hand that feverish access of stir and movement which makes the months of may and june stand out and focus so to speak the attention of onlookers is only an acceleration and accentuation of the life which is lived in certain strata of the london world for eight or nine months in the year a large proportion of the intellectual work of the world is done in london to be in society is a great assistance to the intellectual worker of to day on his road to material prosperity consequently a large section of society is of necessity in london from october to july and since people must have some occupation even out of the season social life in a somewhat lower key indeed than the pitch of the season but on the same artificial foundations goes on undisturbed gathering about it as any institution will do a crowd of that unattached host of idlers male and female whose movements are dictated solely by their own pleasure or their own weariness it was the march of one of the last of the eighties a wild march wind was taking the most radical liberties with the aristocratic neighbourhood of grosvenor place racing and tearing and shrieking down the chimneys with a total absence of the respect due to wealth if it could have got in at one in particular of the many drawing room windows at which it rushed so vigorously it might have swept round the room and out again with a whoop of amusement for the room contained some twelve ladies of varying ages and demeanours and with perhaps one or two exceptions each lady was talking at the top of her speed which in some cases was very considerable and of her voice which as a rule was penetrating every speaker was apparently addressing the same elderly and placid lady who sat comfortably back in an arm chair and made no attempt to listen to any one perhaps she recognised the futility of such a course the elderly and placid lady was the mistress of the very handsomely and fashionably furnished drawing room and of the house to which it belonged her dress bore traces so near to vanishing point that their actual presence had something a little ludicrous about it of the last lingering stage of widows mourning her name was pomeroy mrs robert pomeroy and she was presiding over the ladies committee for a charity bazaar fashionable charities and their frequent concomitant the fashionable bazaars which have superseded the fashionable private theatricals of some years ago are generally and perhaps uncharitably supposed by a certain class of cynical unfashionables to have their motive power in a feminine love of excitement and desire for conspicuousness perhaps there is another aspect under which they may present themselves namely as a proof that not even a long course of society life can destroy the heaven sent instinct for work even though the circumstances under which it struggles may render it so mere a travesty of the real thing from this point of view and when the promoter of a charitable folly is a middle aged woman who puts into the business an almost painfully earnest enthusiasm which might have been so useful if she had only known more of any life outside her own narrow round the situation is not without its pathos but when as in the present instance a long established self reliant and venerable philanthropic institution is suddenly discovered taken up and patronised by such a woman as the secretary and treasurer of the present committee a woman who would have been empty headed and vociferous in any sphere and who had been moulded by circumstances into a pronounced specimen of a certain type of fashionable woman dashing loud essentially unsympathetic the position in the incongruities and discrepancies involved becomes wholly humorous mrs ralph halse in virtue of her office as secretary and treasurer was sitting at mrs pomeroys right hand her conception as to the duties of her office seemed to be limited to a sense that it behoved her never for a single instant to leave off addressing the chair and this duty she fulfilled with a conscientious energy worthy of the highest praise she had discovered the well known and well to do institution before alluded to about a month earlier such a capital time of year you know when one has nothing to do and can attend to things thoroughly she had explained to her friends she had determined that something must be done as she had rather vaguely phrased it and she had applied herself exuberantly and forthwith to the organisation of a bazaar the season was lent philanthropy was the fashion mrs halses scheme became the pet hobby of the moment and the ladies committee was selected exclusively from among women well known in society the committee was tremendously in earnest nobody could listen to it and doubt that fact for a moment at the same time a listener would have found some difficulty in determining what was the particular point which had evoked such enthusiasm because as has been said the members were all talking at once their eloquence was checked at last not as might have been the case with a cold blooded male committee by a few short and pithy words from the gently smiling president but by the appearance of five oclock tea the torrent of declamatory enthusiasm thereupon subsided quenched in the individual consciousness that took possession of each lady that she was dying for her tea and had really been working like a slave the committee broke up with charming informality into low toned duets and trios even mrs ralph halse ceased to address the chair though she could not cease to express her views on the vital point which had roused the committee to a state bordering on frenzy she turned to her nearest neighbour mrs halse was a tall woman good looking in a well developed highly coloured style and appearing younger than her thirty eight years she was dressed from head to foot in grey and the delicate sobriety of her attire was oddly out of keeping with her florid personality as a matter of fact the hobby which had preceded the present all absorbing idea of the bazaar in her mind mrs halse was a woman of hobbies had been ritualism of an advanced type perhaps some of the fervour with which her latest interest had been embraced was due to a certain sense of flatness in its predecessor but be that as it may her present very fashionable attire represented her idea of lenten mourning i dont see myself how there can be two opinions on the subject she said mrs ralph halse very seldom did see how there could be two opinions on a subject on which her own views were decided fancy dress is a distinct feature and of course there must be more effect and more variety when each woman is dressed as suits her best than when there is any attempt at uniform you agree with me lady bracondale im sure the woman she addressed was of the pronounced elderly aristocratic type tall and thin aquiline nosed and sallow of complexion she seemed to be altogether superior to enthusiasm of any kind and her manner was of that unreal kind of dignity and chilling suavity in which nothing is genuine but its slight touch of condescension fancy dress is a pretty sight she said but it is perhaps a drawback that of course all the stall holders cannot be expected to wear it the words were spoken with an emphasis which plainly conveyed the speakers sense that no such abrogation of dignity could by any possibility be expected of herself what is your opinion mrs pomeroy lady bracondale added turning to the chairwoman of the committee mrs pomeroys attention was not claimed for the moment otherwise than by her serene enjoyment of her cup of tea which she was sipping with the air of a woman who has done and is conscious of having done a hard afternoons work perhaps it is somewhat fatiguing to be talked to by twelve ladies all at once lady bracondales question was one which mrs pomeroy rarely answered however even in her secret heart so she only smiled now and shook her head thoughtfully miscellaneous fancy dress gives so much scope for individual taste dont you think said mrs halse of course it does my dear mrs halse every one can wear what they like and that is very nice answered mrs pomeroy comfortably but on the other hand a quiet uniform can be worn by any one said lady bracondale with explanatory condescension by any one of course so important assented the chairwoman with bland cheerfulness then as mrs halses lips parted to give vent to a flood of eloquence she continued placidly in her gentle contented voice mrs romayne is not here yet i wonder what she will say i met her at the french embassy last night said mrs halse with a slightly aggressive inflection in her voice and she told me she meant to come if she could make time apparently she has not been able to mrs romayne repeated lady bracondale interrogatively i dont think ive met her really one feels quite out of the world there was a fine affectation of sincerity about the words which would however hardly have deceived the most unsophisticated hearer as to the speakers position in society or her own appreciation of it lady bracondale was distinctly a person to be known by anybody wishing to make good a claim to be considered in society and she was loftily conscious of the fact she had only just returned to town from bracondale where she had been spending the last two months romayne she repeated mrs romayne ah yes to be sure the name is familiar to me i thought it was there was a little woman years ago whom we met on the continent her husband dear me now what was it ah yes her husband failed or no of course i recollect he was a swindler of some sort of course one never met her again this mrs romayne is the same ralph says said mrs halse sipping her tea at least her husband was william romayne who was the moving spirit in a big bank swindle and a lot of other things i believe years ago she turned up about two months ago and took a house in chelsea lots of money apparently she has a grown up son he would be grown up of course who is going to the bar but dear me said lady bracondale with freezing stateliness does she propose to go into society it was a most scandalous affair my dear mrs pomeroy as far as i remember a connection of lord bracondales lost some money i recollect and i think the man romayne i mean of course poisoned himself or something we were at nice when it happened he committed suicide there and it was most unpleasant she cant expect one to know her eighteen years had passed since the same woman had expressed herself as eager to make the acquaintance of the man and the haze which had wrapped itself in her mind about the tragedy which had frustrated her desire in that direction was not the only outcome for her of the passing of those years lady bracondale had been lady cloughton eighteen years ago the wife of the eldest son of the earl of bracondale poor and with a somewhat perfunctorily yielded position she and her husband had been moreover a cheery easy tempered pair living chiefly on the continent and getting a good deal of pleasure out of life his fathers death had given to lord cloughton the family title and the family lands and with his accession to wealth importance and responsibilities his wifes whole personality had gradually seemed to become transformed her satisfaction in her new dignities took the form of living rigidly up to what she considered their obligations laxity frivolity of any kind seemed to her to abrogate from the importance of her position she ranged herself on the side of strict decorum and respectability and became more precise than the precisians her husband at the same time developed talents latent in his obscurity and became a prominent politician and the ultra correct and exclusive lady bracondale was now in truth a power in society consequently the tone in which she disposed of the intruder who had ventured unauthorised to obtain recognition during her absence was crushing and conclusive but mrs pomeroys individuality was of too soft a consistency to allow of her being crushed and she replied placidly and with unconscious practicality people do know her dear lady bracondale she said she had some friends among really nice people to begin with and every one has called on her i really dont know how it has happened but it is years and years ago you know and she really is a delightful little woman quite wrapped up in her boy almost before the words were well uttered before lady bracondale could translate into speech the aristocratic disapproval written stiffly on her face the door was flung open and the footman announced mrs romayne chapter vii eighteen years lay between the events which lady bracondale recalled so hazily and the mrs romayne who crossed the threshold of mrs pomeroys drawing room as the footman spoke her name those eighteen years had changed her at once curiously more and curiously less than the years between six and twenty and four and forty usually change a woman she looked at the first glance very little older than she had done eighteen years ago younger indeed than she had looked during those early days of her widowhood such changes as time had made in her appearance seemed mainly due to the immense difference in the styles of dress now obtaining the dainty colouring the cut of her frock the pose of her bonnet the arrangement of her hair with its fluffy curls all seemed to accentuate her prettiness and to bring out the youthfulness which a little woman without strongly marked features may keep for so long the fluffy hair was a red brown now instead of a pale yellow and the change was becoming although it helped greatly though very subtly to alter the character of her face the outline of her features was perhaps a trifle sharper than it had been and there were sundry lines about the mouth and eyes when it was in repose but these were obliterated as a rule by a characteristic to which all the minor changes in her seemed to have more or less direct reference a characteristic which seemed to make the very similarity between the woman of to day and the woman of eighteen years before seem unreal the singular brightness and vivacity of her expression her features were animated eager almost restless her gestures and movements were alert and quick her voice as she spoke to an acquaintance here and there as she moved up mrs pomeroys drawing room was brisk and laughing her dress and demeanour were the dress and demeanour of the day to the subtlest shade she had been a typical woman of the world eighteen years before she was a typical woman of the world now but in the old days the personality of the woman had been dominated by and merged in the type now the type seemed to be penetrated by something from within which was not to be wholly suppressed she came quickly down the long drawing room smiling and nodding as she came and greeted mrs pomeroy with a little exaggerated gesture of despair and apology have you really finished she cried is everything settled how shocking of me then as she shook hands with mrs halse she added with a sweetness of tone which seemed to cover an underlying tendency which was not sweet however we have such a host in our secretary that really one voice more or less makes very little difference well really i dont know that we have settled anything said mrs pomeroy we have talked things over you know it is such a mistake to be in a hurry dont you think so ive not a doubt of it was the answer given with a laugh my dear mrs pomeroy i have been in a hurry for the last six weeks and its a frightful state of things youve had a capital meeting though why i believe i am actually the only defaulter the hard blue eyes were moving rapidly over the room as mrs romayne spoke there was an eager comprehensive glance in them as though the survey taken was in some sense a survey of material or at one instant of a battle ground and it gave a certain unreality to their carelessness the only defaulter yes agreed mrs pomeroy comfortably and now mrs romayne you must let me introduce you to a new member of our committee quite an acquisition why where oh and serenely oblivious of the stony stare with which lady bracondale a few paces off was regarding the opposite wall of the room just over the newcomers bonnet mrs pomeroy with her kind fat hand on mrs romaynes arm approached the exclusive acquisition let me introduce mrs romayne dear lady bracondale she said with unimpaired placidity the stony stare was lowered an inch or two until it was about on a level with mrs romaynes eyebrows and lady bracondale bowed icily but at the same moment mrs romayne held out her hand with a graceful little exclamation of surprise it was not genuine though it sounded so those keen quick blue eyes had seen lady bracondale and recognised her in the course of their owners progress up the room and had observed her withdrawal of herself those two or three paces from mrs pomeroys vicinity and it was as they rested for an instant only on her in their subsequent survey of the room that that subtle change suggestive of a sense of coming battle had come to them they looked full into lady bracondales face now with a smiling ease which was just touched with a suggestion of pleasure in the meeting i hardly know whether we require an introduction said mrs romayne she spoke with cordiality which was just sufficiently careless to be thoroughly good form it is so many years since we met though that perhaps our former acquaintanceship must be considered to have died a natural death i am very pleased that it should have a resurrection she finished with a little light laugh and lady bracondale found almost to her own surprise that they were shaking hands if she had been able to analyse cause and effect which she was not she would have known that it was that carelessness in mrs romaynes manner that influenced her a powerful prompter to a freezing demeanour is withdrawn when the other party is obviously insensible to cold it is really too bad of me to be so late continued mrs romayne proceeding to pass over their past acquaintance as a half forgotten recollection to which they were both indifferent and taking up matters as they stood with the easy unconcern and casual conversationalism of a society woman at least it would be if my time were my own just now but as a matter of fact my sole raison dtre for the moment is the getting ready of our little place for my boy i ought to have shut myself up with carpenters and upholsterers until it was done i assure you i cant even dine out without a guilty feeling that i ought to be seeing after something or other connected with chairs and tables she finished with a laugh about which there was a touch of artificiality as there had been about her tone as she alluded to her boy perhaps the only thoroughly genuine point about her at that moment was a certain intent watchfulness strongly repressed in the eyes with which she met lady bracondales gorgon like stare and something about the spirited pose of her head and the lines of her face always recalling vaguely and indefinitely that idea of single combat lady bracondale however was not a judge of artificiality and mrs romaynes manner with its perfect assurance and careless assumption of a position and a footing in society affected her in spite of herself the stony stare relaxed perceptibly as she said stiffly enough but with condescending interest you are expecting your son in town i am expecting him every day i am delighted to say answered mrs romayne with a little conventional gush of superficial enthusiasm really you have no idea how forlorn i am without him we are quite absurdly devoted to one another as i often tell him stupid fellow but i always think dont you that a man is much better out of the way during the agonies of furnishing so i insisted on his making a little tour while i plunged into the fray he was very anxious to help of course dear fellow but i told him frankly that he would be more hindrance than help and packed him off and made a great baby of myself when he was gone of course i have had to console myself by making our little place as perfect as possible as a surprise for him you know how these things grow one little surprise after another comes into ones head and one excuses oneself for ones extravagance when its for ones boy are you thinking of settling in london enquired lady bracondale she was unbending moment by moment in direct contradiction of her preconceived determination mrs romayne was so bright and so unconscious she ran off her pretty maternal platitudes with such careless confidence that iciness on lady bracondales part would have assumed a futile and even ridiculous appearance yes was the answer we are going to settle down a regular cosy couple it has been our castle in the air all the time his education has been going on he is to read for the bar and i tell him that he will value a holiday more in another year or two poor fellow but im afraid i bore about him frightfully she added with another laugh and it is rather hard on him poor boy for he really is not a bore i think you will like him lady bracondale i remember young men always adored you lady bracondale smiled absolutely smiled and said graciously graciously for her that is to say you must bring him to see me i should like to call upon you if you will give me your card mrs romayne was in the act of complying complying with smiling indifference which was the very perfection of society manner when mrs pomeroy evidently moved solely by the impetus of the excited group of ladies of which she was the serenely smiling centre bore cheerfully down upon them perhaps we ought to vote about the fancy dress before we separate this afternoon she suggested or shall we talk it over a little more at the next meeting perhaps that would be wiser mrs romayne she looked invitingly at mrs romayne as if for her opinion on the subject and the invitation was responded to with that ever ready little laugh oh let us put it off until the next meeting she said i am ashamed to say that i really must run away now but at the next meeting i promise faithfully to be here at the beginning and stay until the very end whereupon it became evident that the greater part of the committee was anxious to postpone the decision on the knotty point in question and was conscious of more or less pressing engagements a general exodus ensued mrs halse alone remaining to expound her views to mrs pomeroy all by herself and in a higher and more conclusive tone than before a neat little coup was waiting for mrs romayne she gave the coachman the order home at first and then paused and told him to go to a famous cigar merchants she got into the carriage with a smiling gesture of farewell to lady bracondale whose brougham passed her at the moment but as she leant back against the cushions the smile died from her lips with singular suddenness it left her face very intent the eyes very bright and hard the lips set and a little compressed the lines about them and about her eyes showed out faintly under this new aspect of her face in spite of the eager satisfaction which was its dominant expression the battle had evidently been fought and won and the victor was ready and braced for the next she got out at the cigar merchants and when she returned to her carriage there was that expression of elation about her which often attends the perpetration of a piece of extravagance but as she was driven through the fading sunlight of the march afternoon towards chelsea her face settled once more into that intent reflection and satisfaction it was a narrow slip of a house at which her coup eventually stopped wedged in among much more imposing looking mansions in the most fashionable part of chelsea but what it lacked in size it made up in brightness and general smartness it had evidently been recently done up with all the latest improvements in paint window boxes and fittings generally and it presented a very attractive appearance indeed mrs romayne let herself in with a latch key and went quickly across the prettily decorated hall into a room at the back of what was evidently the dining room she opened the door and then stood still upon the threshold the light of the setting sun was stealing in at the window the lower half of which was filled in with indian blinds and as it fell in long slanting rays across the silent room it seemed to emphasize and at the same time to soften and beautify an impression of waiting and of expectancy that seemed to emanate from everything that room contained it was furnished it was not large as a compromise between a smoking room and a study and its every item from the bookcases and the writing table to the bronzes on the mantelpiece was in the most approved and latest style and of the very best kind every conceivable detail had evidently been thought out and attended to the room was obviously absolutely complete and perfect only on the writing table something seemed lacking and some brown paper parcels lay there waiting to be unfastened and it had as obviously never been lived in it was like a body without a soul the lingering light stole along the wall touching here and there those unused objects waiting characterless for that strange character which the personality of a man impresses always on the room in which he lives and its last touch fell upon the face of the woman standing in the doorway the artificiality of its expression was standing out in strong relief as if in half conscious half instinctive struggle with something that lay behind something which the aspect of that empty room had developed out of its previous intentness and excitement with a little affected laugh as though some one else had been present or as though affectation were indeed second nature to her mrs romayne went up to the writing table and began to undo the parcels lying there they contained a very handsome set of fittings for a mans writing table and she arranged them in their places clearing away the paper with scrupulous care and with another little laugh what a ridiculous woman she said half aloud with just the intonation she had used in speaking to lady bracondale of her little surprises for her boy and what a spoilt fellow she turned away went out of the room with one backward glance as she closed the door and upstairs to the drawing room she had just entered the room when a thought seemed to strike her how utterly ridiculous she said to herself i quite forgot to notice whether there were any letters she was just crossing the room to ring for a servant when the front door bell rang vigorously and she stopped short with an exclamation of surprise she went to the door and stood there listening that she might prepare herself beforehand for the possible visitor for whom she evidently had no desire how tiresome she said to herself who is it i wonder she heard the parlourmaid go down the hall and open the door mrs romayne at home with a shock and convulsion which only the wildest leap of the heart can produce the listening face in the drawing room doorway with the conventional smile which might momently be called for just quivering on it half in abeyance half in evidence was suddenly transformed every trace of artificiality fell away blotted out utterly before the swift involuntary flash of mother love and longing with which those hard blue eyes those pretty superficial little features were in that instant transfigured the elaborately dressed figure caught at the door post as any homely drudge might have done the woman of the world startled out of or into herself forgot the world its julian the white trembling lips murmured julian as she spoke the word up the stairs two steps at a time there dashed a tall fair haired young man who caught her in his arms with a delighted laugh her own laugh but with a boyish ring of sincerity in it ive taken you by surprise mother he cried youve never opened my telegram chapter viii mrs romayne had been left eighteen years before absolutely penniless when dennis falconer took her back from nice to her uncles home in london she had returned to that house wholly dependent for herself and for her little five year old boy on the generosity she would meet with there fortunately old mr falconer was a rich man there had been a good deal of money in the falconer family and as its representatives decreased in number that money had collected itself in the hands of a few survivors a long nervous illness slight enough in itself but begetting considerable restlessness and irritability had followed on her return to london so natural her tender hearted cousin and uncle had said though as a matter of fact such an illness was anything but natural in such a woman as mrs romayne and anything but consistent with her demeanour during the early days of her widowhood partly by the advice of the doctor partly by reason of the sense unexpressed but shared by all concerned that london was by no means a desirable residence for the widow of william romayne old mr falconer and his daughter left their quiet london home and went abroad with her no definite period was talked of for their return to england and they settled down in a charming little house near the lake of geneva in the same house when julian was seven years old frances falconer died her death was comparatively sudden and the blow broke her fathers heart from that time forward his only close interests in life were mrs romayne and her boy the vague expectation of a return to london at some future time faded out altogether mr falconers only desire was to please his niece and she with the same tendency towards seclusion which had dictated their first choice of a continental home suggested a place near heidelberg here they lived for five years more and then mr falconer also died leaving the bulk of his property to mrs romayne the remainder was to go to dennis falconer to his only other near relation william romaynes little son he left no money so seven years after her husbands death mrs romayne was a rich woman again rich and independent as she had never been before and practically alone in the world with her son in her relations with her son those seven years had brought about a curious alteration or developement the dawnings of this change had been observed by frances falconer during the early months of mrs romaynes widowhood she had spoken to her father with tears in her eyes of her belief that her cousin was turning for consolation to her child blindly attached to her cousin she had never acknowledged her previous easy indifference as a mother she stood by while the first place in little julians easy affections was gradually won away from herself not only without a thought of resentment but without any capacity for the criticism of mrs romaynes demeanour in her new capacity as a devoted mother to her that devotion was the natural and beautiful outcome of the overthrow of her cousins married life to sundry other people the new departure presented other aspects dennis falconer spending a few days at the house near the lake of geneva regarded with eyes of stern distaste what seemed to him the most affected superficial travesty of the maternal sentiment ever exhibited meditating upon the subject by himself he referred mrs romaynes assumption of the character of devoted mother to the innate artificiality of a fashionable woman denied the legitimate outlet of society life he went away marvelling at the blindness of his uncle and cousin and asking himself with heavy disapprobation how long the pose would last time as a matter of fact seemed only to confirm it the half laughing wholly artificial manner with which mrs romayne had alluded to her boy in mrs pomeroys drawing room was the same manner with which in his early school days she had alluded to her little boy only developed by years mr falconers death and her own consequent independence had made no difference in her way of life julians education had been proceeded with on the continent as had been already arranged his mother living always near at hand that they might be together whenever it was possible in his holidays they took little luxurious tours together but into society mrs romayne went not at all until julian was over twenty when the haze of fifteen years had wound itself about the memory of william romayne and his misdeeds of those misdeeds william romaynes son knew nothing the one point of discord between old mr falconer and his niece had been her alleged intention of keeping the truth from him if possible for ever mr falconers death removed the only creature who had a right to protest against her decision when julian as he grew older asked his first questions about his father she told him that he had failed and had died suddenly and begged him not to question her and the boy careless and easy going had taken her at her word with the termination of julians university career it became necessary that some arrangement should be made for his future as julian grew up the topic had come up between the mother and son with increasing frequency introduced as a rule not as might have been expected by the young man whom it most concerned but by mrs romayne from the very first it had been presented to him as a foregone conclusion that the start in life to which he was to look forward was to be made in london london was to be their home and he was to read for the english bar on these premises all mrs romaynes plans and suggestions were grounded and julians was not the nature to carve out the idea of a future for himself in opposition to that presented to him consequently the arrangements of which the bright little house in chelsea was the preliminary outcome were matured with much gaiety and enthusiasm in what mrs romayne called merrily a family council of two and a certain touch of feverish excitement which had pervaded his mothers consideration of the subject moved julian to a carelessly affectionate compunction in that it was presumably for his sake that she had remained so long away from the life she apparently preferred the arrangement by which mrs romayne eventually came to london alone was not part of the original scheme as the time fixed for their departure thither drew nearer that feverish excitement increased upon her strangely it seemed as an expression of the nervous restlessness that possessed her that she finally insisted on his joining some friends who were going for two months to egypt and leaving her to struggle with the agonies of furnishing as she said alone the arrangement had separated the mother and son for the first time within julians memory the fact had perhaps had little practical influence on his enjoyment in the interval but it gave an added fervour to his boyish demonstration of delight in that first moment of meeting as he held her in his vigorous young arms and kissed her again and again to think of my having surprised you after all he cried gleefully at last you ought to have had my telegram this morning why youve got nervous while youve been alone mother youre quite trembling mrs romayne laughed a rather uncertain little laugh she was indeed trembling from head to foot her face was very pale still but as she raised it to her son the strange transfigured look had passed from it utterly and her normal expression had returned to it in all its superficial liveliness brought back by an effort of will conscious or instinctive which was perceptible in the slight stiffness of all the lines at the same moment she seemed to become aware of the close clinging pressure with which her hand had closed upon the arm which held her and she relaxed it in a gesture of playful rebuke and deprecation what would you have bad boy she said lightly dont you know i hate surprises oh i suppose you want to flatter yourself that your poor little mother cant get on without you to take care of her well perhaps she cant very well theres a demoralising confession for you sir but it was not such a confession as her face had been only a few minutes before in fact the spoken words seemed rather to belie that mute witness they were spoken in her ordinary tone and the gesture with which she laid her hand on his arm to draw him into the drawing room was one of her usual pretty affected gestures as sharp a contrast as possible to the first clinging unconscious touch let me look at you she said gaily and make sure that i have got my own bad penny back from africa and not somebody elses she drew him laughingly into the fullest light the fading day afforded and proceeded to inspect him as she said her face full of a superficial vivacity which seemed to be doing battle all the time with something behind something which looked out of her hard bright eyes eager and insistent julian romayne was a tall well made young man taller by a head than the mother smiling up at him he was well developed for his twenty three years slight and athletic looking and carrying himself more gracefully than most young englishmen but except in this particular and in a slight tendency towards the use of more gesture than is common in england his foreign training was in no wise perceptible in his appearance the first impression he made on people who knew them both was that he was exactly like his mother and that his mothers features touched into manliness were a very desirable inheritance for her son for he was distinctly good looking but as a matter of fact only the upper part of his face and his colouring were mrs romaynes he had the fair hair which had been hers eighteen years ago he had her blue eyes and her pale complexion and his nose and the shape of his brow were hers but his mouth was larger and rather fuller lipped than his mothers and the line of the chin and jaw was totally different no strongly marked characteristics either intellectual or moral were to be read in his face his expression was simply bright and good tempered with the good temper which has never been tried and is the result rather of circumstances than of principle that strange something in mrs romaynes face seemed to retreat into the depths from which it had come as she looked at him she finished her inspection with a gay tirade against the coat which he was wearing and julian replied with a boyish laugh i knew youd be down upon it he said i say does it look so very bad ill get a new fit out to morrow two or three in fact mother what an awfully pretty little drawing room what an awfully clever little mother you are he flung his arm round her again with the careless affectionate demonstrativeness which her manner seemed to produce in him and looked round the room with admiring eyes they were the eyes of a young man who knew better than some men twice his age how a room should look and whose appreciation was better worth having than it seemed youre quite ready for me you see he declared delightedly what did you mean i should like to know by wanting to keep me away for another fortnight there was a moments pause before mrs romayne spoke she looked up into his face with a rather strange expression in her eyes and then looked away across the room to where a little pile of accepted invitations lay on her writing table that curious light at once of battle and of triumph was strong upon her face as it had not been yet yes she said at last and there was an unusual ring about her voice i am quite ready for you something more than the furnishing of a house had gone to the preparation of a place in society for the widow and son of william romayne and only the woman who had effected that preparation knew how and how completely it had been achieved a moment later mrs romaynes face had changed again and she was laughing lightly at julians comments as she disengaged herself from his hold and went towards the bell foolish boy she said as she rang im glad you think its nice well have some tea she had just poured him out a cup of tea and quick easy question and answer as to his crossing were passing between them when the front door bell rang and she broke off suddenly in her speech who can that be she said hardly a caller it must be six oclock now i wonder whether if it should be a caller dawson will have the sense to say not at home perhaps i had better she rose as she spoke and moved quickly across the room to the door but she was too late as she opened the drawing room door she heard the street door open below and heard the words at home maam with the softest possible ejaculation of annoyance she closed the door stealthily such a nuisance she said rapidly what a time to call i trust they wont and thereupon her face changed suddenly and completely into her usual society smile as the door opened again and she rose to receive her visitors my dear mrs halse she exclaimed why what a delightful surprise now dont say that you have come to tell me that anything has gone wrong about the bazaar she continued agitatedly dont tell me that miss pomeroy she was shaking hands with her younger visitor as she spoke a girl of apparently about twenty very correctly dressed as pretty as a girl can be with neither colour expression nor startlingly correct features whose eyes are for the most part fastened on the ground she was mrs pomeroys only child she did not deal mrs romayne the blow which the latter appeared to anticipate but reassured her in a neatly constructed sentence uttered in a rather demure but perfectly self possessed voice mrs halse had been prevented for the moment from monopolising the conversation by reason of her keen interest in the good looking young man standing by the fireplace but miss pomeroys words were hardly uttered before she turned excitedly to mrs romayne if she was going to make a mistake the disagreeables of the position would be with her hostess she had decided its your son mrs romayne she cried it must be surely such a wonderful likeness only really i can hardly believe that your son i was ridiculous enough to expect quite a boy oh dont say that he has just arrived and we are interrupting your first tte tte how truly frightful let me tell you this moment what i came for and fly mrs romayne answered her with a suave smile i am going to introduce my boy first if you dont mind she said and then as julian in obedience to her look came forward with the easy alacrity of a young man whose social instincts are of the highly civilised kind she laid her hand on his arm with an artificial air of affectionate pride and continued lightly your first london introduction julian mrs ralph halse miss pomeroy he has only just arrived as you guessed she added in an aside to mrs halse and no doubt he is furiously angry with me for allowing him to be caught with the dust of his journey on him but julians anger was not perceptible in his face or in his manner which was very pleasant and ready even after he had handed tea and cake and subsided into conversation with miss pomeroy mrs halse found it difficult to concentrate herself on the business which had brought her to chelsea her speech to mrs romayne as to the brilliant idea which had struck her just after the committee broke up was as voluble as usual certainly but less connected than it might have been thats all right then such a weight off my mind she said as she copied an address into her note book with a circumstance and importance which would have befitted the settlement of the fate of nations it is so important to get things settled at once dont you think so the moment it occurred to me i saw how important it was that there should not be a moments delay and i said to maud pomeroy let us go at once to mrs romayne and she will give us the address and then dear mrs pomeroy can write the letter to night here mrs halses breath gave out for the moment and she let her eyes which had strayed constantly in the direction of julian and miss pomeroy rest on the young mans good looking well bred face we must have your son among the stewards mrs romayne she said so important now i wonder whether it has occurred to you as it has occurred to me that a man or two just a man or two with an impressive emphasis on the last word as though three men would be altogether beside the mark would be rather an advantage on the ladies committee now what is your opinion mr romayne dont you think you could be very useful to us she turned towards julian as she spoke quite regardless of the fact that miss pomeroys correctly modulated little voice was stopped by her tones and mrs romayne turned towards him also he and miss pomeroy were sitting together on the other side of the room and as her eye fell upon the pair a curious little flash as of an idea or a revelation leaped for an instant into mrs romaynes eye julian moved and transferred his attention to mrs halse with an easy courtesy which was a curiously natural reproduction of his mothers more artificial manner and which was at the same time very young and unassuming he laughed lightly i shall be delighted to be a steward he said or to be useful in any way but the idea of a ladies committee is awe inspiring you would make great fun of us at your horrid clubs no doubt retorted mrs halse oh i know what you young men are but you can be rather useful in these cases sometimes though of course it doesnt do to tell you so she laughed loudly and then rose with a sudden access of haste we must really go she said maud mrs halse had innumerable girl friends all of whom she was wont to address by their christian names maud we are behaving abominably we mustnt stay another moment not another second but they did stay a great many other seconds while mrs halse pressed julian into the service of the bazaar in all sorts and kinds of capacities and managed to find out a great deal about his past life in the process when at last she swooped down upon maud pomeroy metaphorically speaking as though that eminently decorous young lady had been responsible for the delay and carried her off in a very tornado of protestation attended to the front door as in courtesy bound by julian mrs romayne left alone in the drawing room let her face relax suddenly from its responsive brightness into an unmistakeable expression of feminine irritation and dislike horrid woman she said to herself patronises me well she will talk about nothing but julian all this evening wherever she may be and she goes everywhere so perhaps it has been worth while to endure her then as julian appeared again she said gaily my dear boy theyve been here an hour and we shall both be late for dinner be off with you and dress it was a very cosy little dinner that followed mrs romayne as carefully dressed for her son as she could have been for the most critical stranger was also at her brightest and most responsive they talked for the most part of people and their doings society gossip mrs romayne told julian all about mrs halses bazaar deriding the whole affair as an excuse for deriding its promoter but with no realisation of its innate absurdity and giving julian to understand at the same time that it was the thing to be in it an idea which he was evidently quite capable of appreciating dinner over she drew his arm playfully through hers and took him all over the house let me see that you approve she said with a laughing assumption of burlesque suspense the last room into which she took him was the little room at the back of the dining room and as his previous tone of appreciation and pleasure developed into genuine boyish exclamations of delight at the sight of it the instants intense satisfaction in her face struck oddly on her manner you like it my lord she said my disgraceful extravagance is rewarded by your gracious approval then your ridiculous mother is silly enough to be pleased she gave him a little careless touch half shake and half caress and julian threw his arm round her rapturously i should think i did like it he said boyishly i say shant i have to work hard here mother what an awfully jolly smoking table suppose you smoke here now suggested mrs romayne by way of taking possession oh yes ill stay with you she sat down as she spoke in one of the low basket chairs by the fire taking a little hand screen from the mantelpiece as she did so and julian with an exclamation of supreme satisfaction threw himself into a long lounging chair with an air of general proprietorship which sat oddly on his youthful figure and proceeded to select and light a cigar a silence followed rather a long silence julian lay back in his chair and smoked in luxurious contentment mrs romayne sat with her dainty head with its elaborate arrangement of red brown hair resting against a cushion her face half hidden by the shade thrown by the fire screen as she held it up in one slender ringed hand she seemed to be looking straight into the fire as a matter of fact her eyes were fixed on the boyish face beside her she was the first to break silence it is two nearly three months since we were together she said the words might have been the merest comment in themselves but there was something in the bright tone in which they were spoken something half suggestion half invitation which implied a desire to make them the opening of a conversation julian romaynes perceptions however were by no means of the acutest and he detected no undertone so it is he assented with dreamy cheerfulness how long did you spend in cairo the question which came after a pause was evidently another attempt on a new line again it failed didnt i tell you ten days said julian lazily mrs romayne changed her position she leant forward her elbow on her knee her cheek resting on her hand the screen still shading her face the catechism is going to begin she said gaily julians cigar was finished he roused himself and dropped the end into the ash tray by his side as he said with a smile what catechism your catechism sir returned his mother do you suppose i am going to let you off without insisting on a full and particular account of all your doings during the last ten weeks a full and particular account of all my doings he said i say that sounds formidable doesnt it the only thing is youve had it in my letters the fullest and most particular she laughed the fullest and most particular never mind she exclaimed leaning back in her chair again with a restless movement i shall catechise all the same my curiosity knows no limits you see now you are on your honour as a as a spoilt boy understand on my honour as a spoilt boy all right fire away mum he pulled himself up folding his hands with an assumption of good little boy demeanour and laughing into her face she also drew herself up and laughed back at him question one have you lost your heart to any pretty girl in the past ten weeks no mum question two have you flirted much with any girl pretty or plain no mum have you overdrawn your allowance no mum ive got such a jolly generous mother mum have you oh have you any secrets from your mother the question broke from her in a kind of cry but she turned it before it was finished into burlesque and julian burst into a shout of laughter not a solitary secret there will that do she was looking straight into his face her own still in shadow and there was a moments pause almost a breathless pause on her part it seemed then she broke into a laugh that will do capitally she said the catechism is over she rose as she spoke and added a word or two about a note she had to write we may as well go up into the drawing room if you have finished smoking she said it is an invitation from some friends of the pomeroys a dinner by the bye dont you think miss pomeroy a very pretty girl julians response was rather languid but his mother did not press the point she turned away to replace the screen on the mantelpiece and as she did so a thought seemed to strike her oh julian she said did you go to alexandria what about those curtains you were to get me her back was towards julian and she did not notice the instants hesitation which preceded his reply he was putting his cigar case into his pocket and the process seemed to demand all his attention i didnt go to alexandria unfortunately he said lightly the fosters had been there and didnt care to go again the clock struck twelve that night when mrs romayne rose at last from the chair in front of her bedroom fireplace in which she had been sitting for more than an hour the fire had gone out before her eyes unnoticed and she shivered a little as she rose her face was strangely pale and haggard looking and the red brown hair harmonised ill with the anxiety of its look it begins from to night she said to herself it is his mans life that begins from to night chapter ix quite a presentable fellow there was an unusual ring of excitement in mrs romaynes voice it was about ten oclock in the evening and she was standing in the middle of her own drawing room looking up into julians face as he stood before her having just come into the room smiling back at her with a certain touch of excitement about his appearance also he was in evening dress he had evidently bestowed particular pains upon his attire and the flower in his buttonhole was an exceptionally dainty one mrs romayne was also in evening dress and in evening dress of the most elaborate description from the point of view of the fashion of the day her appearance was absolutely perfect no detail from the arrangement of her hair to the point of the silk shoe just visible beneath her skirt had been neglected everything was in good taste and in the height of fashion and the effect of the whole heightened by the background afforded by the quiet little drawing room with its softly shaded lamps was almost startling in its suggestion of luxury and refinement the fashion of the moment was peculiarly becoming to mrs romayne and evening dress with its artificialities and its conventionalities always enhanced her good points strictly conventional as they were with that light of excitement on her face and a certain suggestion about her of verve and vivacity she looked almost charming enough to justify the boyish exclamations of exaggerated admiration into which julian had broken on entering the room there was an eager restless happiness in her eyes which leapt up into almost triumphant life as she gave a little touch to julians buttonhole and then pushed him a step or two further back that she might look at him again and repeated her commendatory words with a laugh then on a little gesture from her he picked up her cloak which lay on a chair near put it carefully about her and opening the door for her followed her downstairs nearly three weeks had elapsed since julians arrival in london and in that time short as it was his expression had changed somewhat there was a quickened interest and alertness about it which detracted from his boyishness inasmuch as it made him look as though life had actually begun for him it would have been wholly untrue to say that any touch of responsibility or ambition had dawned upon his good looking young face but a subtle something had come to it which was perhaps a materialisation of a mental movement which did duty for those emotions in the course of those three weeks he had had several interviews with the man with whom he was to read all the preliminaries of his legal career had been settled and in more than one half laughing talk with his mother on the conclusion of some arrangement the preliminaries had been far outstripped and he had been conducted in triumph to the bench itself but in all these buildings of castles in the air there was a factor in the foundations of his fortunes never allowed by his mother to drop out of sight the main factor it became when she was the architect relegating to a subordinate position even the hard work on which julian was wont to expatiate with enthusiasm and energy sometimes as a means sometimes as an end sometimes as the sum total of all human ambition social success social position were woven into all his schemes for the future as they talked together woven in with no direct statements or precepts but with an insidious insistence and a tacit assumption of their value in the scale of things as a truism in no need of formulation society life had begun for him with the very day after his arrival in town and had moved briskly with him through the following weeks briskly but in a small way easter had intervened and no large entertainments had been given to night was to be as mrs romayne said gaily as she settled her train and her cloak in the brougham into which he had followed her his first public appearance they were on their way to the first smart affair of the coming season a dance to be given at a house in park lane not very large but very desirable at which again on mrs romaynes authority all the right people would be you must dance of course but not all the evening julian his mother said as their drive drew to an end i shall want to introduce you a good deal and dont engage yourself for supper if you can help it im sorry to be so hard upon you she finished with a laugh light as her tone had been throughout then their carriage drew up suddenly and her face in shadow for the moment changed strangely for an instant all the happiness all the excitement and superficiality died out of it quenched in a kind of revelation of heartsick anxiety so utterly out of all proportion with the occasion as to be absolutely ghastly ghastly as only a momentary revelation of the cruel cross purposes and incongruities of life can be the next moment as julian sprang out of the carriage and turned to help her out her expression changed again it took them some time to get up to the drawing room for though the party was by no means a crush they had arrived at the most fashionable moment and the staircase was crowded salutations conveyed by graceful movements of the head passed across an intervening barrier of gay dresses and black coats between mrs romayne and numbers of acquaintances above her or below her on the stairs and as she smiled and bowed she murmured comments to julian names or data criticisms of dress or appearance until at last patience and the continual movement of the stream of which they made part brought them face to face with their hostess the conventional handshake the conventional words of greeting passed between that lady and mrs romayne and then the latter indicated julian with a smiling gesture let me introduce my boy lady arden she said so glad to have the opportunity she spoke with an accentuation of that self conscious self deriding maternal pride which was her usual pose setting as it were her tone for the night and certainly julian as he bowed and then shook the hand lady arden held out to him was a legitimate subject for pride his sense of the importance of the occasion had given to his manner and expression not only that touch of excitement which made him positively handsome but a certain added readiness and assurance by no means presuming and very attractive lady ardens eyes rested on him with obvious approval as she said the few words the situation demanded with unusual graciousness and a sign from her brought one of her daughters to her side she introduced julian to the girl take care of mr romayne ida she said he has only lately come to london find him some nice partners and let me have him back by and by please lady ida laughed mrs romayne as they passed on with the girl into the room there are some friends of his mothers to whom he must spare a little time to night the gay replies with which julian and his guide who after a comprehensive glance at him had shown considerable readiness to do her mothers bidding disappeared in the crowd were lost to mrs romayne her attention was claimed by a man at her elbow may i have a dance mrs romayne he said mrs romayne shook hands and laughed well really i dont know she said i think i must give up dancing from to night ive got a great grown up son here do you know look there he is with lady ida arden nice looking boy isnt he it doesnt seem the right thing for his mother to be dancing about now does it she laughed again a gay little laugh well in the key she had set in her first introduction of julian and the man to whom she spoke protested vigorously it seems to me exactly the right thing he said the idea of your having a grown up son is the preposterous point dont you know come i say mrs romayne dont be so horribly hard hearted but i must introduce him dont you see i must do my duty as a mother lady ida is introducing him she has introduced him to half a dozen of the best girls in the room already the colloquy carried on on either side in the lightest of tones finally ended in mrs romaynes promising a turn by and by and the couple drifted apart mrs romayne to find acquaintances close at hand among the first she met was lady bracondale condescendingly amiable to whom she pointed out julian with laughing self excuse he was dancing now and dancing extremely well i am so absurdly proud of him she said i want to introduce him to you by and by if i can catch him but dancing men are so inconveniently useful some time had worn away and she had repeated the substance of this speech in sundry forms to sundry persons before julian rejoined her she had cast several rather preoccupied glances in his direction when she became aware of him on the opposite side of the room threading his way through the intervening groups in her direction just as she was accosted by a rather distinguished looking elderly man how do you do mrs romayne they tell me that you have a grown up son here and i decline to believe it he spoke in a pleasant refined voice marred however by all the affectation of the day and with a tone about it as of a man absolutely secure of position and used to some amount of homage he was a certain lord garstin a distinguished figure in london society rich well bred and idle he was troubled with no ideals fashionable women with all the weaknesses which he knew quite well were quite as high a type of woman as he thought possible or at least desirable and he had a considerable admiration for mrs romayne as a very highly finished and attractive specimen of the type he preferred she shook hands with him with a laugh and a gathering together of her social resources so to speak which suggested that in her scheme of things he was a power whose suffrage was eminently desirable it is true notwithstanding she said brightly i am the proud possessor of a grown up son lord garstin a very dear boy i assure you we are settling down in london together is it possible was the answer uttered with exaggerated incredulity and what are you going to do with him may i ask he is reading for the bar began mrs romayne and then becoming aware that the subject of her words had by this time reached her side she turned slightly and laid her hand on julians arm with a pretty gesture here he is she said let me introduce him julian this is lord garstin he has been kindly asking me about you julian knew all about lord garstin and his tone and manner as he responded to his mothers words were touched with a deference which made them as his mother said to herself just what they ought to be the elder man looked him over with eyes which as far as their vision extended were as keen as eyes need be a great many of your mothers admirers will find it difficult to realise your existence he said pleasantly though of course we have all heard of you you are going to the bar eh lord garstin had a great following among smart young men and the fact was rather a weakness of his he liked to have young men about him to be admired and imitated by them his manner to julian was characteristic of these tastes free from condescension as superiority can only be when it is absolute and unassailable and full of easy familiarity mrs romayne standing fanning herself between them listened for julians reply with a certain intent suspense beneath her smile lord garstins approval was so important to him the simple unaffected frankness of the answer satisfied her ear and lord garstins expression as he listened to it satisfied her eye and with a laughing comment on julians words she allowed her attention to be drawn away for the moment by an acquaintance who claimed it in passing there was a slight flush of elation on her face when a few moments later the chat between lord garstin and julian being broken off the former moved away with a friendly nod to the young man and a little gesture and smile to herself significant of congratulation come and walk round the room she said gaily slipping her hand through julians arm there are hundreds of people you must be introduced to during the half hour that followed julian was introduced to a large proportion of those people in the room who were best worth knowing mrs romayne seemed to have wasted no time on the acquaintance of mediocrities his presentation to lady bracondale had just been accomplished when mrs halse appeared upon the scene and greeted mrs romayne with stereotyped enthusiasm such a success she said in a loud whisper as julian talked to lady bracondale everybody is quite taken by surprise i dont know why im sure but i dont think any one was prepared for such a charming young man ive been quite in love with him ever since i saw him first you know and we really must have him on the bazaar committee mrs halse had been out of town for easter and the affairs of the bazaar had been somewhat in abeyance in consequence mr romayne she continued seizing upon julian i want to talk to you you really must help me at this juncture the man who had pressed mrs romayne to dance earlier in the evening came up to her and claimed the promise she had made him then she cast a glance of laughing pity at julian intended for his eyes alone and moved away it was too bad mother he declared laughing as he met her a little later coming out of the dancing room now to make up you must have one turn with me just one we havent danced together for ages he was full of eagerness a little flushed with the excitement of the evening and her laughing protestations her ridicule of him for wanting to dance with his mother went for nothing they only let loose on her a torrent of boyish persuasion and finally she hesitated laughed undecidedly and yielded she too was a little flushed and elated as though with triumph one turn then you absurd boy she said and she let him draw her hand through his arm and lead her back into the dancing room they went only half a dozen times round the room in spite of his protestations against stopping but mrs romayne was too excellent a dancer and too striking a figure for those turns to pass unnoticed when she stopped and made him take her flushed and laughing out of the room she was instantly surrounded by a group of men vehemently reproaching her for dancing with her son to the exclusion of so many would be partners and laughingly denouncing julian i couldnt help it she protested gaily yes i know its a ridiculous sight but we are rather ridiculous we two you know come julian take me home this moment let me disappear covered with confusion she went swiftly downstairs as she spoke laughing prettily and a few minutes later julian with a good deal of extraneous and wholly unnecessary assistance was putting her into her carriage the whole evening had gone off admirably mrs romayne said the next morning repeating the dictum with which she had parted from julian at night with less excitement but with undiminished satisfaction during the course of the next three or four weeks that satisfaction a certain genuine and deliberate satisfaction which seemed to underlie the superficial gaiety and brightness of her manner seemed to grow upon her the season had begun early and very gaily and she and julian were in great request it was perhaps as well that little work was expected of the embryo barrister before the winter for he and his mother were out night after night welcomed and made much of wherever they went as so attractive a pair one of whom was steeped to the finger tips in knowledge of her world were sure to be mrs romayne arranged a series of weekly dinner parties in the little house at chelsea which promised to be in a small way one of the features of the season they were very small very select and very cheery no better hostess was to be found in london and there was a touch of sentiment about the relation between the hostess and the pleasant young host which was by no means without charm for the guests mrs halses bazaar too which was affording far more entertainment to its promoters than it seemed at all likely to afford to its supporters served to bring julian into special prominence he was not clever but there is a great deal to be done in connection with a bazaar on which intellect would be thrown away and julian proved himself what mrs halse described effusively as a most useful dear an expression by which she probably meant to convey the fact that he was always ready to toil for the ladies committee without too close an investigation into the end to be attained by the said toiling he was quite an important person at all the meetings connected with the bazaar and the fact gave him a standing with the innumerable smart people concerned which he would otherwise hardly have attained so soon his introduction to lord garstin resulted about a fortnight after it took place in an invitation to a bachelor dinner an invitation to one of lord garstins dinners was in its way about as desirable a thing as a young man in society could receive and the pleased repressed importance on julians face as he came into the drawing room to his mother before he started to keep the engagement was like a faint reflection of the satisfaction with which mrs romaynes expression was transfused youre going she said brightly well i shall be at the ponsonbys by half past eleven and i shall expect you there some time before twelve enjoy yourself sir he kissed her with careless affection and she patted him on the shoulder for a conceited boy as he hoped lightly that she would not find her solitary evening dull she had refused to dine out without him saying laughingly that she should enjoy a holiday and then he went off whistling gaily and arranging his buttonhole it wanted a few minutes only to the dinner hour when he arrived at the club where the dinner was to be given three of his fellow guests were already assembled and to two of these well known young men about town he had already been introduced you know these two fellows i think said lord garstin lightly but turning to the third man loring tells me that you and he have not yet been introduced im delighted to perform the ceremony mr julian romayne mr marston loring julian held out his hand with a frank exclamation of pleasure he had recognised in mr marston loring a young man whom he had seen about incessantly during the past month and who had excited a good deal of secret and boyish admiration in him by reason of a certain assumption of blas cynicism with which an excellent society manner was just sufficiently seasoned to give it character it was conventional character enough but it was not to be expected that julian should understand that im awfully glad to meet you he said pleasantly ive known you by sight for ages and i you was the answer spoken with a slight smile and a touch of cordiality which delighted julian the pleasure is distinctly mutual marston loring was not a good looking young man his features indeed would have been insignificant but for the presence of that spurious air of refinement which life in society usually produces and for something more genuine namely a strength and resolution about the mould of his chin and the set of his thin lips which had won him a reputation for being clever looking among the superficial observers of the social world he was nine and twenty but his face might have been the face of a man twenty years older so entirely destitute was it of any of the gracious possibilities which should characterise early manhood it was pale and lined and worn with very ugly suggestiveness and there were stories told about him whispered and laughed at in many of the houses where he was received which accounted amply for those lines the pose too which it pleased him to adopt was that of elderly superiority to all the illusions and credulities of youth marston loring was a man of whom it was vaguely but universally said that he had got on so well reduced to facts this statement meant primarily that with no particular rights in that direction he had gradually worked his way into a position in society a position the insecurity and unreality of which was known only to himself and secondarily that by dint of influence hard work hard work was also part of his pose and a certain amount of unscrupulousness he was making money at the bar when most men dependent on their profession would have starved at it he had brown eyes dull and curiously shallow looking but very keen and calculating and they were even keener than usual as they gave julian one quick look i think we belong to the same profession he said with easy friendliness you are reading with allardyce are you not a good man allardyce so they tell me answered julian not a little impressed by the critical and experienced tone of the approbation i cant say ive done much with him yet one doesnt do much at this time of year you know loring smiled rather sardonically thats what it is to be a gentleman of independent fortune he said some people have to burn the candle at both ends the five minutes chat which ensued before the arrival of the fifth guest a certain lord hesseltine known only by sight to julian and the announcement of dinner was just enough to create a regret in julians mind when he found that he and his new acquaintance were seated on opposite sides of the table lorings contribution to the general conversation throughout dinner witty cynical and assured completed his conquest and when on the subsequent adjournment of the party to the smoking room loring strolled up to him cigar in hand the prospect of a tte tte was greatly to julians satisfaction what an odd thing it is that we should never have been introduced before he began lighting his own cigar and scanning the other man with youthful admiring eyes it is odd returned loring placidly throwing himself into an arm chair as he spoke and signing an invitation to julian to establish himself in another especially as like every one else ive been an immense admirer of your mother all this year i wonder whether you recognise what a lucky fellow you are romayne julians eyes sparkled with pleasure at the easy familiarity of the address and he crossed his legs with careless self importance as he answered with the lightness of youth i ought to oughtnt i i say i know my mother would be awfully pleased to know you you must let me introduce you to her are you coming on to the ponsonbys to night i shall be only too delighted answered loring watching the smoke from his cigar with his dull brown eyes and answering the first part of julians speech no unfortunately ive got an affair in chelsea to night and another in kensington but we shall meet to morrow night at the bracondales i suppose of course assented julian eagerly that will be capital there was a moments pause broken by loring with a reference to a political opinion formulated by one of the other men at dinner and a talk about politics ensued eager on julians part cynical and effectively reserved on lorings a political discussion when the discussers hold the same political faith has much the same effect in promoting rapid intimacy between men granted a predisposition towards intimacy on either side as a discussion of the reigning fashion in dress has with a certain class of women when lord garstins dinner party began to break up and loring and julian rose to take their departure they parted with a hand clasp which would have befitted an acquaintanceship three months rather than three hours old good night said julian awfully pleased to have met you loring see you to morrow night my mother will be delighted i shall be delighted said loring all right then to morrow night well arrange that look in at the house good night a few minutes talk with lord garstin who had taken a decided fancy to that charming little womans boy and julian was standing on the pavement of st jamess street with that pleasant sense of exhilaration and warmth of heart which is an attendant in youth on the inauguration of a new friendship it was a night in early may and a fine hot day had ended as evening drew on in sultry closeness the clouds had been rolling up steadily though not a breath of air seemed to be stirring now and it was evident that a storm was inevitable before long julian was hot and excited he had only a short distance to go he looked up at the sky and decided the wish being father to the thought that it would hold up for the present and that he would walk he set out up st jamess street and along piccadilly taking the right road by instinct his busy thoughts divided between satisfaction at the idea of belonging to the best club in london introduced thereinto by lord garstin and loring and his gifts and graces he had just turned into berkeley street when a rattling peal of thunder roused him with a start and the next instant the thunder was followed by a perfect deluge of rain it was so sudden and he was so entirely unprepared that his only instinct for the moment was to step back hastily into the shelter of a portico in front of which he was just passing and as he did so he noticed a young woman who must have been following him up the street a young woman in the shabby hat and jacket of a work girl take refuge perforce beneath the same shelter with a shrinking movement which was not undignified though it seemed to imply that she was almost more afraid of him than of the drenching bitter rain then his reasoning powers reasserting themselves in the comparative security of the portico he began to consider what he should do he was within seven minutes walk of his destination but seven minutes walk in such rain as was beating down on the pavement before him would render him wholly unfit to present himself at a party and of course as he said to himself there was not a cab to be seen a blinding flash of lightning cut across his reflections and drove him back a step or two farther into shelter involuntarily and as a terrific peal of thunder followed it instantaneously he glanced almost unconsciously at the sharer of his shelter by jove he said to himself the girl had retreated as he himself had done and was standing close up against the door of the house to which the portico belonged in the extreme corner from that which he himself occupied but except for that tacit acknowledgement of his presence she seemed no longer conscious of it she was looking straight out at the storm her head a little lifted as though to catch a glimpse of the sky and her face outlined by her dark clothes and the dark paint of the door behind her stood out in great distinctness it was rather thin and pale and very tired looking the large brown eyes were heavy and haggard it was not worthy of a second glance at that moment according to any canon of the world in which julian lived and yet it drew from him that exclamation of startled admiration he had never seen anything like it he told himself vaguely apparently the intent gaze of which he himself was hardly conscious affected its object she moved uneasily and turning as if involuntarily met his eyes the next instant she was moving hastily from under the portico when the driver of a hansom cab became aware of julians existence and pulled up suddenly hansom sir he shouted yes answered julian quickly dashing across the drenched pavement a hundred and three berkeley square chapter x all the rooms in the house in chelsea were bright and pretty and by no means the least attractive was the dining room the late breakfast hour fixed by mrs romayne just for the season as she said gave plenty of time for the sun to find its way in at the windows and on the morning following julians dinner with lord garstin the sunshine was dancing on the walls and the soft warm air floating in at the open windows as though the thunderstorm of the previous evening had cleared the air to some purpose the two occupants of the room as they faced one another across the dainty little breakfast table had been laughing and talking after their usual fashion ever since they sat down talking of the party of the night before and of engagements in the future and finally reverting to lord garstins dinner and marston loring of whom julian had already had a great deal to say i have a kind of feeling that he and i are going to be chums mother he said as he carried his coffee cup round the table to her to be refilled i think he took to me rather do you know thats a very surprising thing isnt it returned his mother laughing and you took to him well if you must pick up a chum you couldnt do it under better auspices than lord garstins i took to him no end answered julian eagerly i do hope youll like him i think i am pretty sure to like him said mrs romayne graciously i remember hearing about him some time ago that he was quite one of the rising young men of the day he was to have been introduced to me then i forget why it didnt come off theres your coffee julian took his cup with a word of thanks and turned back to his chair and his mother began again mr loring is a member of the princes i suppose she said the princes was the name of the club at which lord garstins dinner had been given i suppose you will want to be setting up a club in no time sir julian laughed and then replied somewhat eagerly and confidentially as though in unconscious response to a certain invitation in his mothers tone well of course a fellow does want a club mother he said one feels it more and more dont you know of course i should awfully like to belong to the princes and why not responded his mother brightly watching him rather narrowly as she spoke lord garstin would put you up ive no doubt if i asked him julians eyes sparkled it would be first rate he exclaimed mother its awfully jolly of you he paused a moment and then continued tentatively it would be rather expensive you know thats the only thing so i suppose answered his mother laughing oh youre a very expensive luxury altogether however i imagine another hundred a year would do then as he broke into vehement demonstrations of delight and gratitude she added with another laugh which did not seem to ring quite true i dont think you need ever run short of money there was a moments pause as julian the picture of glowing satisfaction finished his breakfast and then mrs romayne rose what are you going to do this morning she said read julian glanced out of the window well he said its an awfully jolly morning isnt it i promised to see after some live stock for miss pomeroys stall puppies and kittens and canary birds rum idea isnt it what are you doing this morning dear it turned out that mrs romayne had nothing particular on her hands beyond a visit to a jeweller in bond street and accepting very easily his substitution of miss pomeroys commission for the legal studies to which he was supposed to devote himself in the mornings she took up his reference to the weather and suggested that they should drive together to execute first his business and then her own it will be rather nice driving this morning she said and we can take a turn in the park certainly there was a certain amount of excuse for those people who had already begun to say that mrs romayne was never happy without her son by her side she spared no pains however to make him happy with her and as they drove along there was probably no brighter or brisker talk than theirs in progress in all london they drove through the west end streets and penetrated in search of miss pomeroys requirements into regions into which mrs romayne had hardly ever penetrated before regions which rather amused her to day in their squalor when julian had done his commission in plenty of time to undo it and do it again before the bazaar came off as he remarked with a laugh they turned back again and went to bond street i have a little private matter to attend to here said julian as he followed his mother into the jewellers shop you just have the kindness to stop at your end of the shop will you please and leave me to mine mrs romayne laughed and shook her head at him it was within a few days of her birthday which was always demonstratively honoured by her son now you are not to be extravagant she said holding up a slender threatening finger with mock severity mind i will not have it i shall descend upon you unawares and keep you in order she let him leave her with another laugh and he disappeared to the other end of the shop while she followed a shopman to a counter near the door just turning away from it she met mrs pomeroy and her daughter now this is really most delightful exclaimed mrs pomeroy if any speech so comfortable and so entirely unexcited may be described as an exclamation it is always charming to see you dear mrs romayne of course but it really is particularly charming this morning isnt it maud thats very nice said mrs romayne brightly turning to maud pomeroy with a smile and pressing the girls hand with an affectionate familiarity developed in her with regard to miss pomeroy by the last few weeks a hardly perceptible touch of additional satisfaction had come to her face as she saw the mother and daughter please tell me why yes of course said mrs pomeroy placidly she sat down as she spoke with that instinct for personal ease under all circumstances which was her ruling characteristic that is just what i want to do my dear mrs romayne it is the bazaar of course it really is a most awkward thing isnt it maud it seems that we have asked twenty one ladies all most important to become stall holders and we cant possibly make room for more than eighteen stalls now what would you ah mr romayne how do you do mrs pomeroy had broken off her tale of woe as placidly as she had begun it and had greeted julian with comfortable cordiality he had come up hastily not becoming aware of his mothers companions until he was close to them this is awfully lucky for me he exclaimed i want a lady desperately for half a minute and my mother wont do miss pomeroy turning eagerly to the demure correct looking figure standing by mrs pomeroys side will you come to the other end of the shop with me for half a minute it would be awfully good of you the words were spoken in a tone of fashionable good fellowship the pseudo good fellowship which passes for the real thing in society which as addressed by julian romayne to miss pomeroy and her mother was one of the results of his work in connection with the bazaar and before miss pomeroy could answer mrs romayne interposed somebody very frequently did interpose when miss pomeroy was addressed no one ever seemed to expect opinions or decisions from her perhaps because she was her mothers daughter perhaps because of her curiously characterless exterior while the fact that she had never been known to controvert a statement in words doubtless accentuated the tendency of her acquaintance to make statements for her it will be awfully good of you mrs romayne said to her now laughing if you are kind enough to help this silly fellow to insist on his remembering that his mother will be very angry indeed if he is extravagant i shall have to give up having a birthday i think then as julian with a gay gesture of repression to his mother waited for miss pomeroys answer with another pleading it would be ever so good of you the girl with a glance at her mother said with a conventional smile with pleasure and walked away by his side mrs pomeroy looked after julian with an approving smile he was a favourite of hers such a nice fellow she murmured amiably and mrs romayne laughed her pretty self conscious laugh so glad you find him so she said oh by the bye dear mrs pomeroy can you tell me anything about a mr marston loring he goes everywhere doesnt he i think i have seen him at your house oh yes returned mrs pomeroy as placidly as ever but with a decision which indicated that she was giving expression to a popular verdict not merely to an opinion of her own he is quite a young man to know very clever and rising i dont know what his people were he has been so successful that it really doesnt signify you know he lives in chambers i dont remember where but it is a very good address has he money asked mrs romayne i really dont know said mrs pomeroy he is doing extremely well at the bar by the way they say and herewith mrs pomeroy lowered her voice and confided to her interlocutor two or three details in connection with marston lorings private life the life which in the world no one is supposed to recognise which might have been considered by no means to his credit they were not details which affected his society character in any way however and mrs romayne only laughed with such slight affectation of reprobation as a woman of the world should show men are all alike i suppose she said with that fashionable indulgence which has probably done as much as anything else towards making men all alike by the bye he was lord dunstans best man wasnt he mrs pomeroy was just confirming to mr marston loring what was evidently a certificate of social merit when julian and miss pomeroy reappeared and mrs romayne with an exclamation at herself as a frightful gossip turned to the shopman who had been waiting her pleasure at a discreet distance and transacted her business we havent settled anything about this trying business of the twenty one stall holders said mrs pomeroy plaintively as she finished now i wonder we were thinking of taking a turn in the park werent we maud mrs pomeroy had a curious little habit of constantly referring to her daughter it would be so kind of you dear mrs romayne if you would send your carriage home and take a turn with us you and mr romayne and i would take you home of course i really am anxious to know what you advise for there seems to be an idea that i am in some way responsible for the awkwardness so absurd you know i am quite sure i have only done as i was told apparently it had not occurred to mrs pomeroy that to do as you are told by four or five different people with totally different ends in view is apt to lead to confusion mrs romayne fell in with the plan proposed after an instants demur with smiling alacrity and the turn in the park that followed was a very gay one miss pomeroy and julian laughed and talked together that is to say julian laughed and talked in the best of good spirits and miss pomeroy put in just the correct words and pretty smiles which were wanted to keep his conversation in full swing mrs romayne and mrs pomeroy facing them disposed of the difficulty in connection with the bazaar after a good deal of irrelevant discussion by saying very often and in a great many words that three more stalls must be got in somewhere a decision which seemed to mrs pomeroy to make everything perfectly right although she had had it elaborately demonstrated to her that such a course was absolutely impossible it was half past one when mrs romayne and julian were put down at their own door and the barouche drove off amid a chorus of light laughter and last words the sunshine the fresh air the movement or something less simple and less physical seemed to have had a most exhilarating effect on mrs romayne her face was almost as radiant in its curiously different fashion as julians was radiant with the unreasoning good spirits of youth such nice people she said lightly i wonder whether lunch is ready im quite starving oh letters taking up three or four which lay on the hall table let us trust they are interesting she turned into the dining room as she spoke sorting the envelopes in her hand one for you your friend von mhler isnt it she said tossing it to julian carelessly one for me an invitation obviously one from mrs ponsonby about her stall i suppose and one from she stopped suddenly the last letter of the pile was contained in a small square envelope and addressed in what was obviously a mans handwriting a good handwriting clear and strong but somewhat cramped and precise mrs william romayne queen anne street chelsea a curious stillness seemed to come over the little alert figure as the pale blue eyes caught sight of the writing and then mrs romayne moved and walked slowly away to the window still with her eyes fixed on the envelope she paused a moment and then she opened it and drew out a sheet of note paper bearing a few lines only in the same small clear hand well mother and what have your correspondents got to say i have had no end of a screed from von mhler nearly ten minutes had passed and mrs romayne started violently she thrust the letter still open in her hand though she was looking fixedly out of the window back into its envelope and turned her face had altered curiously and completely all its colour all the genuine animation which had pervaded it as she came into the room had disappeared it was pale and hard looking and the lines about the mouth and eyes were very visible a dinner invitation from lady ashton she said and a long rigmarole from mrs ponsonby to tell me that she is resigning her stall and why she is doing it poor mrs pomeroy should be grateful to her her tone was an exaggeration of her bright carelessness of ten minutes before forced and unnatural her back was towards the window or even julians boyish eyes might have noticed the stiff unreality of the smile with which she spoke they sat down to lunch together but the strange change which had come to her did not pass away julian did most of the talking though the readiness of her comments and her smiles which left her lips always hard and set and never seemed to touch her eyes prevented his being in the least aware of the fact their afternoon was spent apart but when they met again there was that about her face which made julian say with some surprise are you tired mother they were going to a large dinner party before the very smart at home to which julian and mr loring had referred on the previous evening as an opportunity for meeting and mrs romayne was magnificently dressed there were diamonds round her throat and in her hair and as they flashed and sparkled seeming to lend glow and animation to her face as she laughed at him for a ridiculous boy julian thought carelessly that he must have imagined the drawn look which had struck him though he had only recognised it as tired looking on his mothers face as though his words had startled or even annoyed her she gave neither julian nor any one else any further excuse for taxing her with fatigue throughout the long and rather dull dinner she was vivacity itself her face always smiling her laugh always ready as the evening went on a flush made its appearance on her cheeks as though the mental stimulus under which that gaiety was produced involved a veritable quickening of the pulses and her son when he met her in the hall after she had uncloaked for their second party thought that he had never seen his mother look jollier as he expressed it we must look out for loring he said eagerly oh there he is mother just inside the doorway that clever looking fellow do you see with a yellow buttonhole it was easier to recognise an acquaintance than to approach within speaking distance of him and some time elapsed during which mrs romayne and julian exchanged greetings on all sides and were received by lady bracondale before they found themselves also just inside the doorway mrs romayne had given one quick keen glance in the direction indicated by julian and then had become apparently oblivious of mr marston lorings existence until julian finally exclaimed well met loring awfully pleased to see you mother may i introduce mr marston loring she turned her head then and bent it very graciously holding out her hand with her most charming smile i have known you by sight for a long time mr loring she said i am delighted to make your acquaintance the delight is mine was the response spoken with just that touch of well bred deference which is never so attractive to a woman as when it is exhibited in conjunction with such a personality as lorings it is one for which i have wished for a long time seen the papers to night interposed julian eagerly weve lost nottingham you see he was alluding to a bye election which had led to the political discussion of the evening before and loring nodded i see said loring romayne has told you no doubt he went on turning to mrs romayne that we foregathered to a considerable extent last night over politics and other things the last words were spoken with a glance at the younger man which seemed to ascribe to their acquaintance an altogether more personal and friendly footing than political discussion alone could have afforded it and mrs romayne laughed very graciously yes he has told me she said i am rather thinking of getting a little jealous of you mr loring a few minutes more talk followed talk in which loring bore himself with his usual cynical manner just tempered into even unusual effectiveness and then mrs romayne prepared to move on you must come and see us she said to loring julian will give you the address i am at home on fridays and i hope you will dine with us before long she gave him a pretty nod and an au revoir and turned away hes awfully jolly isnt he mother exclaimed julian as soon as they were out of earshot very good style returned mrs romayne approvingly he is just the kind of man to get on you have a good deal of discrimination sir she added the mother and son were separated after that and about half an hour later mrs romayne caught sight of julian disappearing with a very pretty girl whose face she did not know in the direction of the supper room just as she herself was greeted by lord garstin and pressed to repair thither thanks no she said lightly there is such a crowd and i really dont want anything she paused that accentuated vivacity was still about her as she looked up at lord garstin with a little smile and a gesture which he thought unusually charming i want a little chat with you though very much she said with pretty confidence im going to ask you to give me some advice do you know will it bore you frightfully on the contrary it will delight me was the ready and by no means insincere response mrs romayne made a gracious and grateful movement of her head i would rather take your opinion than that of any other man i know she said confidentially she stopped and laughed slightly its about my boy of course she said i want to know what you think of a club for a young man in his position do you think now that it is a good thing emphatically yes returned lord garstin i consider a good club of the first importance to a young man your young man ought to be a member of the princes he paused a moment looking at her as she nodded her head softly waiting as though for further words of wisdom from him and thought what a delightful little woman she was suppose i talk to him about it he said pleasantly i will see to it with pleasure if you would like it nothing certainly could have been more delightful than mrs romaynes manner as she spoke just the right words of graceful acknowledgement and acceptance then she made a gaily disparaging comment on club life and lord garstins advocacy of it and a few minutes bantering laughing repartee followed that society repartee of which mrs romayne was a mistress from thence she drifted into talk about the party and a complaint of the heat of the room it is time we were going i think she remarked with a gay little laugh but a mother is a miserable slave you see i am left until called for i suppose if i were not absolutely obliged to go myself returned lord garstin i shouldnt encourage such a suggestion on your part but as that is the case unfortunately shall i find your boy first and send him to you mrs romayne shook her head with another laugh i saw him retire to the supper room a little while ago with a very pretty girl she said i make it a point never to hurry him under such circumstances but if you should meet him you might tell him that i am quite ready when he is good night the room was not by any means crowded now it was getting late and a great many people were in the supper room the corner of the room in which mrs romayne was standing happened to be nearly deserted there was no one near her and after lord garstin left her she stood still fanning herself and looking straight before her with her bright smile and animated expression rather stereotyped on her face suddenly as if involuntarily she turned her head she looked across to the other side of the room and met the eyes of a man standing against the wall who had been looking fixedly at her ever since lord garstin joined her for an instant not the slightest perceptible change of expression touched her face only the very absoluteness of its immobility suggested that that immobility was the result of a sudden and tremendous effort of self control then the colour faded slowly from her cheeks and from her lips the smile did not disappear but it gradually assumed a ghastly appearance of being carved in marble her eyes widened slightly and became strangely fixed the man was dennis falconer and he and she were looking at one another across the gulf of eighteen years it was only for a moment then mrs romayne still quite colourless lifted her eyebrows prettily and made a gesture of amazed recognition and falconer moved and came slowly towards her what a surprising thing she exclaimed holding out her hand i had no idea you were here to night how do you do welcome home her tone was perfectly easy and gracious so ultra easy indeed that it deprived her words of any personal or emotional significance whatever and relegated their meeting place with subtle skill to the most conventional of society grounds the rather distinguished looking man with the good reserved manner who stood before her accepted the position with grave readiness thank you he said he spoke with distant courtesy about which there was not even the suggestion of that matter of course friendliness as of distant kinship which had made her reception of him nearly perfect as a work of art it is a great pleasure to me to be in england again you have been away let me see two years said mrs romayne with the vivacious assumption of intelligent interest which the social situation demanded five is it really and you have done wonderful things i hear funnily enough i have been hearing about you only to night i must congratulate you he bent his head with a courteous gesture of thanks you have had my note i hope he said you are settled in london now thomson tells me thomson was the family lawyer and he and dennis falconer himself were mrs romaynes trustees under old mr falconers will oh yes she answered suavely i had it to day just before lunch so nice of you to write to me yes we are settled she had been fanning herself carelessly throughout the short colloquy glancing at falconer or about the room with every appearance of perfect ease but now as her eyes wandered to the other end of the room something seemed to catch her attention she hesitated appeared to forget what she had intended to say tried to recover herself and failed julian had come into the room and was just parting gaily from some one in the doorway dennis falconer did not take up her unfinished sentence he followed the direction of her eyes across the room until his own rested upon julian and then he started slightly and glanced down at the woman by his side mrs romayne laughed a rather high unnatural laugh she faced him with her eyes very hard and bright and her lips smiling and through all the artificiality of her face and manner there was something lurking in those hard bright eyes as she did it something not to be caught or defined which made the movement almost heroic you recognise him she said lightly ridiculously like me isnt he at that moment julian started across the room evidently to come to his mother he came on stopping incessantly to exchange good nights laughing bowing and smiling and as though there were a fascination for them about his gay young figure the man and woman standing together at the other end of the room watched him draw nearer and nearer words continued to come from mrs romayne a pretty inconsequent flow of society chatter but it no more tempered the strange gaze with which her eyes followed her son than did the unheeding silence with which falconer received them as his grave eyes rested also on the young man the whole thing was so incongruous the expression of those two pair of eyes was so utterly out of harmony with their surroundings and with the laughing unconscious boy on whom they were fixed that they seemed to draw him out from the brightly dressed smiling groups through which he passed and isolate him strangely in a weird atmosphere of his own here you are sir cried his mother gaily looking no longer at julian as he stood close to her at last but beyond him lord garstin told me you were ready to go dear said julian pleasantly i hope i havent kept you there was no hurry she answered smiling her voice was a little thin and strained we will go now i think but i want to introduce you first to some one whose name you know this is your cousin dennis falconer chapter xi it was a rather close afternoon in the third week of may fine weather had lasted without a break for more than a fortnight for the last two or three days there had been little or no breeze and the inevitable effect had been produced upon london the streets were a combination of dust which defied the water carts and glare which seemed to radiate alike from the heavy smoky blue sky the houses and the pavements it was only half past three and piccadilly was as yet far from being crowded the pavement was mainly occupied by the working population which hurries to and fro along the london streets from morning to night regardless of fashionable hours and the few representatives of the non working class smartly dressed women and carefully got up and sauntering men stood out with peculiar distinctness but the figure of dennis falconer as he walked westward along the north side of piccadilly was conspicuous not only on these rather unenviable terms at the first glance it would have seemed that the past eighteen years had altered him considerably and altered him always for the better analysed carefully the alteration resolved itself into a very noticeable increase of maturity and of a certain kind of strength and the improvement into the fact that his weak points were of a kind to be far less perceptible as such on a mature than on an immature face his face was thin and very brown there were worn lines about it which told of physical endurance and in the sharper chiselling of the whole the thinness of the nose and the narrowness of the forehead were no longer striking the somewhat self conscious superiority of his younger days had disappeared under the hand of time and a certain sternness which had replaced it seemed to give dignity to his expression the keen steadiness of his eyes had strengthened and indeed it was their expression which helped in a very great degree to make his face so noticeable he no longer wore a beard and the firm square outline of his chin and jaw were visible while his mouth was hidden by a moustache iron grey like his hair he was very well dressed but there was that about the simple conventionality of his attire which suggested that its correctness was rather a concession to exterior demands than the expression of personal weakness more than one of the people who turned their heads to look at him as he walked down piccadilly were familiar with that grave stern face it had been reproduced lately in the pages of all the illustrated papers and people glanced at it with the interest created by the appearance in the flesh of something of a celebrity falconer had done a great deal of good work for the geographical society in the course of the past eighteen years work characterised by no brilliancy or originality of intellectual resource but eminently persevering conscientious and patient during the last year however a chapter of accidents had conspired to invest the expedition of which he was the leader with a touch of romance and excitement with which his personality would never have endued it the achievement in which the expedition had resulted had been hailed in england as a national triumph and dennis falconer found himself one of the lions of the moment but the position especially for a man who believed himself to attach no value whatever to it had been somewhat dearly bought falconer as he walked the london streets on that may afternoon was trying to realise himself as at home in them settled among them perhaps for an indefinite period and the effort brought an added shade of gravity to his face the terrible physical strain of the last six months a strain the severity of which he had hardly realised at the time as he endured from day to day with the simple unimaginative perseverance of a man for whom nerves have no existence had told even upon his iron constitution and a couple of great london doctors had condemned him to a years inactivity at least under penalties too grave to be provoked he turned down sloane street and another quarter of an hour brought him to number twenty two queen anne street he rang was admitted and ushered upstairs into the drawing room the room was empty and falconer walked across it glancing about him with those keen habitually observant eyes of his and on his face there was something of the stiffness and reserve which had characterised his voice a minute earlier as he asked for mrs romayne until the night now nearly a fortnight ago when they had met in lady bracondales drawing room dennis falconer had seen mrs romayne only once since their journey from nice had ended in old mr falconers house that one occasion had been his visit to his uncle so called in his swiss home in the second year of mrs romaynes widowhood he had been in europe several times since then and had always made a point of visiting old mr falconer but on every subsequent occasion it had happened rather strangely as he had thought to himself once or twice that mrs romayne was away from home after old mr falconers death communication between them occurred only at the rarest intervals dennis falconer was mrs romaynes only remaining relation and in this capacity had been left by her uncle one of her trustees but any necessary business was transacted by his fellow trustee old mr falconers lawyer but the clan instinct was very strong in falconer it brought in its wake a whole set of duties and obligations which for most men are non existent and the sense of duty which had been characteristic of him in early manhood had only been more deeply and narrowly engraved by every succeeding year arrived in london and knowing mrs romayne to be settled there he had considered it incumbent on him to call on her and had written the note which she had received nearly a fortnight ago he had written it with much the same expression on his face only a little less pronounced perhaps as rested on it now that he was waiting for mrs romayne in her own drawing room through all the changes brought about by the passing of eighteen years the mental attitude produced in him towards mrs romayne during those weeks of dual solitude at nice had remained almost untouched except inasmuch as its disapproval had been accentuated by everything he had heard of her since it had been vivified and rendered as it were tangible and definite by the short interview at lady bracondales party which had made her a reality instead of a remembrance to him he was standing before a large and very admirable photograph of julian julian at his very best and most attractive contemplating it with a heavy frown when the door behind him opened under a light quick touch and mrs romayne came into the room it is too shocking to have kept you waiting she said so glad to see you i gave myself too much shopping to do and i have had quite a fearful rush her voice and manner were very easy very conventionally cordial and as it seemed to falconer there was not a natural tone or movement about her it was her at home afternoon and she was charmingly dressed in something soft and pale coloured her eyes were very bright and the play of expression on her face was even more vivacious and effective than usual exaggeratedly so even she shook hands and pointed him to a seat sinking into a chair herself with an affectation of hard won victory over the fearful rush the subtle assumption of the most superficial society relation as alone existing between them was as insidious and as indefinable as it had been on their previous meeting and seemed to set the key note of the situation even before she spoke again it is a frightful season she said really horribly busy they say it is to be a short one i am sure i trust it is true if we are any of us to be left alive at the end and everything seems to be crammed into a few weeks dont you think so you are very lucky to have arrived half way through london just now does not seem to be a particularly desirable place certainly answered falconer his manner was very formal and reserved a great contrast to her apparent ease no she said lifting her eyebrows with a smile now that sounds rather ungrateful in you do you know for london finds you a very desirable visitor one hears of you everywhere i am afraid i must confess that i take very little pleasure in going everywhere returned falconer stiffly social life in london seems to me to have altered for the worse in every direction since i last took part in it and yet you go out a great deal with a laugh that sounds a trifle inconsistent i am not sufficiently egotistical to imagine that my individual refusal to countenance it would have any effect upon society answered falconer still more stiffly to tolerate is by no means to approve falconers reasons for the toleration in question the real reasons of which he himself was wholly unconscious would have astonished him not a little if he could have brought himself to realise them in their narrow conventionality fortunately it did not occur to mrs romayne to ask for them with the ready tact of a woman of the world she turned the conversation with a gracefully worded question as to his recent expedition he answered it with the courteous generality only rather more gravely spoken with which he had answered a great many similar questions put to him during the past week by ladies to whom he had been introduced in his capacity of momentary celebrity and she passed on from one point to another with the superficial interest evoked by one of the topics of the hour her exaggerated comments and questions more or less wide of the mark were exhausted at length and a moments pause followed a fact that indicated though falconer did not know it that the preceding conversation had involved some kind of strain on the bright little woman who had kept it up so vivaciously the pause was broken by falconer you have heard he said of poor thomsons illness it would hardly be true to say that mrs romayne started even slightly but a curious kind of flush seemed to pass across her face as she answered both her voice and her manner seemed instinctively to increase and emphasize that distance which she had tacitly set between them it was as though the introduction into the conversation of a name their mutual familiarity with which represented mutual interests and connections had created the instinct in her yes poor man she said carelessly there has been a good deal of illness about this season somehow i am afraid it is a bad business went on falconer with no comprehension of the turn she had given to the conversation and with his mental condemnation of what seemed to him simple heartlessness on her part not wholly absent from his voice there was to be a consultation to day and i shall call this evening to hear the result but i am afraid there is very slender hope how very sad said mrs romayne with polite interest falconer bent his head in grave assent and then with a view to arousing in her shallow nature as it seemed to him some remembrance at least of the usefulness to her of the man whose probable death she contemplated so carelessly he said with formal courtesy thomson has done all the work connected with our joint trusteeship so admirably hitherto that there has been no need for my services but if while he is ill you should find yourself in want of his aid in that capacity i need not say that i am entirely at your command again that curious flush passed across mrs romaynes face leaving it rather pale this time thanks so much she said quickly i really could not think of troubling you ive no doubt i shall be able to hold on until mr thomson is well again thanks immensely you will not be within reach for very long i suppose i shall be in london for a year certainly answered falconer acknowledging her tacit refusal to recognise any claim on him in the formal directness of his reply then as she uttered a sharp little exclamation of surprise he added briefly i am in the doctors hands unfortunately there is something wrong with me they say i am very sorry she began prettily though her eyes were rather hard and preoccupied but at that moment the door opened to admit an influx of visitors and falconer rose to go so glad to have seen you she said as she turned to him after welcoming the new comers you wont have a cup of tea it is always rather crushing when a man refuses ones tea isnt it mrs anson turning as she spoke to a lady sitting close by then as she gave him her hand speaking in a tone which still included the other lady in the conversation she alluded for the first time to julian the whole call had gone by without one of those references to my boy with which all mrs romaynes acquaintances were so familiar that such an omission under the circumstances would have been hardly credible to any one of them im so sorry you have missed my boy she said now with her apologetic laugh im afraid i am absurdly proud of him isnt that so dear mrs anson but he really is a dear fellow he is going to the bar i believe said falconer his face and voice alike were uncompromisingly stern and unbending yes answered julians mother he is not clever dear boy but i hope he may do fairly well good bye shall you be at the gordons to night we are going first to see the american actor they rave about so a funny little domestic party i and my son and my sons new and particular chum good bye mrs romaynes face did not regain its normal colour as she turned her attention to her other callers nor did those faint lines about her mouth and eyes disappear she was particularly charming that afternoon but always as she welcomed one set of visitors or parted from another laughing talking or listening so gaily there was a faint hardly definable air of preoccupation about her she had a great many visitors and the afternoon grew hotter as it wore on when she dressed for dinner that night finding herself strangely nervous irritable with her maid and on edge altogether as she expressed it she was very definite and distinct in her self assurances that such an unusual state of things was owing solely to the heat and those tiresome people rather unnecessarily distinct and explicit it would have seemed since there was apparently no chance of contradiction the acquaintanceship between julian and marston loring had developed during the past fortnight with surprising rapidity they had dined together at the club they had smoked together in lorings chambers and they had met incessantly at dances at homes or dinners on all of which occasions mrs romayne had been uniformly gracious to her sons friend at a garden party a few miles out of london admittedly the greatest failure of the season when loring and the romaynes had walked about together all the afternoon with that carelessness of social obligations which a dull party is apt to engender the scheme for the present evening had been arranged loring adding a preliminary dinner at a restaurant with himself in the capacity of host to mrs romayne and her son to the original suggestion that they should go together to the theatre julian was in high spirits as they drove off to keep their engagement but his mothers responses to his chatter were neither so ready nor so bright as usual he glanced at her once or twice and then said boyishly you look awfully done up mother mrs romayne turned to him quickly her eyes sparkling angrily her whole face looking irritable and annoyed my dear julian she said sharply its a very bad habit to be constantly commenting on peoples appearance especially when your remarks are uncomplimentary you told me i looked tired the other day please dont do it again such an ebullition of temper was an almost unheard of thing with mrs romayne and julian could only stare at her in helpless astonishment not hurt but simply surprised and inclined to be resentful he could not realise as a woman might have done the jarred quivering state of nerves implied in such an outbreak and he simply thought his mother was rather odd when a moment later she stretched out her hand hastily and laid it on his with a quick tight squeeze that was abominably cross dear she said in a voice which shook dont mind i am all right now but she was not all right and though she made a valiant effort to collect her forces and appear so her gaiety throughout dinner was strained and forced lorings quick perception realised instantly that something was wrong with her and his demeanour under the circumstances was significant at once of the work of the past fortnight and of his individual capacity for turning everything to his own ends with a tacit assumption of a certain right to consider her he evinced just such a delicate appreciation of her mood as gave her a sense of rest and soothing without letting her feel for a moment that he found anything wanting in her his pose was always that of a man to whom youth or even early manhood with its follies and inexperiences is a thing of the dim past and he used that pose now to the utmost advantage combining a mental equality with the mother with an actual equality with the son as his contemporary in a manner which made him seem in a very subtle way equally the friend of each he talked of course almost exclusively to mrs romayne never however failing to include julian in the conversation and he so managed the conversation as to take all its trouble on his own shoulders and give mrs romayne little to do but listen and be entertained he succeeded so well that the dinner hour by the time it was over had done the work of many days in advancing his dawning intimacy with mrs romayne she felt better she told herself as they entered the theatre told herself with rather excessive eagerness and satisfaction perhaps because of something within of which the quick nervous movement of her hands as she unfastened her cloak was the outward and visible sign the curtain was just going up as they seated themselves and during the first quarter of an hour the two seats to their left remained empty then mrs romayne whose attention was by no means chained to the stage became aware of the slow and difficult approach of a flow of loudly whispered and apologetic conversation combined with the large person of a lady and a moment or two later she was being fallen over by mrs halse who was followed by a girl and who continued to explain the situation fluently and audibly until a distinct expression of the opinion of the pit caused her to subside temporarily she began to talk again before the applause on the fall of the curtain had died away and her voice reached mrs romayne to whom her remarks were addressed across the girl who was with her and julian who was sitting on his mothers left hand with gradually increasing distinctness so curious that our seats should be together were the first words mrs romayne heard i have just been meeting a connection of yours the explorer you know dennis falconer so fascinating oh by the bye my cousin i dont think she has had the pleasure of being introduced to you though she has met your son miss hilda newton mrs romayne miss hilda newton was a very pretty dark girl of a somewhat pronounced type she had large perceptive black eyes singularly unabashed a charming little turned up nose and a rather large mouth with a good deal of shrewd character about it she was understood to be a country cousin of mrs halses with whom she had been staying for the last three weeks but only a very critical and rather unkind eye could have traced the country cousin in her dress which had a great deal of style and dash about it she acknowledged mrs halses introduction of her with rather excessive self possession and after a casual word or two to mrs romayne addressed herself to julian it was she with whom he had disappeared to supper at lady bracondales at home and they had evidently seen a good deal of one another in the interval mrs romayne had noticed them together more than once and she had taken a dislike to miss newtons pretty independent face and manners in her present mood it was an absolute relief to her to find in the girl a legitimate excuse for irritation and a reason for the fact that mrs halses speech had somehow undone all the work of the early part of the evening and set her nerves on edge afresh detestably bad style she said to herself angrily giving an unheeding ear to mrs halse as she watched miss newton reply with a little twirl of her fan to an eager question of julians just what one would expect in a cousin of that woman then she became aware that that woman was vociferously insisting on changing places with julian and that julian was acceding to the proposition with considerable alacrity and before she had well realised exactly what the change involved mrs halse with much paraphernalia of smelling bottle fan opera glasses and programme was established at her side and julian and miss newton were seated together at the end of the row practically isolated by the stream of mrs halses conversation so horrid to talk across people isnt it said that lady airily though no crowd ever collected would have interfered with her flow of language this is much more comfortable my dear mrs romayne i am simply dying to rave to somebody about your cousin he is your cousin isnt he mr falconer you know what a splendid man of course all the accounts of his work have been most fascinating but the man himself makes it all seem so much more real dont you know now do tell me is he your first cousin and do you remember him when he was quite a little boy and all that sort of thing mrs romayne took up her fan and unfurled it she was looking past mrs halse at julian and miss newton who were looking over the same programme with their heads rather close together her eyebrows were slightly contracted and her eyes very bright and the restless movements of the slender hand that held the fan seemed to be an expression of intense inward irritation oh dear no dennis falconer is not my first cousin by any means she said carelessly though her voice was a trifle sharp third or fourth or something of that kind he is quite a hero isnt he said mrs halse gushingly addressing loring have you met him loring though his glance had every appearance of perfect carelessness was watching mrs romayne intently he had noticed her access of nervous irritability and he was curious as to the cause was it her sons flirtation with miss newton was it dislike to mrs halse or had it any connection with dennis falconer he had his reasons for a study of mrs romaynes idiosyncrasies yes he said i met him the other night a good sort of fellow he seemed hes magnificent said mrs halse enthusiastically we must have him at the bazaar my dear mrs romayne that i am quite determined if he would sell african trophies for us you know a natives tooth or poppy heads oh arrow heads is it well anything of that sort it would be a fortune to us have you seen a great deal of him cousins are so often just like brothers and sisters are they not a low laugh and a toss of her head from miss newton at this moment closed the perusal of the programme and julian turned his attention to perusing the pretty black eyes instead mrs romaynes lips seemed to tighten and whiten and the fingers which held the fan were tightly clenched as she answered in a voice which rang hard in spite of her efforts sometimes they are of course but it depends so much on circumstances dennis falconer and i had not met for years until the other day at that moment the curtain went up leaving mrs halse literally with her mouth open and the instant it fell mrs romayne leant across to miss newton with a comment on the performance spoken in a rather thin tense voice and with eyes that glittered as though the nervous strain under which the speaker was labouring was becoming almost insupportable apparently something in her face repelled the girl for her answer was of the briefest and julian throwing himself into the breach he and miss newton were instantly absorbed in an animated discussion it was a long wait and loring noting every one of the restless movements of the woman by his side as she talked and laughed so sharply understood that to mrs romayne every moment meant nervous torture the instant the green curtain fell on the third act she rose and loring followed her example and wrapped her quickly and deftly in her cloak i cant say i think much of your american prodigy she said to him with a forced laugh i must confess that he has bored me to such an extent that i really cant stand any more boredom and shall go straight home julian she glanced round for him as she spoke but he was escorting mrs halse and her cousin and she was waiting for him in her brougham before he joined her suppose you come to the club with me suggested loring carelessly as julian received his mothers announcement of her intentions rather blankly what do you say to a game of billiards all right responded julian thanks old fellow it was only that i told miss newton we were coming on isnt she a jolly girl mother mrs romayne smiled very pretty indeed she said lightly its a sad pity youre such an ineligible fellow isnt it and loring as the carriage drove off said to himself admiringly what a wonderfully clever woman reaction from a heavy strain even apparently if it is only the strain of combating exhaustion engendered by heat is a terrible thing when mrs romayne got out of her carriage after her long drive her face was haggard and drawn she passed into the house gathered up mechanically and without a glance two letters waiting for her on the hall table told the maid who was waiting for her that she might go to bed and went up into the drawing room there was a low chair by a little table covered with dainty useless paraphernalia which she particularly affected she sat down in it now almost unconsciously as it seemed without even loosening her cloak and with a long low sigh the moments passed and still she sat there a curious grey pallor about her face her eyes gazing straight before her as though they were looking into the future or the past at last as if by a sudden fierce effort of will she roused herself and began to tear open the letters still in her hand as if with a desperate instinct towards occupying her thoughts her eyes fell on the letter by this time open in her hand and she read it almost unconsciously taking in the sense gradually as she read dear cousin hermia i have just heard to my great sorrow of the death of our old friend thomson and i think it right to let you know of it i believe i need not remind you that on any future occasion on which the help of your now unfortunately sole trustee may be necessary you will find me entirely at your service faithfully yours dennis falconer with a sudden fierce gesture of which her small white fingers looked hardly capable mrs romayne crushed the letter in her hand and lifted her head to be thrown upon him she said in a curious breathless tone to have to come into contact close contact personal contact with him chapter xii the season as mrs romayne had told dennis falconer was to be a short one and its proceedings were apparently to be regulated on the old principle of a short life and a merry one gaieties overtook one another in too rapid succession and an unusually sunny and breezy may and june with the inevitable action of such weather on human beings even under the most artificial conditions rendered these gaieties a shade more really gay than usual the atmosphere was not again so close as it had been on the afternoon when dennis falconer called on mrs romayne and it is presumable that the weather must have been responsible for her general unusualness of mood on the evening of that day for if she was not quite herself on the following morning the touch of self compulsion in her brightness was so slight as to be hardly perceptible and a day or two later it had entirely disappeared certainly if constant stir and movement are conducive to good spirits there was nothing wonderful in mrs romaynes satisfaction with life for she had not as she complained laughingly a single moment to herself its a regular treadmill she exclaimed gaily one day to lord garstin i had really forgotten what a terrible thing a london season was it seems to agree with you was the answer there is one lady of my acquaintance and only one who seems to grow younger every day you cant mean me she laughed i assure you i am growing grey with incessantly running after that boy of mine he is as difficult to catch as any lion of the season i never see him except at parties julians intimacy with marston loring had grown apace and it had led to sundry social consequences which were his mother said so good for him little dinners at the club to which he had been duly elected dinners at which he was now guest now host jovial little bachelor suppers made up among the very best sets loring himself was very careful though he knew better than to make his care perceptible except in its results never to allow himself to be placed in the position of a rival to mrs romayne for her sons time and company he lost no opportunity of making himself useful and agreeable to mrs romayne now using pleasantly arrogated rights as julians friend now his superior brain power and knowledge of the world until he gradually assumed the position of friend of the house but club life necessarily created in julian interests apart from his mother interests which she was apparently well content that he should have so long as his ever ready chatter to her on the subject revealed that they were all connected with good sets it was furthermore a season of very pretty dbutantes a large majority of whom elected to look upon mr romayne as such a nice boy and to exact or permit any amount of slavery from him in the matters of fetching and carrying and general attendance youre known to be so profoundly ineligible you see his mother would say to him laughing nobody is in the least afraid of you poor boy and she looked on with perfect calmness as he danced and rode and did church parade looked on with a calmness which might have been mistaken for indifference but for the significant fact that she always knew which of his jolly girls was in the ascendant for the moment miss newton had gone home on the day following the meeting at the theatre falconer was to be seen about throughout the season making his grave concession to the weaknesses of society mrs romayne and julian met him constantly and he was asked to and attended the most formal of the dinners given at queen anne street but the intercourse between him and his connection as mrs romayne called herself was of the most distant and non progressive type julian did not take to him at all he is such a solemn fellow mother he said he seems to think that im doing something wrong all the time an observation to which mrs romayne replied by laughing a rather forced laugh and changing the conversation the last event of the season as it became evident as the weeks ran on would be the bazaar in aid of mrs halses discovery among charities it was perhaps as well that the institution in question was by no means in such urgent need of patronage as might have been argued from mrs halses demeanour towards it earlier in the proceedings for that ladys enthusiasm on the subject had suffered severely in the contest with the numerous other enthusiasms which had succeeded it and the affairs of the bazaar had been pursued by all its supporters with energy which is most charitably to be described as intermittent three separate dates had been fixed for the opening day and after a great deal of money had been spent in printing and advertising each of these in succession had had to be abandoned owing to the singular incompleteness of every fundamental arrangement though as mrs halse observed impatiently after the third postponement there were heaps and heaps of chinese lanterns finally it was announced for the fifth and sixth of july and owing to herculean efforts on the part of half a dozen unfortunate men enlisted in the cause who apparently braced themselves to the task with a desperate sense that if the affair was not somehow or another carried through now by fair means or foul they were doomed to struggle in a tumultuous sea of fashionable feminine futility for the remainder of their miserable lives on the fifth the bazaar was actually opened it was late in the evening of that eventful day and in various fashionable drawing rooms exhausted ladies stretched on sofas were recruiting their forces after their severe labours it had been the fashion for the last week or more among the prospective stall holders to allude to the fatigue before them with resigned and heroic sighs of awful import consequently they were now convinced to a woman that they were in the last stages of exhaustion as a matter of fact it is doubtful whether out of the sensations of all the smart helpers concerned with the exception of the devoted half dozen before mentioned who had retired to various clubs in a state of collapse a decent state of fatigue could have been constructed and the reason for this was threefold in the first place so much money had been spent in announcing the dates when the bazaar did not take place that there was exceedingly little forthcoming to announce the date when it did take place consequently its attractive existence remained almost unknown to the general public and the services of the sellers were in very slight demand in the second place the greater part of the work which could not be done by proxy was left undone and in the third place each lady had been throughout the day so deeply convinced of the frightfully tiring nature of her occupation that she thought it only her duty to save herself whenever that course was open to her which was almost always in the drawing room at chelsea very cool and pretty with its open windows and its plentiful supply of flowers and ferns mrs romayne was lying on the sofa as the exigencies of the moment socially speaking demanded of her in an attitude of graceful weariness an attitude which was rather belied by the alert expression of her contented face she had dined at home just a quiet little dinner you know cold because goodness knows when we shall get it with julian and loring at half past seven the bazaar did not close until nine but all the principal stall holders had thought it their duty to the following day not to wear themselves quite out and had left the last two hours to the care of one or other of the hangers on of whom smart women may usually have a supply if they choose and mrs romaynes quiet little dinner was only one of a score of similar functions very dainty and luxurious in view of the tremendous exertions which had preceded them which were being held in various fashionable parts of london at ten oclock loring had taken his leave declaring sympathetically that mrs romayne must long for perfect quiet after her exertions it was then that mrs romayne had betaken herself to her sofa and her papers what an immense time it is since we have had such a domesticated hour mrs romayne had laid down her literature some moments before and had been lying looking at julian with that curious expression in her eyes which would creep into them now and again when they rested on the good looking young figure and which harmonised so ill with the shallow vivacious prettiness of the rest of her face she spoke however with her usual light laugh at herself and julian laughed too as he threw down his magazine and turned towards her it is an age isnt it he said during the final agony of preparation for the bazaar julian had been in immense request not that he was one of the devoted half dozen or that he did much definite work but he was always ready to discuss any ladys private fad with her for any length of time and to rush all over london about nothing his exertions and the exhaustion engendered thereby had rendered necessary a great deal of recreation at the club he had repaired thither very frequently of late instead of escorting his mother home on the conclusion of their tale of parties for the night it is a comfort to think that it is so nearly over observed mrs romayne carelessly it is never worth while in the world in which mrs romayne moved to express more than half your meaning in words and julian quite understood that she alluded not to the domestic hour but to the season her words were not prompted by any actual weariness of the round of life she characterised as it but the sentiment was in the air the fashionable air that is to say she and julian in common with the greater part of their world were leaving london at the end of the week it has been awfully jolly said julian leaning back in his chair and resting his head against his loosely locked hands i had no idea that life was such a first rate business his mother smiled and there was a strange touch of triumph in her smile it is a first rate business she assented if one lives it among the right people and in the right position i imagine you see by this time that it isnt much use otherwise he laughed as though his appreciation of her words rendered them almost a truism to him and there was a moments silence it was broken by julian it costs a lot of money he said in a casual indefinite way but with a quick glance at his mother well it isnt cheap certainly was the laughing answer but i think we shall manage then noticing something a little deprecating about his pose and expression mrs romayne added with mock reprehension youre not going to ask me to raise your allowance you extravagant boy julian moved and leaning forward clasped his hands round one knee as if the uncomfortable and transitory pose assisted explanation he laughed back at her but he was looking nevertheless somewhat ashamed of himself no its not that exactly he began rather lamely its a splendid allowance mother dear and im no end grateful but the fact is there has been a good deal of card playing lately at the club i dont care for cards you know but one must play a bit and i have been rather a fool look here dear i suppose i suppose you couldnt let me have two hundred could you before we go away you know two hundred julian my dear boy there was a strong tone of surprise and remonstrance in mrs romaynes voice and there was also a very distinct note of annoyance but all these sentiments seemed rather to apply to the demand which was apparently unseasonable than to the desirability of the transaction she was neither startled nor distressed it is young fordyce mother continued her son deprecatingly it was awfully foolish to play with him hes so beastly lucky and you see i must settle it before i go away and have you none of your own demanded his mother with some asperity in her tone julians creditor was a young man who had the reputation of being a very good sort of fellow who would never do in society im awfully sorry to say i havent returned julian meekly there was a moments pause and mrs romayne tapped impatiently on the papers lying by her it is such an inconvenient moment she said at last i have just made all my arrangements for the quarter i dont mean that you cant have it of course you can dear but it is difficult to lay my hand on it at this moment falconer could arrange it for you suggested julian alluding to falconer in his capacity of trustee for the first time as it happened mrs romayne started violently and a sharp exclamation of dissent rose to her lips she stopped it half uttered and paused a moment controlling herself with difficulty no she said at last in rather a hard tone i would rather not do that i will think it over and see what can be done we must raise your allowance sir i cant have mines sprung on me like this she had risen as she spoke and as he followed her example she lifted her face towards him for the good night kiss which always passed between them i will sleep upon it she said good night extravagant boy chapter xiii the stall holders presented a singularly fresh and unworn appearance considering how much they had undergone as they gradually put in an appearance at their stall on the following day and gathered together in little knots to compare notes as to their sufferings and here and there to allude incidentally to their takings which certainly seemed disproportionate to the exertions of which they were the result the fancy dress idea on which mrs halses whole soul had been set in march had been abandoned when mrs halse found a fresh hobby in april and each lady wore that variety of the fashion of the day which seemed most desirable in her eyes all the dresses were very smart and as their wearers moved about visiting one anothers stalls exchanging greetings and inspecting one anothers wares with critical eyes they showed to conspicuous advantage for during the first hour at least the stall holders and their satellites male and female a mere handful of people in the great hall had the entire place with all its decorations to themselves it was the cheap day however and as the afternoon wore on the hall gradually filled with that curious class of person which is always craving for any link however sham with the fashionable world and makes it a point of self respect to attend all public functions in which society chances to be engaged these far off votaries of fashion walked about looking not at the stalls but at the ladies in attendance on them turning away as a rule in stolid silence when invited in mellifluous tones to buy or perhaps investing a shilling when long search had resulted in the discovery of a twopenny article to be had for that sum for the sake of making a purchase from one of the leaders of fashion some of them with a vague notion that it was fashionable to know every one kept up a great show of talk and laughter and were constantly seeing acquaintances on the other side of the hall with whom they never by any chance came in contact but no one spent more than five shillings and the stall holders began to find the position pall i call this deadly said mrs halse subsiding into a chair and looking up pathetically at julian romayne who stood by julian should have been in attendance at the stall next but one where mrs pomeroy and his mother reigned but mrs halse in view of the exertions before her had summoned to her aid about a week before miss hilda newton and miss hilda newton was looking irresistibly bewitching to day in a big yellow hat her spirits also bore the strain of the proceedings better than did those of the other young ladies suppose we pick out some things cheap things with a little grimace and go about among the people and try and sell them she said now adventurously looking up into julians face with her pretty black eyes dancing ive done it heaps of times at bazaars and it always goes well let us try mr romayne mr romayne was by no means loath and a few minutes later his mother whose eyes had been covering mrs halses stall all the time she tried to persuade into a purchase a sharp faced girl whose sole object was a sufficiently prolonged inspection of mrs romaynes dress to enable her to find out how that body was made saw them sally forth together laughing and talking in low confidential tones her lips tightened slightly the reappearance of miss newton had found mrs romaynes dislike to the pretty opinionated self reliant girl as active and apparently unreasoning as it had been on her previous visit what a very good idea she said now suavely turning to mrs pomeroy who sat by a picture of placid content and indicating the adventurous pair as they disappeared among the people we must try something of the sort i think maud dear miss pomeroy had recently become maud to mrs romayne do you see i really think something might be done in that way miss pomeroy who was standing in front of the stall a charming and apparently quite inanimate figure in white assented demurely and mrs romayne looking round for a man caught the eye of loring he came to her instantly youll do capitally she said brightly and miss pomeroy making no objection to the proceeding was started forth with loring the latter carrying a small stock in trade to emulate miss newton and julian that stock in trade was quite untouched however when about a quarter of an hour later they returned to the stall a little hot and discomfited we havent made a success said loring with a rather sardonic smile miss pomeroy says im no good now theres that fellow julian doing a roaring trade julian and miss newton in point of fact were at that moment visible returning to mrs halses stall evidently in high feather all their stock sold out mrs romayne watched julian counting his gains into mrs halses hand saying laughingly to loring as she did so you are not boy enough for this kind of thing im afraid and then julian with a final laughing nod turned away from mrs halse and came hastily towards his mothers stall thats right said mrs romayne gaily ignoring the fact that he had evidently not come to stay i was just wanting you sir to go round with miss pomeroy if she will kindly go with you and get rid of some of our odds and ends julian stopped short and flushed a little im awfully sorry he said ill come back and do it with pleasure but i have just promised to go round again with miss newton i came to see if you could give us some change his mother supplied his wants smilingly and he was gone she had turned away with rather compressed lips when a voice behind her said half hesitatingly half gushingly and with a strong german accent we are surely unmistaken it is yes it must be the much honoured mrs romayne mrs romayne turned quickly and gazed at the speaker obviously unrecognisingly nor did the two figures with whom she was confronted look in the least like acquaintances of hers they were young women of the plainest and most angular german type shabbily dressed according to the canons of middle class german taste she remembers us not gretchen began the younger of the two and then a sudden light of recollection broke over mrs romayne they were two girls who had been training for a musical career at leipsic whom it had been the fashion to patronise they had not developed as had been expected however and she had entirely forgotten their existence frulein schmitz she said now with distant brightness ah of course how stupid of me how do you do they were very loquacious mrs romayne had heard all about their careers all the reasons that had led to their spending a fortnight in london and was beginning to think that the moment had come for getting rid of them when having exhausted themselves in compliments on her appearance they enquired after julian though we have seen mr romayne said the elder since ah but much since we had the pleasure to see his mother it was in alexandria in the winter past we hoped that some concerts there might be possible but there is so much jealousy and favouritism it was in alexandria that we met him he was travelling in egypt he told to us yes said mrs romayne smothering a yawn he was in egypt she stopped suddenly and her eyes seemed to contract strangely where did you say you saw him she said it was in alexandria he was there for the day only and he was to us most kind he arrived in the morning early by the same train and he showed us much until at night he left at alexandria surely at alexandria you must have made a mistake it was some other place mrs romaynes tone was curiously unlike that in which she had conducted the early part of the conversation it was sharp and direct frulein schmitz seemed to notice and resent the change but we have not made a mistake i must assure you she said stiffly it was at alexandria we saw him go away in the train there was a moments pause mrs romayne was looking straight before her with those strangely contracted eyes her lips a thin pale line the sisters waited a moment evidently affronted then finding that mrs romayne took no notice whatever of them they exchanged resentful glances and the elder spoke we will say good bye she said formally it is time that we were going mrs romayne seemed to remember their presence gradually only then she said quickly and in a voice that sounded as though her throat were dry you are going at once right out of the hall at once at once we are going yes was the reply and with a stiff inclination of their heads they moved away mrs romayne followed the two angular forms with her eyes until they reached the entrance and disappeared then she swept a quick glance round the hall julian was at the further end deeply absorbed in his proceedings with miss newton the frulein schmitz had evidently been unseen by him his mother looked at him for a moment with a strange fixed gaze and then she turned her eyes away mechanically and moved her mouth with a little twitch as though she felt the muscles stiffening and knew that they must not take the lines they would there was a deadly pallor about her mouth at that instant loring came up to her with a witty satirical comment on the scene at which she was apparently gazing and for the next few minutes she stood there exchanging gay little observations with him the pallor never altering her eyes never moving then quite suddenly she turned towards him i want some tea she said take me to the refreshment place mr loring julian was threading his way to where she stood and though she turned instantly in the direction of the refreshment stall followed perforce by loring she passed close to him he stopped and said something but she only nodded to him and went rapidly on a great many other stall holders were recruiting themselves with tea and ices and they were all more or less in spirits real or affected at the approaching prospect of the end of their labours mrs romayne was instantly hailed as one of a very smart group and took her place with eager high pitched gaiety she did not go back to her stall tea being over but moved about the bazaar always with a little party in attendance laughing and talking she and julian were dining with a large party of stall holders at mrs pomeroys they were all to repair thither direct from the bazaar and mrs romayne took a detachment in her carriage only one instant of solitude came to her before the luxurious hilarious meal only one instant when the stream of descending ladies left her behind on an upper landing in that instant as if involuntarily and unconsciously to herself the gaiety fell from her face like a mask leaving it haggard and ghastly she put her hand it was icy cold up to her head he told me a lie she said to herself a lie oh my boy she was very bright and witty as she and julian drove home together and the greyish whiteness which was stealing over her face was unnoticed by her sons careless eyes even when they stood in the well lighted hall are you going straight up mother he said if so ill say good night i want a cigar she paused a moment and looked at him with that indescribable tenderness which haunted her eyes at times as they rested on him intensified a thousandfold ill come and sit with you for a little while if you will have me she said she tried evidently for her usual manner and succeeded inasmuch as julian noticed nothing beyond but beneath the surface there was something not wholly to be suppressed something which looked out of her eyes trembled in her voice lingered in her touch as she laid her hand on his arm something which taken in conjunction with the shreds of affectation with which she strove to cover it and with the boys profound unconsciousness was as pathetic as it was beautiful and strange she drew him into his own little room and then with a forced laugh at herself she pushed him gently into a chair and insisted on waiting upon him bringing him cigar matches ash tray anything she could think of to add to his comfort laughing all the time at him and at herself and hugging those shreds of affectation close but there was that about her if there had been any one to see and understand which made her one with all the many mothers since the world began who with their hearts aching and bleeding with impotent pity and love have tried to find some outlet for their yearning in the strange instinct for service which goes always hand in hand with mother love as with no other love on earth she lit his match at last and then knelt down beside his chair my dearest she said my dearest you shall have that two hundred to morrow if you like you did not think me vexed about it did you you know i only want you to be happy julian dont you julian laid down his cigar with a merry laugh i should be a fool if i didnt he answered patting her hand with boyish affection its awfully good of you dear and im frightfully grateful i wont make such a fool of myself again mrs romayne put up her hand quickly dont promise julian she said in a strange breathless way you might you might forget you know and then perhaps you wouldnt like to tell me and i want to know i always want to know she stopped abruptly an almost agonised appeal in her eyes she was still kneeling at his side with her eyes fixed on his face and suddenly abruptly almost as though the words forced themselves from her against her will she said with a slight catch in her voice julian i met frulein schmitz to day he met her eyes for a moment his own questioning and uncomprehending then gradually there stole over his face recollection vague at first which became as it grew definite rather shamefaced rather annoyed and rather amused oh he said his tone was light and daring enough though a touch of genuine shame and embarrassment lurked in it oh i call that hard lines he was smiling daringly into her face with an acceptance of the situation that was perfectly frank his mothers hands as they rested on the arm of his chair were tightly wrung together and her eyes never stirred from his face why she said rather hoarsely why did you he laughed shrugging his shoulders and throwing out his hands with a graceful foreign movement i was rather a culprit you see he said i only spent those few hours in alexandria and i never gave a thought to your commission and i felt such a brute about it that i wasnt up to confessing it was the truth and the whole truth and it conveyed itself as such mrs romayne knelt there for a moment more looking into his eyes her own wide and strained and then she rose heavily and slowly to her feet there was a pause the silence was broken by julian evidently with a view to changing a subject on which he could hardly be said to show to conspicuous advantage youre going to write to falconer i suppose you wouldnt like to do it to night dear would you he would get the letter in better time if it was posted the first thing you could do it at my table there mrs romayne did not speak julian could not see her face yes she said at last and her voice sounded rather hollow and far away i will do it to night if you like she bent down and kissed him good night she said wont you write here said julian in some surprise no ill go upstairs she answered and went out of the room she went upstairs moving slowly and heavily straight to her dainty little writing table and sat down drawing out a sheet of paper she wrote the conventional words of address to dennis falconer and then she stopped suddenly and lifted her face it was ghastly the eyes sunken and dim seemed to be confronting the very irony of fate chapter xiv the jolliest week ive ever had in my life i wonder how often youve said that before august had come and gone the greater part of september had followed in its wake and a ruddy september sun was making the end of the summer glorious in the large garden of a large country house in norfolk everything seen in its wonderful radiance seemed to be even overcharged with colour if such a thing is possible with nature it was as though all the beauty of the summer had been intensified and arrested in its maturity into one final glow the rich green of the smooth lawns the colours of the autumnal flowers the tints of the foliage the very atmosphere seemed all alike to be pausing for the moment at the most perfect point of radiance but nature never pauses and that this was indeed the final glow the end of her summer beauty was revealed here and there by little significant touches or written across earth and sky in broader letters the birds were gone or going even as julian romayne spoke a flight of swallows overhead was wheeling and darting hither and thither in preparation for an imminent departure the very glory of the trees meant decay and in spite of all the efforts of indefatigable gardeners dead leaves strewed the trim lawns and gravel paths all these signs and tokens of the approach of the inevitable end were particularly conspicuous about the narrow grass path shut in by high yew hedges up and down which julian romayne and hilda newton were sauntering together fallen leaves were thick upon it and in the flower beds by which it was bordered the summer flowers whose day was long since done had not been replaced by their autumn successors apparently the walk was a secluded and little frequented one on which it was not worth while to spend much pains judging from the coquettish toss of the head tempered by a certain softness of tone with which miss newton replied to the insinuated regret of julians words it seemed not improbable that those characteristics had something to do with their selection of that particular spot for their stroll they had been staying in this pleasant country house together for the last week the hostess having taken a fancy to mrs halses cousin in town and now in another hour julian and his mother would be on their way home as the half mocking half inviting words fell from his companions lips julian turned impetuously towards the pretty piquant face it was shaded by a bewitching garden hat i never meant it so much before on my honour he said impulsively adding with a boyish suggestion of tender reproach in his voice i should have thought you might have known that its awfully hard lines to think its over miss newton had a large crimson dahlia in her hand and she was plucking the petals slowly away and scattering them at her feet is it she said you know it is he returned ardently trying to catch a glimpse of the dark face bent over the crimson flower wont you tell me that youre a little sorry too miss newton hilda his vigorous young hand was just closing over the pretty little fingers that held the dahlia the dainty little figure was yielding to him nothing loath it seemed when from the further end of the grass walk a third voice broke in upon their tte tte and as they started instinctively apart mrs romayne accompanied by their hostess came sauntering towards them taking a farewell look at the quaint old walk julian she said with suave carelessness as she drew near them the garden is looking too beautiful this morning isnt it miss newton what a lovely dahlia that is you were showing julian she looked smilingly at miss newton as she spoke apparently quite unconscious that the girls face was white not with embarrassment disappointment or emotion but with sheer angry resentment and she moved on as she spoke tacitly compelling miss newton to move on at her side while julian and the other lady followed perforce together we have only about ten minutes more im afraid she said i was just taking a last stroll round the place with mrs ponsonby im afraid we shall find london rather unbearable to night the call of duty is always so very inconvenient she was leading the way toward the house and her little high pitched laugh eliciting only a monosyllabic response from the girl at her side she resumed what was practically a monologue carried on with a suavity and ease which was perhaps over elaborated by just a touch her farewells which followed almost immediately on their arrival at the house when a little bustle of departure ensued in which miss newton took no part that young lady having promptly disappeared were characterised by the same manner about which there was also a little touch of suppressed excitement it was not until she and julian were alone together in a first class carriage of the london express that her gay words and laughs ceased and she let herself sink back in her corner unfolding a newspaper with a short hardly audible sigh of relief a very slight and indefinable change had come to mrs romaynes face in the course of the last two months it had been perceptible in her animation and was still more perceptible in her repose the lines about her face which had needed special influences to bring them into prominence during the winter were always plainly perceptible now and they gave her face a very slightly careworn look which was emphasized by the expression of her eyes and mouth the eyes had always a slightly restless look in them in these days even now as she read her paper or appeared to read it there was no concentration in them and every now and then they were lifted hastily almost furtively over the papers edge the mouth was at once weaker and more determined weaker inasmuch as it had grown more sensitive more nervously responsive to the movements of her restless eyes and more determined as though with the expression of a constant mental attitude there was a good deal of indecision in her face and its expression varied slightly but incessantly as she fixed her eyes anew on the printed words before her after each fleeting glance at the boyish face outlined by the cushions opposite she laid down her paper at last with a little deliberate rustle apparently intended to attract attention and as she did so her face assumed its ordinary superficial vivacity an expression which harmonised less well with the rather sharpened features than it had done three months before a good novel julian she said airily smothering a yawn as she spoke and indicating with a little gesture of her head the book in julians hand julian had been holding the book in his hand ever since they left the little norfolk station from which they had started but he had scarcely turned a page his features were composed into an expression of boyish resentment about which there was that distinct suggestion of sullenness which is the usual outward expression of the hauteur of youth as his mother spoke he flushed hotly with angry self consciousness not particularly he said without lifting his eyes there was a moments pause during which mrs romaynes eyes were fixed upon him with concentration enough in them now and then she broke into a light laugh and leaning suddenly forward laid one of her hands on his poor old boy she said in a tone half mocking half sympathising it was very hard on you wasnt it its a cruel fate that makes young men so ineligible and girls so pretty and throws the two perversely together if youve any thought to spare from yourself sir though i think you should bestow a little gratitude upon me for my very timely arrival she laughed again and in her laugh as in her voice there was the faintest possible touch of reality and that reality was anxiety then as julian twisted his hand from under hers with a gruff and almost inaudible i dont see that she leant back in her seat again with a smile my dear boy she said gaily its a very sad position for you i admit but for the present youre dependent on your mother not such a very stingy mother eh sir i think youll find it will be all right for you when the right young woman turns up as no doubt she will some day perhaps youll find that your mother wont abdicate so very ungracefully but you see it must be the right young woman in spite of the laugh in it there was a ring in the tone in which the words were spoken which was full of significance and the significance and the laughter seemed to be doing battle together as mrs romayne went on ignoring julians interjection i dont think you would have found it a very pleasant situation to be engaged to miss newton with the prospect before you of keeping her waiting until you had made your fortune at the bar and im sorry to say i dont share your conviction of the moment that she is the right young woman she is very pretty i allow and a very nice girl no doubt mrs romaynes voice grew a little hard as she said the last words but shes not at all the sort of girl that i should like you to marry she has no money in the first place i have enough for both said julian impetuously and then stopped short and coloured crimson his mother broke into a merry laugh no poor boy she said i have enough for both thats just what i want you to remember in your intercourse with pretty girls after all you know the position has its advantages you may flirt as much as you like while youre known to be dependent on your mother and no one will take you too seriously julian did not echo her laugh nor did he make any comment on her words he sat with his face turned away from her and a rather strange expression in his eyes an expression which was at once unformed and mutinous his mother could not see it but the outline of his profile apparently disturbed her the anxiety in her face deepened again mixed this time with an expression of doubt and self distrust as though to emphasize the lightness of her preceding tone she turned the conversation into a comment on the landscape and took up her paper again the remainder of the journey passed in total silence and the drive home from the station was silent too an arrival in london at the end of september is not a very pleasant proceeding unless it is approached with considerable industry determination and a large stock of energy the butterflies of society and indeed a large proportion of the bees have not yet returned those who have returned have done so under stern compulsion to begin the winters work and there is a general all pervading sentiment as of the end of holidays and the beginning of term time the day that had been so radiantly lovely in norfolk had evidently been oppressively hot and airless in town and the general air of exhaustion and squalor which such circumstances are apt to produce in london did not help to render its appearance more attractive number twenty two queen anne street chelsea itself seemed to be touched by the general depression the summer flowers in the window boxes had been taken away and their successors were apparently waiting for orders from the mistress of the house and as mrs romayne and julian entered the hall there was that indefinable atmosphere about the house which two months abandonment to even the best of servants is apt to produce an atmosphere which is the reverse of cheerful there were letters lying on the hall table one of which mrs romayne handed to julian with the comment from mr allardyce isnt it julian will he be ready for you to morrow julians legal studies were in fact to begin in earnest on the following day and when the next morning he said good bye to his mother and set out for the temple she followed him to the door with a laughing good speed that at least was her ostensible motive but there was something in her face as she laid her hand on his arm as he turned away on the doorstep which suggested that the last words she said to him were those that she had really followed him to say what time shall you be back julian and as he answered carelessly i cant tell not till dinner time i expect there came into her eyes a curious shadow of yearning anxiety take care of yourself sir she said lightly and went back into the house that shadow lived in her eyes all day as she went about giving orders and putting things to rights as she said striving in fact with a concealed earnestness which seemed somewhat disproportionate to its object to give the house that peculiar air of brightness which had been so characteristic of it and which somehow did not seem so easily to be obtained as formerly her face was gaiety itself however when she stood in the drawing room as the dinner bell rang very daintily dressed in a tea gown which julian had admired waiting for her son a moment elapsed and julian dashed downstairs breathless and apologetic but rather sparing of his words his first days work hardly seemed to have dissipated the cloud which had hung about him that morning at breakfast and as his mother slipped her hand playfully into his arm with a laughing word or two of forgiveness he turned and led her out of the room without the response which would have been natural to him have you had a pleasant day said mrs romayne lightly as they sat down to dinner pretty well returned julian indifferently he said no more and mrs romayne with one of her quick half furtive glances at him began to talk of her own day she had paid some calls in the afternoon and had a great deal of news for him as to who had and who had not returned to town and a great deal of gossip which was both amusing in itself and rendered more amusing by the piquant animation with which she retailed it it failed to rouse much interest in julian apparently however and after a time his mother returned to her original topic again with a quick anxious glance at his face did you find mr allardyce easy to work with she enquired interestedly this time yes i suppose so was the unresponsive response how long did he keep you i got away at four oclock something seemed to leap in mrs romaynes eyes to be instantly suppressed as she said with an indifference which any ear keener than julians might have detected to be forced four oclock and what have you been doing since then may i ask you did not come in till a quarter past seven perhaps julian felt the inquisition in the question though he was conscious of nothing unusual in his mothers voice for he answered rather briefly i went to the garrick with a fellow what fellow demanded his mother in the same tone julian moved impatiently theres another fellow reading with allardyce he answered griffiths he took me in as though the suppressed impatience of his tone had not escaped her mrs romayne found herself reminded at this point of something she had heard that afternoon during one of her visits and she proceeded to place her little piece of news before julian with every advantage that narration could give it though her face looked rather thin and sharp as she talked dinner was over by this time and as she finished with a laugh she rose from her seat and put her hand on julians arm his face was somewhat bored and dissatisfied as though his mothers effort for his entertainment entirely failed to compensate him for the merry house parties of the last month i think i shall have to come and keep you company while you smoke your cigar she said lightly adding with an assumption of a sudden thought on the subject which was not wholly successful by the bye the garrick club must be a most attractive spot if you stayed there from four oclock till seven julian took a quick step forward the movement might have been due to his desire to open the door for her or it might have been an expression of the irritation of which his face was full i didnt get there at four he said i really dont know what time it was but it must have been nearly five and i walked home so i left somewhere about half past six the irritation was in his voice as well as in his face and his mother patted him gaily on the shoulder with her most artificially self deriding laugh hes quite annoyed at being asked so many questions she exclaimed its a dreadful nuisance to have such a silly old mother isnt it but you havent told me what mr griffiths is like yet julian had tried to laugh in answer to her first words but the sound produced had been almost as greatly wanting in reality as had been the ease of his mothers tone and he answered now with undisguised impatience like oh hes like any other fellow mother nothing particular one way or the other he paused a moment and then added hastily i was rather thinking of running down to the club this evening dear if you wouldnt mind being alone i want to hear whether loring has come back theres just a chance he might be there you know he had said that morning that there was no likelihood of lorings returning for another two or three days but mrs romayne forbore to remind him of that fact nor did she allude to the conviction which had turned her suddenly rather pale namely that his thoughts of going down to the club had arisen within the last few minutes very well dear she said smiling up at him go by all means oh no i shall be quite happy with a book he did not look back at her as he left the room after another word or two or the expression on her face might have arrested even his youthfully self centred and preoccupied attention loring was not at the club nor was there any information to be obtained there as to his movements julian played a game of billiards and lost it through sheer carelessness and then determined to go home again he would walk part of the way he said to himself though he had had one walk that day he wanted to think things over the phrase was serious and by comparison with the process to which it was attached grandiloquent julians mental apparatus was at present as undeveloped as that of a fashionable young man of four and twenty may usually be taken to be the process of thinking things over as conducted within his good looking head involved no stern process of reasoning no exhaustive system of logical deduction from cause to effect no carefully balanced opinions of the past or decisions for the future when he proposed to himself to think things over in short he simply meant that he should ring a strictly limited number of changes on the fact that as he expressed it vaguely to himself it was awfully hard lines it had taken him some time to come to this conclusion he had flirted with miss hilda newton very happily for the last ten days with a great deal of wholly unnecessary assistance from that young lady herself without the very faintest definite intentions towards her he had enjoyed it and she had enjoyed it and the idea which had occurred to him once or twice that his mother did not enjoy it had not particularly affected him circumstances alone would have been responsible for the proposal which had so nearly been an accomplished fact on the day before and had the speech to miss newton interrupted by mrs romayne reached its legitimate conclusion and received its inevitable response it was extremely likely that he might by this time have been the victim of a vague consciousness of having made a mistake but it had been interrupted and a deeply injured sense of having been thwarted was consequently not unnatural in its author that sense of injury which might have passed away in mere sentiment but which on the other hand might if it had been left untouched by words have developed into a secret breach between mother and son had been focussed and rendered definite and tangible as it were by his mothers laughing speeches in the train it was as he had sat gazing blankly out of the window during the last half hour of their journey that he had come to the conclusion before mentioned that it was awfully hard lines it makes a fellow feel such a fool he said to himself as morosely as the undeveloped nature of his temperament permitted as he issued moodily from his club and started in the direction of piccadilly it makes a fellow feel such a confounded fool he could not reduce this general principle to detail but what he really felt was something of the sensation of the child who realises suddenly and for the first time the pretence of the fairyland of shadows in which he has been performing prodigies of valour all the intercourse with the pretty girls of his sets which julian had hitherto accepted simply and unquestioningly had suddenly become flat stale and unprofitable to him all illusions had gone from it and the reality was painfully unsatisfying and wounding to his self love there is all the difference in the world between a vague understanding and a practical realisation julian had known of course from the very first that he was dependent on his mother but he had never felt it until the previous day he had known that marriage without her consent was practically impossible for him but the fact had never before been brought home to him the veto which had descended so impalpably and decisively upon what he was now prepared to characterise as his hopes with regard to miss newton shrivelling them to nothingness had also shrivelled away all the embellishing haze by which the conditions of his life had been surrounded the background to all his thoughts on the subject the background which had grown up almost without consciousness on his own part with his first humiliated realisation of the facts of the case and which remained a vague brooding shadow in his mind was resentment against his mother a resentment which taken in conjunction with the careless and effusive affection of his attitude to her hitherto threw a curious light on his relations with her but against this background and affecting him far more keenly was a sore sense that life had suddenly lost its savour for him the charm of flirtation had vanished utterly before his mothers words as to its harmlessness the privilege which she assigned to him seemed to reduce him to the level of a shadow among substances to put him at a hopeless disadvantage with all the women of his world and render his intercourse with them a farce of which both they and he must be perfectly conscious its all such utter humbug he said to himself that being the nearest definition he could attain of the vague thoughts that were passing through his mind then he ceased to express himself even mentally and walked along meditating moodily and discontentedly he was walking along piccadilly when he found his thoughts gradually returning to his actual surroundings as though something were drawing them unconsciously to himself as extraneous objects which one is not even aware of noticing will sometimes do it was about eleven oclock not a very pleasant time in piccadilly and the pavement was by no means crowded the first detail to which he awoke was the hilarious demeanour of a young man just in front of him who was walking very unsteadily in the same direction as himself he was a young man of the commonest cockney type obviously in the maudlin stage of intoxication as julians senses became more fully alive he noticed a pace or two in front of the young man the shabbily dressed figure of a girl she was walking hurriedly and nervously and as the young man quickened his uneven steps in response to a sudden quickening of hers julian saw that the intoxicated speeches which had first grown into his own meditation were addressed to the girl and that she was trying in vain to escape from them it was not a particularly uncommon sight for a london street and a half indignant half careless glance would naturally have been all the attention julian would have vouchsafed it but as the pair preceded him up piccadilly the girl shrinking and afraid afraid to attract attention by too rapid movements as much afraid as her nervous undecided glances around her showed of the help a protest might attract to her as of her pursuer the man sodden and brutal absolutely destitute for the moment of reasoning faculty julian found his attention fascinated by them a spark of natural youthful chivalry entirely undeveloped by his life stirred in him he quickened his steps involuntarily apparently and with no definite intention for he was just passing them with a quick undecided glance at the girl when he saw her stop suddenly and shrink back against a neighbouring shop front whether a faint shriek really came from her or not he never knew but her eyes met his and appealed to him almost as if without the owners consciousness the man had laid a hot drunken hand upon the worn ungloved fingers julian stopped let go he said peremptorily his tone was so sharp and the interference was so sudden and unlooked for that the man stupid with drink did as he was bidden as if involuntarily be off continued julian in the same tone the man stared at him for a minute and broke into a maudlin laugh a discordant snatch of a comic song and staggered on his way as though the sudden breaking of his chain of ideas had obliterated the girl from his memory she was standing as julian turned to her leaning back against the shop front shaking from head to foot but evidently making a violent effort to control herself thank you sir she murmured tremulously and was moving to go on her way with faltering trembling footsteps when julian stopped her this is not a nice place for you to be alone in he said almost involuntarily have you far to go he had looked at her for that moment during which she had stood motionless with her face outlined against the dark shutter with a strangely mingled feeling that her face was wonderfully unlike any with which he was acquainted and yet that he had actually seen it before seen it and experienced the same half startled half wondering sensation it was white now to the very lips and the great brown eyes dark and liquid looked out from under their soft lashes and level eyebrows wide with terror and distress her features were beautifully formed though they were so thin and worn that it would never have occurred to julian to class her among the ranks of pretty girls but the real charm of her face lay about her mouth it was very strong though the strength was latent and entirely unconscious very simple and very sweet and even the pallor of her lips and the slight trembling about them could not detract from the beauty of the line they made her hair as julian noticed was of a soft black and very luxuriant she was rather tall and her shabby jacket concealed and spoilt the outline of her figure but the set of her well shaped head was full of instinctive grace she paused a moment before she answered him looking into his face with a simple directness which had a dignity of its own yes sir she said in a low voice which shook a little in spite of her evident efforts to steady it to the hammersmith road but youre not going to walk are you said julian apparently her glance at his face had satisfied her she answered him this time without hesitation yes sir she said her voice was very musical and refined it harmonised better with her face than with her worn work girls dress and the dignified deference of her manner then you must let me see you safely part of the way at any rate said julian impulsively she hesitated and looked at him again and this time the large eyes grew moist with tears its very silly of me she said tremulously i i think it was his touching me that upset me so she had been rubbing one hand all this time mechanically and involuntarily as it seemed over the hand on which that drunken touch had fallen i did try to get a bus but they were all full i couldnt let you take such trouble it needed only the unconscious gratitude of those words to convince julian that it would be no trouble whatever and he asserted the same with an assumption of authority and masterfulness quite new to him it was an hour and a half later when his mother sitting up wakeful in her own room caught the slight sound made by his latch key in the door and noticed a moments pause before the door was opened in that pause there had come to julian one of those sudden flashes of light which sometimes illuminate a vainly pondered question of course he said to himself as he shut the door with a bang of course i knew id seen her before in the thunderstorm the night i dined with garstin end of vol i f m evans co limited printers crystal palace se
