currents a mere cypher etc thy gold is brass prince hohenstiel schwangau in three volumes vol iii london macmillan co and new york a valiant ignorance chapter i it was not generally known among his acquaintances that marston loring had come back from africa accompanied by a new friend this new friend was not introduced by loring at either of his clubs and yet the two met at least once every day he was a man named alfred ramsay a small insignificant looking man with sandy hair which had turned in streaks the peculiar grey which such hair assumes and small dull eyes that never seemed to move in his head it was nearly three oclock on the afternoon following that on which loring had called on mrs romayne and he and his new friend were together in his chambers in the temple mr ramsay had been there several times before and he was sitting now in an arm chair in the sunshine with an air of total want of interest in his surroundings which was characteristic of him loring was walking up and down the room thoughtfully romayne observed ramsay not a particularly good name on the market it belonged to a first class swindler twenty years ago william romayne this young gentleman is no connexion i suppose the remark broke a short silence and loring stopped in his walk and leant back against the mantelpiece as he answered yes he said tersely hes his son he has never been in his fathers line though i doubt whether he knows anything about him though its an odd thing that he shouldnt as to the name why its an old story and wont affect any one nowadays i take it the point is that he has this respectable capital and is exceedingly keen on increasing it there was a dryness in lorings voice as he said the last words which implied a great deal more than did his words and it was apparently to that significance that the other man replied a chip of the old block said ramsay musingly i wonder now how far it goes the last words were spoken very slowly and the dull eyes looked straight before them loring looked down at him with a cynical smile just touching his lips he knew considerably more about his new friends character than he would have chosen to put into words and he could guess not inaccurately what was passing in his mind at the moment and the realisation of the shadowy possibilities with which ramsay was occupied was no part of marston lorings designs he made no direct answer he should be here by this time he said carelessly and as he spoke there was a sharp cheery rap at the door it opened quickly and julian romayne appeared very boyish very good looking and with a curious veiled keenness in his eyes we were just expecting you said loring greeting him with a friendly nod let me introduce you to mr alfred ramsay mr alfred ramsay had risen to honour the introduction turning his whole head slowly round as he looked at julian so that his eyes still gazed straight before them as they rested on the young mans face pleased to know you he said indifferently very glad to make your acquaintance responded julian pleasantly i hope im not behind time pretty fair said loring laying his hand on the young mans shoulder with kindly patronage but ramsay is a busy man you know so suppose we get to business at once ramsay he continued in a brisk businesslike voice as the three sat down about the table romayne knows nothing of the affair whatever i shall begin by running over the preliminaries with him and first of all he went on turning to julian of course it is understood romayne that we keep the matter to ourselves he spoke in a curt off hand manner and as julian made a quick gesture of acquiescence he went on in the same businesslike tone i dont know whether you know anything about the welcome diamond mining company he said probably not it was floated about this time last year and the greater part of the business came into my hands the shares were taken up all right but well it didnt come to anything and its affairs had something to do with my going out to the cape it was in connection with those same affairs that i and ramsay met julian had listened so far with a clouded countenance and now as loring paused he leant back in his chair with a movement of irrepressible disappointment oh he said shortly its a mine then there is a mine in connection with it replied loring imperturbably but you need not trouble yourself about the mine that is only the figure head you understand the affair itself is a matter of arrangement look here romayne he went on as julian leant suddenly forward across the table shares in the welcome diamond mining company are at this moment worth about five shillings each he paused he had been leaning carelessly back in his chair and now he moved uncrossing his legs and leaning one arm on the table in a few days he went on deliberately and significantly they will fall to two shillings he paused again with a slight matter of course gesture that will be worked of course he said julian nodded comprehension yes he said at that price continued loring all the shares will be bought up by two or three men in consequence of private information received from the cape the last words came from loring slowly and deliberately and his eyes met julians significantly a quick flash of understanding passed across julians face and loring continued easily reports to this effect will get about the fact of the presence in london of a mining engineer from the vicinity of the welcome will also get about perhaps he may allow himself to be interviewed you know nothing definite of course the shares will go up with a run he paused and julian threw himself back in his chair tapping the table meditatively with one hand his gaze was fixed upon the wall just over lorings head and there was a curious expression on his face which combined the keen matter of fact calculation of the habitual speculator with a certain unconscious gleam of hungry excitement which was eloquent of youth and inexperience a minute or two passed during which mr ramsays eyes rested indifferently on the young mans face and then julian spoke his voice also in spite of his evident attempt at emulation of lorings businesslike nonchalance was just touched by that youthful incapacity for holding keen personal interest in abeyance and the private information received from the cape will be supplied he said interrogatively will be supplied by ramsay returned loring the words were spoken with the slightest possible movement of the eyelids julian made a quick gesture of comprehension and there was a moments silence then loring went on crisply darting a quick glance at julians face in its calculating eagerness in a private speculation of this kind of course it is a case of working together and share and share alike now we propose ramsay and i you understand to make up a joint capital for the purchase of these shares we are prepared to put into it fifteen thousand pounds between us and we want another ten thousand at least if you are prepared to put in that sum or more on the understanding that the profits after each man has received back his original investment are divided into three equal shares we are willing to take you in with us julian looked up at him quickly into three equal shares he said with a stress on the adjective into three equal shares returned loring drily capital is not the sole requisite in this affair and the other factors are supplied by ramsay and myself a dark flush mounted to julians forehead and the avidity in his eyes developed its a large order though he said i dont quite see where i come in at that rate after all loring leant back in his chair and looked him full in the face you can please yourself of course he said take it or leave it you will come in to the tune of something like thirty thousand if you see your way to trebling your capital by any other means do so lots of fellows will be glad to take your place with us julians eyes gleamed greedily and he wavered obviously those are your final terms he said our final terms said loring concisely looking at ramsay who nodded nonchalantly in confirmation of the words a silence ensued julian sat staring down at the table his brows knit evidently in close thought at last he glanced up suddenly at the two men who had been waiting carelessly for his decision i call it rather rough he said brusquely but all right if the thing looks all right when youve trotted it out i accept he passed on instantly with a brief telling question to the inner working of the scheme there is perhaps nothing by which self revelation is more frankly and unconsciously made than through the means by which a man may be most easily roused to enthusiasm enthusiasm a genuine quickening of his mental pulses even had been a condition of things practically unknown to the easy going commonplace julian romayne of a year before but in the course of the last two months he had experienced it often to hear of large sums of money large profits rapid returns on striking investments touched him instinctively as a record of artistic achievements will touch an artist as triumphs of research will touch an historian as prodigies of physical prowess will touch an athlete and as loring answered him now and went on with fuller and more technical detail his face changed strikingly his eyes brightened and an eager fascinated light came into them he leant farther forward listening commenting questioning with quick and always increasing excitement half an hour passed and still the three men sat about the table talking in terse businesslike fashion three quarters of an hour an hour at the end of that time julian his face flushed and eager his eyes glistening and sparkling his hand absolutely shaking with excitement was holding that hand out to mr ramsay with a gesture which witnessed to the work of that hour as volumes could not have done as far as words went he and mr ramsay had hardly exchanged three sentences it was the bond that lay behind the words that had drawn them together mr ramsay had spoken very little indeed but his silent presence had never for a moment seemed superfluous or without a certain indefinite weight and there was a dull approval in his slow eyes now as he turned them on the young man weve settled so much then said julian in a quick familiar way and we meet here on thursday at two until then he turned to loring and stretched out his hand eagerly thanks old man he said in a low quick voice thanks chapter ii miss pomeroys visit to mrs romayne was postponed for a fortnight at one time indeed it seemed not impossible that mrs pomeroys visit to her sister in devonshire might be postponed indefinitely and mrs romayne was charmingly inconsolable over her prospective disappointment it was a delightful thing to have a girl in the house mrs romayne made the discovery and the statement as the very first evening of miss pomeroys stay with her drew to a close and certainly the evening signalised by a little dinner party had been pleasant enough to warrant satisfaction julian had been in the best possible spirits elated apparently by the presence of his mothers visitor at whose side he was to be found whenever his duties as host allowed such concentration of his attention miss pomeroy herself had been a model of gentle amiability and had looked more than usually bright and pretty loring who had made one of the dinner guests had also been at his best and most amusing no conversation of any length had of course been possible between him and his hostess but a quick low toned word or two passed between them in the movement that ensued upon the reappearance of the men in the drawing room after dinner and on the tone of that first evening that of the fortnight into which miss pomeroys stay lengthened itself was modelled they were very dissipated mrs romayne asserted laughingly and she further declared that she had never enjoyed dissipation so much julians hard working impulses seemed to be in partial abeyance for the time being their demands on him though peremptory when they did occur did not prevent a great deal of attendance on his mother and her guest loring also seemed hardly to have settled back into his usual routine and frequently made one of the party his appearance on the scene and the recognition of that compact between them which he never failed to make either by a glance or a few quiet words were never without a certain effect on mrs romayne not on her spirits for they never varied in their gaiety but on a hard restlessness in her eyes always lessened for the moment by that look or word from loring the last day of june was also the last day of mrs pomeroys absence from london and it was moreover the day fixed for a certain dance which was to stand out from all the other dances of the season the givers of this dance were parvenus of the most pronounced type and during the past three seasons they had paid their way into london society by spending fortunes on the entertainments they gave this season they had issued cards of invitation on which each guest was requested to wear medival florentine dress and it had been whispered abroad that thousands were to be spent in providing such a setting for these costumes as should eclipse anything hitherto seen fortunately for the projectors and nobody knew better than they how absolutely impossible it was to calculate in such a matter the idea caught societys fancy it was taken up with the wild enthusiasm which alternates in the modern mind with blank indifference and as every one with an invitation had spent some three weeks in ardent consideration of his or her dress for the occasion that occasion had acquired a fictitious importance of a colossal nature and was absolutely looked forward to as promising something quite unusual and equally indefinite in the way of amusement the whole thing had evidently been arranged mrs romayne declared gaily to give a final touch of triumph to the end of maud pomeroys visit to her it was about four oclock in the afternoon of the day in question and she and miss pomeroy with julian as escort were taking what she described as a little turn in the park when she expressed this opinion it was a perfect june afternoon the park was very full and all three seemed to be exhilarated either by the sunshine the movement or the prospect of the evening the fortnights intimate association with her present companions had apparently had no effect whatever upon miss pomeroys demure conventionality of manner but her word was readier than usual and her expression was brighter mrs romayne talked and laughed and kept the ball of chatter going and about julians hilarity there was a touch of excitement which was a characteristic which had grown upon him markedly in the course of the last month he turned upon his mother protesting gaily thats much too depressing a point of view he said it forces on us exactly what we want to forget that it is the end now ive made up my mind to cut the connection between to night and both yesterday and to morrow and enjoy myself tremendously and is cutting the connection it sounds as if something might blow up an indispensable preliminary laughed mrs romayne why of course he glanced at miss pomeroy as he spoke and the colour deepened in her cheeks by just a shade as she turned to mrs romayne and said with one of her little smiles and a rather poor attempt at mock confidence mr romayne wants to forget the terrific anxiety which he has already suffered over that gorgeous dress of his and the terrific bill from which he has still to suffer julians protestations were as eager and boyish in manner as they were delicate and skilful in matter and mrs romayne broke in upon them with a laughing apology and a request that julian would tell the coachman to turn out into piccadilly and drive to a house in grosvenor place julian gave the order and added to it you can pull up when you get out of the park mrs romayne took up the words instantly are you not coming with us bad boy she said come and help us pay one call at any rate we are going straight home after that to prepare ourselves for the triumphs of the evening by a little refreshing laziness are we not maud i should like to immensely returned julian ardently as miss pomeroy smiled a response but im afraid i must go down to the club i promised to meet loring there dinner at eight i suppose he added as the carriage drew up and he jumped out he stepped back on the pavement lifting his hat as the carriage drove off then he jumped into a hansom and gave the word to drive not to the club but to the temple arrived there he ran upstairs the excitement about him gaining ground moment by moment to marston lorings rooms loring was there alone he was seated at the writing table writing rapidly his face keen and intent and he suspended his work for an instant only as he glanced up on the opening of the door and nodded a greeting julians life for the last month had been lived at that high pressure which is only produced in a man by the consciousness that he has burnt his ships every shilling that he had accumulated during the previous six months was invested in the scheme propounded to him a month ago by marston loring and the history of his real life during the interval would have been a history of the stages through which that scheme had passed the affairs of the welcome diamond mining company had followed precisely the course indicated by loring during that first interview on the subject between loring ramsay and julian shortly after that interview welcomes had fallen to a nominal price they had then been bought up according to arrangement a slight rise had followed as a matter of course followed by an interval of vacillation and a slow succession of trifling advances which had again been succeeded by a period of quiet so far the excitement with which every hour had been instinct for julian had been the excitement of preparation solely the ground had been tilled and the seed sown and what that soil was in which he had sown his seed what were the characteristics that were to prove so stimulating it was not in him to consider he was perfectly well aware of the nature of the transaction in which he was engaged he had understood at the outset that the private information received from the cape on which the shares were to be bought up was a put up thing as he would have expressed it between ramsay and marston loring and the knowledge affected him not at all that black thread in the warp of his character was running strong and deep now and to such considerations his sensibilities were absolutely dormant well the monosyllable broke from him eager and impetuous as though it contained the pent up suspense and excitement of hours he had come up rapidly to lorings side and the latter without lifting his eyes signed to an evening paper which lay on the table as he said briefly all right julians face turned quite white he snatched up the paper and turned with breathless eagerness to the column devoted to the money market welcome diamond company shares the blue eyes seemed to leap at the line and fasten on it with a hungry avidity pitiful to see and he stood there gazing at it with glittering fascinated eyes with a curious stillness upon him from head to foot as though all remembrance of his actual surroundings all thought even of loring had faded nearly five minutes had passed when loring laid down his pen and leant back in his chair turning a little that he might fix his eyes on julian as he stood rather behind him pretty fair he said carelessly julian lifted his eyes from the paper and turned his white face to loring he nodded as though the feelings of the moment were not to be put into speech and then the slow deep colour of excitement began to creep over his features have you seen ramsay he said in a low quick voice saw him this morning he told me things were beginning to move it was that paragraph yesterday that did it and what about keeping it up said julian this is the ticklish moment i take it whats the next move he had thrown himself into a chair as he spoke his voice was jerking with eagerness as though some of his excitement were finding expression loring looked at him for an instant before he answered he was asking himself a question which had formulated itself in his mind more than once in the last month namely was it merely the influence of his blood which made young romayne so keen a speculator or was there something concealed in the background of his life which made money a desperate necessity with him this is the next move he answered indicating the sheets of manuscript paper which lay before him this will be in one or two of the papers to morrow and if im not mistaken it will have a big effect julian stretched out his hand impulsively for the sheets and ran through them now and then breaking into an eager comment and as he finished he rose impetuously and began to pace excitedly up and down the room his face was flushed now and his eyes glowing yes that ought to take us a long way he said and ramsay backing it up all the while of course loring what do you make of it an affair of weeks an affair of two or three weeks all told returned loring nonchalantly the inside of a month ought to put the best part of thirty thousand into each of our pockets my boy he rose as he spoke and gathered together the sheets of manuscript but as he did so his quick ear caught a strange sharp catch in julians breath he fastened up the papers and directed them with another of those slight smiles and then turned again to the younger man julian was standing at the window staring almost stupidly out im going to turn you out now said loring lightly coming down to the club with me julian turned round but the words seemed to penetrate slowly to his consciousness no he said at last no thanks old man i im going to get home he had to go to his own chambers first it appeared however and loring left him with a careless all right see you to night of course the sunshine had left julians room bright as it still was outside and it looked perhaps the darker by contrast as he opened the door and shut himself in alone he paused a moment with his hand on the lock and then walked aimlessly across to the writing table and sat down there was a pale dazed look about him the line in the evening paper at which he had gazed with such devouring eyes had chronicled the first important rise of those shares on which his hopes were staked chronicled in fact the beginning of the end as he sat there alone the words seemed to stand out all about him to meet his eyes in every direction and it was little wonder that as he realised that the seed so eagerly sown had indeed broken ground at last the perfect fruit seemed to be already in his hand and he was dazed and intoxicated with anticipated triumph he had the blood of a speculator and a gambler in his veins and as he sprang up suddenly from his chair and began to pace up and down the room it was the surging of the speculators instinct that flushed his face and glittered in his eyes the rioting of that money passion which to the man who has never felt its fever is the strangest and most repulsive as it is the most abnormal of all passions but little by little without volition or even consciousness on his part the current of his thoughts changed gradually that greedy tumultuous contemplation of money as an end wavered altered into a contemplation of money as a means into a passing over of that means in the realisation of the end which it was to bring about he was thinking of clemence thinking of her in a tumult of excitement in which the goading of that two edged dart of love and shame which quivered always in his better nature was absolutely unfelt thinking of her in a very hallucination of intoxicated triumph he was living out with her a future life of triumphant satisfaction a life so utterly incompatible with the facts of the case with all that had come and gone and must still come and go as to be a most pathetic imagining when the sound of a clock striking brought him suddenly to himself his first conscious thought was a certain vague surprise at his surroundings as far as externals went he had left lorings room and had come to his own like a man walking in his sleep then he realised the nature of the sound that had roused him and drew out his watch to see what hour it was that had struck it was seven and the fact with the pressing necessity for his return home which it involved gave a turn to the current of his thoughts by which without changing their main character they were blended in with the actual practicalities of the moment he thought of his mother with a certain bitter triumph its not for long he said to himself not for long now his mind ran on over the details of the evening before him the little dinner only ourselves mrs romayne had said gaily the artificialities that would pass between himself and his mother the effective flirtation which he would have to keep up with miss pomeroy the flirtation which in the excitement of the past month he had carried on recklessly and then with his hand on the door he stopped abruptly stopped and stood quite still with a strange defiant recklessness growing in his face whether it was some curious effect of the tumult through which he had passed whether it originated in those jubilant visions of clemence from which he had so recently awakened it is not possible to say but on that instant there had risen within him an impulse of fierce overmastering repulsion against his mother against miss pomeroy against the part he had chosen to play almost before he had realised the sudden sense of overwhelming revolt and distaste which had seized him its obverse was upon him clemence to see clemence to speak to clemence to satisfy the hungry longing which for the moment seemed absolutely to possess him such a longing in various forms and degrees had shaken and torn him often before but hitherto something some influence from clemences own words some jarring and throbbing of that better nature in himself had held him back but now strung up and carried out of himself by his excitement he was impervious to all considerations save that of his own overmastering craving the end was very near now he told himself it was a question of a week or two only he must see her she herself would see that it was only reasonable that he should see her his plans were laid in the passing of a few seconds the only address clemence had given him was that of the house of business where she worked where she had worked when he met her first his only chance of seeing her lay in meeting her when she left her work at night he would not go home to dinner he decided he would telegraph to his mother and dine at a quiet restaurant that would bring him as he knew well enough to the earliest hour at which the hands of whom clemence made one were likely to be released and he would wait in the little by street in which the hands entrance was situated until she came he went out of the room with a quick assured step sent off his telegram a brief detained inconsolable from an office in fleet street and then carefully avoiding the fashionable resorts he walked to the restaurant he had mentally selected the little street which for some scores of men and women formed the picture evoked by a name which for the shopping population of london involved a mental vision of a busy thoroughfare and a considerable expanse of plate glass windows ran parallel to that thoroughfare divided from it only by a long block of buildings and bearing in mind the slight nature of the division between the two the contrast presented was almost startling the little street was a thoroughfare inasmuch as it led from one side street to another but these streets were very little frequented and the connecting link between them was a short cut to nowhere it represented simply so many back entrances to places of business and these being to a great extent monopolised by a single firm the comings and goings at stated times of the hands employed by that firm was often the only movement that broke the quiet from morning until night in the intervals between these comings and goings there brooded over the street such a silence and stillness as seemed strangely incompatible with the thought of all the labour and effort that it held with the hard days work towards which those coming footsteps in the morning were bent with the hard days work which lay behind those departing footsteps in the evening the street itself had a squalid neglected look too as though life and activity had passed it by the days work was not over yet though the evening light was making long shadows and the setting sun was turning the upper windows of the opposite houses into ruddy fire the street was absolutely silent and deserted when julian turned quickly into it he pulled up and surveyed his surroundings with a rapid comprehensive glance it was too early yet he looked at his watch and told himself so with somewhat over elaborated carelessness and took out his cigarette case he lighted a cigarette and pacing slowly up and down the pavement on the opposite side of the street to that on which he expected clemence to emerge he began to reckon with himself the chances for and against her speedy or tardy appearance but such practical matter of fact considerations involved a deliberate mental action on his part and having gone through it urged by that curious instinct under which intense excitement always desires to assert itself as absolute calm and sanity he gradually let himself slip away again from the practical and the actual and gave himself up to the tide of his exhilarated imaginings there is nothing more exciting nothing that sooner quickens the mental pulses into a very fever of confusion than the sudden indulgence of an impulse long resisted the hour that had passed since the idea of which his presence in that quiet little street was the outcome had flashed into julians mind and dominated it had carried him as completely out of himself and out of touch with realities as is a man under the influence of absinthe as a man so exhilarated will be impervious to a considerable amount of physical pain so julian was for the time being absolutely unconscious of anything painful or shameful in his position the circumstances under which he had parted from clemence all the bitter pain and longing under which he had smarted and writhed with such fierce rebellion the attitude towards himself which his conduct might only too justly have created in his wife were absolutely obliterated from his mind he was waiting now husband master altogether the superior triumphant successful self assured for his mistaken but doubtless submissive wife conscious and rather pleased with the consciousness that he loved her in spite of her faults one quarter after another chimed out from a neighbouring clock he had been waiting nearly an hour oblivious in his elation of tedium or weariness oblivious of the claim upon him of the life of queen anne street as though it had no existence for him the slight feeling of impatience with which he realised that the fourth quarter was chiming was entirely unconnected with such externals and it was an eloquent testimony to his mental attitude that it took the form of a faint sense of irritation with clemence for delaying so long a vague feeling of lordly disapproval of her conduct stirred in him as he paused at the top of the street and glanced across at the still fast closed doors he was just looking dubiously at his cigarette case when the click of a latch instantly followed by the sound of girls voices made him start violently he thrust the case hastily into his pocket and walked quickly down the street until he was standing just opposite the door from which a little stream of girls and women was pouring forth several figures had already detached themselves from the stream and were moving rapidly away either singly or in pairs but one quick glance told him that neither of these was clemence and he fixed his eyes with eager confidence on the doorway through which she had still to pass his face was flushed with intense excitement on came the stream girls and women following one another in unbroken succession pretty girls plain girls shabby girls smart girls some arm in arm some laughing and talking in loud voiced groups several of these groups noticed his waiting figure and commented upon it in giggling whispers turning back as they passed down the street to look at it again but julian only saw that none of these was clemence the stream was beginning to dwindle stragglers followed one another now at irregular intervals the two girls who had been the last to appear had nearly reached the end of the street and still julians eyes were riveted on the open doorway the girls turned the corner and down the dim passage into which he was looking there came slowly another figure quite alone before it had emerged into the light julian was across the road as though that one great throb with which his heart leapt up to meet her had impelled him physically and as clemence passed out into the soft dusk of the june evening he spoke her name eagerly at first then with a strange break in his voice clemence clemence at the first sound of his voice evidently the first sign to her that he was near a low indescribable cry broke from clemence she turned towards him trembling swaying as she stood and julian caught her in his arms lest she should fall youve come she cried and before the exquisite rapture and relief of her faint quivering voice with all that it implied of suffering past a harder man than julian might have melted my dear my dear i knew youd come i knew i knew but that pathetic voice had not been needed the first sight of her face as she turned it upon him with that wonderful irradiation of joy upon it had shrivelled into nothingness all the exultation all the triumph and self satisfaction of the past few hours and julian held her in his arms his trance over self convicted self condemned his whole consciousness absorbed in that heavy throbbing agony of his better nature which had leapt into sudden relentless life what it was that so penetrated him he could not have defined where and in what proportion old influence revived touched and was blended with a heart piercing sense of the change in her he could not have said he did not even know that these were indeed the powers that had struck him the change in her even as he gazed down at her face with agonised remorseful eyes as it rested for one moment on his shoulder he rather felt than traced and understood that change was very great those past six months had dealt heavily with that thin white face and the marks of their passing were plain to see even in that moment of absolute transfiguration every curve every suggestion of girlishness seemed to have been worn away worn away by those cruel twin refiners never so pitiless as when they work together physical suffering and mental distress the outline of her features had lost some of its beauty in that intense accentuation the colourless lips were slightly drawn and under the sunken eyes were heavy shadows but no remembrance of the physical loveliness which she had lost could stand for an instant before the spiritual loveliness which she had gained it was as though those twin refiners before whom nothing earthly or external can stand and flourish had strengthened that which lay behind the externals with which they had dealt so ruthlessly the eyes so indescribably beautiful as they looked now into julians had been beautiful even in that moment before she realised his presence beautiful in their heaviness as no brightness as no common happiness could have made them beautiful with the perfect patience and dignity of accepted suffering the tired mouth had been beautiful in its repose as it was beautiful now in its tremulous rapture beautiful in its quiet constancy and self abnegation she let herself rest for a moment in his arms clinging to him with something in her touch which he had never felt before looking up into his face as her head lay back against his shoulder with a strange tremulous tender light quivering on every feature shaken from head to foot by little tremulous tearless sobs the sobs of utter relief and peace then she disengaged herself gently and drew herself away something of that first ecstasy dying out of her face to leave it soft and happy beyond all words that strange light still shone in her eyes and as she moved one thin hand retained its clinging hold on his arm as though some instinct of dependence influenced her involuntarily she was dressed not as the other girls had been in a light summer jacket but in a long cloak and as she drew it about her with the other hand the softest touch of colour came into her white cheek my dear she said softly my dear and julian whispered hoarsely as he had whispered again and again clemmie clemmie he made no attempt to take her in his arms again even the gesture with which he laid his hand upon those clinging fingers on his sleeve was diffident and almost tremulous tender and reverent as no gesture of his had ever been in all his life before he could find no words in her presence everything all the triumph all that had seemed to him the necessities and realities of life seemed to have fallen away from him he was nothing he had nothing he could say nothing to her there was a silence silence which for clemence as her fingers closed round his and that soft colour came and went in her cheeks breathed an ineffable content silence which for julian held the blackest depths of self revelation and self contempt it was broken at last by clemence is it done dear she said gently julians hand turned cold in hers and his eyes fell away from her face not not yet clemmie he faltered wretchedly i i came to tell you to tell you that that you are going to do it that you are going to do it my dear my dear you mean that oh you mean that dont you she had not raised her voice or changed her pose but that touch upon his arm had become a close convulsive grip and even the clutch of the worn blanched hand upon her cloak witnessed to the agony of supplication with which every nerve was strained and quivering her low voice thrilled and vibrated with it her white face to which his first words had brought a look of heart sick disappointment was an embodied prayer he could not answer on the instant it cut him like a lash and she went on rapidly her low beseeching voice breaking and trembling with the intense feeling that flickered on her face like a light julian for my sake for your wifes sake dear i love you so i i need you so dont part us any longer if it was for your good if it was to make you happy theres nothing i would not face and face cheerfully ah you know that dont you but youre doing wrong and i think of it always and it makes the loneliness so that i cant bear it oh i cant bear it she broke suddenly into low shuddering sobs and tears and her head fell forward helplessly on to his breast though she still kept her convulsive hold upon his arm he put his other arm round her and drew her towards him and as he did so he seemed to realise with a kind of double consciousness the course he would take and its utter contemptibility dont clemmie dear dont dont he said in a broken uneven voice its all right dear im going to do it i came to tell you so its all right youre going to tell her i am clemence i promise you i am only only not for a week or two theres theres something i must wait for but you are going to you are you are on my on my soul yes clemence there was a moments silence broken only by her low tremulous sobs then these too died away at last with a long sighing breath she raised herself and looked into his pale miserable face with her own quiet and exhausted must you wait she said with an indescribable accent on the first bitter word must you i i must dear he said desperately his eyes trying wretchedly to avoid hers it shant be long i promise you but i must wait just a little longer she paused a moment still looking into his face then with a sudden light in her eyes she made a slight movement as though she would have bent his head down that she might murmur in his ear she stopped herself however and there settled down upon her face a look of unutterable sadness by julian in his helpless misery of self contempt the gesture had passed utterly unheeded dont let it be much longer dear she said good night julian caught at the last word as though it gave him some sort of chance of restoring his writhing self respect good night he echoed not yet clemence im going to see you home of course but clemence shook her head no she said steadfastly no dear something in her tone something in the touch she laid upon him took from him all power of self assertion all power of resistance to her will she drew his head towards her now kissed him softly on the forehead and then turned and went away down the street leaving him alone chapter iii romayne at last by jove old man we thought you were going to throw us over the voice a young mans voice struck out as it were from an indescribable medley of incongruous sound the background was formed by the lightest and most melodious dance music produced solely from stringed instruments lutes and guitars seemed to predominate and the result had a character and rhythm of its own which was essentially graceful picturesque and italian against the background a high pitched discord compounded of every imaginable key there clashed a very babel of tongues the eminently unmusical voice of modern society with all its faults of modulation and pronunciation blended into a whole full of a character absolutely incompatible with the old time southern harmonies with which it mingled the speakers figure as he stopped suddenly in a hurried passage across the room stood out from a blaze of colour light and gorgeousness of every description which fell without pause or cessation into ever fresh combination as the beautifully dressed crowd moved to and fro in its magnificent setting and the spectacle presented to the eye was as curiously jarring as strikingly suggestive of the ludicrous inconsistencies of dreamland as were the sounds that saluted the ear there was hardly a man or woman to be seen whose dress was not as faithful a copy of the costume prevalent among the florentine nobles under the magnificent rule of the medici as time and money could make it there was not a false note in the surroundings money had been poured out like water in order that a perfect reproduction of an old florentine palace might be achieved and as far as art could go nothing was left to be desired the fault lay with nature the old italians doubtless had their own mannerisms possibly their own vulgarities of carriage gesture and general demeanour but theirs were not the mannerisms and vulgarities of modern smart society the young man who had greeted julian exemplified in his own person all the preposterous incongruity of the whole his dress was a marvel of correctness to the minutest detail its wearers face was of the heavy inanimate bull dog type his movement as he shook hands with julian was an exaggerated specimen of the approved affectation of the moment his speech was clipped and drawled after the most approved model among mashers he was the son of the house and there was a kind of slow excitement about his manner struggling with a nonchalant carelessness which he evidently wished to present to the world as his mental attitude of the moment there was a note of excitement also in the medley of voices about him the affair was a huge go as the young man himself would have expressed it and neither he nor any one of his fathers guests was troubled for one instant by any sense of the ludicrousness of the effect produced julian had that instant entered the room and had paused on the threshold there is perhaps no type of costume more picturesque in its magnificence than that of the italian noble of the middle ages this is perhaps the reason why it has been so extensively vulgarised and julians dress was an admirable specimen of its kind rich graceful and becoming there was a subtle difference between his bearing and that of his host though julians demeanour too was modern to the finest shade he wore the dress well with none of the other mans awkwardness but on the contrary with an absolute ease and unconsciousness which implied a certain excited tension of nerve his face was colourless and very hard but upon the hardness there was a mask of animation and gaiety which was all sufficient for the present occasion im awfully sorry dear boy he said now lightly and eagerly and with an exaggerated gesture of deprecation its horribly late i know give you my word i couldnt help it by jove what a magnificent thing youve made of this the other glanced round with a satisfaction which he tried in vain to repress not so bad is it he said carelessly only these fellows are such fools even the best of them they always blunder if they can with this wholesale condemnation of the workmen among whom some fifty years ago his grandfather might have been found he screwed his eyeglass into his eye serenely unconscious of the comic effect produced for the better contemplation of a pretty girl at the farther end of the room lady pamela looks awfully fit doesnt she he observed parenthetically continuing almost in the same breath the gardens are the best part seems to me awfully like the real thing dont you know julians only direct answer was an expressive gesture of appreciation and apology awfully well done he said excuse me dear boy i see my mother and shell want to know why ive not turned up before i must go and explain his companion laughed the laugh was rather derisive and the glance he cast on julian through his eyeglass was stupidly inquisitive and incredulous what a fellow you are romayne he said they ought to put you in a glass case and label you the model son another gay expressive gesture from julian why not he said lightly were a model pair you know and the next moment he was threading his way quickly across the room a sudden movement of the crowd had shown him his mothers figure and he had realised instinctively that she had seen him he came up to her with a manner about which there was something indescribably reckless and made her a low bow of gay and abject apology i beg ten thousand million pardons he said language fails to express my feelings mrs romaynes dress was not a success that is to say it was perfect in itself and failed only as a setting for its wearer to deprive her appearance of any possibility of chic or dash was to deprive it of all its brilliancy but no unsuitability of colouring or cut in her gown could have been responsible for the look which underlay her smile as she turned to julian now and struck a little attitude of mock implacability with a light high pitched laugh then the conversation must be carried on in dumb show she said for language also fails to express my feelings sir what have you to say for yourself her voice for all its gaiety was thin and strained please nothing was the mock humility answer i met a fellow and he beguiled me he was just off to america he was standing with his hands folded and his eyes cast down and he did not see he would not have understood if he had seen the strange flash in those hard blue eyes such a flash as might leap up in the eyes of a woman in the silent endurance of a swift stab of pain a very poor excuse declared mrs romayne gaily no i dont think i shall forgive you yet such unscrupulous desertion must be visited as it deserves dont you think so lord garstin had come up to them and the question was addressed to him with a light laugh as she gave him her hand he nodded pleasantly to julian as he answered who has deserted not this boy of yours eh mrs romayne laughed again and pushed julian playfully with her fan oh i forgot you dont know his wickedness of course take me away from him lord garstin do and ill confide in you gorgeous affair this isnt it i wonder what it cost lord garstin looked round with a rather lofty smile there were times when it pleased him to pose as an isolated representative of a bygone age by the traditions of which in matters of taste and breeding the present age was utterly condemned rather too gorgeous to please an old man he said now with a fine reserve these dear good people would be more to my taste do you know if they had a little less money have you been outside by the bye its really not badly done mrs romayne turned away with him laughing and nodding to julian and then she stopped and went towards her son again touching his shoulder lightly every one isnt so stony hearted as i am bad boy she whispered gaily somebody has actually kept you some dances i believe if you apologise properly look there she is she made a little gesture with her fan towards the entrance to the dancing room from which maud pomeroy was just emerging looking like a picture in a white dress of the simplest form her long hair loose on her shoulders and crowned with a wreath of flowers the dance music had stopped and the music which still filled the air came from the garden with that hard recklessness growing stronger on his face julian made a slight graceful gesture towards his mother as though he would have kissed his hand to her in gratitude turned away and moved rapidly over to miss pomeroy more than three hours had gone by since julian had found himself standing alone gazing stupidly in the direction in which clemence had disappeared and how the first two of those hours had passed he hardly knew he had turned abruptly away and left the little street to walk mechanically on and on struggling blindly in a black abyss of self contempt in which his love lived only as additional torture he had emerged gradually from that abyss or rather his sense of its surrounding blackness had faded by degrees as all such acute sensations must and so completely had that blackness walled him in and deadened all his outward perceptions that it was only little by little and with a dull sense of surprise that his material surroundings dawned on him again and he realised that he was standing looking down into the river from the thames embankment his consciousness had come back to that life and world which he believed to constitute the only practical realities but it had brought with it that which turned all its environment to bitterness and gall as he stood leaning on the parapet staring sullenly down counting the reflection of the lamps in the dark water beneath him in the moody vacancy of reaction the necessities of his life began to surround him once more he saw them all as they were sordid and base and yet he neither saw nor attempted to see any possibility of self extrication the sound of big ben as it struck eleven had brought back to his mind the claims upon him of that particular evening at eleven oclock the carriage had been ordered to take mrs romayne and her party to the dance and a grim cynical smile touched his set white lips as he thought of his mother he had broken loose temporarily he told himself bitterly he must take up his part again and play the farce out that he should throw himself into the task with a wild oblivion of all proportion and limitation was the inevitable result of all that had gone before of all the perception and all the blindness with which he was racked and baffled miss pomeroy saw him coming and turning her face away she produced a pretty well turned comment on the arrangement of the rooms for the benefit of her cavalier the next instant julian stood beside her dont turn your back on me he implored gaily no fellow ever had such hard luck as ive had to night be a great deal kinder to me than i seem to deserve and forgive me please miss pomeroy turned her head and looked at him with a serene calm on her pretty face which seemed to relegate him to a place among inferior objects entirely indifferent to her her voice was perhaps a little too indifferent oh mr romayne she said youve actually appeared i have he said at last theres a poor fellow ive seen a good deal of not one of the regular set you know but a thoroughly unlucky chap always in the wars hes just off to try his luck on the other side of the world and i met him this evening most awfully blue and lonely he hasnt a friend in the world of course i had to try and cheer him up a bit and there i couldnt leave him dont you know i packed him into the mail train at last and bolted here as fast as wheels could bring me something of the blank serenity of miss pomeroys face gave way she lifted the feather fan that hung at her girdle and began to ruffle the feathers lightly against her other hand with lowered eyelids i dont think i should have troubled to hurry as it was so late she said and there was a touch of reproach and resentment in her voice her cavalier had drifted away by this time and in the midst of the constantly moving stream of people she and julian were practically alone julian answered her quickly with eager significance you would in my place he said you would if you had had the hope of even one of the dances to which you had been looking forward well i wont say how or for how long was it altogether a vain hope am i quite too late you are very late was the answer but the tone was distant and indifferent no longer and as the sound of the violins rose softly and invitingly once more from the other room a quick question from julian received a soft affirmative in reply and he led her triumphantly towards the music the room was not too full the garden the supper the show as the guests called it amongst themselves as a whole prevented any overcrowding in the dancing room but dancing among such cunningly arranged accessories was by no means a commonplace business the unfamiliar picturesqueness of the room with its softly scented air the wonderful effects of colour and light and above all a certain wild passion and sweetness about the music was not wholly without effect even on the jaded torpid receptivity of men and women of the world even miss pomeroys calm was apparently not wholly proof against the intoxication by the time the music died away there was a bright colour on her cheeks and a bright light in her eyes on julian the atmosphere and the music had had much the same effect as an excessive quantity of champagne might have had his pale face had flushed hotly and his eyes were glittering with excitement he had become aware during their last turn round the room that his mother was standing in the doorway watching them this time with loring in attendance and with a feverish flash of callous defiance he so guided their movements that they came to a standstill finally close before her congratulate us he cried gaily weve broken the record and congratulate me individually for ive had the most awfully glorious dance of my life hullo loring old man ill congratulate you both was mrs romaynes ready answer as loring nodded you both look as if you had had a good time wonderful show isnt it it isnt possible to say what it must have cost something appalling of course maud dear have you come across claudia eden over there dont you see isnt it outrageous by jove ejaculated julian lightly looking in the direction indicated by a slight movement of his mothers fan as miss pomeroy uttered an exclamation of pretty amazement conspicuous against all the magnificence about her was a girl in a kind of burlesque of an italian contadina dress of the period with very short skirts very low cut bodice very exaggerated head dress she was talking and laughing with a little crowd of men her manner was as pronounced and as unrefined as her dress but there was about her that absolutely unconscious and impenetrable self possession and self assurance which stamped her as being by birth that which she was certainly not in appearance a lady and a very highly born lady she would do anything to make a sensation murmured miss pomeroy contemplating her critically but have you two seen the gardens went on mrs romayne gaily no then you must simply go instantly the most marvellous thing i ever saw go along at once with a laugh julian turned to miss pomeroy we must do as we are bidden of course he said will it bore you frightfully a smile and the slightest possible shrug of the shoulders constituted miss pomeroys answer and they were turning away together followed by a keen glance from loring when the girl in the contadina dress passing close to them with her somewhat noisy court intercepted their passing evening maud she said in a loud good natured voice which might have been delicate and high bred if fashion had not demanded other characteristics hullo mr romayne like my frock maud miss pomeroy murmured something gracefully inaudible and mrs romayne said with a smile most original lady claudia a restless gleam had come into mrs romaynes eyes at the momentary pause but there was a certain satisfaction too in her smile as the two girls stood face to face maud pomeroy certainly never appeared to greater advantage than in contrast with a pronounced type of the modern society girl the juxtaposition seemed to bring into strong relief everything about her appearance and demeanour which was dainty gentle and sweet and to throw into shade all her more negative charm her voice now perfectly modulated and absolutely even made the other girl seem quite too vulgar as mrs romayne said to herself she echoed mrs romaynes words and added how came you to think of it i thought it would score returned the other with a laugh i cant stand these people dont you know i thought of getting a whole lot of us to do it it would have been no end of a joke then i thought that id keep it to myself ta ta and with a rough ungraceful gesture of farewell she passed on lady claudias hostess would strangle her cheerfully with her own hands remarked loring placidly mrs romayne laughed so would a great many other people she said but come you two be off and see these gardens julian and miss pomeroy moved away as if with one consent and mrs romayne watched them as they went with such a strange intentness in her face that she looked for the moment as though her consciousness were actually leaving her to follow the two on whom her eyes were fixed the idea of the whole entertainment had originated so people said in the fact that its giver had spent enormous sums of money in the course of the past three years on the transformation of his grounds into an italian garden and the scene from the terrace as julian and miss pomeroy stepped out on to it was indeed extraordinarily effective there was no moon and thousands of coloured lamps skilfully disposed shed a picturesque uncertain light under which the long ilex shaded alleys the box hedges the fountains and the statues produced an illusion which was almost perfect by jove exclaimed julian in the same strained excited voice capital isnt it it must be almost worth while to live away here in the wilds of fulham to have a place capable of being turned into a show like this dont you think so miss pomeroy did not answer immediately apparently the excitement created by their dance had rather strengthened than diminished during the interval and she was playing almost nervously with her fan miss pomeroy was not a nervous person as a rule i dont know she said vaguely yes its very pretty isnt it but i dont think i should much care to have a big place do you know i dont think places make much difference her voice was low and very prettily modulated and julian threw a quick sideways glance at her except for a flush and a certain look in her eyes which he could not see her face was as demure and placid as ever dont you he said you are right of course and i am wrong i can imagine circumstances under which all this would be a howling wilderness to me he looked at her very differently this time with his eyes recklessly eloquent she dropped her own eyes quickly and said softly can you they had strolled down the steps as they talked and at their right hand a picturesque little alley with a vista of fountain and statue against a grove of ilex trees led away from the more open space in front of the house down this alley secluded and apparently deserted miss pomeroy turned as if unconsciously before she spoke again julian followed her lead with an ugly smile on his face then she said in the same pretty low voice tell me what circumstances julian laughed and his laugh might well have been construed as a sign of extreme nervousness and agitation i think not he said i might make you angry you would not make me angry they came to the end of the alley as she spoke it opened out on a quaint little corner containing a fish pond surrounded by a stone balustrade the fountain in the middle sparkling and dancing in the gleam of the artificial moonlight which had been arranged here and there about the grounds to give the finishing touch to sundry bits into this moonlight maud pomeroy stepped and stood leaning gracefully over the balustrade gazing down into the water as she said in a voice just low and hesitating enough to be perfectly distinct mr romayne will you tell me did you think me very angry when you came to night i hope you are not angry now at least was the answer spoken with eager anxiety but i would rather think you had been angry than believe that you were quite indifferent as to whether i came or not i am not indifferent maud pomeroy paused there was no colour at all in her cheeks now and her lips were drawn together in a hard thin line such as no one had ever seen on her face before there was a dead silence a sudden stillness had come over julians figure as he stood also leaning against the balustrade but with his back to the water his hand was clenched fiercely against the stone i have no right to be angry with you maud pomeroy went on her voice was thin and hard as if its steadiness was the result of deliberate effort i have no rights at all if i had she let her voice die away again with deliberate intention the silence that followed had something ghastly in it at last with his face as white as death and keeping his eyes fixed steadily before him julian moved you will catch cold im afraid he said a little hoarsely shall we go in without a single word miss pomeroy moved also and retraced her steps up the alley for one moment and for one moment only her face was no longer that of a gentle and amiable girl but of a spiteful and vindictive woman chapter iv more than one of the people who had talked to mrs romayne in the interval had been vaguely aware of a certain incontrollable preoccupation behind her manner though the intense suppressed excitement in which that preoccupation originated passed undetected her restless eyes fastened upon miss pomeroy and julian on the very instant of their reappearance in the room and as they came towards her that excitement leapt up suddenly and lit up her whole face with a wild flash of hope and anticipation they drew nearer and it died down again even more suddenly than it had sprung up and in its passing it seemed to have aged her face curiously and to have left upon it a stamp of heart sick disappointment touched with a creeping anxiety miss pomeroy was pale and her usual still placidity seemed to be accentuated into absolute stupidity julians face was quite colourless and beneath the travesty of his usual manner which he assumed in speaking to his mother there was an indefinable expression which made him look ten years older and twenty years harder and more bitter scruples on his part as to crushing their dress prevented his going home with them he would follow in a hansom he said but before he arrived miss pomeroy had said good night to mrs romayne with a neatly turned and quite meaningless expression of the pleasure the evening had given her and had retired to her room mrs romayne looking haggard and worn lingered until julian came in and went out to meet him good night mother he said and went straight upstairs without pausing it was many many years since he had left her at night without a kiss and as mrs romayne went slowly up to her room through the silent house she stumbled once or twice as though her wide dry eyes hardly saw the stairs before her that creeping anxiety had gained ground greatly in her face the next morning when she came down at about half past ten to learn from the servant that mr julian had already breakfasted and had gone to the temple even more pathetic than the anxiety itself was the courage that battled against it that strove so hard to become confidence as she led and indeed sustained the conversation as she and miss pomeroy who was late in putting in an appearance breakfasted together she talked lightly and gaily of julians defection on this their visitors last morning she deplored the fact that it was indeed the last morning talking of various half formed schemes for such constant meetings as would be practically a continuance of the intimate association of the past fortnight but of response she obtained little or none an access of conventionality demureness and insipidity seemed to be inspiring miss pomeroy an access characterised by a certain absolute obstinacy of colourlessness she had no opinions no sentiments of any sort or kind to offer her expressions of regret at leaving were as unmeaning as they were correct mrs romaynes plans seemed to wither under her little non committal smile and comment and she took her irreproachable leave an hour later with a vaguely expressed hope that they might meet somewhere and apparently without hearing mrs romaynes parting allusion to julian each one of the days that followed seemed to leave upon mrs romaynes face some such effect as might have been produced upon a marble counterpart of that face by the delicate application of a sharp modelling tool every feature became a little sharper every line a little deeper a little harder nobody noticed the fact and nobody could have traced it to its source had they done so but there were times when she was alone times when that chisel under which she grew more haggard every day revealed itself as heart sick gnawing anxiety for three or four days miss pomeroys hope that they might meet somewhere remained unfulfilled and mrs romayne made little jokes at what she assumed to be julians disconsolate condition jokes which taken in conjunction with the look in her eyes as she spoke them were almost ghastly then the meeting took place at a party from which as it appeared miss pomeroy and her mother were just departing so that a few words of greeting on either side was all that passed mrs pomeroy and her daughter called on mrs romayne a day or two later it was mrs romaynes day of course the room was very full and as mrs pomeroy said with an expression as near apprehension as was compatible with her placidity in the eyes which kept turning to her daughters demure face wednesday is such a popular day and weve really dozens of calls to pay havent we maud consequently they stayed barely ten minutes and exchanged half a dozen sentences with their hostess but short and formal as the call was it was supplemented by no more intimate intercourse they met of course nearly every day that is to say mrs romayne as she went about indefatigably from party to party caught constant glimpses of miss pomeroy and her mother just arriving as she left just leaving as she arrived just going to supper to tea to fulfil some social duty or other which made it impossible that more than a word or two should pass when mrs romayne pressed miss pomeroy with sprightly reproaches to come and see her she was met invariably with unmeaning smiles and vague words about engagements which gentle as they sounded proved as little capable of manipulation as a stone once or twice after such a meeting mrs romaynes jokes at julians expense as she told him of them airily afterwards julian and miss pomeroy never seemed to meet now took the form of hints and innuendoes as to whether he was not at the bottom of the mystery as she called it and whether he could not perhaps sweep it away there was a terrible contrast between the casual gaiety with which such hints were dropped by her and the something which lay behind something which gave her voice a strange unnatural ring and cut her words off almost before they had any meaning something the name of which as it lurked in the hard bright eyes which never met julians was nervous fear such hints were always met and turned by julian as lightly as they were uttered before a fortnight had passed since miss pomeroys departure mrs romayne had acquired a habit of giving one quick almost furtive glance round any room she entered in which people were assembled and that look was particularly eager and intent as she entered a drawing room to fulfil an engagement for a luncheon party one day at the beginning of the third week a luncheon is by no means a bad opportunity for a quiet chat she did not see the figures she was in search of though no one could have detected that fact from her expression nor could any one have interpreted the sudden exclamation of surprise she uttered why its dennis falconer she said prettily i had no idea you were in town it was dennis falconer not a little altered by the past eight months and altered for the better six months earlier he had disappeared from the ken of his society acquaintances disappeared quietly almost imperceptibly by and by when his absence began to be commented upon rumour had whispered it abroad that he was laid up or something the fact so lightly stated and equally lightly commented on had meant for falconer a realisation of the possibilities hinted at by his doctor early in november he had passed from the dreariness of unoccupied and somewhat lonely club life into the infinitely heavier dreariness of a solitary sick room within his own limits and on his own lines dennis falconer was a strong man with his dark hour absolutely upon him he braced himself to meet it with stern dignity and he endured four months of physical suffering and mental tedium from which that suffering weary and unremitting as it was was seldom acute enough to relieve him with uncomplaining fortitude he was quite alone circumstances had occurred to detain dr aston in india and his solitude was not realised by any of his club acquaintances it was a period on which in after life he never willingly looked back a dark hour in truth but it was lived through at last and as it passed away it gave place to a clear and steady light in which the shadows which had preceded it had vanished severe as had been the means the end was amply attained he emerged from his sick room in such perfect physical health as he had not known for years all the disabilities under which he had laboured during the preceding summer were removed and in every nerve and muscle he was conscious of vigorous life in may he had received his doctors permission to return to his work and he was in london now to arrange the preliminaries of an expedition with which he hoped to leave england early in the autumn the physical change in him was conspicuous as he stepped forward to return mrs romaynes greeting he looked ten years younger than he had been wont to look the worn look of endurance had gone and there was an air of strength and power about him which was very noticeable hardly less striking was the change in his expression much of the grim austerity of his demeanour during the previous summer had originated in the painful depression consequent on his state of health much also in his realisation of his position as a man laid aside and solacing himself as best he might the gravity and reserve of his expression remained but the heaviness had disappeared completely his manner to mrs romayne as he shook the hand she held out to him was significant of the lighter and more tolerant point of view from which his own lighter prospects unconsciously led him to contemplate his fellow creatures it was neither expansive nor friendly but it lacked that undercurrent of stiff condemnation which had previously characterised it i have intended to call on you he said with grave directness i am sorry to appear negligent but my time is no longer at my own disposal mrs romayne put aside the claim on his time which he imputed to her with a quick gesture and a laugh you are quite recovered i hope she said easily tiresome business convalescence isnt it i am quite recovered i am thankful to say responded falconer he was so keenly conscious of all that the words meant for him that he was insensible even to the jarring effect her manner had always had for him i hope before very long to be at work again indeed i am practically at work now yes said mrs romayne prettily are you thinking of going abroad again i am going out to africa i shall hardly be in england again for another five years mrs romayne had been looking vaguely about the room evidently bestowing a modicum of her attention only on falconer but as he spoke the last words the slightest possible start passed through her frame and her wandering eyes suddenly ceased to wander there was a moments pause and then she turned them on falconers face really and when do you go there was something rather odd beneath the carelessness of her voice and her eyes as she fixed them on falconers were odd too i hope to leave england early in october mrs romayne made no reply her face suggested curiously that the actual exigencies of the situation had faded for her that she was not in the present at all for the moment there was no trace of that satisfaction and relief which would have been the natural consummation on such news of the defiance and distaste so hardly repressed in her manner to her connexion during the past year she looked apparently unconsciously into the grave steady mans face above her and there was a vague half formed expression in her eyes which might have been a suddenly stirred sense of loneliness or foreboding it was gone again in an instant and as the man who was to take her in to lunch approached her she turned from falconer with the lightest possible au revoir falconer found himself very well situated at luncheon a question came up on which his word carried weight and the discussion which ensued brought home to him that sense of renewed power and standing in the world so grateful to him after his long period of inaction he was full of grave content and satisfaction when after lunch circumstances threw him again with mrs romayne and his whole mental attitude was suffused with a dignified kindliness he began to speak at once with grave but not unfriendly interest and as though he were conscious of a certain remissness i am glad to hear of your son i hope it is quite satisfactory to you mrs romayne had acknowledged his vicinity with a conventional word and smile circumstances demanded of her at the moment no active exertion she was standing aside as it were for the instant and there were tired lines faintly visible about her mouth they disappeared however as if by magic beneath the hard intentness which leapt into her face as she turned sharply to falconer on his first words the movement was apparently involuntary for she turned away lifting with elaborate carelessness the long eye glasses which she had lately adopted as though to cover the first movement and said as she looked through them at something at the other end of the room its very stupid of me no doubt but i must ask you to explain the neutrality of her previous conversation with him had vanished as completely as the strange suggestion with which it had ended had vanished the old defiance apparently entirely uncalled for rang in her elaborately indifferent voice is it so old a story said falconer or is it perhaps a mistake he added with genuine regret i hope not a sensible marriage is such a safeguard a covenant with society i heard of your sons engagement some three weeks ago on what purported to be excellent authority did you hear the name of the young lady by any chance mrs romayne achieved a harsh little laugh as she spoke falconer glanced round the room and lowered his voice miss maud pomeroy he said a most desirable wife for him i should have said eight months before under the inexplicable influence of the face and manner of the pale dignified woman who had faced him so bravely in the little lodging in camden town dennis falconer had been almost ready to urge upon julian romayne marriage with the girl he was supposed to have ruined but he would have done so convinced in the recesses of his heart to which that womans influence could not penetrate that such a course must mean ruin to the young man and in the grim severity of his mental attitude at the time he would have said that such ruin was the just and righteous consequence of the young mans guilt clemences disappearance had frustrated the possibility of any such action on his part time and the pressing actualities of his own life had obliterated the impression made on him and the whole affair had gradually faded into the past insensibly to himself he looked upon it now conventionally enough as one of those dark episodes which are in no way to be obliterated or lightened but which may and must be overlaid to that end it seemed to him in the relaxation of his sterner attitude a thing so natural as to be necessarily condoned that julian should marry in his own class and settle down a moments pause followed on his words mrs romayne was sweeping the room with her eye glasses the hand which held them shook a little and if the man beside her could have known it she saw absolutely nothing maud pomeroy she said at last and she seemed to be unconscious of that moments interval of silence ah well to tell you the truth that is not such an extraordinary report though it hardly represents the fact at present young people will be young people you know and they must be allowed their little wilfulnesses she also had lowered her voice though it was high pitched and her speech was almost exaggeratedly confidential influenced by the tone into which they had thus fallen falconer said meaningly and not unkindly you have had to make no more serious allowances i hope since with a laugh so light and high as to be painfully out of tune mrs romayne answered him gaily in the negative one little peccadillo she said was not such a very terrible thing in a young mans record and she was charmed to say that with that little affair of which they both knew her anxieties on julians account had begun and ended she held out her hand to falconer as she finished her assurance parting with him with her brightest air of society friendliness and as he wished her good bye looking down into the trivial vivacity of her face falconer felt himself stirred for the first time by a certain touch of pity for her coming upon his softer mood and the comparatively friendly nature of their talk the eager assurance with which she spoke struck him as being not without pathos he had no confidence in julian and it occurred to him vaguely and with a sense of surprise that if the security so superficially founded should prove false the blow would be somewhat disproportionate to the lightness of the nature on which it must fall the next instant he recollected how largely her own actions would have contributed to bring about the blow and he dismissed her sternly from his thoughts as she passed out of the room mrs romayne went straight home though she had numerous calls on her list for the afternoon her eyes were even desperately bright and defiant and that same evening marston loring received a note asking him to come and see her on the following day he found her waiting for him in the drawing room at the hour she had appointed and she plunged into the matter in hand with an affectation of spontaneous confidence which was most effective she had sent for him in his capacity of fellow conspirator she told him she was in a little perplexity and she was turning to him as usual this with a charming smile to help her from this prelude she went on to speak of the strange change which had come about in the relations between herself and julian on the one hand and the pomeroys on the other lorings keen eyes had detected this change some time since by this time indeed it was being whispered about somewhat freely but he only listened with grave attention the upshot of her speech was did loring know anything about it had julian said anything had he spoken of any quarrel of any misunderstanding had his friend any kind of clue to give her as to his feelings on the subject the ease and gaiety of her manner which strove to give to the whole thing something the air of a joke was disturbed and broken as she came to the point by a feverishness about which there was nothing gay or light and some uncertainty as to how far she had gone seemed to pervade her mind and to produce a feeling that some kind of explanation was necessary you see she said it isnt always safe to go to the fountain head in these little matters a young man doesnt always care to be questioned by his mother one might give offence you know her tone was playful but her eyes were filled with the nervous fear which lurked in them so often when she and julian were alone together and the look on her face as she spoke her last words seemed to give to that fear a definite object it was the fear of giving offence to her son loring put the explanation aside with a smile but he had no words of enlightenment for her julian he said had preserved a total silence on the subject i will see what i can do he said finally with a smile that cancelled the offensiveness of the intention conveyed of pumping his friend and we will confer further meanwhile i know you will like to hear that his financial proceedings are prospering exceedingly and are discretion itself but the further conference which took place in a day or two was entirely fruitless as far as its nominal purpose was concerned loring did not reveal to mrs romayne the exceeding brevity and decision with which julian had dealt with any and every attempt to lead the conversation towards the pomeroys but he gave her to understand that at present he had nothing to tell her one night about a week later when she and her son came home in the dawn of the july day from a series of at homes mrs romayne instead of saying good night to julian at the door of her room as was her custom laid her hand suddenly on his arm and drew him just across the threshold her face was white to the very lips and there was a set desperation in it stronger even than the fear with which her eyes were full her voice as she spoke was breathless and uncertain as though her heart beat with painful rapidity julian she said what is it that has gone wrong between you and maud pomeroy a flash so quick in the passing that its intense bitterness was not to be detected passed across julians face it seemed to leave him armed with an expression of determined brightness which defied all emotion or sentiment i dont know that anything has gone wrong dear he said lightly his mothers hold on his arm tightened desperately i saw what happened to night in the supper room she said wont you her voice broke and there came to it a strangely beseeching note wont you tell me what it is julians face grew rather set and he paused a moment then he said still in the same tone it is nothing that i need worry you about dear something might be done if i knew what it was it could be set right i know no dear the words came from julian quickly and instantly and there was a decision and significance behind his light tone now her speech had created a necessity and he rose instinctively to meet it im awfully sorry to distress you but i assure you nothing can be done a girl must be allowed to know her own mind you know and a certain little question asked and answered the only thing left to the fellow is to retire gracefully im awfully sorry you are cut up about it i was afraid you would be never mind dear im in no particular hurry he had gained in fluency and expansiveness of manner as he proceeded the expedient had only occurred to him on the spur of the moment and as he finished he bent down and kissed her lightly on the forehead good night he said sleep as well as i intend to do he left her with a nod and a smile shutting the door behind him and mrs romayne stood for a moment motionless as she had received his kiss staring at the door through which he had disappeared then she began to rub her hands feebly against one another as though a great cold had seized her she was trembling from head to foot failed she spoke the word half aloud in a low shivering tone which gave to its isolated utterance a strangely weird effect chapter v marston loring was sitting at his writing table writing with an intentness which harmonised oddly with the suggestion of his evening dress correct and up to date in the minutest particular he had come rapidly out from the inner room two or three minutes before evidently acting upon a recently formed determination and he was writing now swiftly and decisively but there was nothing of rashness or impulsiveness about his face or manner as he wrote they were even keener more calculating and cynical than usual he finished his note directed it with the same decision pushed it aside and taking up an open letter which had been lying before him as he wrote leant back in his chair and began to re read it the note on which the ink was scarcely dry was addressed to a broker in the city the letter which he had taken up bore the postmark of a small town in south africa and was marked private and urgent three days had passed since julians explanation to his mother as to his relations with miss pomeroy marston loring had come back from south africa three months before with some very excellent machinery ready to his hand for the production of what would materially simplify and embellish his future career a large fortune that the machinery was such as a man of honour would have hesitated to put in motion that the hands which worked it could hardly escape unstained affected him not at all the stains were not such as could be pointed at it was hardly likely that they would be detected certain fellow mechanics were necessary to the proceedings one of these he had found in ramsay the other he had created so to speak in julian romayne the first noticeable production of that machinery had been that first decisive rise in welcomes at the end of june and since that time it had been worked mainly by the master mechanics ramsay and loring with unceasing skill energy and unscrupulousness various causes had co operated to prevent such a speedy consummation as loring had anticipated when he told julian that the inside of a month would see the end of the proceedings the month had gone by and the shares though they were now worth ten times as much as had been paid for them by the three in whose hands they lay had not yet touched the highest value to which it was proposed to raise them to which they were rising as a matter of fact with ever increasing rapidity and yet notwithstanding the apparent certainty that in another week his shares would have materially increased in value the note which loring had just written contained instructions for the disposal of all his interest in the welcome diamond mining company without fail on the following day a very small stone will put out of gear the most skilfully constructed and reliable machine a very small modicum of fact will reduce the most skilful and elaborate fiction to its elements the letter which loring was studying now with knit brows and compressed lips brought him private information which he knew might be public property twenty four hours later to the effect that the welcome diamond mine was under water as soon as that fact was generally made known shares in the company would be practically worthless he folded the letter and sat for a moment tapping it meditatively against the table he was thinking deeply not now about the actual contents of the letter but of a question which they had raised in his mind a question interwoven and complicated with other carefully laid plans finally he threw the letter down on the table with a movement of sudden resolution i must he said to himself it wont do to risk a row he glanced hastily at his watch and then drew out a sheet of note paper and wrote rapidly dear julian be here to morrow at ten sharp dont fail yours marston loring he directed the letter and then rose quickly took up the hat and light overcoat lying on a chair near him and went out with the letter in his hand at the porters lodge he stopped get this sent by hand this evening he said giving the man the letter addressed to julian the other letter he posted himself as he passed along the strand he was on his way to dine in curzon street and among his subsequent engagements for the evening the academy soire occupied a prominent place it was nearly twelve oclock when he arrived at burlington house and the vestibule and staircase were alike crowded with people going up and coming down smiling nodding and generally obstructing the way with a bland oblivion of any but their own individual rights to a passage at the foot of the stairs loring was seized upon and absorbed in a portentous obstruction of which the centre figure was mrs halse a truly electrifying figure in a painfully fashionable evening frock of a brilliant green i was just looking for a man she said in her usual strident tones they get such an extraordinary lot of people together here that picking out any one one knows is like looking for a needle in a bundle of hay i suppose nobody ever did look for a needle in a bundle of hay by the bye mr halse isnt here of course mr halse was seldom known to appear in public and when he did so his meek presence was obviously entirely devoid of interest for his wife and im looking after hilda compton her husbands coming to fetch her but he doesnt care about her going about alone quite right too i tell him she added with a laugh but of course it wont last hilda compton a three months bride was standing by looking like a hilda newton who had been born and bred in the centre of london society daring in dress self possessed in manner audaciously pretty in face she echoed mrs halses laugh and the latter went on to loring you can come upstairs with us its such a bore not to have a man and turning led the way that characteristic feature in her vociferous personality mrs halses hobbies had become crystallised to a great extent since hilda newtons engagement and marriage into a passion for matrimonial affairs not necessarily for match making match marring was quite as keen an interest with her the comments with which she beguiled their way into the first room were mainly called forth by the young men and maidens of her acquaintance who happened to catch her eye and whom she suspected of mutual likings or loathings they had drifted halfway across the room without coming within speaking distance of any one they knew when mrs halse broke off in an energetically whispered account of a certain pretty young womans partiality for according to mrs halse an unresponsive young man and exclaimed suddenly thats maud pomeroy over there isnt it its my belief that she wears those ridiculous white dresses so that people may have something to remember her by theres nothing in her face thats certain loring glanced through the doorway into the other room to where miss pomeroy in white silk was smiling very prettily upon a young man who was obviously if his countenance was to be relied upon making inane remarks to her he was a very rich young man and he had lately succeeded to a title loring smiled rather enigmatically it is surely impossible to associate two such dissimilar ideas as artifice and miss pomeroy oil and water you know milk and water you mean put in mrs compton with a laugh mrs halse responded to the little witticism with obstreperous hilarity and then turned suddenly and confidentially to loring and spoke in an eager semi whisper now perhaps you can tell me she said nobody who knows her seems to have been able to pick up anything not that she has any intimate friends that kind of girl never has but you know him and men gossip much more than women when alls said and done has she behaved infamously to him or has he behaved infamously to her has who behaved infamously to whom said loring smiling mrs halse unfurled her fan and began to waft it vigorously and excitedly to and fro you do know something about it she exclaimed hilda he wouldnt fence like that unless he knew something but youre not going to get out of it like that she continued addressing herself again to loring ill tell you plainly of whom i am talking and youll tell me plainly what has happened maud pomeroy is the she and young romayne is the he now then i give you my word that i know nothing about it i dont believe you was the answer given with uncompromising vigour and directness good heavens somebody must know something about it a month ago the romaynes and the pomeroys were never apart you couldnt go into a room without seeing him making eyes at her and her simpering up at him and their respective mammas exchanging confidences in corners i was within an ace of congratulating them all round heaps of times i lived with my mouth open to do it so to speak they all seemed so keen about it it was evidently a matter for fervent congratulation though why mrs pomeroy should have cared about it i cant think this parenthetically he wont have anything of his own while his mother lives i suppose maud fancied him its my belief that that poor woman darent call her soul her own where miss maud is concerned mrs halse paused but only for the purpose of taking breath that very necessary process being accomplished she continued her summary of the position then she goes to stay with prospective mamma in law and we all stand on tip toe and hold our breath she spends a fortnight there and the next thing we know is that the whole affair is apparently off off if you please no more making of eyes no more simperings no more confidences and no explanation of any sort or kind mr loring i cannot stand it and i insist on knowing what you know mrs halse you do know what i know that is nothing if a large and smart lady could by any possibility permit herself to stamp a large and heavy foot in the midst of a crowded and fashionable assembly mrs halse stamped hers at that moment she gazed for an instant into lorings imperturbable face and then becoming convinced of his sincerity she turned to mrs compton with a gesture of despair hilda she said if somebody doesnt find out something soon i shall die of suspense as it seemed not improbable from her demeanour at the moment that she would obviate the chances of such a calamity by hurling herself upon one of the objects of her interest and wresting a solution of the mystery from him or her by main force it was perhaps as well that at that moment a temporary distraction presented itself in the shape of a popular actor mrs halse was very fond of popular actors they had been a hobby with her at one time and in the movement and breaking up of the group which ensued loring drifted quietly away he had made his way gradually into the big room when he suddenly quickened his steps and began to thread his way skilfully and rapidly through the crowd mrs romayne was standing on the opposite side of the room smiling an invitation to him to come and speak to her mrs romayne had not been looking her best lately somehow the piquant style and daring colour which she affected hardly suited her as they had been wont to do to night there was a tired look upon her face which seemed to reveal some recently traced lines about her mouth lines of intense and almost dogged determination and to her sparkling eyes if she allowed them a moments repose there came a haggard look which had seemed for the last three days to lie only just beneath the surface but these were subtle hardly perceptible points and for the rest she remained a noticeably attractive woman of the most pronounced artificial type wheres the boy said loring easily when they had shaken hands is he here mrs romayne shook her head and laughed no she said he rather bars the soire a mistake i think one must take it for what it is of course an omnium gatherum of a perfectly preposterous nature looked at from that point of view its not unfunny do look at that girl over there she thinks her garment is a revelation to all beholders so it is returned loring drily mrs romayne laughed and dropped the glasses with which she had been coolly surveying the garment in question that was rather obvious wasnt it she said gaily by the bye did you want to see julian there was a moments pause after loring had replied pleasantly enough in the negative and then mrs romayne looked up at him suddenly and said its frightfully hot in here dont you think suppose we try one of the less popular rooms she stopped a moment and then added with her most artificial laugh of course you gather from that that im going to victimise you again yes i do want a little quiet talk with you whod be a conspirator there was nothing of the unwilling victim at least in lorings tone or manner as he deprecated her words nor was there either reluctance or tedium in his face as he followed her through the room on the contrary it was almost lighted up by an expression of sudden purpose mrs romayne led the way to the almost deserted miniature room and they began to walk slowly up and down to all intents and purposes alone together there seemed to be no particular point to mrs romaynes desire for a private conference with her fellow conspirator she talked about julian talked about him carelessly artificially but with a persistence which only another mother could have understood slipping in little questions now and then on all sorts of details connected with that business side of a mans life as to which she said women are always so in the dark and reverting again and again to her satisfaction and reliance in his mentor its rather absurd to quote those ridiculous old proverbs she said at last laughing affectedly but isnt there one or a fable or something about a duck whose chickens no a hen whose chickens it would be wouldnt it would take to the water and agitated her awfully because she couldnt go after them thats exactly what i feel like i assure you and i look upon you as an exceptionally sensible water bird who is also at home on the land a kind of connecting link humiliating similes arent they loring smiled in answer to her laugh but his tone as he answered her was rather grave not by any means humiliating as far as i am concerned he said for you assume a certain amount of sympathy between yourself and me may i tell you what a pleasure that idea gives me he spoke slowly and deliberately and mrs romayne started slightly she glanced up at his face for an instant unfurling her fan and using it gently as though the movement were an outlet for some sort of faint agitation loring was not looking at her his eyes were fixed for the moment on the opposite wall and his profile told her nothing there was a hardly perceptible pause and then he went on with an admirable mixture of deference admiration the depth of which seemed the greater in that it was rather suggested than expressed and the practical confidence of a man of the world dont think that i am underrating julian he said or that my regard for him personally is anything but a very warm and sincere affair when i tell you that it is a long time now since julian has figured in my thoughts as anything but his mothers son because he is his mothers son there are very few things i would not do for him very little trouble i would not take for him he hardly paused mrs romayne rather broke in on his speech with a high pitched laugh thats very kind and flattering she said and there was something astonishingly hasty and nervous in the way she spoke i hope it doesnt come upon you quite as a surprise answered loring with the slightest suggestion of a cynical smile unseen by mrs romayne i hope it doesnt need any words of mine to show you what i have tried to show you in more practical ways you have honoured me with a great deal of confidence and you have honoured me still further by putting it in my power to be of some slight service to you will you not give me still further powers in that direction will you not make our interests practically one by becoming my wife he turned to her as he finished and in spite of the admirable composure and deference with which he had spoken his eyes were very eager and elated almost as though with anticipated triumph mrs romayne met his eyes and stood for a moment gazing into them speechless and motionless as though the blank astonishment written on every line of her face had absolutely paralysed her mr loring she said at last and there was an almost bewildered remonstrance in her low astonished tone my dear mr loring one moment he interposed quickly of course i dont ask you to look upon it as anything but a question of expediency and mutual goodwill and esteem we are both of us very well aware that london is not arcadia you wont consider it brutal frankness on my part im sure if i tell you that from a financial point of view our positions are not unequal i have been exceptionally fortunate lately and i can offer you an income of about five thousand a year and if a mans assistance and support counts for something in your life as i hope it may mrs romayne interrupted him with all the tact and practicality of a woman of the world she had mastered her amazement and was mistress of the situation she spoke kindly and composedly with just that touch of delicate concern which the occasion demanded dont say any more please it is really quite impossible a sudden flash of surprise passed across marston lorings face and he paused a moment his keen eyes fixed scrutinisingly on her face he was trying to detect there some signs of that coquetry or affectation of reluctance which he believed must surely underlie her words his scrutiny failed to detect anything of the kind however and an unpleasant glitter came into his eyes impossible is a rather curt word he said may i ask you to amplify it he saw the colour rise beneath her paint as she answered i have not the faintest intention of marrying in the first place and even if there were not innumerable other reasons against what you propose im afraid i have no fancy for making myself ridiculous oh of course i am well aware she laughed a little that in my capacity of silly old mother i am as ridiculous as any woman need be but really i cannot add another farcical part to that farcical rle and that farcical part would be enquired loring that of the old wife of a young husband she answered with artificial mirth mr loring i am really sorrier if you are indeed disappointed than i can tell you if you have thought that i encouraged you but that is too utterly preposterous i have considered you simply as my sons friend almost my sons contemporary a young man with an exceptionally wise and reliable head certainly not as a young man who would be foolish enough to want to marry a woman old enough to be his mother lorings lips were rather thin and his eyes glittered dangerously as she stood looking at him then with a certain softening excitement about her face there was no slightest suggestion of age about her nothing but an admirably developed and preserved maturity and loring was a young man in nothing but years that is a mere form of words if you will pardon my saying so he said and his voice was dangerously quiet and controlled there is difference between us in years of course but that goes for nothing in experience in knowledge of the world if i may say so the difference between us is practically nil i am as you say your sons friend but is that a reason for refusing me a larger form of the right which you yourself have pressed upon me to watch over him and to supplement your care where it must inevitably fall short for julians sake he was confronting her now looking straight down at her and as he spoke the last words all the concern and agitation partly affected partly real with which her face had been moved vanished before a set expression of unalterable resolution for julians sake she said in a low decisive voice it is impossible he stood for a moment watching her all the evil of his face standing out in intense relief and then he made a slight cold gesture of acquiescence may i take you back into the large room he said she held out her hand to him with an eager gesture of apology and appeal we are friends still she murmured and the murmur was almost pathetically genuine in its anxiety it makes no difference lorings mouth was not good to look at as he answered in a tone absolutely destitute of expression certainly not chapter vi if evil thoughts and evil passions could have a tangible effect upon the physical atmosphere the air of marston lorings room an hour later should have been thick and heavy he was sitting thrown back in an easy chair his evening coat replaced by a smoking jacket a glass of whisky and seltzer water close to his hand there were also cigars on the table but he was not smoking he was staring straight before him into vacancy his face was pale and set with vindictive passion to the existence of which in his nature the general callousness of his expression gave no clue it was many years since marston loring had felt as he felt to night it was many years since he had been foiled and thwarted made a fool of as he himself would have said and all that was blackest and worst in the man was roused by the process his life ever since he had realised at the age of twenty five that there were prizes in the world which some men obtained and other men failed to obtain had been ruled by a series of carefully made and elaborately worked out calculations everything he had done and everything he had not done had been included in one or other of these calculations carefully designed to meet certain ends all of which met and culminated in the one great end of existence as he conceived it material prosperity and position he had been perhaps as vicious a youth as could have been found in london and he had not ceased to be vicious as a man but he so managed his vices that even the reputation which clung to him had contributed to his success the question of marriage he had discussed with himself on more than one occasion always solely from the point of view of expediency and just about the time when mrs romayne made her appearance in london society he had come to the conclusion that given the right sort of woman the step might possibly prove advantageous he had been considerably struck by mrs romayne from the first she was the kind of woman he greatly admired and he was well aware that to be on terms of intimacy with such a social power was an excellent thing for a man in his position a position which as he was also well aware was by no means so secure as most people supposed it was from this point of view that he had cultivated julian and at first from this point of view only the idea of mrs romayne as a possible wife occurred to him later but when it did occur it developed into active intention with considerable rapidity he had looked at the question from every possible point of view and decided that nothing could suit him better he had no taste for young women he admired mrs romayne as much as it was possible to him to admire any one she was the kind of woman he could get on with he told himself she possessed exceptional advantages in the matter of social standing and she had money her eager cultivation of him during the autumn that followed her first season in town convinced him that with a little trouble she could be brought to forget the disadvantage of his comparative poverty and he would have proposed to her in the ensuing winter had not his voyage to the cape prevented he had come back with the prospect of a fortune of his own but the fact made no difference to his matrimonial plans where there is money more money is always to be desired mrs romaynes fortune was no longer absolutely necessary to him but it had not ceased to be desirable and her other advantages remained intact she had received him with enthusiasm she had cultivated him assiduously she had absolutely led him on as it seemed to loring he in common with the rest of the world regarded her relations with her son as the merest pose and her appeal for his help with julian had seemed to him simply the most transparent of subterfuges he had no more doubted that she would accept him than he had doubted his own existence and now his plans were frustrated his calculations were falsified and his very practical and material castles in the air were laid in the dust he was refused he roused himself at last and the faintest suggestion of a cruel smile curved his thin lips he lifted the glass by his side drank off its contents and then turned out the lamp and went into the inner room his face was quite itself the next morning the scowl and the cruelty had alike disappeared and it was with an even less cynical smile than usual that he looked up from his morning paper at a few minutes past ten oclock as the door opened with a hasty knock and julian romayne appeared good morning dear boy said loring pleasantly morning old man responded julian he was looking rather pale and anxious and he went on quickly nothing wrong with welcomes i hope loring smiled again nothing in the world as far as i know he said gaily what a nervous fellow you are what an unreasonable fellow you are retorted julian the cloud vanishing from his face as if by magic what do you mean by dragging a poor wretch down here at this hour in the morning whether he will or no whats up it was some legal business it appeared and loring proceeded to go into it with great circumstance it sounded very important as he put it but julian took his leave declaring gaily that he didnt see where the urgency came in youre such an abominably hard working fellow he said lightly perhaps returned loring its not such a bad principle and its an excellent character to have let me tell you by the bye julian he continued as the young man turned away with a laugh and laid his hand on the door how would you like to have a few more welcomes he rose as he spoke and stood leaning against the mantelpiece with his back to the empty grate confronting julian as the young man turned sharply towards him what do you mean said julian are there any in the market well yes said loring quietly the fact is theres a certain shooting in scotland which i have coveted for years its for sale now and on uncommonly reasonable terms of course its appalling extravagance on my part for the shares are going up every day but i am going to sell a thousand pounds worth of welcomes to day and buy that moor it is extravagance said julian and there was an eager light in his blue eyes like to have the shares said loring imperturbably julian hesitated i should like them of course he said rather breathlessly so would lots of other fellows but you see my thousands what there were of them are all locked up in the welcome already you wouldnt think it worth while to borrow i suppose enquired loring carelessly theres a little difficulty known as security for some fellows of course was the answer but not for you youve got money coming to you julian coloured a dull red and looked down at the carpet moving his foot to and fro uneasily the idea of raising money on a reversion for such a purpose was for the moment inexpressibly repugnant to him the shares are going up every day said loring you ought to make a good thing of it and youll sell at the end of this week i take it however of course i dont want to press you theyll go off fast enough julian lifted his head suddenly and drove his clenched hand deep down into his pocket ill do it he said all right loring ill take them to day said loring suavely to day returned julian almost fiercely he turned and left the room abruptly without another word and loring with the smile of the night before touching his lips once more took up his paper again apparently he had forgotten the letter he had received from south africa on the previous day and the news it contained chapter vii it was six oclock on the following day and in the sunset light of the july evening a light with which the bustling hurrying unlovely crowd on which it fell seemed strangely out of harmony the current of human life was setting strongly in every direction from the city along cornhill going against the stream but driven nevertheless at a pace which was looked upon far from favourably by the police occupied in regulating the traffic there came a hansom cab in the cab with one hand gripping the doors until the knuckles stood out white was julian romayne his hat was pulled slightly forward over his brow as if with some half conscious sense of the ghastliness of his face some instinct to hide that ghastliness from casual eyes his face was of a livid pallor there were grey shadows about the mouth which was set into hard lines of temporary and difficult self control his nostrils not sensitive as a rule quivered slightly as the pace of his horse slackened perforce now and again he gave no other slightest sign of consciousness of his surroundings the cab turned out of cornhill and in another second pulled up suddenly almost before the cab had stopped julian flung open the doors and leapt out he paid the man double his fare dashed into the building before which they had stopped and up the stairs to an office on the second floor his hand was shaking like a leaf as he stretched it out to try the lock of the door it yielded to his touch and he flung it roughly open and passed rapidly in the outer office had only one occupant a rather feeble looking little man who was trying to improve the appearance of a shabby hat by a careful application of his coat sleeve he looked up with a start on julians entrance and an expression of comprehending concern dawned on his face he was the messenger of the welcome diamond mining company before he could speak however a hoarse peremptory question broke from julian mr ramsays not gone not yet sir was the answer given with timid alacrity hes here later than usual to night you see in consequence but before the first words were fairly uttered julian had crossed the room and as he reached the second door leading into the inner office it opened quietly and ramsay stood on the threshold he was looking as imperturbable and uninterested as usual and his voice was dry indifference itself as he observed i have been expecting you all day without a word julian strode past him into the managers room and then as ramsay shut the door calmly he said in a quick unnatural tone which also carried with it a curious suggestion that he had not even heard ramsays words its a mistake its a mistake it must be ramsays only answer was a slight shrug of the shoulders as his dull eyes rested apparently with complete indifference upon julians face and the latter went on rapidly and unevenly ive only just heard ive been out of town all day ive come to hear to see what can be done the last words were hardly audible as though his mouth was so parched that he could hardly articulate he lifted his hand as if involuntarily and pushed back his hat fixing a pair of fierce burning eyes upon ramsay theres nothing to be done of course said ramsay drily the things collapsed a harsh wild laugh rang through the room its faint echoes startling the little man in the outer office collapsed cried julian collapsed by heaven he put out one hand gropingly caught at a chair near him and dropped heavily into it letting his face fall forward upon his folded arms as they rested upon its back only half an hour had passed since he had gone to his rooms in the temple after a picnic on the river to find waiting for him there a telegram from ramsay and into that half hour had been compressed such a desperate stand against despair as is little less terrible than despair itself the telegram had told him that on the opening of the stock exchange that morning it had been spread abroad on unimpeachable authority that the welcome diamond mine was under water this evening the inevitable sequel of such a fact as he knew too well shares in the welcome diamond mining company were so much waste paper ramsay stood for a moment looking at him with a rather curious expression on his inexpressive face its a turn of the game he said drily if you stand to win you must stand to lose too you hadnt thought of that i suppose with a sudden tumultuous movement as though his agony of mind was no longer to be endured in stillness julian sprang from his chair and began to walk up and down the room with hasty uneven strides thought of it he cried what was there to make one think of it it was a certainty yesterday man a certainty a spasm passed across his face and seemed to cut off his words and ramsay observed sententiously its a mistake to reckon anything as a certainty till you hold it in your hand julian faced round suddenly and confronted him his eyes blazing every feature working what the devil is the good of saying things like that he demanded cant you understand that i have reckoned on it as you call it cant you understand that it was all or nothing with me and i am just done cant you understand he broke off suddenly and turning away with a heavy groan flung himself into a chair and let his face fall forward on the table for all that he was face to face with at that moment he could have found no words the remorse the sense of failure and helplessness the despair which seemed to be tearing his heart to pieces were one intolerable anguish ramsay followed him with his eyes and then crossed the room quietly and stood beside his bowed figure which was shaken now and again from head to foot is it so bad as this boy he said quietly then as there came no answer he went on meditatively ten thousand pounds ten thousand isnt so much to lose counters in the game thats all he paused and after a moment julian lifted his face haggard and drawn its the stake you must look to he said my stake was heavy ramsay oh youre right enough ten thousand pounds isnt much i borrowed a thousand yesterday raised it on a reversion to get hold of some shares loring wanted to sell that wasnt much either of course he had spoken in a dreary monotonous voice which was inexpressibly hopeless and ramsays eyes were fixed keenly on him as their owner said drily you bought a thousand pounds worth of lorings shares yesterday did you know that he was selling out all his interest in the welcome julian turned with a quick startled movement and then paused all his interest he repeated he wanted a thousand to pay for a scotch moor that was all he sold every share he had yesterday returned ramsay curious coincidence you dont mean to tell me the eyes of the two men met and julian sprang to his feet with a fierce imprecation he knew it he cried he knew it and kept it dark that he might keep the market to himself it isnt possible ramsay it isnt possible nothing is impossible returned ramsay quietly a savage hissing breath came from between julians set teeth and he seemed literally alive with passion without a word he stretched out his hand for his hat and turned to leave the room ramsay quietly intercepted his passage where are you going he said im going to see mr loring the slightest possible smile touched the elder mans lips and he said all right i shall have something to say to mr loring too but listen to me first was it a desperate necessity to you to pull off this affair julian did not speak his lips twitched for a moment then settled into a thin line and the look in his eyes was answer enough very good then said ramsay come and see me here to morrow at six i may be able to give you a hand with a gesture of uncomprehending assent but with no word of answer julian turned away and left the room three quarters of an hour later he was coming rapidly down the staircase which led from lorings chambers his face was flushed and quivering and every pulse was beating madly like the pulses of a man who has just given unrestrained expression to furious passion he turned on to the embankment and began to walk away in a headlong fashion evidently neither knowing nor caring where he was going and as he walked the tumultuous life and glow of his face died slowly out and settled into a haggard sullen mask of dull despair he had spoken his mind to loring and now there was nothing more for him to do chapter viii we are all the slaves of man my dear lady bracondale you are kept in town because parliament insists on keeping your husband and i am kept in town because oh because the most capricious young man in london happens to be my son an afternoon call in the first week of august is distinctly an anomaly and seems to partake somewhat of the nature of a visit of condolence parliament was sitting late this year and those hapless wives who considered it their duty to wait in town until their legislating husbands were released visited one another and were visited by the one or two acquaintances detained in london by other causes in a manner which betrayed a combination of martyrdom and shamefacedness lady bracondale who was nothing if not a personification of duty done or in the act of doing was being condoled with or called upon on this particular august afternoon by two distinct sets of sympathising acquaintances two sets which in spite of placid words and pretty speeches seemed to be entirely incapable of amalgamation mrs romayne and mrs pomeroy and her daughter who had arrived a few minutes later and it was to mrs pomeroy that lady bracondale who had a peculiar gift for saying in a stately and condescending manner the things which quicker perceptions would have recognised as not being precisely the best things to be said under the circumstances turned as mrs romayne stopped speaking i suppose mrs romayne looks upon you as the exception that proves her rule she said for it is not a case of manly compulsion with you i believe i hope your sister goes on well mrs pomeroy having neither husband nor son was detained in town by the presence in her house of the sister whom she had visited earlier in the year and who had spent the last month under the care of a london doctor but her tone was as placid as ever as she replied thank you i believe they consider her nearly recovered for the time being she hopes to go home this week and then maud and i will go and pay some country visits we dont think of going abroad this year i shouldnt feel easy to be out of england while my sister remains in this state but thats not compulsion at all exclaimed mrs romayne gaily you are acting entirely on your own impulse now just consider my hard case we were going to pontresina you know im very fond of pontresina its such a dear bright amusing place and we were to have started yesterday now imagine my feelings when two nights ago that boy of mine came home and said that on the whole he thought hed rather not go abroad this year hes taken with an enthusiasm for his profession if you please and he must needs stay somewhere quiet so he says and work at it i must do him the justice to say that he was awfully apologetic dear fellow mrs romayne laughed her little affected maternal laugh he was very anxious that i should go without him and even offered to give up his own plan when he found how preposterous i thought that part of his idea there was not the faintest difference in mrs romaynes voice by which it would have been possible to tell that her last statement was even less veracious than any other part of her speech and that julians proposal to give up his plan was a figment of the moment only and then of course i gave in she continued of course he knew i should the wretch and were to have a cottage on the river and spend six weeks there she finished with a little grimace and lady bracondale observed politely im afraid you will find it rather dull i shall find it very dull returned mrs romayne with ingenuous frankness i shall be bored to death but then you all know that i am really a very ridiculous woman and if my lord and master is content there is nothing more to be said hes kind enough to assure me that there are lots of nice people about i dont know what kind of nice people one is likely to find about the river in august and september but i take his word for it i believe the comptons have a house boat somewhere observed miss pomeroy it was her first contribution to the conversation and it was made apparently rather because conventionality by this time demanded a remark of some sort from her than from any interest in the subject before any reply could be made the door opened and marston loring was announced mrs romayne had been looking rather sharp featured and there was a great restlessness in her eyes it seemed to leap up and then settle suddenly into comparative repose as they rested on marston loring and as he turned to shake hands with her she greeted him gaily it was their first meeting since the night of the academy soire but lorings manner was absolutely unmoved his greeting to her differed in nowise from his greeting to the other two ladies and if that fact in itself involved a subtle change in his demeanour towards her the change was observed by one pair of eyes only a pair of demure brown eyes miss pomeroy had been a good deal interested in marston lorings comings and goings during the fortnight she spent in queen anne street i thought you were gone mrs romayne said lightly what are you doing in town to day may one ask when you were booked to start for norway yesterday business he returned in a tone which addressed the whole company rather than any member of it individually i am investing in a scotch moor and i cant leave london till i have signed and sealed there was a delicate implication of wealth about the statement which seemed to give a curious fillip to the conversation and an animated discussion ensued on scotland its charms and its disadvantages mrs romayne held her part in the discussion with unfailing readiness and as the subject exhausted itself she rose to take leave she said good bye in her usual charming manner to her hostess and to mrs pomeroy and her daughter and then she turned to loring by the bye she said carelessly ive a piece of property of yours in the carriage did you know you had lost something when you called the other day no i shant tell you what it is you very careless person but ill give it you if you like to come down for it she turned away loring followed her perforce and there was an ugly smile on his face as he did so at the foot of the stairs she paused then with a quick glance towards an open door which led into a dining room she went rapidly towards it signing to him to follow her once within the room she turned and faced him she was smiling still but the smile was stiff and mechanical and her eyes as she fixed them on his face were desperately anxious there was a curious ring of conscious helplessness and reliance on the man to whom she spoke about her voice as she began to speak i wanted to speak to you she said im so glad to see you im rather perplexed julian has taken it into his head to stop in town or rather close to town he wont go abroad he wont visit can you tell me the reason will you try and find out the reason may i rely on you but of course i know i may there was a tone almost of relief in her voice as if in the mere making of the confidence in the sense of companionship and support it gave her she found some sort of ease and loring smiled again as he met her eyes im sorry to have to dispel an illusion which is so flattering to me he said with the slightest possible accentuation of his usual quiet cynicism of manner but its useless to assume that i can be of any further service to you he stopped watching with keen relentless eyes the effect of his words a startled look came to the face turned towards him the eyebrows were lifted and contracted with a quick movement of perplexity evidently she believed that she had not fully understood him for she did not speak and he went on your son and i have quarrelled he has insulted me grossly for the future we are strangers to one another consequently you will see that i shall be no longer able to keep him out of mischief there was an indescribable tone in his voice ominous and vindictive and as he spoke mrs romaynes face seemed to grow old and her eyes dilated it can be put right she said in a quick uncertain voice he will apologise you will forgive loring interrupted her very coldly and incisively he will not apologise he said and i should not accept any apology i neednt suggest of course that under the circumstances our acquaintance much as i regret this had perhaps better cease they faced each other for another moment and into mrs romaynes eyes there crept a sick despair strangely incongruous with the surface appearance of the position then she seemed to recover herself as if with a tremendous effort of will she drew herself up bowed her head with grave dignity and moved to leave the room he held the door open for her with an absolutely expressionless countenance she passed down the hall to where the servant was waiting at the door went out and got into her carriage alone loring stood at the foot of the stairs watching her and then turned with a cruel contentment in his eyes and went upstairs again to the drawing room the two elder ladies were sitting with their heads very close together as he opened the drawing room door evidently deep in some question of domestic importance and standing by a conservatory window at the other end of the room a rather bored looking figure in its solitary girlishness was maud pomeroy the occasion being as has been said something of an anomaly conventions were not so strict as usual lady bracondale just glanced up with a vague smile as loring reappeared and then became absorbed in conversation as he strolled across to maud pomeroy she looked up at him with a faint smile has mrs romayne gone she said he signified a careless assent and then said you are looking rather bored do you know miss pomeroy suppose we go and look at the flowers until were wanted she hesitated a moment and then moved idly into the conservatory looking back at loring with a smile as he followed her i was a little bored she confessed it is very kind of you to come and amuse me for the next moment or two loring could hardly be said to prove himself very amusing he sauntered round the little conservatory at his companions side his eyes fixed keenly upon her impassive profile with something very calculating in their depths miss pomeroy also was apparently absorbed in thought and did not notice his silence you are a great friend of the romaynes are you not she said at last in her thin even very proper tones loring glanced at her again well he said thats not a question that its particularly easy for me to answer to day i have been on fairly intimate terms with them as you know but do you know what that kind of thing sometimes leads to miss pomeroy shook her head well there is such a thing as knowing people too well said loring deliberately and then you find out little traits that dont do to tell you the truth romayne and i have quarrelled im glad of that said miss pomeroy softly he looked at her quickly but he was not quick enough to catch the spiteful gleam in her eyes would it be inquisitive to enquire why he said i dont think mr romayne is a nice young man was the answer i would rather people i like she broke off in pretty confusion i would rather you werent a friend of his mr loring i think theres a great deal about him that nobody knows indeed said loring interrogatively and quietly you see she said with charming seriousness i think a girl can often feel whether a man is nice or nasty quicker than another man can mr loring has mr romayne ever said anything to you oh please dont think its very odd of me to say such things to you has he ever said anything that made you think he might be married there was a hardly perceptible pause a hardly perceptible flash of comprehension on lorings face and the vindictive satisfaction in his eyes deepened what makes you ask me that he said in a tone which seemed to fence gravely with the suggestion rather than to repudiate it miss pomeroy responded with growing conviction because im quite sure that he is married and of course as he doesnt own it there must be something something not nice about it and it does seem to me so wrong that people should like him so much when he isnt a bit what they think he is the mans eyes and the girls eyes met at that moment for the first time the girls were perfectly clear mild and expressionless and into the mans there stole a cynical tinge of admiration by jove he said to himself she is clever at that instant mrs pomeroys voice was heard from the drawing room calling placidly for her daughter and miss pomeroy moved forward with graceful promptitude into the drawing room we shall meet in scotland by and by i believe said loring pleasantly as he shook hands with miss pomeroy you were to be at the stewarts i believe in the last week of september and so am i i shall look forward to it good bye miss pomeroy good bye mr loring a few minutes later loring also took leave of lady bracondale and went away the satisfaction was stronger than ever in his eyes maud pomeroys words had somehow or other carried instantaneous conviction to his mind and in the fact he believed them to contain he saw certain social ruin for julian romayne hes done for himself all round he said to himself as he let himself into his rooms half an hour later that nice little house in chelsea will be to let next season at that same moment in the managers room at the offices of the welcome diamond mining company julian romayne was standing by the table looking down at ramsay as the latter sat leaning back in his chair indifferent enough in attitude but with a hard intensity of expression in his dull eyes julian had evidently just risen pushing back his chair the back of which he was gripping almost convulsively his face was ashen his eyes were dilated with an expression of desperate intolerable temptation ill do it he was saying in a harsh unnatural voice ill do it ramsay shake hands on it chapter ix the cottage which mrs romayne had taken for august and september on julians refusal to go abroad was situated a few miles above henley it was a very charming little house to which the term cottage was applicable only in mock humility and it was very charmingly situated it had a delightful garden not large but full of roses and sunflowers and all sorts of things as mrs romayne explained to julian after her visit of inspection its lawns sloped down to the river and altogether on the same authority it was a wonderful chance to get hold of it the statement which mrs romayne had made to lady bracondale on julians authority that there were nice people about had originated as a matter of fact not with julian but with his mother herself it was quite true nevertheless but apparently julians sudden desire for quiet had proved infectious the acquaintance between herself and her present neighbours being of the slightest mrs romayne made no such attempt as might have been expected of her to develope that acquaintance she seemed to be strangely without impetus in herself towards action of any kind she was resting some people might have said she was pausing certainly but whether as the days went on her life did not signify rather temporary and enforced quiescence than the peaceful and pleasant suspension of labour might have been an open question it was a hot bright august day after day the sun shone steadily down as julian departed for town after an early breakfast at which his mother never failed to appear day after day it shone through all the long little broken hours upon the quiet house and garden about which the one womans figure moved in almost total solitude until with the evening julian returned again evening after evening the mother and son spent alone but by no means always together after their dinner during which conversation seldom flagged between them any more than it would have flagged between two friendly and well bred acquaintances mrs romayne would sit in the drawing room with a bit of fashionable fancy work in her hand into which she only occasionally put a stitch and sometimes julian would spend half an hour with her there reading the newspaper and carrying on the talk of dinner or sometimes he would stroll out into the garden at once and come in only just before bed time mrs romayne never followed him and never questioned him perhaps it was the curiously still life she led which brought so strange and still an expression to her face a stillness which suggested a slow wearing waiting and a mingled concentration watchfulness and patience it was an evening in the second week of september and she was walking up and down the lawn in the fading sunset light she was moving with slow regular steps with the monotonous motion of a woman to whom the even movement brought some sort of relief or soothing there was an indescribable touch of desolateness about her lonely figure as she moved up and down before the empty house a servant came out to her by and by with some newly arrived letters she took them and then her monotonous motion being perforce suspended a sense of physical fatigue seemed to assert itself and she sat down on a low basket chair a sigh came from her as she did so one of those sighs which in their unconsciousness are so suggestive of habitual suffering she paused a moment looking away into space with absent eyes then she seemed to rouse herself and took up one of the letters as if forcing herself to seek relief from the current of her monotonous thoughts she had opened the envelope and read the letter half through in a mechanical uninterested way when its contents seemed suddenly to arrest her attention a change came to her expression a change which in its slight quickening and revival showed how dulled almost numbed it had been before she turned once more to the beginning of the letter and read it again glenfyle ross shire dear mrs romayne i am so sorry to have to ask you to postpone the visit which you had promised us for the end of this month i find that by some stupid mistake my husband and i have given separate invitations for the same date as there is unfortunately no doubt that his invitation was given first there falls upon me the very disagreeable task of explaining the situation to you and your son and begging you to forgive me yours truly marion stewart mrs romayne leant back in her chair not indolently but with an intent consideration in every line of her figure and letting the hand that held the letter fall on her knee she sat gazing at the written words with sharp angrily sparkling eyes which looked as though they were bent on piercing through the words themselves to the meaning which she believed they hid she was evidently surprised and annoyed as evidently she gave not an instants credence to the reason alleged for the postponement of the visit in question and the slight involved in this postponement indefinite as she noticed with an unpleasant little smile seemed to stimulate her her face had grown even vindictive when her eyes fell on the postmark of the second letter lying on her knee it was that of the same little scotch town the name of which was stamped upon the already opened envelope she took it up eagerly and as she saw the handwriting she paused for an instant and a flash of intense consideration passed across her face then she tore it hastily open it was from mrs pomeroy and it conveyed in three long winded and incoherent sheets a piece of news which the writer was sure would delight mrs romayne dear maud the letter said was just engaged to that charming mr loring mrs pomeroys mind seemed to be in a state of somewhat considerable confusion between a theoretical and conventional sense that it was very sad for her to lose her daughter and a certain practical and actual sense which by no means harmonised with the theoretical one and all unconsciously threw a good deal of light on the relations between the mother and daughter as they actually existed the coherence of the letter was further disturbed by sundry sentences which dovetailed so oddly into the general fabric that they had somewhat the appearance of being inserted to order sentences which conveyed various repetitions of dear mauds assurance of mrs romaynes congratulations and various repetitions of the statement that mr lorings financial position had recently improved amazingly and that he was sure of a seat in parliament at the forthcoming general election he has been staying with the stewarts during the whole of our visit to them the letter ended dear lady marion has been so kind about it and taken such an interest ah the exclamation uttered evidently involuntarily just above her breath came from mrs romaynes lips sharply and bitterly she had read the letter through with certain quick movements of her eyebrows and mocking smiles coming and going about her thin lips and they smiled again as she folded the letter deliberately and put it back into its envelope she was looking thoroughly roused now and there was a confidence in her alert determined expression it was the kindling up of martial spirit at a challenging trumpet call from a well known battlefield if marston loring and his future wife were indeed arranging their forces for the undermining of mrs romaynes social position and miss pomeroy and loring between them could have pieced out a very sufficient explanation of lady marion stewarts note the campaign judging from appearances at that moment was likely to be far from a tame one mrs romayne was still sitting with the letters in her hand tapping one foot with impatient vigour upon the grass and there was the same eager intentness in her eyes when from the house behind her the sound of a dinner bell rang out she started violently and in the start something seemed to fall between her and the subject on which her thoughts had been busy a curious shade of that new stillness replaced the energy on her face it was the dressing bell and she rose mechanically and as she turned towards the house her eyes fell upon the figure of julian he had evidently been standing on the verandah and as she rose he had turned and was disappearing into the house another shade of stillness fell upon her face as though the letters she had received and the feelings they had stirred had receded into the distance it often happened that the mother and son did not meet on julians return home in the evening until dinner time and it happened so this evening the dinner bell was ringing when julian came downstairs with a quick word or two of apology and followed his mother into the dining room julian looked as though his months hard work had by no means agreed with him his face was even painfully thin and worn and there was an expression of hard concentration about it which seemed to age it strangely his eyes were rather sunken it was a curious feature of a change in him less easily defined that his likeness to his mother had faded considerably all the character of his face now seemed to originate about his mouth that mouth of which mrs romayne had been wont to say with affected gaiety that it was like nobody in particular that mouth which had been a somewhat weak and undecided feature there was nothing undecided about it now and mrs romayne never looked at it without a deepening of that stillness on her face it was set into heavy resolute lines no one indeed judging from the bare outline of julians daily life during that hot august could have wondered at the signs of physical wear and tear that he exhibited ten oclock on every one of those sultry days found him at work not indeed in the temple but in an office in the city and it was from the same office that he would issue forth at about five oclock to catch the train for henley sometimes with sullen determination sometimes with a pale fierce excitement on his face the affairs of the welcome diamond mining company had readjusted themselves after the blow which had threatened the companys very existence as hardly the most sanguine could have hoped ten days after the announcement of the presence of water in the mine some of the newspapers published another telegram which had been received by the directors the passage of the water by which the existing mine was rendered practically useless had revealed hitherto unsuspected possibilities and there appeared to be little doubt that the first mine had been as it were only a pledge of still richer strata yet to be worked one telegram followed another confirming the report in greater detail prospectuses were issued setting forth a proposal to utilise the opportunity thus opened and debentures were issued for the providing of the necessary funds these debentures were taken up somewhat slowly at first but on the arrival in england of specimens of diamonds from the new lead together with a circumstantial report they were taken up with a rush works were understood to be already on foot and dividends were looked for at an early date the new managing director of the company was julian romayne there was a kind of dry excitement about him to night behind the deliberate assumption of conversational interest which was his never changing manner with his mother now and his hand shook a little as he poured himself out more wine than usual he did not rejoin his mother in the drawing room saying something as she left him about having letters to write and two hours afterwards he was walking up and down the lawn in the moonlight with a cigar there was a fierce restlessness in his step and there was a fierce restlessness in his face too he had been walking there for half an hour when a shadow passed across the blind of the drawing room window the night was very hot and the window was wide open and the blind was drawn up mrs romaynes figure stood there outlined by the lamplight within the drawing room window was shadowed from the moonlight by an angle of the house good night julian she called julian stopped in his walk mechanically good night mother he answered the figure in the window seemed to hesitate for a moment then mrs romayne moved and drew down the blind the lights in the room behind went out one by one and julian resumed his walk in the moonlight as mechanically as he had stopped it it was his custom to go every morning first to his room in the temple in case any letters might be waiting for him there and on the following morning a slight accident on the line having considerably delayed his train he paused a moment before giving his order to the cabman he was very late and there was a feverish impatience in every line of his face he had almost decided that any private letters might wait until the next day when with a sudden unaccountable reaction he sprang into the cab and told the man to drive to the temple he had apparently repented of the resolution by the time the cab stopped for he sprang out with a muttered imprecation on the delay there was only one letter waiting for him and he caught it up fiercely then the handwriting in which it was directed caught his eye all the tumultuous heat and impatience of his face died out suddenly and utterly he stood for a moment staring down at the letter white to the very lips then he seemed absolutely and physically to set his teeth and in the intense hardness of determination which set its mark on every muscle of his face his whole expression would have seemed to deteriorate markedly and terribly but for the desperation in his eyes which was little short of agony he moved abruptly crossed the room unlocked a drawer in his writing table and thrust the letter in with quick deliberate movements unopened he locked the drawer again sharply and turned and went hastily out of the room the letter was from clemence it was the first sign of her existence which he had received since their parting on that june evening nearly three months ago he was looking only older harder and more recklessly resolute when about a quarter of an hour later he entered the office of the welcome diamond mining company the feeble looking little messenger was in solitary possession and he looked up rather uneasily as julian wished him a brief good morning and crossed to the door of the managers room mr ramsays just gone out mr romayne he said i was to say he would be in again directly julian made a curt gesture of assent and went on into the private room there was plenty of work waiting for him it appeared and he was still applying himself to it with dogged concentration when nearly an hour later the door opened and ramsay appeared there you are he said indifferently i thought you werent going to turn up this morning julian had just glanced up from the letter he was writing to acknowledge the other mans entrance and he went on writing as he explained briefly that his train had been delayed no particular reason for wanting me i suppose he said in a brief businesslike way as he laid down his pen ramsay sat down deliberately and put his hand into the breast pocket of his coat well yes he said theres a matter here which rather calls for the attention of the managing director he held out a letter as he spoke and julian took it and read it quickly then he laid it down on the table before him and looked up slowly at ramsay his face was rather pale a general meeting of shareholders he said demanded there was a moments pause while he looked steadily into ramsays immoveable face and then he added in the same rather difficult tone did you expect this ramsay i never expect returned ramsay drily such a thing was on the cards of course julians face grew dark and calculating well he said harshly after another moments pause it must be arranged for of course what do you propose ramsay answered the question by another do you happen to know anything he said of a man named compton howard compton julians brows contracted as if with an involuntary effort to detect the relevancy of the question as he answered tersely yes he and i belong to the same club you didnt know i suppose that some shares in the welcome have drifted into his hands julian shook his head with a quick frown of vexation ah observed ramsay they have though and it has come to my knowledge that various enquiries have been made into the state of the welcome diamond mine made on the spot and made in secret and ive traced these enquiries to this mr howard compton a dreadful grey pallor had begun to spread itself over julians face and the muscles seemed to have grown rigid with the intense force with which he held them to their expression of dogged determination he did not speak and ramsay went on in the same dry indifferent way he is either a very clever hand or very cleverly advised the one point we score at present is that he has not done as he intended to do and taken us by surprise do you mean to say the words seemed to come from between julians dry white lips almost without consciousness on his part his eyes were fixed upon ramsay with a hard unseeing kind of stare his voice was hoarse uneven and hardly audible and it died away leaving the sentence unfinished the meaning is obvious of course returned ramsay an affair of this kind is a ticklish thing to pull off and a hitch of this kind is always possible though i never came across an affair in which it seemed less probable i dont know yet exactly how much our friend knows the meeting wont be a particularly placid affair of course and youre likely to have a warm time of it but of course theres a chance that he maynt know quite enough and we may be able to pull it through yet and if not something seemed to rattle in julians throat as he spoke the words and they came out thick and husky if not repeated ramsay well if not i think i wouldnt go to that meeting if i were you there was a moments dead silence broken only by julians heavy laboured breathing the two men sat there face to face and their eyes met with a terrible significance of what was better unexpressed in words then ramsays dull eyes took a deliberate survey of julians face it was drawn and livid and the elder man rose and took from the cupboard some brandy he poured it into a glass with a slightly contemptuous smile and put it into julians hand youre the very devil to work he said drily and for all i know you may be first rate as a winner but i cant say youre a good loser and its a useful lesson to learn in this business julian drank the brandy and rose mechanically the strong stimulant hardly seemed to touch the blanched horror of his face what do you propose to do he said in a stiff toneless voice personally nothing returned ramsay until i know more business will go on as usual youll call the meeting of course ill tell harrison to get the forms ready for you to sign they must be sent out to morrow going yes said julian heavily theres nothing more i need do to day he took his hat and went slowly out of the office looking straight before him like a man walking in his sleep ramsay looked after him and stood for a minute rubbing his chin thoughtfully not quite what i thought he was he said to himself though he has served this purpose well enough pity he hasnt a little more of his father in him got all the makings of the right sort but he cant stay chapter x the early sunlight of a lovely september morning was streaming into the room through every crack and chink in the blinds and curtains making the light from the still burning lamp look yellow dim and unnatural it was julians sitting room in the house in chelsea and the light falling here and there touched into distinctness many of those little luxurious details on which the evening light had fallen on that winter day eighteen months before when mrs romayne had stood upon the threshold and looked round upon her completed arrangements waiting then for the use which was to give them life on a chair by the writing table his head dropped sideways on his arm as it rested on the table sat julian romayne asleep he was asleep but he was not at rest his face was grey and drawn it twitched painfully and his hand was fiercely clenched gradually an expression of terror and despair gathered on his features until they were almost convulsed and with a strangled gasping cry he woke and started to his feet trembling in every limb and with great drops standing on his forehead he stood clutching at a chair for support while the first poignant impression of his dream subsided and then he moved as though impelled by some reactionary impulse to collect himself he glanced at the clock and saw that the hands pointed to a quarter past six he was vaguely conscious of having heard it strike six so that he could have slept for a few moments only his lips twitched slightly at the thought of what those few moments had held for him then he realised that he was cold that all his limbs were stiff and aching and he dragged himself slowly across the room drew the curtains and the blinds and stood there in the sunshine it was the first movement of physical consciousness which he had felt since he left the office of the welcome diamond mining company on the morning of the previous day how that day had passed he did not know here and there in the blackness a picture of himself stood out with uncertain distinctness he knew that he had telegraphed to his mother to the effect that he might not return to henley for some time he remembered writing the words though he could recall no mental process by which the elaborate excuse he had made had occurred to him he knew that somewhere dinner had been placed before him though where and whether he had eaten he knew not at all for the rest an impression of ceaseless walking of interminable streets giving place imperceptibly to the four walls of his own room made up the only actual background in his memory to the intense mental consciousness which had usurped for the time being the tangibility of material things the favourable turn in the affairs of the welcome diamond mining company had been founded on a deliberate system of forgery and fraud planned by ramsay subscribed to and participated in by julian the telegram as to the new lead had been concocted in the office in the city the diamonds exhibited as earnest of the future yield of the mine had been bought for that purpose and not one penny of the money paid in debentures had ever been intended for application to the working of the ruined mine if these facts should come to light and hostile enquiries once instituted on the spot only one of those incredibly lucky chances to which gamblers and swindlers alike owe so much could avert such a catastrophe the consequences were obvious public exposure public ignominy and execration wholesale and irremediable loss of position were absolutely inevitable and as inevitable if he remained in england the dark gulf in which his life must be swallowed up and closed as far as everything which constituted life for him was concerned whether he fled from it or whether it clutched him was the legitimate reward of his doings penal servitude he could not realise it he could not face it he had beaten it back he had thrust it down again and again during that long day and night and again and again the horror had swept over him gaining always in certainty and reality struggle against it as he might and did clutching at his consciousness shaking and rending it with a force not to be resisted and growing ever stronger and stronger there dawned a dazed bewildered conviction that the end he saw before him was indeed the inevitable end that in that black gulf and no other all his efforts and fierce strivings were to find their consummation he had digged it with his own hands he had followed on towards it in a very desperation of defiance and recklessness goaded by a grinding sense of failure and frustration to a wild daring which had looked like courage and resolution but the spirit which had stimulated him was not in himself all unconscious of it as he was he had been drunk with the thought of what lay beyond that gulf drunk with a desperate unreasoning anticipation of triumph the hideous possibility of failure confronted him now practically for the first time and before it all his fictitious stamina shrivelled away as in its very nature it was bound to do a vague confounded comprehension of the consequences which he had brought upon himself rose upon him walling him in on every side and about those consequences as connected with himself there was all the ghastly incongruity and unreality of a hideous nightmare he had never understood the realities of life he had crushed down their impulses in his heart he had called superficialities essentials selfish ignorance practical sense and he had worked and fought in a false atmosphere and for a false aim and now instead of that fictitious triumph which he had looked to grasp he found himself face to face with facts so sordid and so relentless that he could hardly recognise them as facts at all his world was tottering into ruins all about him the clash and crisis of imminent downfall and disgrace was stunning him and shaking him through and through and in the wild tumult and confusion all the limitations of his nature seemed to break up as it were into one blind chaos of protest and repudiation dominated only by despair nothing fixed or steadfast held its place the very passions by which he had been driven on had been borne down and numbed the thought of clemence had become merely a vague element in the confusion of his mother he did not think at all even that dark factor in his being the perversion of his instincts as to truth and falsehood honesty and dishonesty which had asserted its grim presence with the very awakening of his character which had dictated the first steps along the path of which he stood now at the end was swept into solution now with every other element in his character it had held its place hitherto side by side with the other motive powers by which his life had been regulated dictating the lines on which those powers should work strengthening and developing with the demands they put upon it but it had remained the servant of a stronger passion and as far as any power of support or guidance was concerned it had gone down in the flood he had no perception truly of the moral aspect of his position no sense of guilt or of remorse he only knew that he was beaten that it was all over with him he stood there at the window staring out into the sunshine seeing nothing conscious of nothing but the gulf before him as utterly and absolutely isolated in his misery as though he had been the only creature living in the world the desperate struggle with facts was sinking into a hopeless confused acceptance of them into a dazed bewildered contemplation of details which seemed to rise slowly into distinctness out of the fog which hung about them to rise and fade again without volition on his part details connected with the future came first and he looked at them and understood them with stunned composure as though they stood outside him all together then he found himself wondering heavily as to the time that must pass before the certainty that was in himself became literal knowledge there was no sense of any possible chance of salvation in his mind by and by he became heavily and confusedly aware that another day had begun another day through which he must carry his horrible bewildering burden no longer in the semi unconsciousness of yesterday but alive now in every fibre to its intolerable pressure he went out into the sunshine by and by out into the streets he knew so well and as he walked along there came upon him a ghastly sense of being but a shadow among shadows the life about him seemed to have receded to an incalculable distance to have lost all substance he himself as he appeared to other people had no existence and his real self had no existence for any one but himself he was face to face with black implacable reality and before its presence all the superficialities and conventionalities which had usurped its place vanished like the shades they were he walked always with that chill sense of isolation on him from chelsea to the city in motion in continual motion only was his misery endurable ramsay was not at the office when he arrived and a message from him left with the secretary informed julian that he would not be there that day his absence affected julian not at all there was no suspense in his mental attitude to make him crave for even a blow to end it to his battered consciousness delay before the final agony had something of the appearance of rest or respite he did the work he had come to do with a numbed comprehension of its import and then as he passed out again into those horribly unreal streets there came upon him a desperate longing for human companionship a desperate longing to break through his solitude and touch another human creature he would go to the club he thought dully he must speak to some one he must get some assurance of his own identity or its unfamiliarity would drive him mad there were two or three men only who were known to him in the room when he arrived and even as they greeted him they seemed to elude him to retreat and to lose all tangibility beyond the yawning gulf which lay between himself and them he tried to talk he tried desperately to bridge the gulf in vain he turned away and went out into the streets again alone with the one terrible reality which the world seemed to contain the failure broke him down an unendurable horror of himself and of the world a very terror of his misery rolled down upon him and overwhelmed him it was one of those realisations of the impotency of humanity before the strokes of the infinitely greater than humanity which seize upon a man sometimes when all the wrappings of life and custom are stripped from him and he finds himself in primeval defencelessness he could only fight wildly with it those instincts and affinities through which such moments work out strength and comprehension were utterly submerged in him now the experience could be for him nothing but a blind horror giving place at last to the old stunned hopeless confusion and despair and when at last he dragged himself upstairs to his room in the temple late at night he was utterly exhausted mentally and physically he dropped into a chair and sank into a heavy sleep ten days followed ten long days giving place to heavy nights ten nights passing into monotonous days by degrees julian fell into a species of dull routine in which he ate and drank and even slept passed to and fro along the london streets stunned almost to stupefaction he went each day to the office and sat there all day long doing little sitting for the most part staring into space or walking up and down with heavy regular steps he was rarely disturbed ramsay appeared but seldom his visits were brief and he was uncommunicative at last there came a morning when he reached the office to find upon his desk a letter in ramsays familiar handwriting julian sat down before it and looked at it for a moment his face twitching slightly then he broke the seal dear romayne he read your friend compton holds the whole affair in his hand marston loring gave him the tip you will do as you think best about meeting the shareholders i shall not be present myself as i am leaving england for the present to night yours alfred ramsay the letter bore date of the previous day chapter xi a white face drawn and set into a look which pitifully travestied the calmness of despair bloodshot eyes with something in them of the incomprehending agony of a hunted animal quivering lips which would not take the rigid line at which they aimed and from which seemed to radiate an indescribable suggestion of youthfulness which made the bewildered desperation of the face infinitely piteous two hours had passed and julian was seated at his writing table in his room at the temple he held a pen in his hand and before him lay a sheet of paper bearing three words only my dear clemence on the table behind him lay a roughly packed travelling bag and a bradshaw flight instant flight was the one course that had occurred to him such a necessity had been present to him from the first and in the almost insane terror which had mastered him on finding himself deserted by ramsay thoughts which had lain dormant in his mind during the last ten days had taken shape almost without volition on his part and he had made his plans with wild haste he knew nothing he thought of nothing but that he must go at once that at any moment he might find himself stopped at any moment it might be too late no thought of that last refuge of the detected criminal suicide presented itself to him the realities of life were as yet strange to him wrenched from his moorings tossed away to drift on the pitiless sea he could not realise what was the depth of that sea how futile must be his struggles to keep himself afloat the reality of death had never touched his superficial nature he made his preparations with the promptitude of desperation and as each detail was despatched one deed that must be done began to prick into his consciousness some word must be sent to clemence with this necessity he found himself at last confronted with no further possibility of postponement but no words would come to him little as he understood it all the bewildered misery of his heart was what he wanted to convey to her all the incoherent horror which was tossing him to and fro what words were possible where there was no reason only blind agonised feeling there was one aspect of his shipwreck now in which it appeared only as the end and consummation of his ten weeks of silence towards clemence those ten weeks in which he saw now only cruelty and futility where he had seen before wisdom and necessity his failure his ruin had a side on which they touched him only in his connection with her it became the failure to keep the promise he had made her when he saw her last the ruin of his vision of a life with her he sat there staring stupidly at the paper and gradually all thoughts slipped away from him but the thought of clemence herself a hunger such as his selfish young heart had never known rose in him for her presence her pity his misery turned to her stretching forth empty despairing hands until the sick longing dominated his whole consciousness then out of the aching yearning there came to him suddenly a recollection of the letter he had received ten days before the letter which he had thrust into a drawer in his blind foolhardy determination unopened the end on which he had set himself to wait had vanished for ever everything by which he had held was overturned and submerged but the letter was there still the letter had come from clemence he unlocked with trembling eagerness the drawer in which he had placed it drew out the envelope and tore it open that it could bring no comfort to him that there could indeed be only aggravation of his wretchedness in it was as nothing to him it was to touch clemence that he wanted clemence and clemence only was the cry of his whole being the letter was very short a few lines only he ran his eyes over it with hungry avidity and then they seemed to stop suddenly and all the quivering life seemed to freeze on his features a moment passed and a great dry sob broke from him he dashed his head down upon the table with a bitter boyish cry clemmie clemmie simple beautiful with that wonderful new tenderness which comes to a woman with the consummation of her womanhood pathetic in their gentleness beyond all words the few brief lines brought him from clemence the most sacred tidings that can pass between husband and wife tidings of the birth of their child clemmie the word broke from him again a pitiful despairing sob and then he lay there long dry sobs shaking him from head to foot as that bitterest of all waves the unavailing realisation of what might have been contrasted with what is swept over him and overwhelmed him the reality touched into life by her letter as though clemences voice had spoken to him which he had thrown away the reality on which in doing so he had hurled himself stood out before him in pitiless distinctness and in his ignorance and blindness in his utter want of comprehension of the moral aspect of his acts and the stern justice of the retribution he was meeting there was no light or cohesion for him anywhere in the world and darkness and chaos had closed about him nearly an hour passed before he moved and lifted a white haggard face marred with the agony of impotent regret he looked about him vaguely pushing his hair back heavily from his forehead and as his eye fell upon the travelling bag that instinctive sense of the necessity upon him which had stirred him with no consciousness on his part deepened into a mechanically active impulse he must go he paused a moment and then he drew out a fresh sheet of paper falconer he muttered falconer will see to them theres no one else it was as though the fire through which he was passing had burnt away from him all recollection even of his mother he had thought of her for long only as the source of all that was unpleasant in his life now in the sharpness of his pain a haze had spread itself over the past and all thought of the means by which the present position had been brought about was obliterated he wrote for a few minutes rapidly desperately in a handwriting which was hardly legible then he thrust the letter into an envelope which he directed to dennis falconer and rose his original intention of writing to clemence had left him it had become an impossibility and side by side with his sense of his utter incapacity to find any words in which to speak to her there had risen in him a heart broken impulse to see her face once more and for the last time the sunshine of the day had given place to a drizzling rain when he turned into that quiet little street which had witnessed their last meeting the dazed sense of the necessity for flight was strong upon him darkness had fallen he had left his room for the last time in another hour he would be in the liverpool train a fugitive from justice and in the terror and confusion of the realisation of that one all absorbing fact the only other thought that lived in him was his blind desire for one sight of clemence he had come to the little street unreasoningly weighing no probabilities as to whether or no she would be at work not even understanding that there were probabilities to weigh coming there simply because he had seen her there before and knew of no other chance of seeing her he took up his position in a doorway by which she must pass and waited it seemed to him that he had been standing there utterly alone for hours when the door from which his haggard sunken eyes had never stirred opened as on that other occasion clemence was the last to come out but she came this time walking quickly and eagerly for an instant as she passed beneath the lamp the light fell on her face and as julians eyes rested on it for that instant he clutched at the railing by which he stood then she came on in the shadow still followed by those hungry eyes perhaps she felt their gaze perhaps her own heart felt the pang that was rending his in the very act of passing him she stopped suddenly and turned towards him looking into the dimness in which he was shrouded she stretched out her hands with a low inarticulate cry he had her in his arms in an instant straining her to him with a despairing passion which he had never known before and she clung to him half frightened by his touch julian she whispered then as no word came from him only his burning kisses pressed upon her upturned face she went on softly dear werent you going to speak to me still he did not speak and with a look and accent indescribably beautiful in their tender womanliness she said you didnt think i would reproach you its good bye clemmie he muttered hoarsely good bye i im going away for for a little while he could as easily have killed her at that moment as have told her the truth going away she echoed with a little catch in her breath where dear to to america he could not tell her all the truth but there was no power in him to originate an unnecessary lie he felt her arms tighten about him and he answered the appeal hoarsely hurrying out the words i im leaving a letter about you and his voice died away in his throat as he tried to speak of his child and then he went on rapidly and unevenly it will be all right clemence clemence try to forgive me good bye dear good bye he drew her hands from about his neck kissing them wildly her hold tightened instinctively upon his fingers and she was trembling very much youre not going now she whispered yes he answered hoarsely now then as he saw the look which came over her face the desperate necessity for reassuring her came upon him he tried to smile america is nothing nowadays you know he said in a harsh unnatural tone its no distance i shall be back directly say good bye to me wont you i must go she let her face fall on his shoulder pressing it closer and closer as though she could never tear herself away im frightened for you dear she said im frightened are you sure sure there is nothing wrong quite sure of course you will be back soon quite soon there was a moments quivering silence and then clemence slowly lifted her face he took her in his arms again and their lips met in one long agonised kiss neither spoke again when he released her julian with a face like death turned and went away down the street his head bent his whole figure tense as though he were facing a blinding wind clemence stood for a moment still as a statue her eyes wide her face quite quiet then she too went away through the night chapter xii over the country about henley that same day the sun was shining gloriously it was about five oclock in the afternoon and there was a clearness about the light a distinctness about the shadows which taken in conjunction with the heavy bank of clouds into which the sun would presently sink argued coming rain for the present however nature was lovely to look at and a garden party which was going on in the large old fashioned garden of a large old fashioned country house about a mile from the river had the benefit of every advantage which atmosphere and surroundings could give it was a large party and the scene was very bright and animated on the larger of the two lawns conspicuous among the well dressed but by no means striking looking women about her stood mrs romayne talking to a local magnate she had arrived about half an hour before and the politely concealed satisfaction and surprise with which she had been received had testified to the fact that her appearance at such a function was a phenomenon in the neighbourhood invitations had showered in on her during her residence at the cottage but it had gradually become an established fact that she was going out very little this was in truth the first party she had attended it was fortunate that her hostess was not a particularly observant person there had been something about mrs romayne when she arrived which might have dashed that hostesss personal elation with a suspicion that her guests appearance had been dictated by motives not wholly complimentary to the party lines about the mouth which suggested the enforced endurance of a burden from which she was seeking temporary relief however fictitious a restlessness in the eyes which suggested an attempt at the eluding of the too insistent companionship of her own thoughts her eyes were painfully bright and there was a nervous tension about her manner as she stood there on the lawn talking and laughing but her companion of the moment a worthy old gentleman with not much acquaintance among women of the world thought her simply the most astonishingly charming woman he had ever met and seeking in his mind for lines on which to make himself agreeable to her he recollected to have heard something about her son you have a son here i believe he said with ponderous interest i should greatly like to make his acquaintance mrs romayne laughed i have a son she said but he is not here im sorry to say he is hard at work just at present ah she broke off with an exclamation of surprise i see a friend of mine over there i must go and speak to her and with a bow and a smile to her admirer she broke off the conversation which had perhaps seemed longer to one party than to the other and moved across the lawn to where hilda compton was standing watching her with an uncertain but not particularly pleasant expression on her pretty face are you staying in the neighbourhood said mrs romayne prettily when they had shaken hands she was apparently entirely oblivious of something cold and disagreeable in the younger womans manner is your husband here hilda compton glanced at her with a certain tentative triumph in her eyes no she said hes not here im staying on a house boat but he is kept in town over some troublesome business she paused and then as mrs romayne made a rather patronising gesture of sympathy that gleam of triumph strengthened into something distinctly malicious hilda compton had never forgotten or forgiven that moment in the norfolk garden twelve months ago it had been no part of her policy to resent it when such resentment must necessarily have rebounded to her own disadvantage she had accepted mrs romaynes society friendliness during the past season with just such a manner as might sting but could not in very self respect be impugned by the elder woman a manner cleverly tinged with that deference which points the sense of superiority with which a certain type of girl recognises the fact that the present is to her and not to the previous generation but she had hoped always that the day might come when she would find herself in a position to take more active measures and she felt now that even what she knew to be a slight breach of conjugal faith would be venial if it would straighten what she would have called her score against julian romaynes mother yes its rather a bore she said city business you know dont you think its very foolish of men to speculate mrs romayne of course i havent a quarter of your experience but i think so they always seem to get into trouble of some sort but you know more than i do about this affair no doubt since mr romayne is mixed up in it and hes such a devoted son husbands dont tell one much i find self command is a wonderful thing even when it originates in no higher motive than the instinct of a woman of the world for the retention of her society demeanour mrs romaynes lips were ashen and her fingers were clenched round the sunshade she held until her rings cut into them but she faced hilda compton steadily and with a mechanical smile her eyes a little dull and contracted meeting the girls pretty unfeeling ones hilda compton noticed the change of colour even behind the artificial tinting and rejoiced at the slip of the tongue by which her foolish young husband had put such a weapon into her hand if only she had succeeded in making howard tell her more instead of making him lose his temper she reflected however that perhaps the truth was not so very bad after all and hints might possibly sound worse than the actual facts do tell mr romayne from me that i hope he hasnt done anything very shocking she said with a laugh i wanted howard to tell me just what it was but he would not isnt it funny how men seem to lose their heads altogether when they get on to that silly stock exchange the last men one would expect too who would have thought of mr romaynes getting into trouble of that kind somewhat to her disgust hilda compton found as she proceeded that it was impossible to give such significance to her words as she would have wished she realised that it would never do to allow herself to be brought to book and consequently conventionality demanded that she should adopt a jesting tone and trust to mrs romaynes possessing some half knowledge which should give the words the barb she wished for them she had a pleasant conviction as mrs romayne answered her that she had done something at least towards wiping out that old score the elder womans words were preceded by a harsh little laugh and there was something indistinct about their utterance just so who would have thought mrs romayne stopped abruptly and a sharp extraordinary spasm passed across her face leaving it fixed and old the girl by her side could not flatter herself that the effect was produced by her words for mrs romayne was gazing to the other side of the garden and it was evidently something she had seen there which had affected her so powerfully turning her own curious eyes in the same direction hilda compton saw nothing calculated to account for such an effect the crowd had drifted away to some extent to the other lawn and the tennis courts and there was a considerable space sparsely sprinkled with people between where they stood and the last group on the lawn a group of ladies to whom the host was introducing a little alert elderly man with grey hair a little man who looked to day though only one pair of the two pair of womens eyes fixed upon him across the lawn recognised this exactly as he had looked twenty years ago hilda compton did not know him and she was wondering curiously whether mrs romayne did when she heard their hostesss voice and turned quickly mrs romayne roused apparently by finding herself addressed had turned also very quickly it seemed to hilda compton and rather as though she did not wish her face to be seen by some one on the other side of the garden and was listening with a dazed strained expression of enforced attention i want to introduce a connexion of mine my dear mrs romayne something of a traveller and something of an eccentricity but really worth talking to there he is indicating the little alert elderly man on the other side of the lawn he is a dr aston may i fetch him to hilda comptons astonishment mrs romayne stretched out her hand hurriedly in unmistakeable dissent and it was shaking like a leaf im afraid i must say no she said in a hoarse hurried tone which sounded as though she could hardly control it i have a long drive you know and i must run away she took her leave so briefly and hurriedly that her hostess came to the conclusion that illness must be the cause of the seclusion in which she was living and that she must have miscalculated her strength that afternoon she might have thought so with even more reason if she had seen the strange collapse of her whole figure with which mrs romayne sank back into the corner of her carriage as she was driven home along the country roads if her attendance at the garden party had been indeed a desperate attempt at finding some sort of temporary oblivion or distraction that attempt had obviously failed her face was drawn and set and in her eyes as they stared unseeingly before her there was a look as of a woman who is quivering still under the influence of some horrible shock she had as she had said a long drive home and as she neared her own house that look in her eyes faded displaced by a sick hunger of anxiety she got out of the carriage quickly helping herself a good deal as she rose however as if that shock had affected her physical strength has mr julian come she said to the servant who opened the door then as the woman answered in the negative she moved swiftly on to where her letters lay waiting for her and looked them rapidly over there was none from julian and she carried them listlessly upstairs as she went to dress for her solitary dinner the rain which was falling fast by this time in london was just beginning to patter slowly on the window when she came into the dining room and the wind was rising and moving gustily round the house they were dreary sounds both of them and mrs romayne shivered a little as she sat down apparently the monotonous pattering growing quicker and quicker as dinner went on or the low howling of the wind made her nervous she ate nothing and when at last the form of dinner having been gone through with and the servant having left the room she rose and walked aimlessly to the fireplace her lips were strangely compressed and she seemed to control the expression of her eyes with a determined effort it was as though she were controlling something within of which the tendency frightened her she stood there forgetting apparently to go into the drawing room her face fixed and intent as though she were reasoning or arguing with herself at last she shivered sharply and her lips twitched then rousing herself forcibly as it seemed she rang the bell fiercely and gave orders that a fire should be lighted in the drawing room it was a wretched evening she said to the servant as though the audible expression of a tangible reason for the nervous discomfort which seemed to be upon her was some sort of relief to her the fire lighted she drew a chair in front of it and taking up a novel set herself to read with a desperate determination in every line of her face down one page line by line on through the next still line by line her eyes travelled steadily mechanically and then as mechanically her hand moved turned the leaf and her eyes moved on again but unless her face greatly belied her the sense of the words she read so intently never penetrated to her brain by and by that movement of her eyes ceased she sat staring fixedly at the page before her then she let the hand that held the book sink gradually on her knee and sat staring into space as she had sat staring at the printed words her face was drawn and there was an intense indefinite dread about it which was none the less ghastly in that it would have been impossible to say in which of her set features its shadow lurked the room was absolutely still outside the rain fell and the wind moaned inside the intense quiet seemed to be taking a weirdly tangible form and to be creeping closer and closer round her motionless figure with every breath she drew with a sudden sharp movement as though in taking a too sharply piercing point her thoughts had roused her to a desperate resistance of them she rose and began to walk restlessly up and down the room her brows were drawn to a concentration which made her whole face look thin and very old there was an expression of deliberate self conscious self contempt about her mouth but in her eyes there lurked the battling horror against which all her force seemed to be fiercely arrayed up and down she walked no muscle of her set face relaxing until quite suddenly there swept across it breaking up all its rigid lines a very agony of yearning it was as though some sudden and most inopportune realisation in no wise to be resisted had shaken her through and through if only i had dared to ask him if only if only i dared to speak the words had broken from her half aloud a sharp low cry and as she uttered them she stopped in her walk gripping and clinging to a chair as if for physical support in a moment of terrible mental conflict she was evidently fighting desperately inch by inch for the self control which was slipping from her the self control which she dreaded to lose as she dreaded nothing else in life the self control to which she clung with the tenacity of instinctive self preservation she lifted her face at last still and hard as resolution could make it she crossed the room with quick resolute steps looking neither to the right nor the left and went rapidly upstairs to her own room a desk containing a quantity of papers stood on the chest of drawers they were old bills and receipts that needed sorting and destroying and she had brought them into the country saying that she never had time for such work in town she went up to this desk now lifted it in her two hands and placing it on the table sat down before it and unlocked it all her movements were the quick concentrated movements of a woman to whom employment close tedious employment has become an absolute necessity a telegram ten days old was not among the papers to be sorted but mrs romayne held one in her hand as she sat there at her writing table she had drawn it from the front of her dress and she read and re read it oblivious of the task she had set herself with an intensity in her eyes which seemed as though it would wring a hidden meaning from the words it was the telegram julian had sent her ten days before she folded it at last with a quick defiant gesture and drew towards her a packet of receipts she untied the string that fastened the papers and out from among them there fell a folded letter yellow with age and crumpled it had evidently worked its way into that packet by accident as papers will when many are kept together for it was obviously a letter and not a bill mrs romayne stretched out her hand mechanically and picked it up and opened it her eyes were met by the words written in a childish scrawling much blotted handwriting my dear mamma it was the letter which she had received from julian twenty years ago at nice in an instant even as her eyes fell on those faded baby characters so suddenly and so utterly that she never realised her loss the self control to which she had clung so fiercely melted away from mrs romayne before the flash and quiver of recognition had subsided on her face she had seized the bell rope and was ringing furiously for her maid the woman appearing breathless and alarmed a moment later found her mistress searching feverishly for bonnet and cloak i am going to london dawson order the carriage at once the voice was harsh rapid and peremptory but the bewildered woman hesitated now maam mrs romayne turned on her with such a face as her maid had never seen before at once i said at once the last train was just steaming into the station when mrs romaynes carriage dashed up the horse smoking and covered with foam she had thrust that yellow little letter half unconsciously into her pocket and all through the journey she sat motionless clasping it tightly in her hand her eyes wild her features forced into a quiescence which sat upon them like a mask that mask seemed to get thin to break away now and again as she drove through the london streets at last as though the wild emotion which it hid was growing too strong for it her breath was coming faster and faster until her white parted lips took an involuntary line of physical pain there were no lights in the house in chelsea as her cab drew up it was twelve oclock she rang violently and waited her rapid breathing almost suffocating her no one came she rang again pausing this time with her hand on the bell again and again furiously as a wild unreasoning horror seemed to seize upon her and tear at her heart at last there was a sound as of the tentative undoing of bolts and turning of keys the door was opened an inch or two and a frightened womans voice said who is it a moment later there was no possibility of doubt on that score the door was hurriedly thrown open and mrs romayne moved swiftly into the hall turning fiercely to confront the astonished partially dressed servant whose bedroom candle seemed to be the only light in the house has mr julian gone to bed she demanded and the woman hardly recognised her mistresss voice mr julian is not here maam she answered he has not been here since the day before yesterday chapter xiii mr falconer sir mr falconer dennis falconer was a light sleeper and he was awake on the first call low and hurried as it was it must be a very bad morning he said to himself for the light was not nearly so strong as it usually was when he was called at eight oclock all right he called back but the retreating footsteps that usually ensued upon his answer did not follow theres a lady sir to see you please shes waiting in the sitting room mrs romayne she told me to say what it was a sharp exclamation of inexpressible astonishment and as he uttered it falconer sprang out of bed as he did so he realised that the unusualness of the light was due to the unusualness of the hour seven oclock only some one from mrs romayne you mean he called his strong deep voice full of incredulity and apprehension then as the answer came through the door mrs romayne sir the lady said he called back hurriedly say i will be with her in a moment very few moments indeed had passed before falconers bedroom door opened and he came out with a rapid step he opened his sitting room door and passed in shutting the door hastily behind him and as he did so the words of grave concern with which he had entered died upon his lips in the disorder and dreariness of a room from which the traces of yesterdays usage had not yet been obliterated in the cold grey light of the early september morning a woman was pacing up and down with almost frenzied steps for a moment as he caught his first glimpse of the face he thought vaguely that it was not mrs romayne then it turned and confronted him and meeting the eyes he recognised not the woman whom he had known during the past two years but the woman into whose face he had looked with so strange a shock of unfamiliarity and for one moment only as he and dr aston had confronted it together twenty years ago in nice every trace of the mrs romayne of to day seemed to have vanished scorched away by the consuming fire which burnt in her blue eyes and seemed to be the only thing that lived behind that ghastly face even her features were drawn and sunken almost beyond recognition an almost paralysing sense of unreality fell upon dennis falconer for all his practical common sense and before he could recover himself sufficiently for speech mrs romayne had crossed the room to him attempting no greeting swept away on a tide before which all the barriers of her life all the safeguards as they had seemed to her had gone down in one common ruin dennis falconer she cried hoarsely my boy is gone gone help me to think what i must do help me to think how i can find him help me help me the words themselves were an appeal but they rang out in that harsh untuned voice with all the fierce peremptoriness of a command and as she spoke them mrs romayne beat her hands one against the other as though her agony were indeed too great to be endured falconer utterly confounded more by her manner than by her tidings which indeed in his slow and bewildered sense of the extraordinarily direct communication which her words had established between herself and him he hardly grasped echoed the one word which seemed to contain a definite statement gone he said gone gone she returned repeating the word as she had done before in a kind of hoarse cry oh let me try and make you understand clearly that we may lose no time time ah who knows how much may have been lost already my boy my boy she strangled the cry in her very throat and laying one hand on falconers arm with a convulsive grip as if to steady herself she lifted the other to her head pushing the hair back from her forehead and pressing her fingers down as though to force herself to think and speak coherently i had a telegram from him she said speaking in short quick sentences with heavy panting breaths between ten days ago it said that he was going to stop in town for a few days yesterday i heard something that made me uneasy i came up to speak to him late last night i expected to find him in queen anne street he was not there he has not been there for the last two nights he is gone she stopped as though in those three words she had summed up all the horror of the situation and with that strange sense of unreality making his voice stiff and constrained falconer said but must you necessarily apprehend anything alarming some private visit perhaps a painful discovery of course she tore her hand away from his arm wringing it fiercely with its fellow as she faced him breaking in upon his words with a passionate cry apprehend apprehend i know i tell you i know ah have i been watching and fighting for so many years have i planned and struggled and sickened with fear not to know now that it has overtaken me at last dennis falconer dont palter with me you know what lies about my boy you know what horrible inheritance i have had to battle with for him good heaven when have you spared me your knowledge of it when have you failed to thrust it on me to force me to shudder and sicken even when i felt most secure she paused battling for breath and then as falconer tried to speak she put out her hand to stop him and went on hurriedly thats all over its done with now you must help me your knowledge must help me you are a man you will know what to do how he can be saved he must be saved he must she turned away from him with a wild unconscious gesture as though his personality had no existence for her save and except as he could serve her purpose and began once more to pace up and down the room falconer followed her with his eyes standing motionless and confounded the very foundation on which stood his every conception with regard to the woman before him and the life she lived had suddenly melted into nothingness before her passionate words and there seemed for the time being to be no stability anywhere about him it was no light that her words let in upon him rather they rolled over that mental tract of country which had been to him perfectly familiar and commonplace a darkness in which every landmark was obliterated in those first bewildered seconds his most prominent sensation was one of utter blackness the mental counterpart of the effect produced upon the physical vision by the sudden substitution of illimitable darkness for a narrow and well known scene what do you fear he said he spoke almost like an automaton in a low tentative tone he has been speculating she never stopped in her rushing walk i have known it for months and i have been in torment there was a strange scathed look on her face which gave the words a terrible reality he has had some heavy anxiety on his mind all the summer what i dont know but this is the end of it oh my boy my darling what have i done that you should shut your mother out i have slaved for you i have slaved for you and i will slave for you as long as i live why have you gone away from me she was not crying to falconer watching her and listening to her no tears could have been so terrible as that bitter dry eyed wail which seemed to him to echo in a void where nothing answering to it could have been nurtured into life the contrast between the artificial woman he had known hitherto and the woman in the consuming anguish of her motherhood with whom he now found himself face to face was so amazing that he could make no attempt to grapple with it he took desperate and instinctive refuge in the practical do you know anything of his city associations he said she made a despairing gesture of negation i did she said hoarsely i did all i knew to keep in touch with him two months ago marston loring could have told me anything but everything failed me everything crumbled away they quarrelled already with that matter of fact tendency inherent in all men and particularly in unimaginative men which assimilates a revelation and reduces it involuntarily to a commonplace falconer had become almost accustomed to the new point of view which had been forced upon him the darkness was lifting and he was aware of vast tracts of mental country destitute of those landmarks which his soul loved but no longer enveloped in a dense atmosphere of confusion a man of falconers narrow temperament confirmed in his rigidity by many years of life having his set conceptions suddenly overthrown and forcibly enlarged will be totally incapable of any just appreciation of the new horizon then created he will be conscious of the spaces about him only as confusing unrealities the limitations solidified by the mental habits of years will retain some sort of ghostly influence over him long after they have ceased to have any actual existence his first conscious and deliberate movement will be an instinctive attempt to reconcile the new condition of things with these old limitations rather than to reconcile himself with the new conditions the facts which mrs romaynes words recalled to him the character of the man whom she had encouraged as her sons chief intimate the character of the life to which she had bred him gave definite force to the vague movement towards such reconciliation already stirring in falconers mind he accepted the revelation of unsuspected mothers love and mothers dread and ceased to contemplate it as he concentrated his mental vision on the selfish vanity and worldliness with which mrs romayne had stood endued in his thoughts for twenty years and as his point of view readjusted itself on these lines her present position with all the suffering which it involved presented itself to him solely as the inevitable climax of a simple and eminently comprehensible sequence of cause and effect his voice was low and stern as he said can you not think of any other friend who could give us some clue to his recent movements i cant she cried stopping in her rapid walk and confronting him fiercely it is because there is no one left because i dont know what to do or where to turn that i have come to you should i be wasting time like this if i could think of any other means of acting im tied hand and foot in the dark tied to the rack man we can do nothing till we find him till we know what has happened think think think how are we to find him how are we to her voice which had risen into an agonised cry broke suddenly a greyish tint spread itself over her face and all her features were contorted as if with horrible physical pain she stretched out her hand feebly and gropingly caught at an arm chair and fell into it letting her face fall forward on its back as her nails pressed themselves pitilessly into her thin hands it its nothing she gasped in a tight suppressed voice fighting desperately as it seemed to utter words rather than groans i have been ill the night the words died away caught and strangled by the relentless stabbing pain and falconer utterly at a loss stood for a moment helplessly watching her and then strode across the room meaning to call a woman to his aid he opened the door hurriedly and then stopped short on the shelf fixed against the wall facing him there lay his morning letters and on the top of the pile lay one directed in julians handwriting mrs romaynes physical distress sank into insignificance for him the physical suffering which had fallen to his lot during the past year had by no means obliterated the lifelong instinct which led him to look upon such weakness as a detail to be disregarded and of women he knew nothing he turned back into the room with the letter in his hand and shutting the door again opened it hastily it was the letter julian had written on the previous day in his room in the temple dear falconer he read ive done for myself all round and by the time you get this i shall be out of england its penal servitude if i stay the smash will come in a day or two and you will understand its all up with me but theres my wife and child for heavens sake be kind to them this is the address the address followed and then the signature for another moment dennis falconer stood motionless with his eyes fixed on the letter so despairing in its hopeless brevity so terribly eloquent of immeasurable disgrace and wrong then he lifted his head and turned towards mrs romayne she had not moved she was apparently unconscious of his presence the tense rigidity of her position had passed into a total collapse in which all her figure seemed to have fallen together as if in absolute exhaustion to falconer she presented an appearance only of most desirable quiet and he hesitated simply as to how he should so break to her what must be broken as to excite her least she would have to see the letter he glanced at it again on the thought and a cold shock seemed to strike him as he realised the total oblivion of his mother to which the young mans last appeal bore witness i have received some news he said his tone as he spoke was curiously different from any in which he had ever before addressed her it was grave straightforward and not unkindly and it very subtly and quite unconsciously conveyed the altered attitude of a stern and narrow moralist towards wrong doing no longer triumphant and serene but writhing under its merited suffering a certain stern compassion the new position of affairs demanded of him and he gave it but it was that lofty compassion which is more than half composed of a sense of the righteousness of the retribution meted out with sympathy or respect it was utterly untouched he was prepared to help her to the utmost he was steady reliability itself but his help was permeated as was his compassion with a superior recognition of the justice of the trouble which rendered that help necessary as though there was something between her and her surroundings through which his voice must penetrate before it reached her brain a second or two elapsed before mrs romayne gave any sign of having heard him then she moved and turned her face towards him looking at him as though from a long way off her forehead and the hair about it strangely colourless and dead looking were damp grey shadows had fallen about her mouth there was a faint struggle in her dull eyes as though she had heard his words and was trying to force her way to an understanding of them through overwhelming physical disabilities i am sorry to say it is far from reassuring continued falconer a sudden flash of understanding and conviction flashed across her features and its spirit dominated her weakness as its light transfigured her face she rose clinging to the chair but evidently absolutely unconscious of any physical sensation and held out her hand still clammy and tremulous with pain give it me she said indicating the letter he held her voice was a thin whisper then as he hesitated youre wasting time give it me he gave it her without a word and turned away it would break her down of course he thought perhaps into some wild form of hysteria at the position in which the young man confessed himself perhaps into passionate repudiation of the son who had so deceived her and who was leaving her without word or sign moments passed three or four perhaps and then a tense insistent touch fell on his arm and he turned mrs romayne was standing by his side julians letter held tightly in her hand which trembled no longer her eyes were bright almost hard in their determination and every line and muscle of her face and figure was braced and set into a vivid strength and resolution we must see this woman at once she said and her voice was as strange in its desperate energy as was her face then as falconer only looked at her blankly she added in the same absorbed concentrated way you will come with me you mean you will see i must see this woman she repeated tapping the paper impatiently with her hand dont you see she will probably know where he is she must know let us go at once but if she does know if she does know why that is everything i can follow him he is frightened he has lost his head if he goes away like this he is lost i am going to stop him but she silenced him with a movement of her hand before which his words died on his lips dennis falconer she said help me or refuse to help me as you like but dont try to stop me the shadow of a horror such as this has haunted me for twenty years i bring the nerve and desperation of twenty years to meet it now and i am going to save him will you come dominated against his will sternly disapproving but powerless to assert his disapprobation in the face of the intensity of her determination falconer made a slight gesture of enforced assent mrs romayne hardly waited for it before she turned and went swiftly out of the room and down the stairs it was early still not yet eight oclock and cabs were hardly to be found they met one at last and falconer put her into it and looked at her obviously with an intention of uttering the protest with which his face was full she made a peremptory sign that he should give the address holding out the letter containing it and instantly reclaiming it her nerves were evidently strung beyond the possibility of irrelevant or unnecessary speech a long drive followed to a dingy poverty stricken neighbourhood and then in a dreary looking little street the cab stopped mrs romayne got out with the same rapid concentrated movements signing again with a movement of her set lips to falconer that he should ring and make the necessary enquiries the bell was answered after an appreciable interval by a slatternly looking girl a young woman lodges here i believe said falconer sternly a young married woman mrs mrs roden or romayne the girl stared at him for a moment with bold curious eyes and then transferred the stare to mrs romayne with a coarse giggle young married woman she repeated with a toss of the head oh yes of course top floor back before the last words which conveyed a general intimation that visitors for the top floor back were expected to show themselves up were well uttered mrs romayne had crossed the dirty little passage with swift steps and was mounting the stairs she went straight on until she reached the top landing and then she turned sharply to falconer who had followed her closely his judgement condemned her proceedings utterly but his stern sense of her claim upon him remained untouched and he believed himself to be merely waiting until her impulse should fail her as it seemed to him it must before long to take matters into his own hands knock she said falconer obeyed her the door was opened with a quiet sad toned yes and clemence stood on the threshold she was looking very fragile and very white the haggard look of suffering had left her but it had taken with it in the passing all the physical strength from her face her eyes were heavy as with sleeplessness and tears and from their depths there seemed to emanate the quiet grief which spoke in every line of her face she held her baby in her arms and her whole personality seemed to be touched by the mysterious influence of motherhood into a new dignity and beauty to falconer the change in her since he had seen her in camden town was so great as to give him a moments absolute shock it was the same woman and yet not the same the difference lay for him rather in the evidences of long suffering which spoke so eloquently about that womans face and form than in the work effected by that suffering and the feeling that the sight of her stirred in him was one of pity a mans half indignant half patronising pity for weakness and trust abused but falconer she did not seem to see instantly as she opened the door her eyes had passed to where mrs romayne stood confronting her her face absorbed concentrated hard as steel a faint flush of colour flooded clemences face then she lowered her eyes and stood with her head a little bent over her child motionless you are my sons wife the words came from mrs romayne quick terse utterly untouched and unemotional as though the situation in itself were absolutely devoid of meaning for her my husbands name is julian romayne was the low answer mrs romayne made a quick imperious gesture indicative of her desire to pass into the little room on the threshold of which clemence was standing clemence made way for her with quiet dignity and then followed her in falconer hesitated an instant and took up his position in the doorway holding himself in grave attentive readiness until the moment when his presence should be required the little room was scrupulously neat and clean facing him a strangely incongruous figure amid such poor surroundings but apparently as absolutely unconscious of them as of the child at which she never glanced stood mrs romayne facing mrs romayne stood clemence paler now than before and with her head bent a little lower falconer could see that she trembled slightly mrs romayne began to speak instantly in the same hard rapid tone where is my son she said you have been told perhaps to say you do not know to keep his plans secret you must give them up instantly to me he has made a mistake and only prompt action can redeem it when did you see him last what did he tell you as though some subtle influence from the one woman had penetrated to the heart of the other clemences face had turned quite white for her too the personal aspect of the situation seemed suddenly to sink into abeyance her head was lifted and her eyes filled with a creeping apprehension were fixed full upon mrs romayne oblivious of anything but the one interest which they held in common the man watching them was vaguely conscious of something about the two women which put him quite away from them which made him the merest spectator of something to which he had no key i saw him last night said clemence hurriedly and fearfully he came to say good bye a kind of hoarse cry broke from mrs romayne good bye she cried as though appealing to some encircling environment of fate and she let him go she let him go she stopped herself forcing down her passion with an iron hand and went on in a tone only colder and more decisive in its greater rapidity than before he has made a mistake you cannot understand of course no doubt it seems to you that everything to be desired is comprised in the miserable subterfuge of flight no doubt she was interrupted with a low cry of unutterable horror clemence had drawn a step nearer to her pressing her baby passionately to her heart flight she cried flight ah i knew i knew there was something wrong what is it oh what is it my dear my dear what have you done what have you done there was an instants dead silence as the cry died away and clemence stood with her beseeching eyes dark and dilated her uplifted face white and quivering appealing as it seemed for an answer to julian himself falconer was looking straight before him his face set and grim passive not only with the natural passivity of a man in the presence of inevitable anguish but with the involuntary self forgetfulness of a man in the presence of a power greater than he can understand mrs romayne had paused as though stopped by some kind of hard annoyed surprise then mrs romayne went on in a thin tense voice there is no time to waste over what has been done the point is to retrieve it he must come back at once where is he with a sudden quick movement clemence turned crossed the room and laid the child tenderly in the little cot standing by the fire she pressed her face down for one instant to the tiny sleep flushed cheek and then rose and came back to mrs romayne and falconer her face white and resolute her eyes shining glancing from one to the other as she spoke will there be time she said can i get to him before he sails there is a woman downstairs who will take care of my child he is alone he may be doing flight what can flight do for him if he has done wrong he doesnt always know i am his wife and i must go and help him will there be time it was falconer to whom her eyes finally turned vaguely conscious of the absence of womanly sympathy and appealing in the void for a mans knowledge and assistance it was falconer who answered her instinctively and involuntarily he answered her directly the current of his thoughts seeming to submit itself to hers without an impulse to resist or control her where was he going he said to america was the answer eager and low as though life and death hung on the response it should elicit he was going then he told me that was at nine oclock last night oh if i go at once i shall be in time i shall be in time a hard nervous irritation was disturbing the concentration of mrs romaynes face futile and utterly to be ignored as seemed to her any impulse on the part of the woman to whom in the face of the terrible issues with which she stood confronted she gave no personal consideration whatever the introduction of such futility seemed in the strained tense condition of her nerves to involve irrelevancy and delay which she was utterly unable to meet with any self command she broke in now her voice harsh and vibrating with uncontrollable impatience there is no need she said i am on my way to him now you there is no need for you you can do nothing i am his wife said clemence she did not raise her voice no colour came to her dead white face only she turned to julians mother with her hands crushed tightly together against her heart and such a light shining in her eyes as seemed to transfigure her whole face and figure for an instant the eyes of the two women met and held one another then mrs romayne with a gesture which seemed to repudiate and deny the influence which nevertheless she was powerless to resist turned to falconer and moved swiftly towards the door what does it matter she said in a tone of fierce impatience which relegated clemence to the position of the merest nonentity the only thing of consequence is time she swept out of the room as she spoke and clemence turned again to falconer stretching out beseeching hands help me she said the movement which he had thought to guide and control so easily had passed beyond falconers control and he knew it he could only follow it waiting until the turn of events should throw it as he still believed they must upon a mans strength and experience but as clemence had touched him once before against his will she touched him now against his judgement and he answered her in one word come throughout the terrible hours that followed during the drive to the station the sickening suspense the brief interval of waiting for a train the long journey neither by word nor sign did mrs romayne evince the slightest consciousness of clemences presence her face almost stony now in its set determination never altered after they were seated in the train she never spoke at all she sat gazing straight before her motionless as a statue like a woman living only by her hold upon a moment in the future to which each present second as it passed was bringing her nearer there had been no time to ascertain the probabilities as to their forestalling the sailing of the boat in which julian had presumably intended to leave england falconer while admitting to himself that the young man might have over estimated panic stricken the danger in which he had placed himself had but faint hope that any steps other than the promotion of his speedy departure would be possible when they should be in possession of the facts even should their arrival be in time to frustrate his original determination but mrs romayne weighed no probabilities she looked neither to the right nor to the left she saw before her only the climax and consummation of the struggle of twenty years and on that consummation was concentrated her whole existence chapter xiv the room was very still even the clock upon the mantelpiece was not going so that not even a low tick disturbed the perfect quiet it was a sitting room in one of the liverpool hotels and quite alone in it was clemence she was sitting near the window motionless her hands clasped tightly together on her knee her face was lifted slightly towards the sky and its calm broken now and again by a slight quiver of the lips was that of intense absorption clemences was one of those natures in which great mental suffering of any kind passes instinctively into unformed prayer and she was praying now with her whole being with no faintest consciousness of herself or her mental attitude she had been sitting there alone and motionless for more than an hour when a touch fell upon the handle of the door she started violently and rose involuntarily to her feet as it opened to admit falconer she did not speak all her agony of questioning seemed to have passed into the eyes she fixed upon him and into those tightly clasped hands falconer crossed the room quickly to her and spoke as though in answer to audible words i have found him he said there has been some delay the boat will not leave until to morrow and till then he is here a breath of unutterable relief and thanksgiving broke from clemences white lips and she let her face fall forward for a moment on her hands then she lifted it again tremulous and shaken is it right that he should go she said it is necessary returned falconer sternly but the sternness was not for her a look of trouble and perplexity passed into her face her lips were parted to speak again when a door at the other end of the room opened sharply not the door by which falconer had entered but a second leading presumably into a bedroom and mrs romayne appeared the rigidity of her self control had given place apparently to a consuming fever her eyes were glittering the dry skin seemed to be too tightly drawn across her sharpened features there was no paint upon her now no mask less tangible but no less effective of artificiality of expression it was the very woman stripped of all the trappings of her life bearing the ravages of past struggles thick upon her driven to bay and braced to hold the struggle on which she was entering with the last breath in her body she was still dressed for walking and the contrast between the smart somewhat youthful apparel which she had always affected and her face was terrible to see she came straight up to falconer utterly unconscious apparently as far as feeling and realisation constitute consciousness of clemences presence you have found him she said and the words were less a question than an assertion let us go at once stop though she added abruptly laying a burning hand on falconers arm as though in the haste and pressure of her own impulses she ascribed a similar impatience to him i had better know the facts first what has he told you falconer hesitated his words when he spoke ignored her final question and answered the idea which vibrated behind every word of her speech he glanced at clemence as he began to speak as though he wished his words to apply to her also i do not think he said that anything will be gained by your seeing him except extreme distress for all concerned i fear there is nothing to be done he had spoken very firmly as though the moment had arrived in his estimation for that stand on manly judgement which he had involuntarily postponed for so long and he paused as though to accentuate the weight of his words mrs romayne with a gesture of irrepressible tortured impatience but otherwise with no recognition whatever of his having spoken repeated her question what has he told you clemences eyes fixed upon falconers face dilated slightly and then the shadow of a smile touched her parted lips i fear there is no doubt that it is a bad affair continued falconer there are forged documents connected with it and misappropriation of money fraudulently come by and detection seems to be inevitable his only hope of safety lies in flight as though with the very tangibility and imminence of the danger she had come forth to meet mrs romaynes spirit rose higher the only sort of change brought to her face by the words was an intensifying of all its previous characteristics of growing courage and determination from clemences lips the little tremulous light had died quenched in such a horror of vicarious shame of pity love and anguish unspeakable as seemed to freeze her where she stood the facts the facts the words came from mrs romayne sharp and tense seeming to put aside and ignore any extraneous comment or opinion falconer hesitated again for a moment and scanned her face closely absolutely unconscious of his own incapacity for reading what was written there so far was he from an adequate conception of the realities of the situation that he thought that a plain statement of details would crush out for ever the hope of which he was conscious in her and he decided that such instantaneous crushing was the only mercy he could show her gravely and concisely with no unnecessary comment he told her the whole story as he had gathered it half an hour earlier from julians incoherent despairing words he finished and paused holding himself braced for the outbreak of despair which he expected his words were followed by a dead silence his eyes were fixed on mrs romayne with a vague fear for her reason and he felt rather than saw that clemence had turned away and was standing with her face hidden in her hands mrs romaynes brows had contracted as if in intense thought and her eyes were extraordinarily bright and keen at last with no slightest relaxation of the intent calculation of her face she asked one or two questions as to details of business procedure the words coming from her sharp and distinct questions of which falconer as he answered them tried in vain to see the drift then she moved with a gesture of determination so self absorbed that it seemed to isolate her utterly take me to him at once she said a sharp exclamation broke from falconer and as she moved towards the door he followed her hastily indescribably disturbed and confused by so entirely unexpected a course of action to what purpose he said quickly i beg of you to be advised by me the boy must go nothing can be gained but a parting mrs romayne turned upon him and faced him suddenly i am here to see my son she said and there was something in her voice rather in what its intense restraint suggested than in its tones themselves absolutely dominating and conclusive you came to help me take me to him or tell me where to find him intensely annoyed and disapproving keenly alive to the fear that julian so taken by surprise might impute to him some definitely treacherous intention in withholding as he had done the fact that he was not alone falconer yet felt himself powerless he had no shadow of a right to stand between mother and son he had made his stand and he might as effectually have opposed himself to the wind his words his judgement were as nothing to her that he should so far fail to carry into effect his conception of his duty as her escort as to let her go alone was of course impossible in his eyes he made a sternly unwilling sign to the effect that he would perforce accompany her and then as she passed quickly out of the room he looked at clemence there was a stunned look upon her face now she did not even glance at him in answer but she moved mechanically as it seemed and like a woman walking in her sleep and followed mrs romayne not one word was spoken by either of the trio until they stood a quarter of an hour later before a rather dingy door in a dreary passage of an unpretentious and obscure private hotel then falconer spoke in a low stern tone here he said indicating the door before them mrs romayne moved swiftly forward and turned the handle for one instant as the door opened there was a vision of a dull bare little sitting room touched with a strange glory by a red ray from the setting sun which slanted right across it and in the middle of the room in the full light of that red ray which fell with an almost weird effect of irradiation upon his attitude of despair julian sitting by the table his head buried on his outstretched arms for an instant only the picture was visible then julian turned his head sharply and sprang to his feet with a cry his mother was advancing rapidly towards him but it was not his mother that he saw it was the figure behind her with the dazed white face all breaking up now into quivering lines it was to that figure that he stretched out his hands with the hoarse heart broken sob clemmie clemmie theyve told you before the words were uttered clemence had rushed past mrs romayne and was clinging to him in such a sudden agony of sobs and tears as seemed to rend her very heart mrs romayne stopped abruptly falconer who was close to her with his back to the door which he had shut swiftly on julians cry saw a spasm of pain cut across the concentration of her face for an instant and in the flash of anger and impatience which succeeded it she seemed to recognise clemences presence practically for the first time she fell back a step or two waiting with contemptuous self control her eyes fixed upon the pair before her as they clung together and julian tried brokenly and despairingly to soothe the pitiful abandonment of grief with which clemence was shaken his own distress increased with every incoherent word of self reproach he uttered and it was a sense of his anguish that seemed at last to reach clemence and produce in her a womans instinct towards the suppression of her own pain she disengaged herself gently forcing back the heavy sob that trembled on her lips and looked from julian towards mrs romayne with a tacit recognition of his mothers claims which was as beautiful as it was instinctive you will listen she said in a choked beseeching voice you will listen and come back she turned away as she spoke making him a sign that he should not speak to her and as she drew away from him mrs romayne advanced rapidly every movement every line of her face every tone of her voice claiming as an inalienable right her sons attention her face was very hard far harder than it had been before that spasm of pain had shaken it and there was no touch of emotion in her hard quick voice she seemed to have put all sentiment deliberately aside julian she said you have made a terrible mistake you are taking just the one false step that would be absolutely irretrievable you must come back to town at once her manner her voice some influence from the long past days when her word for all her affectation of weak indulgence had been his law had arrested his attention almost without his own consent he stood now looking at her looking at her across such a gulf of ignorance mistake and wrong as had swallowed even that bitterness with which he had once regarded her leaving him absolutely cold and dead to her town and i have parted company mother he said he spoke hoarsely but the emotion in his tone was the reflex of that through which he had just passed in meeting clemence his manner was even callous that would be true indeed was the quick answer if you had succeeded in leaving england not only town and you but life and you everything that makes life worth living would have parted company to go away now is to cut your own throat julian turned to falconer havent you told them he said thickly dont they know that that is done falconer drew a step nearer your mother knows he began but mrs romayne interposed lifting her hand peremptorily without even glancing at him i know everything she said i know that you are in hideous danger and if you run away from it it is indeed all over with you you must face it you must defy it as though in her last words she had touched and given form and life to the very core of the determination which had nerved her since she had first read julians letter that morning her voice rose as she spoke them into a ring of indomitable courage vibrating with the very triumph of that defiance of which she spoke her slight haggard physique seemed to expand to gain in dignity and power as the whole room seemed to fill with the magnetism of her intense resolution there was an instants pause and then an exclamation broke alike from julian and from falconer julians was almost derisive in its absolute repudiation of her words falconers was sternly incredulous clemence was standing a little apart no sound came from her but she lifted her face suddenly and turned it towards mrs romayne a vague horror and confusion had dawned in her eyes before the annihilating words with which falconer obviously intended to follow up his first ejaculation could be uttered mrs romayne was speaking again in a rapid businesslike tone now but always with that ring of triumph behind it you must come back with me to night and take up your position as if nothing could shake it you must fight for your credit and your social status tooth and nail when you have lost them you have lost everything you have not lost them yet and no risk is too great to run for their retention not penal servitude asked julian with a ghastly smile not penal servitude not hanging if that were the risk returned his mother passionately what are you better off if you escape disgraced ostracised ruined beyond all hope of reclamation than you would be in a convicts cell what would you have to live for to hope for when you have lost your position with the world you have lost everything what does it matter that you go down in one wave rather than another she paused a moment battling with her fierce horror and repulsion then she went on again in another tone eager and decided but the risk is not so frightful after all she said show it a bold front and we shall triumph over it now listen to me julian this other man this man ramsay was the actual forger she paused for an answer and apparently the insistence of her tone forced one from julian in spite of himself as far as the actual commission of the forgery goes yes he said sullenly but then what is there to prove to prove mind that you were a party to it julian glanced round at clemence as if involuntarily then he looked recklessly back at his mother and laughed harshly the facts he began his mother caught up the words the facts yes she said but if the facts are denied can they be proved if you face this meeting and say that you yourself have been deceived even if it should come to a prosecution there are always loopholes with good counsel and facing it out ourselves unflinchingly you would come through untouched it is the only chance julian and we must dare it chapter xv the red glow from the setting sun had shifted a little it fell now behind julian and between him and clemence and its light seemed to isolate the mother and son shutting them in alone together mrs romayne stood a few paces from julian not touching him or appealing to him concentrating all her forces on the dominating of his weaker nature julian stood doggedly before her his hands clenched his face set near the window looking across the shabby little room from which those two figures eloquent of struggle and crisis stood out so strangely was clemence her eyes fixed upon julian now as though life and death hung on his looks aloof alike from clemence and from the mother and son a grim spectator holding in reserve his weight of condemnation until the upshot of the scene should declare itself was dennis falconer for all answer as though her ringing words had touched him so little that he found them not even worth the trouble of an articulate denial julian shook his head sullenly the gesture witnessed to a heavy dead weight of dissent likely to be more difficult to act upon than the most vehement opposition and mrs romayne paused for a moment looking at him her lips taking a firmer line her eyes flashing you dont realise the position she said look at it and understand the choice before you on the one hand is ignominy ruin the end of your career to reach it you have only to give way to your nerves to act under the influence of panic to run away in short on the other hand she moved a step nearer to him with a tense emphatic gesture which seemed an outlet for some of the passionate urgency which she was keeping resolutely in hand on the other hand is the very reverse of all this social position consideration the prosperous life to which you have always looked forward all this is to be retained by one bold stroke by a little courage and resolution and at the risk of what is by no means worse than the life which must inevitably be yours if you do not nerve yourself to run it julian think what is at stake falconers eyes had been fixed on mrs romayne severe inexorable in their condemnation they travelled now to julian again julian made that dull gesture of negation its all over he said doggedly ive staked and lost you have not lost yet his mother cried the vibration in her voice was stronger now and there were white patches coming and going faintly about her mouth you shall not lose while i can lift a hand to save you think think its all before you still happiness success life youve only to grasp them instead of letting go think julian had been standing with his haggard young face averted from her staring sullenly at the ground he turned upon her suddenly his face quivering with an impotent misery of regret his voice ringing with hopeless bitterness theyre gone he said ive thrown them all away i might as well be dead thats true enough it might be possible to brazen it out i dont know i dont care it wouldnt give me anything worth having social position credit standing what good would they be to me im sick of the whole thing ive done with it his incoherent hardly articulated words stopped abruptly and he seemed to struggle fiercely for means of expression so fiercely that the blind impotent wrestle with the limitations of a lifetime seemed to dominate the situation for the moment and in mrs romaynes agonised face as she watched him the life seemed arrested it was as though he were groping and fighting among sensations and instincts so new to him that he had no words in his vocabulary in which to clothe them and the effort to express them was instinct with the despair of conscious futility he seemed to break away at last and rush upon a wild confused declaration which comprised all that he could grasp why should i fight for what i dont want he cried hoarsely theres nothing worth having now my boy the cry arrested clemence moving towards julian with shining eyes and white parted lips it arrested falconer who had drawn nearer to mrs romayne with a desperate impulse to end the struggle by throwing into the scale against mrs romayne the weight of his opinion my boy my boy dont talk like that for heavens sake for heavens sake julian my darling if not for yourself for your mother i have lived for you i have had no thought in life but you to save you to protect you to keep you from ruin such as this dont break my heart ah she broke into a low wailing moan wringing her hands together as her eyes fastened on his face transfixed into an expression of blank surprise as his eyes met hers for the first time dont look like that julian julian in all these years have you never understood have you never understood how i have loved you they were face to face mother and son all the artificialities and conventionalities of their lives scorched and burnt away but between them lay that unbridgeable gulf of ignorance and wrong and her outstretched hands appealed to him in vain he looked at her coldly uncertainly as though she were a stranger to him then with one strange gasping cry she seemed to thrust all consciousness of herself fiercely on one side in her realisation of his great need in the very crisis of her agony in the very crisis as it seemed of her defeat there came upon her a great dignity my son she said there is something in your life of which you have never known something which accident might have revealed to you at any time but which i kept from you hoping that fortune might favour me as it has done and preserve your ignorance believing that in happiness and self respect lay one of your safeguards and dreading that knowledge might bring to you some sort of morbid temptation julian it is the toil and struggle of twenty years that you are trampling on in throwing down your life like this twenty years ago your father died by his own hand a swindler liar and thief a few chance words brought home to me the possibility that some such dreadful taint might rest on you to keep you from its awful consequence to give you such a life as should obviate the possibility of temptation to hedge you in with every security that money and position could create for you to give you such a standing in the world as should leave you nothing to wish for has been the one thought the one motive of my life from that time until now the speech so terrible a declaration of a struggle foredoomed by its own essence to failure a struggle in which the foe was real the combatant in desperate earnest and the weapons straws trembled into an abrupt palpitating silence as though her feelings were too intense for speech there was a moments stillness like the stillness of death a stillness broken only by julians long laboured breaths as he stood facing her his face blanched and frozen into an image of horror then he spoke is it true he had turned mechanically to dennis falconer and the words came from him in a hoarse whisper dennis falconer was white to the lips far down in his nature at the root of the rigid and conventional morality by which he lived was a pulse which palpitated in harmony with the divine realities of life and as like answers to like that pulse in him had recognised its counterpart at last through all the cramped distortion that had concealed it for so long beating full and strong instinct with the throbbing life of the same great realities in a dwarfed and darkened womans soul perfect mother love absolute self abnegation let them clothe themselves in what mistaken form they may are an earnest of ideal love and beauty and in their presence condemnation must give place to reverence conscious for the first time in his life that he stood in the midst of that which was beyond his power to analyse or to estimate he made no attempt at speech he bowed his head in silence julian looked at him for a moment longer and then he turned his face once more upon his mother as though what she saw there struck into her very heart a cry of pity and tenderness broke from her she moved swiftly to him putting her arms about him trying to draw him into her embrace as though he had been once more her little child julian she cried my boy my boy try to understand try to understand why i have told you this now i dont ask you to think of me to think what such a repetition of the past as threatens me in you would be to me a blow infinitely heavier an agony infinitely crueller than what came upon me twenty years ago because of the long struggle to which it would bring defeat because of the long hope and resolution which it would take out of my heart because of my love for you my darling my darling she was kissing his hands now passionately with that oblivion of any other presence in the room which she had evinced throughout and falconer watching her fascinated almost awestruck saw her as she went on lift one of the young mans hands and press it to her cheek stroking it with a wild nervous movement of her own thin fingers but theres a motive power for you in it julian a lever for your own pride your own strength of will you are panic stricken unnerved worn out danger is new to you my darling look at your fathers fate wholesale ruin disgrace and obloquy and let it nerve you to turn away from it look down the precipice on the brink of which you are standing and lay firm hold upon the only rope that can save you take your courage in both hands and we will face the danger and conquer together oh my boy if it is a hot fire to pass through it wont last long it leads to safety to firmer standing ground to a new lease of life she was clinging to him convulsively touching his hands his hair his face as though speech alone afforded an all insufficient outlet for her agonised beseeching and as she spoke the last words he seized her hands in his and thrust her from him not with any personal roughness but rather unconsciously and involuntarily as in the very isolation of despair life he cried what can life give to me beyond what ive got already ive got my billet like father like son im bound for the dogs sooner or later and i dont care to spin out the journey whos going to fight against his fate it is not fate through that little room across and above the passion and despair that filled it the words rang out strong and clear and julian turned with a convulsive start to meet them clemence had come swiftly across the room and was standing beside him facing him as he turned to her facing falconer arrested in a quick movement to interpose blindly and instinctively as it seemed between julian and his mother facing mrs romayne as she stood leaning heavily on the back of a chair her eyes strained and terrible to see her face ghastly all that humanity can touch of the beautiful and the inspiring all the burning faith the quivering personal realisation of that unseen of which each man is a part the human love acting upon and reacted on by the divine instinct was shining out from clemences face she paused hardly for an instant as her clear eyes dark and deep with the intensity of her fervour rested on julian as though they saw him and him only in all the world then her voice rang out again sweet and full theres no such thing as fate she said not like that not fate that makes us bad theres god julian its trying to do right that matters nothing else in life and that we can all do theres nothing nothing can prevent us oh i dont say her voice broke into a great pity and tenderness i dont say that its not harder for some than for others but its whats hard that is best worth doing julian she drew a step nearer to him stretching out both her hands youre looking at it wrong dear the things youve lost for good are not the things that matter what one has what people think of one thats nothing its what one is its oneself thats the only thing to mind about she stopped her whole face stirred and tremulous with her conviction and julian with an impulsive movement caught her hands in his and pressed his forehead down upon them in a blind agony of self abasement im a swindler clemmie he cried thickly it was as though he had hardly taken in the full sense of her words but was clinging to her and confessing to her under some blunted bewildered impetus a cheat and a thief all round thats what i am but thats not for ever she cried such love and hope and courage shining in her eyes as would not let her great tears fall you can retrieve the past you can repent and begin again ah i know of course that what is done cant ever be undone what you have done remains the same for always but you can change you can be different and nothing else but you yourself matters at all what does it matter if people think you a cheat if you are an honest man nothing no more than it matters to yourself if they call you an honest man for ever when youre a cheat she paused again but this time he did not speak he lifted his head and drew her to him crushing her hands against his breast and looking into her eyes with a strange agonised struggle towards comprehension dawning in his own there was a moments dead silence there was that passing between clemence and julian which no words could have touched the final struggle towards dominion of a mans better nature falconer had fallen back all that was narrow and conventional about his morality had shrivelled into nothingness and stood confessed to his own consciousness for what it was he knew that the great question now at issue was beyond the reach of his mans practicality and that he could only stand aside mrs romayne was gripping heavily at the chair by which she stood impotent frozen despair paralysing her from head to foot leaving alive and sentient only her eyes you must go back dear the words fell from clemences lips tender distinct immutable as the laws of right and wrong you must take the consequences of what youve done and through that pain and shame youll get above it to begin again julians lips white now as ashes moved stiffly the consequences he whispered the consequences clemmie the consequences she replied and in the ring of her voice in the clasp with which her hands closed over his was all the courage and conviction with which she sought to nerve him ah i dont know i dont understand but are there no innocent people who may suffer for your fault unless you are there to take it on yourself besides how else dear how can you begin again without having made amends how can you free yourself of the past without acknowledging whats black and bad in it and if you acknowledge whats black and bad how can you hesitate to take its punishment and as if that struggling life in him were growing and stirring under her influence a strange flickering light crept into julians face and the struggle in his eyes grew into a faint suggestion of victory he paused a moment his breath coming thick and fast but suppose suppose it isnt any good his voice tense hardly audible seemed to catch and strain like that of a man at the very crisis of his life suppose its in me and i must it isnt so she cried and as she spoke she drew away from him as though carried beyond herself beyond her womanly love for him in that supreme declaration of the truth that was her very being you know it isnt so there is no must except gods must to us that we should follow him there is no power can tear us from his hand unless we throw ourselves away by saying that his hand is without strength to save us good and evil lie before every one of us and we must all choose and nothing else is real and living in this life except that choice and the end to which it leads us through all the limitations of the phraseology in which her faith was clothed the great truth which makes the mystery of humanity the truth which words can only belittle and obscure which lives not in words but in the silent consciousness of each mans soul rang out all penetrating and all dominating and as she faced him her eyes shining her whole face radiant julian caught her in his arms with a great cry i will he cried clemence i choose help me i will go back she yielded to his touch with a low sob and as they stood clasped in one anothers arms a shuddering moan rang through the room and mrs romayne fell heavily forward at their feet chapter xvi will she suffer any more on the upper landing of the hotel in which falconer had found julian clemence was standing one hand resting on the handle of a door which she had just closed behind her looking in the uncertain light of a flickering gas jet into the face of the man to whom she spoke he was a quick capable looking man with a brisk professional manner evidently a doctor clemences face was pale and tired as though with strain or watching and her low voice shook a little the doctor was drawing on his left hand glove and he paused to answer her i should say that she would not he said it is practically over he gave a keen rather curious look at clemence and then added you are alone with the lady yes said clemence simply a long night and a long day had passed and between mrs romayne and the one absorbing passion of her life had fallen that solemn shadow before which all earthly passions pale and fade away that solemn shadow before whose creeping touch not strength of will not love itself can stand as she fell to the ground before her son she had loosed her hold perforce on all the struggle and burning resolution which was life to her she had followed the guide whom none may resist into that valley through which every one must pass and its mists had lifted from her no more from that one long faint she had been brought back only to fall into another in such total unconsciousness which had yielded twice to intervals of physical pain terrible to see the long hours had passed and in one of these spaces of blank unconsciousness julian romayne had seen his mother for the last time the necessity for his departure was pressing and relentless the meeting of the shareholders was imminent and that meeting he must face he had left his mothers room in the grey light of the early morning with a look on his face which clemence the only witness of that mute parting never forgot and he had gone away with dennis falconer to make those preparations for his surrender of himself to justice which were not to be delayed and now the day was drawing to a close the doctor had paid his last visit and the night was drawing on there was a moments pause after clemences words then the doctor wished her a professional good night and as he went downstairs she turned and went back into the room it was a small room the best which the hotel cared to place at the disposal of sudden illness but somewhat dingy and ill appointed the gaslight shaded from the face upon the bed but shedding a garish light upon the rest of the room touched nothing luxurious nothing which its present occupant could have realised in connection with herself her very rings lying upon the dressing table and flashing under the gaslight seemed to protest against such poor surroundings but the figure on the bed lay motionless protesting never more it lay in blank unconsciousness even when clemence crossing the room stood for a moment looking down her whole face tender and quivering and then sank gently on her knees and pressed her lips with a womanly gesture of infinite pity to the pale inanimate hand upon the bed it was over now practically as the doctor looking at that waning life from a purely physical point of view had said all the struggle and the dread all the courage and the hope the valiant ignorance of twenty years and the face upon the pillow was the face of the vanquished the face of one whose last vivid consciousness of earthly things had been the consciousness of failure for many minutes clemence knelt there all the feeling of her womans soul seeming to expend itself in that soft mute pressure then she rose quietly and moved across the room to make some final preparation for the night that done she came back again to the bedside and doing so she started the shadowy hands were moving feebly upon the counterpane from out the grey pinched face upon the pillow two glazed blue eyes were looking with a restless searching movement as though in want of something they rested upon clemence with no recognition in them but as her sons wife drew nearer to her quickly and gently mrs romayne moved feebly and tried to turn her head upon the pillow as though moved by some vague indefinite and far away sense of dislike and repulsion her white lips moved uncertainly as she did so and faint sounds came from between them clemence bent over her tenderly and tried to catch the words and they grew gradually a little clearer my boy the faint uncertain voice muttered my little boy a great wave of pity and yearning swept over clemence and she sank once more to her knees fixing her eyes on the poor worn face was it of any use to speak could her voice reach to those dim lands where the mother groped for her little boy he will come she said he will come by and by as though the voice had roused her without penetrating to her brain mrs romayne moved again that slight feeble movement so eloquent of the extremity of weakness her eyes turned to clemence with that glance of vague unrecognising dislike no she said as though answering her no hes too little she paused and again there was that groping movement of her hands his letter she muttered his letter my dear mamma my dear mamma there was a restless distress in the glazed eyes now and their glance tore clemences heart the feeble hands were moving painfully and as she watched with her tears falling fast in her impotent pity and longing to satisfy their craving something in their movements all unmeaning as they seemed at first penetrated to clemences understanding with one of those strange flashes of comprehension only possible under so tense a strain of sympathy those nerveless hands were feeling for a pocket in an instant clemence had risen crossed the room and put her hand into the pocket of the dress which mrs romayne had worn her finger touched a paper and she drew it out instantly she saw that it was yellow and faded with age and she moved quickly back with it to the bedside the hands and the eyes were still moving but the muttered words were audible no longer and as clemence put the paper gently between the thin fingers she felt with a sudden thrill of awe that they were growing cold but the touch seemed to rouse mrs romayne once more her fingers closed on the paper as if instinctively and the restless distress died out of her eyes as she tried vainly to unfold the paper clemence put out her hand gently and did the work for which the dying fingers had no strength and on the dying face there dawned a pale shadowy smile yes she said yes my dear mamma my dear mamma your loving son julian and with her sons name on her lips mrs romayne left him behind and passed from ignorance to knowledge the trial and conviction of julian romayne were a nine days wonder in society the people who had most readily and carelessly received the widow and son of william romayne asked one another with the martyred air of those whose charity has been abused and their feelings for morality outraged what was to be expected after all of the son of such a father the people whose feelings for morality had been outraged at the outset by mrs romaynes reappearance in london and soothed subsequently by the simplicity of the position observed sagely that they had always said so both parties were unanimous in the assertion that the young mans life was practically at an end he had forfeited his place in society for ever but julian himself realised gradually and painfully during the years of his punishment with the strength of a manhood attained through pain when he went away to a new country with his wife and child that his life had just begun the end f m evans co limited printers crystal palace se january a classified catalogue of books in general literature
