xxii holgate's last hand hurricane island chapter i the sea queen pember street e is never very cheerful in appearance not even in mid spring when the dingy lilacs in the forecourts of those grimy houses bourgeon and blossom the shrubs assimilate soon the general air of depression common to the neighbourhood the smoke catches and turns them they wilt or wither and the bunches of flowers are sicklied over with the smuts and blacks of the roaring chimneys the one open space within reach is the river and thither i frequently repaired during the three years i practised in the east end at least it was something to have that wide flood before one the channel of great winds and the haunt of strange craft the tide grew turbid under the tower bridge and rolled desolately about the barren wilderness of the isle of dogs but it was for all that a breach in the continuity of ugly streets and houses a wide road itself on which tramped unknown and curious lives passing to and fro between london and foreign parts unless a man be in deadly earnest or very young i cannot conceive a career more distressing to the imagination and crushing to the ambition than the practice of medicine in the east end the bulk of my cases were club cases which enabled me to be sure of a living and the rest were for the most part sordid and unpleasant subjects springing out of the vile life of the district alien sailors abounded and quarrelled fiercely often and often have i been awakened in the dead hours to find drunken and foreign speaking men at my door with one or more among them suffering from a dangerous knife wound and the point of it that came nearly home to me was that this career would not only lead to nothing but was unprofitable in itself i had taken the position in the hope that i might make something of it but i found that it was all i could do to maintain my place i made no charge for advice in my consultations but took a little money on the medicine which i made up is any position to be conceived more degrading to a professional man the one bright time in my week was of a saturday when i donned my best coat and gloves took down my silkiest hat and discarding the fumes and flavours of the east set out for piccadilly i still remained a member of a decent club and here i lunched in my glory talked with some human creatures exchanged views on the affairs of the world smoked and lolled in comfortable chairs in short took my enjoyment like a man about town and then went back to earn my next week's holiday punctually to a minute i must be in the surgery in pember street at six o'clock and the horrid round must begin to circle again i will confess that there was a time when i could have loved that career as a saunterer in west end streets it appealed to me at five and twenty almost as a romantic profession other young men whom i had known at school and college had entered it and some were or appeared to be signal stars in that galaxy of wealth and beauty my means however denied me access and at thirty i would have been content after my experience of hardships and poverty to settle in some comfortable suburb not too distant from the sphere of radiance as it was i was in chains in the slums of wapping and re visited the glimpses of piccadilly once a week when i rose on an evening in november to go down to the river almost for the last time it was not a saturday but a thursday and the west end seemed still a long way off i had finished my round of cases and had sat waiting in my dingy surgery for patients but none had come and in the enforced meditation that ensued as i reviewed my past and my prospects my soul sickened in me i wanted to breathe more freely i wanted more air and something more cheerful than the low surgery lamp and the dismal lights that wagged in the street i put on my hat and passed down to the river it was quite dark and the easterly drift had obscured and dirtied the sky so that when i came out by a landing which i knew now familiarly i could see only the lights across the water and some tall spars and funnels in the foreground but the river at full tide champed audibly against the wharves and the various sounds of that restless port assailed my ears the roar of the unseen traffic behind me the fluting and screaming of whistles the mingled shouts oaths and orders in the distance and the drone of that profound water under all i had stood for some minutes drinking in the better air when there were voices near suddenly risen out of the flood and i perceived two men had landed they paused by me for one to relight his pipe and in the flash of the match i gathered from the dresses that they were stevedores newly come no doubt from unloading some vessel but my attention was taken off them unexpectedly by a great flare that went up into the sky apparently in mid channel it made a big bright flame quite unusual in that resort of silent lights and one of the stevedores commented on it that'll be her he said she was coming up round the dogs in a la di da fashion maybe she'll fly rockets in another minute them steam yachts are the jockeys to blue the money responded his companion nothink's good enough for them what is it i asked only a geordie brig straight from winning the america cup sir said the first man with a facetious smile what did they make her out bill bill hesitated i think it was the sea queen he said doubtfully and added in harmony with his companion's mood they don't want to make themselves known not by a long chalk with which the flare having died down they tramped away into the night with a civil leave taking i followed them presently moving along the road in the direction of the docks when i reached the entrance i paused and the gatekeeper addressed me going in doctor got a call i recognised him in the dimness of his lamp as a man whom i had attended for an accident and i gave him good evening no said i but i want some air i think i will if you don't mind welcome sir said he cheerily and i found myself on the other side of the gateway i walked along the vacant stretch of ground lit only by dull gas lamps and passing the low office buildings and storing sheds came out by the water basins here was a scene of some bustle and disorder but it was farther on that the spectators were engaged in a knot for the caisson was drifting round and a handsome vessel was floating in her funnel backed against the grey darkness and her spars in a ghostly silhouette the name i heard on several sides roused in me a faint curiosity it was the stranger i had observed the sea queen the subject of the stevedores' pleasantries a pretty boat said i to my neighbour what is she he shook his head sea queen out of hamburg he said and a pleasure yacht from the look of her but what she does here beats me the caisson closed and the steam yacht warped up slowly to the pier there was little or no noise on her only a voice raised occasionally in an authoritative command and the rattling of chains that paid out through the donkey engine idly i moved to the stone quay when the gangway was let down but only one man descended the passengers if there had been any had long since reached town from tilbury saving themselves that uninteresting trudge up the winding river lane i moved on to where a steamer was being loaded under the electric lights and watched the same for some time with interest then taking out my watch i examined it and came to the conclusion that if i was to see any patients that evening at all i must at once get back to my unpalatable rooms i began to go along the pier and passed into the shadow of the sea queen now sunk in quiet and drab and dark as i went a port hole in the stern almost on the level of my eyes gleamed like a moon and of a sudden there was an outbreak of angry voices one threatening volubly and the other deeper and slower but equally hostile it was not that the altercation was anything astonishing in human life but i think it was the instantaneous flash of that light and those voices in a dead ship that pulled me up i stared into the port hole and as i did so the face of a man passed across it 'twixt the light and me it passed and vanished and i walked on as i turned to go down to the gates i was aware of the approaching fog i had seen it scores of times in that abominable low lying part of the town and i knew the symptoms there was a faint smell in the air an odour that bit the nostrils carrying the reek of that changeless wilderness of factories and houses the opaque grey sky lost its greyness and was struck to a lurid yellow banks of high fog rolled up the east and moved menacingly almost imperceptibly upon the town for a moment there were dim shadows of the wharves and the riverside houses with a church tower dimmer still behind them and then the billows of the fog descended and swallowed up all i moved now in a blackness but bore to the right in which direction i knew were the dock sheds and safety i seemed to have been feeling my way for a long time quite ten minutes and yet i did not come upon anything i began to be seized with the fear of a blind man who is helpless in vacancy had i left the basin in my rear or had i somehow wandered back towards it and would another step take me over into the water i shrank from the thought of that cold plunge and putting out my stick on all sides tapped and tapped and went on foot by foot i was still upon the stone when i should have reached the sheds or at least have got upon the earth again with the roadway running to the gates angry at my own folly for lingering so long about the ships i continued cautiously forward trying each step of the way presently i heard a sound of footsteps before me and then a voice raised in a stave of song there followed a loud oath and the splash of a heavy body in water plainly the basin was then in front of me and some one had fallen in the poor wretch was doomed to drown in that horrid and impenetrable darkness i shuddered at the thought of that fate and moved faster under the whip of impulse the next moment i brought sharply up against a stone post by which ships were warped in and fastened below was the water and now i could hear the sound of splashing and a voice raised in a cry of terror round the post was coiled a heavy rope which i loosened as rapidly as was possible and began to lower over the edge of the basin this way i called make this way here is the pier but the splashing continued and a smother of sound came to me as if the swimmer were under water and his voice stifled almost without thinking i gripped the thick tarry rope and let myself over the basin until i had reached the surface of the water this way i called if you can get here i can save you the noise seemed to come from some little distance out and now i was in the water myself with the cable in my hand striking out feverishly and awkwardly in the direction of the struggling man i came upon him in a dozen strokes and the first news i had of him was a kick in the shoulder that almost tore me from my rope the next moment i had him by the collar and without more ado was retracing my way towing a violent mass of humanity behind me it was only by dint of hard work and by propping him in my arms that i at last landed him on the pier and then i succeeded in following myself very sore and stiff and cold the first words that sprang from the prostrate figure on the quay were some incoherent oaths which ultimately took form curse legrand curse him come said i if you are well enough to swear you are well enough to travel and we are both of us in a case for treatment i can't see you said a voice in a grumbling way but you saved me pull along and i'll do my best to follow where the dickens are we i groped and helped him to his feet give me your arm said i we can't afford to go in again either of us were you in too he asked stupidly well what do you think i replied with a little laugh and began to walk this time determinately at right angles from the basin he said nothing more but hung on my arm pretty limp as we struggled through the darkness and presently we both fell over a bale of goods so far so good i said picking him up we must be in the neighbourhood of the sheds now to find them and creep along in their protection we struck the buildings immediately after and i had no difficulty in working my way to the end that took us to dry ground or at least to the sloppy ground at the bottom of the docks by good fortune we now hit upon the roadway and it was to me a delight to hear the ring of the hard macadam under our squelching boots i was now almost cheerful for i was sure that i could not wander from the road and sure enough we were advertised of our position and heralded all the way by the meagre lamps at intervals soon after we reached the gates which were opened by my friend he peered into our faces it was a call sure enough said i laughing and here's my patient when we got into the road the fog had slightly lifted and i had less difficulty in picking my way home than i had anticipated once in the surgery i turned up the lamp and poked the fire into a blaze after which i looked at my companion it was with a sense of familiarity that i recognised his face as that which i had seen flitting across the port hole of the sea queen he sat back in the chair in which i had placed him and stared weakly about the room the steam went up from both of us look here said i if we stay so we are dead or rheumatic men and i went into my bedroom changed myself and brought him some garments of my own these he put on talking now in the garrulous voice i had heard on the yacht but somewhat disconnectedly it's awfully good of you a good samaritan and here a vacant laugh i wonder if these things how did i go over i thought i was going straight it must have been that infernal fog where the dickens are we you are in my house said i but you might be at the bottom of the basin good heavens he said with a laugh i feel mighty shivery don't you think a drop of something i looked at him closely i think it wouldn't be a bad idea in the circumstances i said oh i know i had too much to carry he said recklessly it made me quarrel with that wretched legrand too a fat headed fool i rang for water and mixed two hot jorums of whisky one of which he sipped contentedly you see we had a rousing time coming over he observed as if in apology i looked my question and he answered it hamburg in the sea queen the old man skipped at tilbury and barraclough's a real blazer which accounts for the blaze i saw i remarked drily oh you saw that yes it was that that made legrand mad he's particular but what's the odds the boss has to pay his eyes roamed about the shabby room shabby from the wretched pictures on the walls to the threadbare carpet underfoot and though he was not a gentleman i felt some feeling of irritation perhaps if he had been a gentleman i should not have been put out at this scrutiny of my poverty you saved me and that's certain he began again say are you a doctor i admitted it well can you recommend another glass of toddy he asked smiling and his smile was pleasant in the circumstances again perhaps i said oh i know i played the fool he conceded but it isn't often i do i must have gone off in the fog how did you get at me i told him that was plucky he said admiringly i don't know two folks i'd risk the same for there wasn't much risk i answered it was only a question of taking a cold bath out of season well he said and whistled there's white people everywhere i guess business good the question was abrupt and i could not avoid it you have your answer i replied with a gesture at the room and taking out my cigar case i offered him one he accepted it bit off the end and spat it on the floor as if preoccupied his brow wrinkled as if the mental exercise were unusual and difficult the sea queen is a rum bird he said presently but there's plenty of money behind and she wants a doctor well said i smiling at him we left a scotch chap sick at hamburg he continued the boss is a secret beggar with pots of money they say we chartered out of the clyde and picked him up at hamburg him and others a pleasure yacht i inquired you may call it that if it ain't that i don't know what it is and i ought to know seeing i am purser we've all signed on for twelve months anyway now doctor we want a doctor he laughed as if this had been a joke and i stared at him you mean said i slowly that i might apply if it's worth your while said he you know best well i don't know about that i replied it depends on a good many things all the same i knew that i did know best the whole of my discontent latent and seething for years surged up in me here was the wretched practice by which i earned a miserable pittance bad food and low company on the pleasure yacht i should at least walk among equals and feel myself a civilised being i could dispose of my goodwill for a small sum and after twelve months well something might turn up at any rate i should have a year's respite a year's holiday i looked across at the purser of the sea queen with his good looking easy natured face his sleek black hair and his rather flabby white face and still i hesitated i can make it a dead bird he said wagging his head and you'll find it pretty comfortable where are you going the mediterranean i asked i haven't the least idea he said with a frank yawn but if your tickets are all right you can bet on the place i'm agreeable i said in a matter of fact voice good man said he with some of his former sparkle of interest and now we'll have another to toast it and then i must be off don't you think you'd better stay here the night i asked i can put you up and the fog's thicker thanks old man he replied with easy familiarity i would like a roost only i've got an engagement i wired to some one you know and he winked at me wickedly very well said i if you have an appointment i would suggest that we leave over the toast you're right he said ingenuously but it was a nasty bath all serene i'll fix that up by the way he paused on his road to the door i haven't your name nor i yours i answered mine's richard phillimore mine's lane he said qualified mb london i replied good for you that'll make it easier i suppose i can go in your togs you're welcome i said though they don't fit you very well oh i'm a bit smaller than you i know but all cats are grey in the dark and it's infernally dark to night well so long and i'm much obliged to you i'm sure he swung out of the door with his free gait and i stopped him one word more who's your owner the boss oh morland morland a regular millionaire with that he was gone chapter ii in the three tuns the next day i had a full round of visits to make so that i had little time to think over the adventure of the previous evening on saturday i made my way as usual to the west end and spent the afternoon in luxury basking in the renewal of my self respect i had leisure then to reflect and although the more i considered the less appeared the likelihood of any advantage to myself derivable out of lane's promise yet i allowed myself the satisfaction of certain inquiries no one in the club had heard of morland the millionaire and the sea queen was unknown to my yachting friends moreover no morland appeared in the court guide still it was quite possible even probable that he was an american so that omission did not abash me it was only when i rehearsed the circumstances in bald terms that i doubted to the point of incredulity i had fished up a tipsy fellow of a loose good nature who under the stimulus of more whisky had probably at the best offered more than he was entitled to do and who at the worst had long since forgotten all about his good samaritan the situation seemed easy of interpretation and in the warmth of my pleasant intercourse with my companions i presently ceased to ponder it yet when i arrived at my house and opened the letter that awaited me i will confess that i experienced a thrill of hope it was from hills a firm of solicitors in lincoln's inn fields and premising that i was a candidate for the post of doctor in the ss sea queen requested me to call on monday at three o'clock this looked so to speak like business and i attended at the address with my mind made up and clear if i was offered the position i would take it and so cut my cable i had to wait some time in an ante room but presently was ushered into the presence of one of the partners an amiable business like man with the air of a country squire dr phillimore he queried introductively and i assented please sit down will you you are anxious to take position of doctor on the sea queen he consulted some note before him i see your name has been mentioned to my client in this connection i assume you are fully qualified i told him the facts and referred him to the medical year book moreover i added i have no doubt if a recommendation were necessary sir john wemyss of harley street would be willing to write to you sir john wemyss he echoed reflectively oh yes the cancer man let me see he was president wasn't he of the college of surgeons yes some years ago i answered a good man he declared with a friendly air of patronage well i don't suppose there would be any difficulty on that score if sir john will write my client is a prudent man and would naturally like to have the best advice available moreover he is quite willing to pay for it there is of course that question and he looked at me as if inviting my suggestion i laughed really i have no views only that naturally i should like as large a salary as is compatible with the circumstances very well dr phillimore said he nodding i daresay we can arrange that too you are young yet and the position might lead he broke off as the baize door on his left opened noiselessly what is it pye the clerk bent down and whispered to him oh very well it's opportune in a way will you ask mr morland to be good enough to come in the little clerk went out with his neat walk and the solicitor rose i shall be able to introduce you to my client who is the owner of the sea queen he said with a certain change of voice and quickly went forward to the outer door how do you do mr morland he exclaimed with a cheerful deference such as was due to the presence of wealth i was just engaged on a little matter of yours i hope you came right up these dull offices go so much by routine it was the question of a doctor sir as he spoke he indicated me and for the first time i saw mr morland he was a man of thirty five of middle height slightly disposed to stoutness but with a fine carriage and with a bronzed good looking face rendered heavier for the dull expression of his blue eyes his hair which was short and worn en brosse after a foreign fashion was straw yellow is it the doctor he asked after a glance at me and though he spoke excellent english there was also something a little foreign in his accent well sir we haven't reached that point yet said the lawyer smiling this is dr phillimore whom you wished me to ah yes said mr morland and he put out a hand mechanically you will arrange it he said to the other with an air of command most certainly sir but i thought you would like to see being on the spot no there is only one thing you know anything of throats he asked suddenly i told him i had studied under a specialist at the hospital as it happened in these days we doctors are compelled to take special courses in order to keep march with the times that is right he said nodding and the smile that came upon his face turned the eyes bluer he looked quite handsome we must all keep step with the times i will look to you to arrange it he added again to the lawyer and seemed to wait for my dismissal the solicitor bowed me sharply from the room for was not his millionaire client in waiting and i went down the stairs it was now past four and as i came out into the square i saw before me the little lawyer's clerk who had entered the room and had been called pye he was talking amiably to another man and as i passed smiled at me through his pince nez you saw mr morland he asked in a friendly way yes i said and looked at the stranger there seemed no necessity to say more it is odd that you should encounter here gentlemen said pye adjusting his glasses and yet i suppose it isn't mr holgate this gentleman is the future doctor of the sea queen oh dear me it isn't settled said i with a laugh pye beamed at me i think i know my chief's face he said it's my business to interpret him particularly when he can't interpret himself the other man laughed lazily he was a man with a big body and a face round and gross in proportion heavy lidded eyes and an imperturbable expression this is mr holgate the third officer said pye by way of introduction and somehow or other we began to walk in the direction of holborn when we had threaded the great turnstile the little clerk hesitated and swung round i was going to drink a glass of wine with mr holgate perhaps you would join us sir gladly said i for i had made up my mind to take tea before returning to wapping and somehow my interview had inspirited me i took a sanguine view of my chances for all my words to pye moreover i have always been interested in my fellow creatures and finally i was in the mood for a glass of something enters this trio then into the three tuns presently and sits to a table in comfortable chairs with the clatter of the street falling like rain on the senses and the bright flare of gas among the dark barrels there was about the place an odour of good fellowship and of peace that pleased me who had not visited these haunts for years little pye turned his pince nez on me as the attendant advanced what'll you have doctor he asked i hesitated i suppose it must be port said i port is more palatable and no more noxious in such places than any other wine any port in a storm in fact said the little man looking at me quizzically for my part said holgate in his stuffy fat voice port you should say interposed pye with brisk wit he smiled at his smartness and his eyes seemed to challenge me to respond there's nothing to beat spirits and sound rum for choice but as they won't have it here i'll take brandy continued the third officer he lighted a cigar and began to smoke examining everything within eyeshot attentively but with indifference i think except for the first glance he had bestowed upon me that he had completely ignored my presence little pye put up his glass i drink said he to a prosperous voyage mr holgate and to pleasant companions prosperous voyage said the third officer wheezily and i murmured something to the same effect you say the old man's velvet said holgate resuming his puffing well said pye beaming through his glasses i wouldn't go so far as to say it but he looks it he looks kid glove i hate 'em growled holgate i've seen that kind on the ferry all airs and aitches and frosty as a berg well of course it would be much more satisfactory to be sailing under a real tartar remarked the little man with mild pleasantry holgate cast him a glance which inquired but was indifferent what's your idea doctor he asked i have none said i smiling i am much more interested in third officers his masklike face relaxed and he stroked his black moustaches and took a long pull of his cigar that was very nice of you doctor he said nodding with more cordiality pye drew an apple from his pocket and carefully bit into it i don't know why but it struck me as comical to see him at this schoolboy business his ears alert his glasses shining and his white teeth going to and fro he reminded me of a squirrel a fancy to which the little tufts of whiskers by his ears lent themselves he eyed both of us brightly after all said the third officer heavily it's more important in the end to know your owner let alone his travelling with you i wouldn't give two straws for the old man velvet or iron so long as i could get the lug of my owner you'll find them both all right said pye reassuringly captain day i have seen and mr morland i know he is very rich i asked i'll trouble you for a two and a half commission on it said the clerk cheerfully and then i'd live like a fighting cock at least that's what we all believe there's no knowing the shadows of the november afternoon had gathered in the streets without and a thin scant rain was flying into the area of warmth and brightness entered more customers and shook the water from the umbrellas they stood at the bar and drank and talked noisily round about us in the loom of the great barrels the shadows lurched from the wagging gas flames the clerk had finished his apple we will have another said holgate this is mine i said he shook his head i protested doctor you confess you live in doubt he said whereas i have my appointment in my pocket plainly it is my right i think that's a fair argument doctor said pye i am in both your debt said i lightly for company and wine i'm sure we shall owe you both many a time yet said the third officer civilly at the table near us two men had sat and were talking even as we but one had a half penny paper and turned the flimsy thing about i fancy in search of racing news you see there is no doubt about you began pye amiably and suddenly dropped his sentence in the unexpected silence i caught some words from the other table well it's good pluck of him if he wants to marry her what's the odds if he is a prince live and let live i say pye's little squirrel head turned round and he stared for a moment at the speaker then it came back again you are uncommonly polite said holgate irritably i'm sorry i thought i recognised that voice said the little man sweetly one gets echoes everywhere i was going to say we took you for granted doctor it's good of you said i but will mr morland i can practically answer for my employer i can't say anything about mr morland who has however authorised us to appoint the yacht is from hamburg said i i believe so said he and its destination that knowledge is quite out of my province said the squirrel briefly when one came to think of it it was almost a snub and i had never any patience for these legal silences as he shut his jaws he looked a man who could keep a secret and knew his own mind yet he had been so easily familiar that i flushed with resentment confound these little professional tricks and solemnities we were meeting on another ground than lawyer and client i dare say it will be within the cabin boy's province to morrow said i somewhat sharply very likely he assented and holgate who had turned at my tone exchanged a glance with him mr pye is fond of keeping his own counsel said the third officer in his slow voice and i'm not sure he isn't right being a lawyer but he isn't a lawyer here i protested pye smiled no i'm not he said and please don't remind me of it at which we all laughed and grew friendly again well this is a funny sort of tea for me said the clerk presently i generally patronise the abc and he rose to go holgate did not move but sat staring at the fire which shone on his broad placid face i knew a man once he observed who kept his own counsel i hope he was a lawyer said pye humourously no he was a steward the steward of an estate in the north in the hills was the wealth of a millionaire coal doctor holgate looked at me and he kept his counsel and held his tongue with what object i asked oh a little syndicate succeeded in buying it from the owner and now it's a seven figure affair his face had no expression of inquiry or of inviting comment he had simply stated history but i was moved to say flippantly what luck the steward got it asked pye he romped in said the third officer and will presently be a baronet said i lightly stranger things have happened he remarked and began to smile i fancy we all smiled though it was not of course altogether humourous is that called robbery asked holgate i doubt if the law covers it said pye no it's quite an innocent transaction what is robbery i asked cynically lawyers may feel their way amid the intricacies but no one else can hope to i'm stealing now when i take these matches i will follow your example said holgate and did so i'm not sure that that's not perks said little pye with his quizzical glance well is it perks if i buy a picture from you for ten bob which i know to be worth l inquired holgate pye considered i give it up he said which only proves said i continuing my mood that it takes a good capercutter to move in and out moral sanctions i don't believe i know what that means quite said holgate giving me the full charge of his steady eyes i stooped and warmed my fingers for the cold blast of the streets was forbidding well the most famous people have been those who have successfully performed the egg dance between commandments i remarked i suppose they have said holgate thoughtfully i rose abruptly and in the glass above the mantelpiece the two figures behind me came into vision the little clerk's eyebrows were elevated in a question and the men faced each other holgate's lips were pursed and he nodded i saw this in the flash of rising and then i turned about i shall get a wigging said pye seizing his umbrella we walked out and i bade them good bye after a civil exchange of amenities then i took an omnibus down chancery lane and made for the underground as i travelled back my thoughts circled about the situation i was glad to have made the acquaintance of one or more of my shipmates if of course i was to join the company holgate puzzled me for a third officer until i reflected that in these days every officer had a master's licence yet that this man should not by the force of his evident individuality take higher rank in life surprised me what however was of most immediate concern to me was the extreme friendliness of my two companions lane was well enough in his way and certainly had shown his goodwill but holgate was more than this to a lonely man with an appetite for society holgate was intelligent i found a few patients waiting and disposed of them by eight o'clock after which i strolled down to the docks in spite of the drizzle i have said that i am interested in my fellows and in addition i confess to a certain forethought i walked down to the docks with the deliberate intention of acquiring some information about the sea queen if that were possible i knew the name of the owner or at least of the man who had chartered her i had the name and acquaintance of one or two of the company but i knew nothing as to her destination her properties as a boat or her time of sailing some of this ignorance i hoped to remedy by my visit and it seemed that i was in the way to do so from the start for no sooner was i on the quay in the neighbourhood of the yacht than i came upon a handsome young man in the dress of a superior sailor with whom i fell into talk he was outspoken as a child but volunteered nothing of his own initiative an amiable sluggish respectful fellow who was as he stated quartermaster on the sea queen i confessed my interest in her at which he indulgently supplied me with information i signed on at glasgow sir and most of us too and we picked up mr morland at hamburg him and the ladies the ladies i echoed for here was a surprise yes two ladies what came with him miss morland and another lady a dark one said my friend oh said i then you're off for a pleasure cruise i hardly know sir said he they do say new york but i haven't heard definite that looked in favour of my theory of mr morland as an american he was perhaps a trust king and miss morland a vivacious beauty from chicago here my companion suggested that i might care to have a look at the yacht my friend said i you mustn't let me take you on false pretences i may be your doctor and i may be not oh that's all right sir said he easily it can't do no harm we're only loading up with provisions and there's no mess about we ascended the gangway and entered the dark ship which was singularly silent he had already the sailor's affection for his floating home and pointed me out one or two points for admiration which i understood but ill as they were technical as we were peeping into the saloon a man passed us and stopped sharply that you ellison he asked in a harsh voice who's that only a gentleman having a look round he's to be doctor said the quartermaster the man made no reply but stared at me and then went on swiftly rather abrupt i commented smiling oh that's nothing it is only his way said the good natured fellow he's the boatswain is mr morland an american i asked i don't know sir i've hardly seen him we signed on at glasgow with a little slip of a fellow representing mr morland glasses and side whiskers that would be mr pye i said very likely would you like to take a squint at the engines mr mccrae is on board he led me without waiting for answer towards the engine room and called out mr mccrae which brought presently a little red faced bearded man from the depths this gentleman wants to know what you can do said my friend by way of introduction the engineer nodded towards me we can make eighteen he said wiping his hands on a greasy piece of rag eighteen at a pinch but i keep her going steady at fourteen a good boat said i aye tolerable he said and pulled out a sheet of paper which he began to peruse under the slender light this now's another slap in the eye for the emperor said mccrae this business of the prince what is it i asked i haven't seen the papers to night he rapped his knuckles on the newspaper this prince frederic of hochburg kicking over the traces i tell ye i'm real sorry for the old man i pity him emperor though he be he's had his sup of troubles but i don't understand what this new one is i said mccrae was not above explaining well y'see this prince frederic is the heir to the duchy of hochburg and he has taken up with some singer and swears he'll resign his inheritance and marry her that's where the mischief is not that the man's not right proceeded the scotchman warming evidently to his opinions for why should princes be exempt from the disposition of providence let him come forward like a man and ye'll see he'll gain the univairsal sympathy of europe for his honesty it certainly increases the emperor's difficulties i said for with a vacancy at hochburg and the pan german movement in full swing aye ye're a student of political affairs broke in the engineer in his broad glasgow accent and i'll not say there isn't something to be said at the present juncture of european politics but man the principle's all wrong why is a man no better than you or me to ride over us whether it be riches or kings or emperors it's the accident of birth and the accident of riches that dictates to us and i'm thinking it ought to be set right by legislation well we are getting along to the millennium famously said i jestingly the millennium he said with a contemptuous snort i think ellison was pleased to see us getting on so pleasantly in argument as he was responsible for the introduction and he now ventured on a statement in the hopes no doubt of cementing the acquaintanceship this gentleman's coming along with us mr mccrae he said the engineer looked at me i have put in for doctor but it's by no means certain i explained oh well we'll hope it is he said affably and to the quartermaster ellison this gentleman'll maybe take a finger of whisky to his own health and ours he added with a relaxation of his grim face at his jest ye'll find a bottle in my cabin so when the quartermaster had returned once more i had to drink to the success of my application it appeared that the sea queen was peopled with amiable spirits if i excepted the boatswain and as i went over the side i congratulated myself on having already made the acquaintance of two more of my shipmates on a friendly footing if i were destined to the appointment on my way home it struck me that i had already heard of the affair of prince frederic the remark of the man at the next table in the three tuns must have referred to the scandal and as i reflected on that i could see in my mind's eye the little clerk's head go round in a stare at our neighbours chapter iii mademoiselle trebizond pye had interpreted his employer's face correctly and lane had not boasted unduly on wednesday evening i received a letter appointing me to the position of doctor and at the same time informing me of my remuneration this was well enough as it chanced though not on too liberal a scale it was yet sufficient to meet my wants and mentally i cast myself adrift from wapping with a psalm of thankfulness the sea queen was to sail on friday and so i had little time left yet by a lucky chance i was enabled to dispose of my practice on the nail to use a convenient colloquialism and with that adventitious sum of money equipped and fortified myself for my voyage i paid two preliminary visits to the yacht but found no one of importance on board and it was not until the actual afternoon of our departure that i made the acquaintance of any more of my shipmates we warped out of the docks and dropped down the river unexpectedly the captain on his bridge at intervals and the pilot all the time and at ten o'clock we reached gravesend where we anchored in the stream it was blowing hard of a cold night and the wind was peppered with sleet a depressing proem to our unknown voyage we swung at anchor there until mr morland came aboard with his friends and we left on the turn of the tide about midnight i did not see mr morland arrive as i was busy in the forecastle with a man who had met with a trivial accident it was lane who informed me that the butterflies were come and we might spread our wings lane i had encountered for a few minutes in the afternoon when he smilingly saluted me well what price me and hurried off ere i could answer him or thank him as this form of salutation seemed to require but he had more leisure at supper to which he invited me in his cabin we chaps have the benefit of a pleasure yacht doctor said he winking and you bet i'm not purser for nothing blame me if i sup with that crew until they shake down a bit barraclough's all right and a gentleman but i can't stand legrand or holgate i've met mr holgate and thought him intelligent i ventured lane emitted scorn intelligent he's a bladder of peas and thinks himself a monarch precious little swank about him if he can help it he's fly enough there well a tot won't hurt us now i can tell you i've been hustled he had recourse to a decanter of whisky this is the real stuff i took care of that legrand can do on two bob vitriol for all i care he don't know the difference well the boss's aboard and his crowd and we're off and here's fortune doctor the toast was irreproachable and i put down my glass and reverted to his phrase his crowd yes his sister and the other lady rippers both i saw them when they came aboard at hamburg and now can you tell me where we're going i asked i don't know said lane carelessly i hope we're running out of this beastly weather that's all i merely engaged for twelve months i put in same here and that's good enough said lane i'll ask the old man to morrow if his prickles don't stand up too thick here she goes doctor when i left the purser i turned in for the night was shrewd and discomfortable enough to bar romantic thoughts on leaving the english coast besides we were bound down channel and should keep company with our native cliffs the whole of the next day it would be time to wave a farewell when we passed the lizard the quarters in the sea queen were roomy i was berthed aft with the other officers and mr morland's rooms and the cabins of the two ladies were on the upper deck ample in appearance from the outside and no doubt furnished luxuriously the guests had the run of a fine saloon also on the lower deck as well as a music gallery which ran round it and there was a boudoir as i heard attached to the ladies' compartments as well as a private room to mr morland's breakfast was mainly interesting as introducing me practically for the first time to my companions we were then abreast of the isle of wight and were keeping well away towards france the chief officer i now to my astonishment discovered to be a man of title sir john barraclough was a tall loose limbed good looking man of thirty something with a blue eye and a casual manner he nodded at me amiably and continued his talk with legrand the second officer who was dark and high coloured with a restless expression of face lane threw a jocular greeting across the table to me and i shook hands cordially with holgate whom i now saw for the first time since i had come aboard presently barraclough turned to me glad to see you doctor he said in an indifferent manner hope it's goin' to be a fine cruise i had just echoed his wish formally when the captain made his appearance from the deck captain day was a most fastidious looking man with a brown vandyke beard and a flow of good manners seeing me and holgate there as the only strangers he singled us out at once with quite the right degree of friendliness glad to make your acquaintance dr phillimore this your first voyage i hope we'll make a happy family but having thus condescended briefly he relapsed into silence and shortly afterwards left us there's too much condemned rnr about the old man confided lane as we went on deck but he's all right it was on deck that i met with my surprise for the first person my eyes fell on was no other than pye the little lawyer's clerk i never expected to see you here i told him well you see i did expect to see you he replied in his self satisfied little way i'm here to represent mr morland for the time being oh said i then you can tell us all where we are bound for for no one seems to know he considered a little i shall be able to tell you shortly i have no doubt he said at last at present mr morland alone knows perhaps even he doesn't he added with his smile i don't like that little buffer declared lane grumpily as we walked on he is too fussy and by your leave please for me made me get out all my books yesterday as if i were an office boy he feels responsible i suppose i ventured well who's responsible if i'm not demanded the purser hotly i've been at sea fifteen years and this brat hasn't so much as been sick in the marguerite i'll lay let him look after his own books i'm all right it was quite manifest that lane was decided in his likes and dislikes as his unreasonable objection to the second officer had already discovered to me the passengers were not visible during the morning but in the afternoon i received a message calling me to mr morland's cabin i found him seated before a bureau with a docket of papers before him and he was civil and abrupt is there anything you can recommend for sea sickness dr phillimore he asked bluntly i told him of several remedies which had been tried and mentioned cocaine as probably the best adding that i had little faith in any of them he thought a moment prepare me some cocaine he said and with a bow intimated that he had done with me it was civil as i have said but it was also abrupt he had the air of a martinet and the expression of a schoolmaster who set his pupil a task but i made up the doses forthwith and let him have them later i saw two figures walking upon the hurricane promenade one of which i easily made out as mr morland and the other was a woman heavily cloaked in fur a strong breeze was beating up channel and as they stood and faced it the woman put her hand to her hat but for the most part they walked to and fro sometimes in conversation but often in silence once at eight bells i noticed from my point of observation the woman stop lean across the railing and point towards the coast of france which was fast fading into the gathering mists she seemed to speak her face turned level with her shoulders towards the man he put out a hand and snapped his fingers and they presently resumed their promenade the sun had gone down and darkness was settling on us the sea queen ploughed steadily westward her lights springing out one by one and the figures on the hurricane deck were presently merged in shadow as i leaned over the stern reflecting and contemplating now the dull wash of the water about the screw i was conscious of some one's approach well doctor said the cheerful voice of pye have you had a good look at our passengers mr pye said i pleasantly enough i am a man of moods and i have lived long in silence and routine as no doubt you yourself also i find occupation even in my own thoughts you are well equipped for the sea he rejoined i'm not sure about myself you see i'm a londoner and i shall miss those peopled spaces here there's nothing but he waved his hand at all events i see you're a respectable sailor i said which apparently others are not his silence seemed to inquire of me i gave mr morland a prescription for sea sickness this afternoon that would be for one of the ladies he made answer he is evidently firm on his legs and and his companion i suppose i may tell you that his companion is his sister he said after a pause well yes i replied drily for his precautions jarred on me for i suppose we shall discover the mystery in the course of the next twelve months mystery he repeated musingly i suppose i am by training somewhat circumspect it's difficult to get out of it but there's no mystery mr and miss morland have brought a friend with them if there's no mystery i said the friend i have not heard her name he replied or at least if i have i have forgotten it is a friend of miss morland's i believe she is a french lady the dusk had enclosed us but through it i perceived some one hurriedly approaching is it the doctor said the steward's voice and i answered in the affirmative you're wanted at once sir mr morland has sent for you i moved off quickly and had got half way down the deck when a woman came forward noiselessly through the gloom dr phillimore she said i want you to see to mlle chateray at once she is very ill i entered the state rooms without further question hurried down the handsome corridor and under miss morland's guidance found the cabin certain constitutions are peculiarly affected by the sea and it is even undertaking a risk for some people to travel on that element clearly it was as pye hinted for the french lady that my prescription had been required outside the cabin in the corridor i encountered mr morland who exhibited a troubled face unusual to one of such apparent equanimity but he said nothing only looked at his sister and turned away inside i found a blue chamber roomy and well lighted by electricity an elegant broad bed affixed to the one wall and upon it stretched in the most wonderful deshabille my patient mlle chateray was of middle height of a pleasant fulness and dark of feature she had large eyes that as i entered were roaming in a restless way about the room and her voice was lifted sharply abusive of her maid a mild frenchwoman who stood by her she is in a state of collapse dr phillimore said my guide's voice in my ear i knew better than that it was hysteria or i had never seen hysteria and the mal de mer had been merely provocative i took her hand without ceremony and wheeling on me her lustrous eyes she broke out in torrential french she would die if she remained there they were beasts to keep her there why was she not put ashore at havre havre was a port as every one knew and there were ports not only in england i had a kind face and would do as she bade me very well then let her be put ashore she began to tear at her elaborate dressing gown and i was afraid of one of those outbreaks which are known as crises des nerfs i took her hands firmly you shall be put ashore as you wish i said and in the meantime while the yacht is going about you will drink what i give you it will comfort you she gazed into my eyes ceasing to struggle and then said more quietly yes yes give it me quick it was a case for bromide and i turned away at once to go to my surgery you will lie exactly as you are mademoiselle i said peremptorily until i return i left the cabin and descended and i think i was not gone more than ten minutes when mlle chateray had taken the draught i turned to her maid she will be quieter now i said let me know if anything further develops and i moved towards the door miss morland stood in my way for the first time i observed her her cloak had fallen from her leaving her fine figure in the full illumination of the light her head was set well back above the eloquent lines of a strong throat and the square shoulders underneath the lace over her bosom stirred with her breathing and to my fancy at the moment she was as a statue into which life was flowing suddenly i saw this before i met her gaze and the calm beauty of that confirmed my fancy she moved then and opened the door for me you have promised she shall be landed she said in a low voice madam i would promise anything in such a case i answered a faint smile passed over her face for we were now outside the cabin and in the ladies' boudoir you can promise relief then i understand she queried she will probably be all right to night though i cannot say the hysteria will not recur i replied an expression flitted over her face but whether it was of pity or annoyance i could not have said my brother will not put the yacht about she said i'm not going to ask him i rejoined i thank you doctor said she simply and so will he it is my business i responded indifferently she had spoken with distance even coldly and with the air of condescension there was no necessity to thank me at all and certainly not in that way bidding her good evening i went down again and as i went a problem which had vaguely bothered me during my administrations recurred now more insistently there was something familiar in mlle chateray's face what was it i spent some time in the surgery and later joined the officers at dinner captain day wore a short dinner jacket like my own but the others had made no attempt to dress perhaps that was the reason why the captain devoted his attention to me his voice was that of a cultivated man and he seemed to converse on the same level of cultivation he made a figure apart from the rest of the company to which little pye was now joined and as i looked down and across the table from which only holgate was absent on duty their marvellous unlikeness to him struck me even sir john barraclough and lane seemed by comparison more or less of a piece though the first officer ignored the purser quite markedly captain day i discovered had some taste in letters and as that also had been my consolation in my exile in wapping i think we drew nearer on a common hobby i visited my patient about nine o'clock and found her sleeping as she lay asleep i was again haunted by the likeness to some one i had seen before but i was unable to trace it to its source nor did i trouble my head in the matter since resemblances are so frequently accidental and baffling pye had invited me to his room earlier in the day and i went straight to him from the deck cabin to find holgate there was not unpleasing as it seemed in a way to recall what i almost began to consider old times the time that was in the three tuns pye mixed the toddy and we smoked more or less at our ease i spoke of my patient in answer to a question as one suffering from sea sickness what's she like inquired holgate i should say handsome i rejoined i understood from mr pye that she is french i think i heard so said pye but you could tell well she spoke french i said with a smile pye's smile seemed to commend my reticence but holgate ignoring the obvious retort on me pursued a different subject upon my soul i envy people like those millionaires here am i working like a navvy for a bare living never been able to marry pye probably in the same case and you doctor no i'm a bachelor i answered well take us three no doubt in our different walks every bit as capable as mr morland on his wall street or wherever it is it isn't a righteous distribution of this world's goods it is odd said i speaking my thoughts how you came to take up this life the sort of blunder said holgate that is made in three cases out of four i hankered after it in my teens and once out of them it was too late who is going to adapt a youth of twenty one without capital to a commercial life or a legal life or a medical life there is no changing the dice when the hands are dealt you must abide by them yes we are all waifs said i sententiously not being greatly interested in the argument when i came back from my last voyage pursued holgate i was in paris for a bit and went into the comedie one night and i never heard the rest of holgate's reminiscence for the word regarding the theatre suddenly sent a message to my memory and lighted it up instantaneously i said aloud and with some excitement trebizond holgate ceased talking and pye removed his cigarette hastily what may we venture to ask is trebizond he said presently i smiled foolishly oh it is only that i have made a discovery i said a small discovery again there was silence perhaps we are worthy to hear it suggested holgate equably pye still held his cigarette between his fingers and looked at me out of his gold rimmed glasses oh nothing much said i and glanced at my watch i'm sorry i must see my patient safe for the night i'll look in again i left them and went upstairs knocking on the boudoir door miss morland opened it mlle chateray is still sleeping she said formally i will leave a dose with her maid i replied so that if it be necessary it may be given in the night you will of course be in attendance if required she said coldly i bowed i am paid for it madam i answered though i must confess to a hostile feeling within my heart i think then that is all she said and i took my dismissal at the hands of the arrogant beauty with an internal conflict of anger and admiration i did not return to pye but went to my own cabin in an irritable condition it ought not to have mattered to me that the sister of a millionaire my employer should treat me more or less as a lackey but it did i threw myself on my bunk and took down a book at random from my little shelf out of its pages tumbled an evening news sheet which i now remembered to have bought of a screaming boy as i hurried into the dock gates on the previous afternoon i had not had time to look at it in my various preoccupations but after all it was the last news of my native land i should have for some time and so i opened it and began the perusal it was one of those half penny journals which seem to combine the maximum of vulgarity with a minimum of news but i passed over the blatant racing items and murder trials with less than my customary distaste and was rambling leisurely through the columns when i was arrested by a paragraph and sat up briskly it was the tail that interested me it is stated that prince frederic is in london the name of the lady who has so infatuated him is mlle yvonne trebizond the well known prima donna i had recalled the name trebizond during holgate's talk and it seemed strange now that this second discovery should fall so coincidently the face of mlle chateray had taken me back by a sudden gust of memory to certain pleasant days in paris before i was banished to the east end i had frequented the theatres and the concert rooms and i remembered the vivacious singer a true comedienne with her pack of tricks and her remarkable individuality mlle chateray then was no other than yvonne trebizond and i looked down at the paper and read another sentence which ere that illumination had had no significance but now was pregnant with it the prince has the full support and sympathy of his sister princess alix i rose abruptly i can keep my own counsel as well as a lawyer's clerk but i saw no reason in the world for it now i had left my glass untouched and my cigar unlit in pye's cabin i went back forthwith to finish both the pair were still seated as if expecting me patient all right doctor inquired holgate i nodded mr pye i said i find my discovery has amplified itself when i was here it was of small dimensions now it has grown to the proportions of a well a balloon i ended both men gazed at me steadily out with it man urged the third officer i have your permission i asked the lawyer's clerk smiling when you have told me what it is i will tell you said he gravely jocose i put the paper in holgate's hands and pointed to the paragraph he read it slowly aloud and then looked up well he asked i am going to tell you something which you know i said addressing pye the lady in the deck cabin is mlle trebizond holgate started good heavens he exclaimed but pye was quite silent only keeping his eyes on me i recognized her but couldn't name her i went on now it has come back to me which means of course said pye unemotionally that mr morland is the prince said holgate with a heavy breath pye resumed his cigarette with all these sensations my dear holgate he remarked i have forgotten my duty perhaps you will help yourself holgate did so good heavens he said again and then i suppose if you're right that we carry caesar and his fortunes he has got off with the lady and the plunder the plunder i echoed he indicated the paragraph and i read now another sentence which i had overlooked the prince has expressed his intention according to rumour of marrying as he chooses and as he inherits more than a million pounds from his mother he is in a position to snap his fingers at the empress in that case no doubt he would follow precedent and take rank as an ordinary subject i looked up at holgate we carry caesar and his fortune he said with a smiling emphasis on the singular and then he waved his arm melodramatically and to think we are all paupers and grinned at me it is inequitable said i lightly it's an unjust distribution of this world's goods echoing therein his own remark earlier in the evening pye sat still with an inexpressive face his admirable silence however now ceased so we shall have this gossip all over the ship to morrow no said i curtly for the suggestion annoyed me it is nothing to me i told you because you knew and i told mr holgate i paused because i'm your chum said the third officer i did not contradict him i had spoken really out of the excitement of my discovery certainly i had not spoken because holgate was my chum chapter iv an amazing proposition as i had said it was no business of mine and having divulged my news i was in no haste to go about with it like a common gossip that prince frederic of hochburg was mr morland and that miss morland was princess alix i was as assured as that i had identified in my patient the well known parisian singer yvonne trebizond but having made the discovery i promised myself some interest in watching the course of the rumour it would spread about the ship like fire and would be whispered over taffrails in galleys and in stokehole but to my surprise i could observe no signs of this flight of gossip no one certainly offered me any communication on the subject and i observed no curiosity and no surprise the mess conducted itself with equanimity and nothing was hinted of princes or of emperors or of mysterious secrets no facts ever hid themselves so cunningly as these obviously somewhat startling facts and i wondered at the silence but still held my tongue mademoiselle continued to give me trouble during the next day but that was more in the way of unreasonable demands and petulance than through hysteric exhibitions she did not repeat her request to be landed which was now quite impracticable as we were well out in the atlantic but she referred to it where are we doctor she inquired languidly and i told her at which she considered well perhaps it is worth it she said and smiled at me confidingly of mr morland i saw little for he was shut in his cabin a great part of the day reading or writing and smoking without cessation and he walked regularly on the hurricane deck with his sister once i encountered him in mademoiselle's room and he nodded she is getting well doctor is it not so he asked in a pleasant way and exhibited a tenderness in his words and manner to mademoiselle which i should not have associated with him of his sister i saw even less except in the distance but her too i met in her friend's room mademoiselle was talkative that day the second of my attendance on her and spoke of things with a terrifying frankness sometimes in bad english but oftener in her own tongue she rehearsed her sensations during sea sickness criticised miss morland and asked me about barraclough whom she had seen passing by her window once or twice sir john she said speaking pretty broken english then he is noble oh comme il est gentil comme il est beau and as quickly fell to cross questioning me on my parentage and history it was in the thick of this that miss morland made her entrance i do not know if it be a confession of weak mindedness or even of snobbishness i hope not but the fact was that since i had discovered miss morland's identity i did not judge her coldness and aloofness so hardly i am disposed to think it was merely a reasonable attitude on my part produced by the knowledge of her circumstances and what i set down as her trials she bowed to me and addressed some words to mademoiselle which sympathetic in their import were yet somewhat frigid in tone mademoiselle replied laughing you are very good my dear but i am progressing we are sailing into the land of romance and will find what we shall find there i lingered beyond what was necessary and thus it happened that miss morland and i left the cabin together outside she spoke is there any likelihood of a recurrence of the attack i don't think so i answered but mlle trebizond is a nervous subject it was the look in her eyes that made me suddenly realise my indiscretion a light flashed in them almost as if she would have struck me mlle chateray is almost well enough to dispense with a doctor's services she said with an accent on the name you must allow me to be the judge of that i replied flushing she was silent naturally she said at last and turned away the newspaper had stated that princess alix was sympathetic to her brother's attachment but was she altogether so i could not but attribute her coolness and her reticence to some scruple she walked daily with her brother and it was evident that she was fond of him or why was she here but how much of personal prejudice and of private conviction had she sacrificed on that pious altar i was sure that if the news of our passengers were bruited about at all i should hear of it from lane who was a gossip at heart and as he said nothing i knew that holgate had been silent why i could not conceive unless pye had gagged him but in any case it appeared that holgate also could keep his own counsel and hold his tongue that he could speak i had yet to realise as the astonishing narrative i am now approaching demonstrates it was the evening of our fifth day out and the long swell of the atlantic was washing on our port side so that the sea queen heeled over and dipped her snout as she ran i had misgivings for my late patient whom i had not seen for the last thirty six hours although she had made an appearance on the hurricane deck in a chair holgate asked me to his cabin with his customary urbanity saying that he wanted a few words with me once the door was shut he settled down on his bunk and lit a cigar help yourself doctor he said i declined and remained standing for i was anxious to get away he looked at me steadily out of his dark eyes do you know where we're going doctor he asked no said i but i should be glad to i've just discovered he replied buenos ayres i told him that i was glad to hear it as we should run into better weather i couldn't just make up my mind he went on till to day but it's pretty plain now though the old man has not said so any fool can see it with the way we're shaping he puffed for a moment or two and then resumed i've been thinking over things a bit and if your theory is correct mr morland is to marry the lady at buenos ayres and probably make his home there or it may be in some other part of america a capital place for losing identity is the states i said that it was quite probable but as the yacht's chartered for a year pursued holgate evenly the odds are that there's to be cruising off and on may be up the west coast of america may be the south seas or may be japan there's a goodly cruise before us doctor well it will be tolerable for us i answered just so he replied only tolerable not eighteen carat which seems a pity shall we strike for higher wages i asked drily i've been thinking over what you said doctor said the third officer taking no heed of this and it's gone home pretty deep prince frederic has cut himself adrift from his past there's no getting behind that the emperor has thrown him up and there's no one outside a penny a liner cares two pinches for him or what becomes of him he's done with the chancelleries of europe won't waste their time on him he's negligible well said i for i was not in the mood for a political discussion well suppose he never turned up said holgate and leaned back and stared at me i don't understand said i i don't suppose he will turn up as you say he's done for i mean that the ship might founder said holgate still holding me with his eye i was perplexed and seeing it he laughed let us make no bones about it he said laying down his cigar here's a discarded prince whom no one wants sailing for no one knows where with his fortune on board and no one responsible for him do you take me now i'm hanged if i do i replied testily for indeed i had no thought of what the man was driving at but here it came out with a burst doctor all this is in our hands we can do what we will we're masters of the situation i opened my mouth and stared at him the broad swarthy face loomed like a menace in the uncertain light before us it was dark it was inscrutable a heavy resolution was marked in that thick neck low brow and salient chin we eyed each other in silence but this is monstrous i said with a little laugh you have not brought me here for a silly jest it's god's truth i haven't doctor he replied earnestly i mean what i say see the prince carries away a million and if the prince disappears the million belongs to those who can find it now we don't want any truck with dismounted princes we're playing for our own hand i know you take sensible views on these matters i admit it makes one blink a bit at first but stick on to the idea turn it round and you'll get used to it it spells a good deal to poor devils like you and me you must be mad i said angrily or he interrupted me that's not my line i'm in dead sober earnest you hold on to the notion and you'll come round to it it's a bit steep at first to the eye but you hang on to it like a sensible man good heavens man said i are you plotting murder i never mentioned that he said in another voice there are several ways it don't do to take more risks than you want a ship can be cast away and parties can be separated and one party can make sure of the boodle see i only see that you're an infernal ruffian i replied hotly his countenance did not change hang on to it he said and i could have laughed in his face at the preposterous suggestion you'll warm to it by degrees you are asking me to join in wholesale robbery at the least i said still angrily struggling with my stupor i am he answered and he leaned forward d'you think i'm entering on this game wildly not i i mean to carry it out do you suppose i haven't laid my plans why more than half the men are mine i saw to that it was i got 'em he placed a large hand on my shoulder and his eyes gleamed diabolically in his set face they'll do my bidding i command here sir and damn your captain day i'll take 'em to hell if i want to i shook off his hand roughly i may tell you i said in as cool a tone as i could assume that i am going straight on deck to the captain to retail this conversation you have therefore probably about ten minutes left you for reflection which i hope will bring you consolation holgate got up and without undue haste threw open the large port through which streamed the clamour of the water i guess i've misunderstood you said he quietly and it isn't often i make a mistake he lifted his lip in a grin and i could see a horrid tier of teeth which seemed to have grown together like concrete in one huge fang it is in my power dr phillimore to blow your brains out here and now the noise of the sea would cover the report and he fingered a pistol that now i perceived in his hand outside yonder is a grave that tells no tales the dead rise up never from the sea by thunder and the port's open i'm half in the mind he threw the weapon carelessly upon the bunk and laughed look you that's how i value you you are mighty conscientious doctor but you have no value you're just the ordinary respectable out of elbows crock that peoples that island over yonder you are good neither for good nor ill a crew of you wouldn't put a knot on a boat so that's how i value you if you won't do my work one way you shall another i'll have my value out of you some way if only to pay back my self respect you're safe from pistol and shark go and do what you will i'll wait for you and lay for you chummie i stood listening to this remarkable tirade which was offered in a voice by no means angry but even something contemptuous and without a word i left him i went as i had promised at once to the captain whom i found in his cabin with a volume of de quincey well doctor said he laying down the book anything amiss your face is portentous yes sir i answered he motioned me to a chair and waited i suppose you're aware sir that you have on board prince frederic of hochburg and his sister i began indeed i'm nothing of the sort said he sharply what on earth is this nonsense if i had not had such important information to lay before him i might have been abashed as it was i proceeded well sir it's a fact mr morland is the prince i have known it some days and would have held my tongue but for imperative necessity mr pye knows it and mr holgate this is most astounding he began and paced nervously about the cabin i say mr holgate because i come about him i pursued he has just made the most shameless and barefaced proposal which amounts to a plot to wreck the ship and make off with the prince's property which is supposed to amount to a great deal captain day sat down heavily upon my soul dr phillimore he said i shall begin to ask myself whether it is you or i who is mad that is exactly the sort of question i asked myself a few minutes ago i replied and i've been able to answer it only on the supposition that your third officer is an amazing scoundrel there was the pause of some moments during which he studied my face and at last he went to the bell very well he said more calmly we can settle it one way i suppose and when the steward appeared ask mr holgate to come to me at once he sat down again fidgeted with his book opened it endeavoured to read and glanced at me in a perplexed fashion as if he distrusted his eyesight and so we remained without a word until a knock announced some one at the door and the next moment holgate large placid and respectful was in the cabin mr holgate said captain day in his most particular voice i have just heard the most remarkable statement by dr phillimore perhaps you will be good enough to repeat it dr phillimore and he glanced askew at me i did so bluntly this man i said has proposed to me within the last ten minutes that i should join a plot to cast away the ship and seize the property of of mr morland day looked at his third officer you hear mr holgate he said what have you to say a broad smile passed over holgate's fat face yes sir he said coolly it is just as dr phillimore says but the whole thing was a mere spoof i should be glad if you would explain said day icily well the doctor's not exactly correct said holgate still smiling and he had the vast impudence to smile at me for what i proposed was to seize the property of prince frederic of hochburg i think it is ah said day letting the exclamation escape softly through his lips and he cast his nervous glance at me you see sir the doctor has got some cock and bull tale into his head went on holgate easily about mr morland being prince frederic and the ladies i don't know whom and so i suggested that that being so we should take care of the prince's millions for him and get a tidy sum all round i daresay it wasn't a very funny joke indeed i thought he would have seen through it all along but i suppose he didn't the doctor's rather serious i started up captain day said i this man lies the proposal was serious enough and he knows it mr morland is prince frederic i should advise you to ask mr pye so be it said day with a gesture of helplessness and thus pye was summoned to the strange conclave day took up his book again pray sit down mr holgate he said politely this is not the criminal dock yet which seemed to augur badly for my case the little clerk on entering fixed his glasses on his nose more firmly with two fingers and cast an inquisitive look at us mr pye said the captain in his impeccable distant voice i am informed that mr morland is not mr morland but some one else and i have been referred to you is this so pye glanced at me mr morland is the name of the gentleman for whom my firm is acting he said suavely and not any one else said day not according to my knowledge said the clerk not according to his instructions sir i burst out indignantly he knows the facts i'm certain and if not i can prove my point readily enough the point is said day drily whether mr holgate is guilty of the extraordinary charge you have preferred well sir it is material that i acquainted him with the identity of mr morland in mr pye's presence i replied hotly feeling my ground moving from under me day looked at pye that is true sir said the clerk dr phillimore stated in my presence that he had discovered that mr morland was i think he said prince frederic of hochburg day was silent i think this is pretty much a mare's nest said he presently and i really don't know why i should have been bothered with it i was furious with pye and his idea as i conceived it of legal discretion very well sir said i somewhat sullenly and turned to go when the door of the cabin opened and there entered sir john barraclough with his customary insouciance it seems sir john said day in his ironic tones that not only have i the honour of a distinguished baronet as first officer but also a prince as cargo there was as i had gathered little love between the captain and his first officer barraclough laughed oh you've just tumbled to it he said i wonder how but it was bound to leak out some time i never saw a man more astonished than day he leapt to his feet good god he said i seem to be the only one who doesn't know what's going on in my ship is this part of the jest barraclough in his turn showed surprise but it was holgate spoke is it true sir john it can't be true he cried opening his mouth so that the horrid tooth demonstrated itself barraclough looked at pye who was mum i suppose this gentleman is responsible for the news he said no sir i have said nothing retorted pye i can't pretend to judge other professions than my own said the captain stormily but i'm inclined to think i might have been taken into the confidence think where it places me heavens man what am i in my ship i think the mr morland perhaps had better answer that question suggested barraclough with a little sneer day moved some papers with a hand that trembled that will do then he said shortly good evening gentlemen i've no desire to detain you any longer but said i silence dr phillimore i command this ship he cried angrily or at least i'm supposed to you can settle your differences with mr holgate elsewhere i shrugged my shoulders and left the cabin a very angry man in his vanity the fool had refused to consider my charge and yet when i looked at this business more deliberately and from a little distance i could not deny that day had some excuse holgate's story was remarkably natural the captain would judge of the third officer's incredulity by his own and would be therefore willing to accept the story of the spoof but then he had not seen holgate's face and he had not heard holgate even i was staggered by the turn things had taken though infuriated by my treatment and it did me no good to see holgate's face smiling at me as i went down the gangway oh doctor doctor are you a scotchman he whispered at which i would have turned on him savagely but held myself in and passed on and was silent i have always found the value of caution chapter v the wounded man well the whole affair had been a considerable farce in which i had played the most humiliating part indeed but for the interposition of barraclough i must have come out of it the butt of all shafts as it was i was sensitive in regard to my position and more than once was tempted to see myself as i must have appeared to others but after all they had not gone through the scene with holgate and were not witnesses to his astounding perfidy i was angry with every one with myself with the captain and above all with little pye in the universal surprise that came of the discovery of mr morland's identity my shame so to speak was covered but i felt myself the mark of ridicule from holgate's cynical smile to the captain's open neglect of me i turned on the lawyer's clerk in my fury and gave him some home truths about solicitors and their ways to which however he listened unabashed doctor said he do you suppose a man in my position is his own master you are welcome to know what you will about my own affairs but i have my professional secrets to guard what would be thought of me had i come aboard blabbing of my firm's clients fore and aft it would have been a betrayal of confidence there was of course something in this but the argument did not allay my irritation it merely directed it elsewhere so that i began upon the third mate he heard me quietly mr holgate can answer for himself he replied but it seems to me if i may say so without offence doctor that you are misinterpreting a somewhat elaborate joke mr holgate's explanation is reasonable enough and besides the only other explanation is monstrous inconceivable i agree with you i said shortly and so i say no more he cast a shrewd glance at me but made no comment now it was quite conceivable that holgate should have made me a derisive object in the ship but on the contrary he did nothing of the sort the charge i had made against him did not leak out at the mess table day holgate and pye were aware of it and so far as i know it went no further this somewhat astonished me until i had some light thrown upon it later but in the meantime i wondered and insensibly that significant silence began to modify my attitude had he known me in the fulness of my disposition he would probably have spoken but as it was he had other plans to follow one of these seemed to include a reconciliation with myself his quizzical smile disappeared and he shook his head at me solemnly at table doctor said he that scotchman's head i am not a scotchman i retorted impatiently well he breathed heavily i will admit it was a very bad joke i was on the point of replying that it was not a joke at all when i recovered my temper after all it is trying to the temper to sit opposite to a man whom you know to be a prime ruffian however impotent his aspirations may be since i had unveiled his plot even though no credence was given it still holgate was harmless but as i have already said i am a man of precautions and i held my tongue i think he had taken me only for a man of impulse i must confess i do not see the joke i answered now you come to insist on it and shed the cold light of reason on it no more do i he said with a laugh jokes are very well behind the footlights i shrugged my shoulders think what a fool i look i said coldly his friendliness increased my dear fellow he said bending over to me i give you my word i've held my tongue i thought of that i didn't know you'd take it so seriously your profession should have been the stage i answered he nodded low comedian i wish i had they make good salaries i believe instead of beggarly oh you have the prince's boodle i said lightly he laughed so i have and i'll be hanged if i apologise i said i have suffered enough from the mistake quite right doctor said he gravely i would not apologise to a bishop let alone a third officer with that apparent advance to an understanding we parted and i did not set eyes on him again until the abrupt events that brought about the conference in the cabin if my personal appearance on the matter did not get out at least the tale of the prince's identity passed swiftly from mouth to mouth the whole ship's company was agog with interest an interest which increased during the next two days sir john barraclough expressed to me his opinion of day's behaviour very roundly for the captain had icily withdrawn into himself and spoke as little as possible to his first officer the man's a fool to take it this way phillimore he said does he suppose it was my doing i happened to know but of course it was not my secret this too was pye's excuse for silence and it was obviously adequate but as the baronet's evidence of friendliness was thus betrayed in his confidence to me i ventured on a question which was not really inquisitive oh well you see i've known the prince off and on some time he and i yachted together before i lost my money and he gave me this chance he's a good sort with which bluff and british indifference he terminated the conversation i think that the mysterious aloofness of our passengers served to keep the interest warm had mr morland and his party descended and been on show so to say before the company it is probable that the bloom of surprise would have worn off with the contact but they kept to themselves and the hurricane deck every morning and afternoon the prince and his sister took a prolonged walk together and at times they were joined by my patient who however in the better weather we were enjoying reclined in her chair and took the sun on these occasions mr morland and his sister ceased their promenade and sat with their guest sometimes the full voice of mlle chateray or trebizond would come to us below and occasionally her light laughter was heard very musical to the ears speculations it is not necessary to say were rife among us it was known we were set for buenos ayres and it was taken for granted that there the prince was to effect his morganatic marriage but what was to happen afterwards we were chartered for twelve months that bespoke a cruise and guesses flew about the ship lane the purser was the most in evidence in these discussions he was an excitable man with a passion for talk and company and he offered to lay me a certain sum that we should pull up in yokohama as like as not paid off there we've no contracts against it he said in a fume it was the attitude of mccrae the chief engineer that interested me in view of his professed opinions he unfolded his mind to me one evening when we had been out some ten days it's like this doctor the man's sheer sick of courts and barbarisms and he's in search of a healthy independent life which he needs i'm thinking that's to his credit altogether but it's a wonderful thing when you come to think of it that one man like that should upset the politics of europe and a man that does not achieve it mind you but gets it by mere birth and chance the paper said he had a million of his own a fool could be independent on that aye and live healthy too if he weren't too much of a fool but what right has a man with wealth like that i ask you as mr holgate was saying yesterday it's an insult to decent hardworking men like you and me so that's mr holgate's idea is it said i and mused the engineer was proceeding in the strain when i saw the face of the boatswain jump suddenly into the dimness of the engine room it was a thin lipped gaunt face lacking eyebrows which added to the gauntness and the general complexion was red to the shade of crimson when his jaw was in repose it appeared as if the lower part of his face had been sucked up into the upper like a lid into its box but now his jaw was open disclosing a plentiful lack of teeth you're wanted doctor he said in his abrupt voice there's been an accident forward i left at once and followed him asking some necessary questions i don't know exactly how it occurred he said in answer one of the men adams fell on something and it's drilled a hole in him when we reached the man's berth he was surrounded by a number of the crew whom i ordered off if i've got anything to do i don't want to be hampered i said so clear out and leave adams to me and the boatswain when the place was clear i made an examination and found a wound under the shoulder blade it was not dangerous but might well have been so i sent for my bag and dressed it the boatswain looking on all the time i made no comment but when i had finished i turned and met the boatswain's eyes that's a knife wound i said shortly is it sir he replied and stared down at adams how did it come about adams he inquired authoritatively i was larking along with gray and ran up agen him said the man in a sullen voice i didn't see what he 'ad in his 'and more fool you said the boatswain angrily d'ye think i can go short of men for a lot of horse play all right doctor nothing serious no said i deliberating if the knife was clean there's not much harm done except that you go short of a man as you say for some days the boatswain swore as politely as an oath can be managed i'll come in again later i said meanwhile keep him in bed but on my next visit it was manifest that the wound was not such a simple affair for the man's temperature had risen and he was wandering he gave tongue to a profusion of oaths which seemed to be directed in the main against gray but also included the boatswain raised himself on his arm and shook his fist in my face muttering my share and not a brown less and something about blowing the gaff it was with difficulty that i completed my ministrations but i did so and gave the boatswain a dose to be given to the wounded man at once and another four hours later it was entirely an involuntary omission on my part that i said nothing of returning nevertheless i did return only two hours later and just before midnight i had had the man removed to a disused cabin and when i got there the door was locked angrily i went on deck and found the boatswain pierce i said the door of the sick room is locked what on earth does this mean i want to see my patient oh he's all right sir he went to sleep quite easy i asked one of the hands to keep an eye on him and i suppose he's shut the door but it isn't locked but it is i said angrily the blockhead said the boatswain i'll get the key for you sir if you'll wait a minute but i was not going to wait i was making for the hatchway when i was hailed through the darkness by a voice dr phillimore i turned and little pye emerged from the blackness i've been trying to get to sleep but i've got the most awful neuralgia i wish you'd give me something for it said he in a moment i said i've got to see one of the hands and then oh come doctor give us a chance said pye if you tell me what i'll get it myself look here would a dose of chloral do any good my dear sir said i drily every man in these days seems to be his own doctor try it and if it's only satisfactory enough we'll have a beautiful post mortem to morrow well said little pye with a return of his native repartee it's precisely because i don't want to be my own doctor that i've come to you that naturally was unanswerable and i acknowledged the hit by prescribing for him then i went on my way the door was open and the boatswain was waiting he covered a yawn as i approached it was that fool reilly sir he explained he mucked my instructions i nodded and proceeded to examine my patient the boatswain seemed to have spoken the truth for the man was as quiet as a log save for the movement of the clothes when he respired but it was that very respiration that arrested my attention i felt his pulse and i took the temperature as i moved to examine the glass pierce's thin crimson face peeping over my shoulder almost struck upon me the jaw was sucked into its socket the temperature was still high too high to allow of that placid sleep i contemplated the thermometer meditatively the port was shut and the only sounds that broke the night were the dull beating of the screw and the duller wash of the waves against the side of the sea queen the boatswain stood motionless behind me you are right i said slowly he has gone off pretty comfortably but i should like to see his temperature lower however the sleep will do him good and i've no doubt i'll find him all right in the morning as i spoke i turned away with a nod and passed out of the cabin once on deck i paused to consider what i should do two things i knew for certain firstly that the knife wound was no accident for no mere horse play could have resulted in such a deep cut secondly that adams was under the influence of a narcotic who had administered it and why i recalled the man's delirium and his wandering statements to which at the time i had paid little heed and i thought i began to get the clue i looked at my watch and found it half past twelve every one save those on duty was abed and the steamer ploughed steadily through the trough a column of smoke swept abaft by the wind and black against the starlight i sought my cabin poured myself out a stiff glass of grog and sat down to smoke and think at two bells i roused myself and went on deck how singularly still was the progress of the vessel i heard the feet of the officer on the bridge and no other sound in all that floating house a figure like a statue stood out in the dimness by the chart house and i came to a pause it turned and i thought i made out my friend the quartermaster that you ellison i asked yes sir i want to look at that man adams in the forecastle i said please accompany me as i may need your assistance i descended the ladder and went forward till i reached the cabin which i had used as a hospital and turned the handle of the door it opened but the darkness was profound and ellison struck a match and lit the lamp adams lay in his bunk groaning faintly i turned up his sleeve and examined him the wound was inflamed as i had expected and it was not that which arrested me but a mark on the arm above the elbow it was the prick of the hypodermic syringe my doubts were now certainties as we stood there adams opened his eyes and struggled into a sitting posture no my man said i you must keep to your back he stared at me but allowed me to force him backwards and continued to stare adams can you understand said i firmly gray struck you with a knife between the shoulders damn him he growled sulkily doctor my head's bad give me something to drink i had come prepared and i did so and he fell back with a sigh showing more signs of alertness you quarrelled i suggested but he made no answer look you here my man i went on sternly i know a good deal about this and what you quarrelled over it would be wiser believe me to be candid pierce had a hand in this still he was silent i pulled from my pocket a syringe and showed it to him do you know what that is i asked he shook his head staring well said i it came pretty near finishing you off you have had a heavy dose i want to know who did it i caught up his arm and thrust the puncture under his nose he still stared you were talking pretty wildly in your delirium and had to be silenced that was how it was done if they can't silence you one way they will another how much was your share to be the man's face worked in an ugly fashion and he was at any time a repulsive creature the glitter in his eyes spoke of fever the devil's own he said hoarsely they wanted to cheat me of it and i said i'd split damn pierce and gray and all so you were going for the prince's cash box were you i said equably it's more than that said he there's the treasure in the strong room that's their game now i see you are sensible i said and i can undertake to make you well and sound and happy provided you tell the truth doctor it burns like fire he groaned i will see to that i said what is the plot i have cried off that's why i got the knife he said faintly but swear to god no harm'll come to me i promise you that i said nodding it's the boatswain's plot he whispered and he has more'n half the men they are going to rise ere ever we get to buenos ayres but i was no party to their plans he continued feverishly and as if anxious to convince me that's why i've this knife doctor because i'm an honest man i had more than my doubts of that but i nodded again you have only done your duty in telling me adams said i and i'll keep my promise provided you hold your tongue about this they have given you a dose of morphia and it's lucky it wasn't bigger if you do what i tell you we'll have you right in a couple of days i made him drink a draught i had brought with me and closing the door left him a passage led from here to the men's quarters and as i came out i signed to ellison to be noiseless and put out the light then we moved towards the hatchway when we reached it i happened to glance round at ellison and through that brooding darkness lightened only by a dim swinging lamp i thought i saw a flitting shadow but the next swing of the boat threw the light clear into the corner and there was nothing we emerged on the lower deck and thence regained the quarterdeck there was a bright light in the chart room and i led the way thither i closed the door and turned on the quartermaster his face was grey and his hand trembled you heard said i yes sir he replied and hesitated but he's wandering sir ain't he my man said i i'm a doctor leave that much to me i only want to know if you heard that is all your part no there is one thing more what about the hands they're a pretty mixed lot sir not exactly what i would call yacht hands but were you engaged with them i interrupted sharply no sir sir john he got me on i've sailed with him before thank the lord for that i said heartily for i had begun to suspect every one the voyage was a nightmare i thought who is the officer in charge i asked mr legrand sir said ellison the second mate and i had had few exchanges he was a reserved man and devoted to his duty besides as navigating officer he had his full share of responsibility for the safety of the ship i moved out of the chart house leaving the quartermaster in a maze of bewilderment and i think incredulity the stars illumined the figure of the second officer on the bridge and i stood in a little gust of doubt which shook me should i sleep over the new discovery i had ellison a didymus for witness but i was still sore from the reception of my previous news i took the length of the deck and looked over the poop where a faint trail of light spumed in the wake of the ship suddenly i was seized from behind lifted by a powerful arm and thrown violently upon the taffrail it struck me heavily upon the thighs and i plunged with my hands desperately in the air lost my balance and pitched over head foremost towards the bubbling water as i fell my shoulder struck the bulge of the iron carcase of the vessel and i cannoned off into the void but by the merest chance my clutching hands in that instant caught in the hitch of a rope which had strayed overboard the loop ran out with my wrist in it and i hit the water its roar was in my ears but nothing else and when i rose to the surface the ship was thirty yards away but the rope was still over my arm and as soon as i recovered breath i began to haul myself slowly and painfully in as it was i was being torn through the water at the rate of from twelve to fourteen knots an hour and in a very few minutes the chill which my immersion had inflicted on me passed away giving place to a curious warmth that stole throughout my limbs and enabled me to continue the onward struggle i drew nearer foot by foot the sea racing past me and burying my face constantly in floods of salt water but i was encouraged to observe the sea queen was now perceptibly closer and i clung and hauled and hauled again my danger now was the screw and i could hear the thumping of the steel blades below and see the boiling pit under the stern by the vessel if i hauled closer should i be dragged into that terrible maelstrom and be drawn under the deadly and merciless machinery i could see the open taffrail through which the stars glimmered away above me it seemed that safety was so near and yet so far she rolled and the lights of the port holes flashed lanterns on the sea in that uprising i raised my voice helplessly hopelessly in a cry i repeated this shout three times and then i saw a man come and hang over the taffrail was it the unknown murderer and did he look for his victim to complete his abominable job as the thought struck me i was silent and then i saw him stoop and examine the iron stanchions at his feet next i felt the rope being pulled slowly in at this i shouted again and he ceased the screw i called the screw he moved away to the port side and once more the rope began to move gradually i reached the side of the ship about a dozen feet to port and five minutes later i was safe on deck good lord sir what is it asked ellison's voice in terror my arm is cut through and one leg is near broken i gasped don't ask me more but get me brandy he returned in an incredibly short time for if he was a man of leisurely british mind he was wonderful on his feet i drank the raw spirit and felt better now do you believe i asked him you mean that i was knocked overboard i knew too much i said sharply don't stand staring man we don't know where we are or what is afoot give me your arm and let us get to the bridge stay have you any weapon no sir any available no sir not without waking the carpenter that is the usual british way said i believe nothing until it happens nothing does happen does it nothing has happened has it ellison well we must chance it at least we have stout fists we made our way under the shelter of the saloon and smoking room and came to the steps of the bridge i mounted with great difficulty and ellison followed legrand turned at our appearance and surveyed us under the gleam of his lamp with astonishment mr legrand said i i need not ask if you have weapons available for i'm sure you have not but you will need them what is't you mean he said sharply mutiny and murder said i he went straight to the speaking tube without a word and called down to the engineer's room mr mccrae will you personally bring me a couple of pistols or any offensive weapon at hand iron bars will do at once please this was a man after my own heart i could have embraced him he came back to me and now doctor i told him he was silent and then brought out a string of expletives i mistrusted the filthy pack from the first he said see what they give us to work with sir the scum of glasgow and london and none of us to have a say in the matter i'd sooner go to sea with satan than scum like that he said fiercely as soon as i set eyes on them i knew we were in for it but not this he added not this by a long chalk there's one thing to be done said i we'll do it now he replied his fury gone as suddenly as it came and we descended the ladder at the foot we met mccrae very angry and sarcastic wanting to know since when the deck was allowed to order the engine room about like pot boys but a few words put him in possession of the facts and i think if any argument had been needed my exhausted and dripping body would have sufficed the old man said he legrand nodded chapter vi the conference in the cabin we opened the captain's door without knocking but he was awake at once and turned on the electric light what is this gentlemen is it a raree show he inquired in his particular voice it is some information dr phillimore has to impart sir said legrand day's eyes narrowed oh i see dr phillimore is taking part in some more theatricals he said grimly and his costume seems suited to them i beg your pardon sir said i hotly if you would only listen instead of passing judgment we might get on i'm learning a lot this voyage said day with a sneer pray proceed again i told my story day got up in his pyjamas an insignificant figure of a man without his important uniform he might have been merely a member of parliament or a minor poet but he had with all his defects the courage of his position and responsibilities this is a matter i feel unequal to alone it has gone on too long he said sharply it is time i knew where i stand he left the cabin abruptly and returned in a few minutes i have taken the liberty of inviting mr morland's attendance he said and have sent for sir john barraclough and mr holgate i will know once for all where i stand i beg you not mr holgate captain said i and why not mr holgate sir he asked peremptorily here is a report of conspiracy and mutiny you bring me and i will have my officers in attendance to weigh it you will remember my former charge captain day i said well sir he answered if my report to night is correct as i have a witness to prove does it not shed some light on my former charge against mr holgate and is it therefore desirable that he should be here day considered and then he looked me up and down if i were a doctor dr phillimore he observed with sarcasm i should advise you to change your clothes oh there is a more important matter than clothes i replied angrily or should i be here is it for fun do you suppose he turned from me without saying anything but my words had their effect for when the door opened and holgate's face appeared day said civilly enough i am sorry to have disturbed you unnecessarily mr holgate but i find i shall not need you at present the third officer's big face moved slowly on his bull neck and his eyes met mine very well sir said he calmly and there was nothing legible in his gaze it was blank and insignificant destitute even of curiosity barraclough arrived immediately afterwards and on his heels mr morland dressed as when he walked the hurricane deck daily his somewhat dull face owning and manifesting a certain dignity i have asked you here mr morland said day at once because of certain rumours and mysteries and alleged discoveries which are in circulation it is an untimely hour but that is not my fault dr phillimore has brought me a story which if he is correct is of vital importance to us i should be glad therefore if you would answer a question are you prince frederic of hochburg mr morland's eyes lighted up i have employed you sir he began to work this ship pardon me it is necessary said day with extreme politeness i hear a tale of conspiracy to rob my employer who sails with me and whom i know as mr morland but who is stated to be prince frederic of hochburg i am justified therefore in asking if mr morland is prince frederic and if he has the money on board which the tale alleges according to that answer must i shape my conduct mr morland drew himself up it is reasonable he said as if reflecting yes i am frederic of hochburg day's fingers trembled and the money he asked in a hard voice there is some money on board said the prince looking round on our faces and now i was surprised that i had not identified long since that guttural german accent but i should wish to know what this scene means sir he said in a haughty voice day waved his hand at me i have learned to night said i by an accident that there is a plot among the crew to seize the ship and its contents before reaching buenos ayres for the third time i then told my story to which my sodden garments were a genuine witness the prince listened to me with a frown i do not understand said he i was led to believe that i was chartering a good vessel with a good captain and a crew for my cruise i do not understand this nor i said day with a shrug of his shoulders i am not responsible for the crew it was arranged by your agents mr morland ah said the prince shortly and then but you tell me they have turned out to be pirates this is ridiculous i must refer you to dr phillimore sir said day curtly as for me if i had known what i know now you would have sailed under another captain i am too old for mysteries ignoring this if he listened to it the prince turned on me where is your evidence of this he asked and his eyes fell on ellison who was plainly uncomfortable ah did what the doctor says happen yes sir then we must send for this man adams concluded his royal highness let him be brought i had in my hand during all this time the bar of iron which mccrae had brought i gave it to barraclough if you are going said i take this it may be needed he looked at me with a lift of his eyebrows all serene said he with a smile this seems a pretty show altogether come quartermaster legrand went back to his bridge with a revolver in his pocket and i was left with mr morland and the captain the former scrutinised me closely and deliberately without regard to my feelings while day feigned to be busy at his table i stay here sir said i to the prince with emphasis because i seem in a manner to be a prisoner on trial i have called my evidence and it will be forthcoming presently but i must say i added bitterly that i resent the way in which my testimony has been received and at buenos ayres if we ever reach that port i shall beg to be relieved of my duties and have my contract cancelled if mr mr morland does not object certainly i shall not dr phillimore said day drily oh come captain said i impatiently we are in a peril together and you stand on ceremonies that has yet to be proved he said even as he spoke a noise announced the return of the party and sir john barraclough entered your man's missing said he day uttered an exclamation and the prince's frown deepened there's no one in the cabin said barraclough at that instant a knock fell on the door is the doctor here said a voice which i recognised at once barraclough opened the door and holgate stood on the threshold it has been reported to me as i came on duty he said that adams is missing doctor it seems a bad case he was delirious and two of the men say they heard a plunge the port hole is open it's a lie i cried holgate's face twitched it's the report made to me he said i came at once and the fang showed clear under his upper lip it is foul play i said he was not likely to throw himself overboard it all belongs to the plot was this man delirious asked day of me i hesitated for a time he was slightly i answered he was delirious when he told you these things that i deny he turned to ellison what do you say quartermaster i don't know sir said the man in confusion he didn't seem quite quite all right ah said day looking at mr morland good heavens sir would you take a common sailor's word before a doctor's i asked indignantly no dr phillimore i am only weighing the evidence said he coolly this man was according to you delirious for a time he made some communication as to a plot then he disappears it is either conspiracy or delirium either accounts for the facts which are we to believe you forget the attempt on me i said hotly not at all he said i have not forgotten that accident but it hardly gets us further it fits in with either supposition the plot or he paused the delirium he added significantly gentlemen i wish you good night or good morning i said turning on my heel and i will beg of you mr morland to grant me the privilege of a substitute when we reach buenos ayres mr morland did not answer he made an impatient gesture and then are you satisfied captain day he asked quite was the laconic answer then may i request you will see that discipline is kept among your men said the prince severely and stalked out of the cabin barraclough broke into laughter upon my soul he began but was interrupted by an angry exclamation be good enough sir to keep your counsel till it is asked sir said day trembling with fury i have too many princes and baronets here for my taste he stamped round the room in agitation my men he cried good lord what have i had to do with them i wish i'd never seen the figurehead of the yacht good lord my men i would sooner run an excursion steamer than submit to this barraclough eyed him without any emotion even with hard hostility the exit of the prince had stayed my departure and abruptly day came to a pause by me that will do gentlemen he said quietly holgate who was at the door opened it and his round face swung gently on his shoulders till his gaze rested on me again something flickered in it something like a leer on that malicious blackness and then he was gone day stood stock still looking by me after him as i turned to follow he addressed me dr phillimore if you can spare a moment before you change he said civilly i shall be glad of a few minutes i answered promptly wondering and the door closed behind barraclough doctor i haven't slept a wink for nights burst out the captain suddenly i must have something he had a haggard drawn look and his eyes seemed sunken in his head at once i was the professional man and not an officer of the ship sit down sir said i and tell me what is it he sat down shakily i don't like my officers doctor and i don't like my employer he said peevishly i held his pulse which was jumping what else i said you are not a married man he inquired looking at me restlessly no never mind he paused and proceeded in his ridiculously precise voice i had the misfortune to lose my wife and my son in a fortnight about a month ago it has rather upset me it might have seemed comic communicated in that matter of fact tone but somehow it struck me as tragic that this vain self contained and reticent man should confess to the frailty of humanity to a man he disliked was the measure of his suffering i can mend the sleep captain said i you must do the rest good god he shook his head and stood up no said i sit down i'll see to you let me ring in a few minutes i had my case of instruments and carefully extracted what i wanted while day looked on feverishly impatient i'm going to do what has already been done this night i said gravely but in a better cause i raised the syringe and bade him put back the sleeve of his pyjama a rush of pain went through my arm which had been bruised and battered in the sea and suddenly the cabin went from me for the first and only time in my life i fainted when i came to day was bending over me glass in hand a look of solicitude on his face it seems we have changed places said i feebly and that you are my physician he set the glass down doctor i did you less than justice just now he said quickly but i have had my troubles i picked myself up slowly i will now resume i said smiling if you are able he said doubtfully and then heavens i should like just one hour of sleep you shall sleep till eight bells i promise you i answered and once more i took the syringe he sighed as if in anticipation doctor he said as he lay back not a word of this we must talk about the other thing i don't like my officers i'll tackle this question to morrow there's something in it i bade him good night and left with the conviction that in the difficulties before us captain day would count for little to face such emergencies as i felt must now be faced we had no need of a neurotic subject nevertheless i was mistaken in one particular day sent for me next morning and i found him in quite a brisk cheerful state he did not allude to what had occurred between us but came straight to the subject of the plot nothing has happened doctor he said i knew nothing could happen for the disappearance of adams meant that the conspirators were not ready with their plans otherwise they would not have been so determined to rob me of my evidence this i explained and he listened attentively you see the difficulty he said at last there is no corroboration of your story and i can take no action i will have an inquiry into adams's disappearance of course but i fear nothing will come of it he rubbed his hands nervously i wish to god it would this was astounding from the man but as i looked into his eyes i could see how deeply his nervous system had been shocked and once more i despaired of such a captain in such circumstances i carried my misgivings to legrand with whom the events of the night had seemed to bring me in closer relationship the old man's all right he said a better seaman doesn't exist there's nothing he doesn't know except human nature said i well that may be but who knows much about that said the second officer setting his sextant you say we're slumbering over a volcano i daresay we are it's more or less what we're paid to do and take all risks things are quiet enough now anyway was this another sceptic where i had sought to find an ally i am used by this to ridicule i began drily who on earth is ridiculing you he asked you have only given us something to think of and something pretty tall too i shrugged my shoulders i suppose it is my word against holgate's i said wearily holgate's he said lowering his sextant swiftly holgate's i wouldn't trust holgate if he were on a dozen oaths not if he were swung at a yard arm and were making christian confession he said passionately nor would i i said softly after a pause we exchanged glances he resumed his sextant the only thing to be done he said is to keep a watch we shall know shortly excuse me doctor i must take the bearings routine must go on aboard ship but this cool attitude reasonable as it was was not to my taste in my condition things moved as smoothly as before the watch came and went and the bells tolled regularly but with the knowledge that i had that something evil was brewing i fretted and worried and grew out of temper the powers that were responsible for the safety of the ship and her good conduct were indifferent to the danger or else incredulous i alone knew how incompetent was the captain to secure his vessel and the attitude of mr morland filled me with contempt it was very well for a royal prince in his palace surrounded by his guard servitors and dependants to assume an autocratic attitude and take things for granted but it was another case when he had deliberately abandoned that security and launched himself upon a romantic not to say quixotic career in which nothing was certain yet upon the promenade deck the prince and his sister took their constitutionals as if nothing had happened or would happen and as before mlle trebizond joined them and her laugh floated down to us musical and clear would nothing make them understand the peril in which they stood in all this vexation of spirit i still found time to be amused by lane the affair of adams was necessarily public property and the inquiry promised by day was in process adams was gone gone overboard as i knew and i could have put my hand on his murderer if i could not also identify the man who had made an attempt to be mine lane on the rumour of the night's proceedings reaching him sought me and complained it was ludicrous but it was characteristic of the man as i had come to know him where do i come in he asked plaintively you might have given me a call doctor i wish i had been sleeping as sound as you i said oh hang it man it's dull enough on this beastly boat if there's any row on i'm in it do you think you guess how big a row you may be on i asked him oh well it's infernally dull he grumbled which when you come to think of it was a surprising point of view the adams inquiry ended in what must necessarily be called an open verdict the evidence of the boatswain and pentecost one of the hands assured that both testified to the fact that they were awakened in the still hours by a splash and one thought it was accompanied by a cry but was not sure at any rate the boatswain was sufficiently aroused to make search and to discover that adams was missing and subsequently that the port hole was open he had then as he declared reported the matter at once to the officer of the watch who was holgate holgate came to the captain's cabin as has been related there was no discrepancy to be noted in the stories of the two men nor was there any inherent improbability in their tale so as i have said though no verdict was given the verdict might be considered as open and we had got no further the captain however took one precaution for the key of the ammunition chest was put in barraclough's charge what others did i know not but i slept with a loaded revolver under my pillow we were now within a week of buenos ayres and had come into summer weather when we passed the twentieth parallel the heat was overpowering we took to ducks and the ladies as we could observe to the lightest of cotton dresses for all however that we saw of them they might have been dwelling in another sphere as indeed they were the steward alone had the privilege of communion with them and he being a distant fellow had nothing to say though i believe lane cross questioned him rigorously i have said that we saw nothing of our passengers but i at least was to see them more nearly very soon and that in the most unexpected manner one evening i had retired to my cabin and was stretched in my bunk reading one of the gilded books from the yacht's library when i was interrupted by a knock on the door come in i called idly and the door promptly opened and to my amazement miss morland stood before me she wore a plain evening dress of chiffon very pretty to the eye and over her head and shoulders a mantle of silk lace she had naturally as i had observed on my previous encounters a sparkle of colour in her face but now she had lost it and was dead white of complexion under the electric light doctor phillimore she said in english which was more perfect of accent than her brother's but speaking somewhat formally i understand that you believe you have discovered some plot by this time i was on my feet madam no one else believes it said i i do she said sharply and then i want you to come and see my brother mr morland i will do as you will i answered but at the same time i must point out that mr morland has cognisance of my story i stated what i had to say in his presence some days since ah said she you do not understand it is impossible for one in my brother's position to entertain these suspicions it is not for him to take precautions or should not be she added bitterly i bowed i will repeat what i have already stated i said and then as she turned to go i took a sudden impulse my heart was beating faster at this unexpected appearance of an ally and i made up my mind to confirm the alliance if it was what it seemed miss morland said i if i must continue to call you so that is my name sir she said loftily then if that is your name there is nothing in my plot i answered bluntly this plot imaginary or otherwise but one in which you say you believe is dependent wholly on your name not being morland madam assure me that it is and i undertake that the plot shall cease disappear in a twinkling you speak sir as if you had authority over it she said after a pause no i reason only on what i know this conspiracy has been evolved on the supposition that you and mr morland are not what you claim to be and on other suppositions if these be untrue and the mutineers can be convinced of that the conspiracy naturally falls to the ground again she made a pause but spoke quickly when she spoke my brother is prince frederic of hochburg i bowed and madam the ship contains treasure let us finish our confidences there are bonds and bullion to a large amount on board she said as if reluctantly it was unwise of him but he would have it so i may take it that the princess alix would not have it so i suggested you may assume what you will sir she said coldly madam said i seriously for handsome as she was and royal too i was nettled by her distance you ask me to help you and you keep me at arm's length i am not asking out of curiosity i only want to know what allies i can depend on heaven knows i have gone through enough already to keep me silent henceforward for ever even to the point of attempted murder i will answer any question you wish to put if i can she replied in a milder voice but my brother is waiting then may i know why you credit this plot i asked i know nothing of the plot she said the news of it has just come to my ears through some words dropped by mr morland but this i know that he runs a great risk he has always run a great risk ever since she stopped i am willing to believe the worst now said i i am ready to accompany you and forthwith without more words we went on deck when we reached the cabin i found not only the prince but day who was clearly in one of his moods he had a nervous way of flipping his fingers when put out and he stood now firing off his white hand restlessly he did not pay me any attention on my entrance but fixed his gaze on princess alix as i am no longer in command on my boat dr phillimore he said abruptly perhaps you will be good enough to explain to mr morland what you propose to do i looked at the prince who nodded curtly evidently there had been a scene i believe that a rising is contemplated before we reach buenos ayres i said i would advise therefore that we change our course for rio janeiro at once we are only thirty hours' steam away day turned his attention on me there is something in that he said i shall be able to get a new doctor the prince frowned it is for me to say he said sharply you sir will then be able to get a new captain said day politely he bowed to the prince and princess that is very probable said the prince and added i order you to put into rio captain dr phillimore's advice commends itself to me i said nothing but the princess gave me a quick glance in which i seemed to read approval your orders shall be obeyed said day and ceremoniously left the cabin when he was gone the prince turned to me i am obliged for your zeal in my service he said as if he were conferring a decoration whereupon he bowed and i followed the captain i went at once to day's cabin and waited for i had made up my mind as to the method in which he should be treated the man was obviously incapable of discretion in his state he entered presently with a heavy sigh and only then observed me a malignant look worked in his face blackly but i interposed at once captain said i if you are captain i am doctor this can only end one way and i won't have it end that way if it is in my power to prevent it you are wrong he said snappishly you are captain and doctor in one i am going to try on you a particular drug which i have faith in i said ignoring his words it is new but there are great possibilities in it if it is all i believe it to be you will get up to morrow another man he put his arms on the table oh my god he groaned night and day night and day for god's sake doctor give me something that was what i wanted he was a little querulous spiteful child now and i had possession of him i had seen his soul undressed and naked and it frightened me i felt more than anxiety for him i felt compassion and it was i that put him to bed that night but meanwhile we were on the way to rio janeiro chapter vii the rising in advising that the yacht's course should be laid for rio i assumed that possibly the mutineers would not have completed their arrangements and would be taken by surprise my assumption was justified though its very correctness came near to wrecking what reputation i had left as a man of sense i had long recognised that i was looked upon as having a bee in my bonnet and the fact that we arrived safely in the port must have increased the doubts of those who knew i was responsible for the alteration of the course the change could not of course be concealed very long the watch was privy to it when day set the new course and by next morning it was all over the ship yet the same dignified routine proceeded no one volunteered any act of violence and if i believed in myself no one else did i am sure little pye mused openly on the change but withdrew himself at once into his legal reticence when i also expressed my surprise to say the truth i was not anxious that it should be known that i was the author of the alteration and so made inquiries with a show of innocence nor do i think that any one suspected me for neither the prince nor day would be likely to talk day indeed surprised me he thanked me privately for my medical advice and with a smile added perhaps i should say also nautical i shook my head smiling also it was political captain and that's all he nodded absently and said suddenly i think doctor i will get rid of pierce at rio i was heartily glad to hear this and would have suggested that holgate also should go but refrained i knew not how far his improvement would bear the strain of the suggestion we lay at anchor in the bay to coal and the passengers took themselves off to the shore mlle trebizond in a wild flutter of excitement this meant for her the nearest approach to paris i suppose that was available at least she was in great spirits and talked with the officers as we entered the harbour we heard the sound of music pouring from the saloon which had never yet been used by the party and on that the rich notes of a fine mezzo soprano the little exhibition arrested the men at their work and after that long passage of silence seemed to wake us up and put us in a better mood as it was disagreeable on board during the coaling operations i too followed the party on shore in the company of barraclough we had arrived at mid day and the yacht was to sail on the following evening for the simple methods of coaling in rio protract the business i lunched at the english hotel and occupied the time in the usual manner of the sight seer visited the summit of the hill by the alpine railway and walked negligently in the botanical gardens i slept ashore and was joined on nightfall by lane who was full of the gust of living he could only be said to enjoy himself when he got ashore and yet he could not keep off the sea i learned from him with satisfaction that pierce the boatswain was gone paid off at the captain's orders so here was something for my consolation i breathed a little more freely and inquired further but the rest of his information was not so satisfactory besides the passengers day barraclough mccrae and himself had come ashore leaving legrand with holgate and little pye to represent what might be termed the aristocracy of the deck and next morning i got a glimpse in the streets of pye so that holgate was barring the second officer master of the yacht i will confess i did not like this look of things so deep was my distrust of holgate in the rua do ouvidor i had a fleeting vision of princess alix and mlle trebizond as they turned into a shop but for the rest i enjoyed myself as a stranger to the sea queen and one with no concern in her fortunes it was late afternoon when i got to the quay to take a boat to the yacht for as i calculated that would leave me a full hour to the time appointed for sailing judge then of my amazement when i saw her standing out the smoke wrack flying abaft and trudging steadily for the mouth of the harbour i stood there i think fully three minutes before i moved or took action but during that space of time i had jumped at the conclusion i was not wanted aboard was it day no the idea was absurd as he was most meticulous in his observation of the conventions it certainly was not the prince the inference was only too obvious the hour of sailing had been shifted by whom i sprang down to the foot of the quay where one of the big two decked harbour ferry boats was lying is your steam up i shouted to a man on the bridge i want you to catch that yacht he stared at me in astonishment and shook his head i shouted back again and he replied in portuguese i assume of which tongue i am quite ignorant i clambered aboard and made my way to him by which time he had been joined by another man with gold lace round his cap i repeated my query in french and the second man replied indolently it was impossible i will give you twenty pounds if you catch her i said and fumbled in my mind for some computation in their wretched currency i do not know how many hundred thousand reis i mentioned but it seemed to have some effect both men stared after the yacht i added several hundred thousand more reis and they were plainly shaken heaven knew why i should have been offering my poor money for the sake of prince frederic of hochburg i did not stop to reason but acted merely on impulse the man with the gold band went to the speaking tube and shouted down it the other man began to give brisk orders in a small thin voice evidently my offer was accepted i turned and looked out into the bay and there was the sea queen still steaming leisurely for the heads when once the ferry boat shook herself loose she made fair way she champed and churned in a fussy manner and the great steel crank in her middle began to thud in a terrifying manner we had backed out and were driving down the harbour at the rate of perhaps nine knots was the sea queen making more it was impossible to judge at that distance the yacht might have been a mile away and if she were going as fast as we it would probably be impracticable to attract her attention for some time until at any rate we were clear of the shipping surely then the sight of a cumbrous ferry boat beating down on an unwonted journey to the heads would draw their eyes and fill their speculations we were three miles out twenty minutes after starting and now it was obvious that we were not making ground but losing the trail of the smoke swept the water behind her and her nose was plunging for the open sea i was in despair i shouted to the captain in the effort to get him to hoist signals and at last one was found which suited the emergency i have forgotten what it was but it apparently signified that help was required immediately but still the yacht held on and the distance between us grew it seemed that i was after all destined to be free of the fortunes of that ship whatever they might be and i stood by the captain of the ferry boat with a feeling of defeat and helplessness silent and almost resigned and then by one of those strange ironies the solution came to me came to me too just as mere selfish considerations were asserting themselves i had thought of the prince and the conspirators if i had thought at all certainly not of myself and now came the reflection that i had pledged my last sovereign in the endeavour to catch the yacht and that i was to be landed again in that foreign port penniless was it under the stimulus of that thought that i recalled of a sudden the first appearance of the sea queen in my life and remembered the flash of the rocket have you any rockets i asked turning abruptly round the man stared smiled deprecatingly and shook his head he addressed his mate in portuguese and they held an animated conversation finally he turned to me and the mate went below there is one he believes monsieur said the captain it was for saving life but it is old well old or new i was resolved to try it and presently when the mate appeared with a huge bomb in his hands we set ourselves to work the men by this time were interested and we had the rocket rigged in a trice the anxious moment was when we came to fire it would it fizzle out was the touch long gone it resisted sullenly for some minutes and then unexpectedly took the bit in its teeth if i may put it that way and bolted in the summer evening sky was a great rush of light and in my ears the hissing of a hundred serpents then there was silence and the light describing its arc vanished into the water ahead i gazed anxiously but it was not until ten minutes later that we were able to judge of the success of our venture then the little captain touched me on the shoulder beaming he did not trust to his inadequate french but pointed i had already seen the sea queen lay to a quarter of an hour later i stepped aboard her and the man who let down the gangway was holgate why doctor we thought you were in your cabin a near shave said he pretty close said i i thought the hour was six it was changed to five by captain's orders he replied notice was sent duly it missed me i answered cheerfully i wasn't at the hotel all the time i passed him and met legrand who stared at me it's not your ghost doctor no i said in a lower voice but maybe it will come to ghosts yet he stroked his short beard and turned about day i found was surveying me from the bridge in the most elegant suit of ducks now that you have arrived dr phillimore perhaps we may be allowed to proceed he said sarcastically i made no reply but went aft where my adventures must be poured into lane's ears barraclough looked me up and down in his cool indifferent way come aboard sir he said with a grin yes said i with a deliberate drawl it cost me just twenty five pounds damned if i wouldn't sooner have stayed and had a good old time said lane what's the use of a bally ship oh said i being a millionaire i can't tell if i'd only thought of it lane i might have followed your advice didn't you get the notice asked pye no i was enjoying myself you see i'm a careless fellow but i'm a modest one also and i've made too much of a sensation for my taste you're fond of sensations my good sir said sir john with his abominable arrogance well if you'll allow me i'll shed all i can of this that is clothes i replied calmly and i went below when i had had a bath and assumed my yachting costume i came on deck again only to meet day in a furious temper as i could tell from his eyes i explained the circumstances of my mishap adding that i had not received my notice which was no doubt my fault i certainly might have made more changes at rio than i did he said maliciously and passed by me it was ungracious but the man was not responsible from the deck above the face of mlle trebizond peered down at me smiling and handsome it was an adventure she said in her english showing her pretty teeth it was most exciting doctor to be chased by a pirate i'm glad you enjoyed it mademoiselle said i politely i take some credit to myself for the rocket oh but it should have been dark that would have been much better said she come up and tell me all about it after a momentary hesitation i obeyed and when i reached the deck i found princess alix there once more i explained my misadventure and mlle trebizond chatted and laughed in great good humour she had made many purchases but complained of the shops she could not get her favourite perfume she protested and wondered how people could live in such remote regions then she tired of me i suppose and walked off leaving me to the princess her blue eyes as cold as her brother's flashed a question at me it was not an accident she said the notice i find was sent last night after mr morland had communicated with captain day it should have reached me at the hotel early this morning it didn't i see she looked towards the forts at the mouth of the harbour which we were then passing i am glad you did your duty in rejoining the yacht she said next i think i was between amusement and irritation at her words for after all i considered that it was not a time to talk of duty when i had been the victim of a trick and had after my own poor fashion paid so heavily for it i might even have looked for a sentence of thanks for my zeal but the princess was a princess still despite that she was also miss morland and the sister of a man who had thrown away all to contract a morganatic marriage but amusement got the upper hand i smiled oh we english have usually a severe sense of duty i replied at least when it comes to a pinch on the other hand of course we lack discipline she glanced at me and with a little bow moved away i was dismissed the yacht was pointed now for buenos ayres at which port it was clear that for reasons of his own prince frederic was anxious to arrive it was not until the second evening however that anything of importance occurred but that was of considerable importance as you shall see i had occasion to pay a visit to the stoke hole where one of the men had injured his hand and i had finished my work and was mounting the grubby wire ladder when a fireman passed me with averted face i hardly glanced at him and certainly did not pause the least fraction of a second but to the half glance succeeded a shock the nerves i suppose took a perceptible instant of time to convey the recognition to the brain but despite the grime on his face and the change in his appearance i could not be mistaken it was pierce the discharged boatswain here was news indeed pierce of whom day thought he had got rid in rio was employed as stoker on the yacht how came he there this bespoke treachery again and now i began to get some notion of how vast and subtle was the web of the conspiracy it could not be that only a few men were concerned in it holgate had been right how many hands could we depend on who put pierce in his present situation i went on deck in a fume of wonder and excitement plainly something was hatching and probably that very moment if fierce thought i had recognised him it would doubtless precipitate the plans of the villains there was no time to be lost and so first of all i went whither do you suppose to see the princess she received me in her boudoir where she was reclining in an evening gown that fitted her beautiful figure closely and she rose in astonishment but at once her eyes lighted you have something to tell me she inquired yes said i the man who was dismissed is still on board he is acting as stoker she compressed her lips and eyed me that spells madam business said i what is to be done she asked quietly but i could see her bosom moving with excitement i have come to you first because it is you who must prepare the prince and persuade him of the crisis i will go to the captain with my tale and heaven knows how i shall be received it is the prince who must act yes yes she said quickly go at once i will find my brother day was in his cabin and knocking i entered without waiting for permission i found him with his arm bared and a syringe in his hand he stared at me and scowled there is no time for words sir said i pierce is on board and there is danger there will probably be a rising to night he threw the syringe down i'm very glad to hear it he declared in even tones take that away doctor where's sir john barraclough i told him that he was on the bridge send mr legrand to me and he broke off but how do you know he asked suspiciously it is not a case of knowledge it is a case for preparation he said if we have the arms distributed i was interrupted by a sharp report from below day ran out in his pyjamas and i followed we heard barraclough's voice from the bridge raised angrily go back there man get back gray it was a pitch black night save for the glittering stars and i could only make out a knot of men at the head of the ladder leading from the lower deck what the devil do you mean shouted barraclough and then all of a sudden the knot of men opened in a struggle and a man burst through and dashed towards us falling at my feet for god's sake sir he panted out they've seized the engine room and mr mccrae's shot 'twas pierce done it i recognised by his voice grant one of the deck hands and i helped him to his feet who's in this i asked but before he could reply the gang of men approached nearer and some one spoke from their midst it was holgate captain day i regret to state that the men are not satisfied with the way things are being conducted he said in a level voice they are not satisfied with their pay for one thing and there are other matters no harm is intended but they have decided that i am to take your place and for the present you are to consider yourselves prisoners particularly the doctor he added the offensive assurance of the man made me boil but on day it seemed to have a curiously astringent effect so mr holgate there has been a council of war he said quietly even drily and you are to step into my shoes i will give you three minutes to retire from the deck go back i tell you do you hear men go back his acrid voice rang out thinly but barraclough above shouted hoarsely good god can't you do something to them at this moment i was aware of noises on the promenade deck and looking up saw the prince's figure outlined dimly against the stars you have your orders he called out in his deep voice go back to your quarters there was a pause and then the silence was broken by a shot and one of the men fell a second report rang out and a curse rose on the air a third followed and the men turned and retreated from the hurricane deck came still another shot and they tumbled down the ladder pell mell the prince was shooting as calmly as at so many partridges i ran down stairs and fetched my revolver and when i returned i could hear no sound from the lower deck barraclough met me at the door of the saloon there's not a pound of steam on her he said the brutes have shut off the valves let her go said i we have something more important on our hands they'll be here again the prince took them by surprise no english captain would have used his weapons so no by heaven he exclaimed this makes it a question of he paused mr legrand came running along the deck we've got it now he said oh we've got all we want now look here said i is ellison with you i'm sure he's not in this yes said barraclough well post him at the ladder and here's grant let's find out how we stand it'll be hot work to night said legrand day's voice came to us from his cabin door sir john barraclough be good enough to place all the men you can trust on guard with orders to fire in case of necessity i shall be obliged for your company and that of the officers in my cabin we had four men including ellison on the deck and there was also the man at the wheel who had not quitted his place through all these events one could surely rely upon a man with such a sense of duty so having made such dispositions as were possible barraclough followed us to the captain the ladies i hoped were safe in their cabins as i had heard no sound of them day was brief and businesslike dr phillimore was right said he i ask his pardon we must see how many men we have there is mr lane and mr pye where is mr pye i am here sir said the little clerk from the back that makes including mr morland twelve men to depend on so far as we know if that is he added almost with a sneer we can depend on them grant may know more said legrand bring him said day and opened the door to the prince prince frederic was cool and collected and showed little to mark the disturbance and bloodshed of the last quarter of an hour little unless it were in the increased blue of his eyes which shone frostily have you all your men captain he remarked in his determined german way quite free of vivacity we are sure of twelve said day and we are trying to find out about the others so as to separate sheep and goats but here was grant arrived blood on his face and a brisk air of savagery about him grant who are the mutineers said the captain couldn't speak to 'em all sir said the man i knew nothing of it till half an hour ago when i ran into them and they seized me there was gray and pierce and mr holgate and granger and half a dozen in the lot that took me do you mean to say that you had no inkling of this said day with asperity i'll take god to witness no sir said the man earnestly and i'll take my oath williams and naylor hadn't neither that makes two more said the prince nodding but where are they grant looked over his shoulder in the direction which would indicate the forecastle if they're not here sir your highness he said hesitatingly i don't know where they are the stokers is all joined i heard 'em say good lord they've made a clean sweep said barraclough with a laugh and what's this about mccrae mr mccrae was shot at the first sir in seizing the engines and they've fetched her pretty nigh to a standstill growled the first officer phew no there she goes he exclaimed as the screw began to bump they've picked her up that'll be crossley he's with them confound him then that leaves twelve said the purser and forty odd t'other side oh he whistled this makes swank don't it silence mr lane commanded the captain we must first of all be on our guard armed and secondly see if we are in a position to add to our numbers but we have the deck which can only be reached one way the stewards mr lane he asked quickly i'll answer for the three and the cuisine declared the purser boldly i'll go bail on them i've known jackson on other voyages i engaged 'em myself then who the devil engaged the others i'd like to know asked day in his old irritable tone at which to the astonishment of all a small voice broke the silence i did sir we all wheeled round it was pye the little man fixed his gold glasses on his nose with two fingers in his nervous way and blinked through them at us unruffled as a cock sparrow that yet had doubts he by heaven whispered legrand to me with infinite scorn he chose 'em and i regret to find sir pursued pye that some of them have gone wrong i feel myself in a way responsible it all comes of putting things in the hands of lawyers said lane with innocent recklessness day looked down his nose well mr pye he said drily we'll try to forgive you you fell in with the wrong crowd if i had known he paused the question is how are we to get in touch with the faithful men who may be in the forecastle if you will allow me sir i will venture into the forecastle and find out said pye with a restrained sense of importance you cried day in amazement and there was a general burst of laughter except on the part of the prince who was eyeing pye severely and on the part of myself who did not see anything for ridicule in the unexpected courage of a timid man i feel in a way responsible repeated pye but his protest was feeble in effort for day put him curtly aside i fear you will not do sir said he but i will captain i called out the prince's eyes came over to me leaving pye he nodded and addressed day in an undertone my dear sir they've marked you out first and foremost said barraclough i'll back the doctor declared lane excitedly oh i go only in the mission of humanity i replied mccrae may not be dead no one knows and what's more the mutineers have two or three cripples on their hands they won't lay a hand on me at present that's true dr phillimore remarked day well if you have weighed the risks i will not prevent you it is essential we should know something more it will come to blows again and that without notice mr morland he hesitated wishes me to express his thanks for your offer in that case said i acknowledging the compliment with a bow i may as well take time by the forelock and nodding to legrand i slipped out on the deck chapter viii the capture of the bridge i walked through the darkness to the head of the ladder where ellison was on watch any news i asked the quartermaster no sir all quiet he answered and as i made to go down he cried out where are you going sir don't do that you can't go there it's all right i answered keep your eyes open nothing will happen to me and don't be lured from the staircase whatever occurs and here take my revolver i'm on a mission of peace i slipped down the ladder and found myself in the gloom of the orlop deck a lantern was hanging in the shrouds and i had not reached it before i was challenged it's the doctor gray said i recognising his voice and come no earlier than you want him i'll wager there's more than one of you has got his gruel i'm thinking he came into the light are you armed doctor said he you can feel said i and he clapped his hands down my pockets well i don't know he said in a hesitating way it's true enough davenport's dead as mutton and stephenson and coyne are down in their bunks but it's mr holgate commands here i'll call him he went forward and whistled and presently two other men approached one of whom i saw was holgate by his rolling form glad to see you doctor he said cheerfully i was hoping to be honoured by a visit but hang me if i expected it come along now and let's get some light on the case he led the way into the forecastle quarters and emerged into the room in which the hands had their meals which was lit by electricity as were all the cabins and saloons of the sea queen these digs are not what i'm accustomed to doctor he said taking a seat i'm frank you see but of course i retire only to jump better isn't that how it goes we jumped too soon you see and that was you if it had not been for that fool pierce twice the essential ass played into your hands you were pretty smart though i gave you a lead there i was the fool well mr holgate as between man and man you were i said he laughed oh it will work out all right but it makes it bloody now there was no need of blood in this little job not if it had been rightly managed and i'll take blame for that no you were my mistake he looked at me in his tense unblinking way as if he would have torn out of me on that instant what i thought and what i really was i shall not be your last i said indifferently have a drink he said we've got some good champagne all under lock and key you bet my son that's not going to be my mistake at any rate i've not lived forty years for nothing i'm going to pull this off thank you said i but it's business i've come on business and 'the boy' go together in the city i've heard he answered well is it terms you want oh dear no i replied only an affair of mercy you've got two wounded men and there's mccrae he looked down for a moment mccrae was another mistake but not mine he said you can't do any good to mccrae but you can see the others if you will not that that's what you've come for shall i tell you what doctor you've come like the gentlemen who went to the holy land and came back carrying grapes eh i remember the picture when i was a boy a precious huge bunch too well you can have the grapes if you'll take 'em in a liquefied form and carry them in your belly i rose i'll see these men i said abruptly he led me to the bunks and i examined the wounded men one was beyond hope the other was but slightly injured and i told holgate the truth he nodded i don't much want coyne he said musingly i've no use for him he's a bungler the cold blooded way in which he delivered this heartless criticism raised in me a feeling of nausea i was moving away when he stopped me stay you're not going back empty handed doctor after all your kindness any one you'd like to see i thought yes said i naylor or williams holgate moved out and lifted the hatch naylor he called granger let naylor up he turned to me we don't starve 'em it's pretty comfortable 'tween decks when you're used to it i made no reply and presently a voice hailed us from below is that naylor asked holgate yes naylor here is the doctor inquiring after your health any questions he puts to you you are at liberty to reply to he moved away whistling cheerfully and i called out naylor i only want to know one thing how many of you are there six sir said the man all under hatch yes sir very well keep up your hearts this is not the end good night i went to holgate really said i lightly i find there are more honest men in this ship than i had anticipated i don't think he liked that you've got twelve he said drily and there's more than thirty with us you forget one thing i said we have the wheel and to morrow you may find yourselves steaming cheerfully up the river to buenos ayres like any good liner that would be a pity wouldn't it he said with a grin but you also forget one thing doctor that is i've got the engines supposing those engines stopped well we can get a press of canvas on her i suggested great heavens says he can you what are we doing i think said i that we have a good marksman on board you're right he said savagely and by thunder i won't forgive him for that i had meant by thunder i'll play old harry and merry hades to him for that lord doctor he added with a sneer to think of you sucking up to a potty prince or perhaps it's the ladies yes i hope you remember the ladies said i it's not too late holgate he was silent a moment i take no stock in women he said at length they're nothing to me let the little innocent birds go free i'll tell you what doctor i'll offer terms and generous terms considering i've got the trumps i'll drop the whole pack of you at the mouth of the river ladies and all and add all personal possessions of every one save what's in the prince's safes now that's fair i'll make you ambassador by gad it will be the only chance you will ever have of being a prince's ambassador he laughed holgate said i i've met many generous men but you appropriate the gingerbread as you might say now i wish you good night he advanced two steps towards me doctor said he gravely you've got to consider this it's important i'm not here to play marbles it's a sure thing i give you up there he made a movement of his thumb to the quarterdeck just this chance strike a bargain and i'll see you through there's not a hap'orth of harm will come to any otherwise he shrugged his shoulders mr holgate said i i will deal with you as frankly as you seem to desire this spells for you in my opinion one thing and that's the dock oh dear no he interrupted smiling the men were discontented despatched a deputation and were fired on by the prince english juries don't like these arbitrary german military ways you forget mccrae said i no i don't there was an accident in the engine room and the second engineer can bear witness to it as well as some others oh we stand very well doctor even as he spoke i saw a shadow steal out of the deeper darkness and draw to his side i made it out for pierce the murderer i will say that that interruption of the ruffianly boatswain turned unexpectedly the course of my blood i had seemed somehow to have been dealing with holgate as a scoundrel certainly yet upon terms of fair warfare but that shadow struck us all down to a lower level murder had been committed and here was the murderer without one word i turned and made my way towards the ladder communicating with the upper deck i had no good news to offer to my comrades indeed had i spoken quite what was in my thoughts it was a black prospect with which i must present them but i did not wish to increase the tension of the situation and merely recounted the facts i had gathered thirty against twelve mused day and there are six true men in the hold three head men we have opened well gentlemen he looked round sarcastically as he spoke but at once returned to his colder formal manner they have the engine room and we the bridge that means that their attack will be on the bridge i have no doubt that is what they mean i said very well gentlemen said day we know exactly where we are now thanks to dr phillimore you have your stations i shall be obliged if you will take them we are likely to have a lively night and let me say gentlemen said the prince raising his voice that i do not conceive it possible that a pack of mutineers can secure the control of their ship from their officers it is inconceivable i repeat i shall be at your disposal captain he turned to day when it is necessary i will take my share in the common danger and struggle there was a murmur of applause at this and we dispersed to our quarters legrand had the bridge and the man at the wheel was turning the spokes as calmly as if there had been no such thing as an alarm or a rising down below all was quiet and the engines were moving slowly it was now about one in the morning and on our beams the wind was rising the yacht was making about eight knots and no more and we were still a day's steam from buenos ayres i paced the deck in cover of the chart house for an hour or more in a condition of nervous impatience holgate i knew would move deliberately but when he moved this time he would strike hard it was towards the dawn that stopping in my walk i listened and heard amid the whistling of the wind and the wash of the water a little mutter of sound somewhere in the disintegrating darkness below i called to legrand under my breath and i heard his hist he was at attention his ears straining in the wind to get news of what was passing then there was a shot and the noise of a melee at the ladder oaths and shouts and the reports of revolvers echoed from the wooden walls can you see phillimore screamed legrand against the wind they are attacking the gangway i shouted back one of the two men who stood armed near me rushed forward go back go back thundered legrand from the bridge go to your post i was aware that the prince had come out on the hurricane deck which was on the level of the bridge and as i peered into the gloom suddenly a shout from the second man in my neighbourhood made me wheel sharply about i turned in time to see him fire at some figures that came over the port side of the yacht immediately i guessed that this was the real attack and that the assault on the ladder was but a diversion i ran forward calling to legrand i found barraclough on the other side of the deck houses using a cutlass and i moved to his assistance three men had reached the deck and a fourth was clambering over the seaman who had called out fired wide and the next moment went down under a heavy blow from the figure in front i discharged a shot but missed the man as he made his rush barraclough simultaneously gave way and i saw him being pushed backwards against the side of the saloon i fired again at one of his assailants who fell away with a curse and just then the first flush of the coming dawn moved over the waters and shed a little light on the scene it disclosed the burly form of holgate in grips with legrand who had descended from the bridge and barraclough still struggling with his opponent i had just time to make this out when one of the mutineers struck at me with a heavy bar and the blow owing to a movement on my part fell on my right arm and paralysed it he raised his weapon again while i fumbled to get the revolver out of my useless hand into my left when day suddenly emerged from somewhere with a levelled pistol my antagonist dropped like a log day fired again and then with an oath holgate threw the second officer heavily to the deck and pointed a revolver there was a pause of two seconds then a report and day slipped moved his arms helplessly and slid along the deck a shout now came from the other side of the ship where the struggle at the gangway had been going on and in a moment a stampede was upon us i was forced back by sheer weight of numbers to the head of the companion way using my weapon with some wildness for all was passing before me in confusion i had received a hard crack on the head and scarcely knew what i was doing but was merely sustained in my resistance by a sense of continuity inherited as it were from the earlier part of the struggle somehow i found myself in the shelter of the corridor that led to the apartments of the prince his sister and his guest and for some reason i could not with my dizzy head conjecture i was alone i looked down the corridor which was in gentle light but saw nothing it was as silent as though it had been plunged in the profound peace and slumber of the night without the racket of noises reached me as in a dream and i remember that i sat down on a couch in the corridor my empty revolver in my hand what ensued or how long i sat there i do not know but i think it could not have been very long i was aroused by a voice and looked up stupidly a face floated in the mists before me and i nodded in a friendly way smiling and opened my mouth to speak instead i lurched forward and was conscious of warm arms the soft pressure of a human body and the fragrance of a dress there was a time when i seemed to sway alone in a cold and dreary vacancy but soon there returned to my senses the warmth and the fragrance and the ineffable comfort of some presence some liquid was forced between my lips and i drank and as i drank my brain cleared and i looked and was aware who was supporting me with her arm it was princess alix madam i began stuttering hush drink this she said quickly we have need of you we cannot spare a man like you you have no dangerous wound i think not i said with difficulty a blow on the head my hand went feebly to it as i spoke and came away with a patch of red i rose and totteringly picked up my revolver which had fallen what has happened she shook her head i was up in the hurricane deck but my brother sent me down there is nothing to be heard i was going out when i found you here it is good of you i said vaguely let us go out then take this weapon i have one said she quickly i nodded brave girl said i gravely brave heart as brave as beautiful i felt vaguely i was paying her a necessary compliment but that was all yet the corridor was clearing before me now and the light of dawn was filtering through the curtained windows princess alix had turned to the door which gave on the deck if they have won she said suddenly in a low voice why have they not come here i shook my head they do not want the saloon they want other things said i they want the strongrooms then are they she began i cannot tell said i i will go out no she said imperatively wait of a sudden a voice was raised in a scream from the farther end of the corridor it is mademoiselle said she with a little frown she is impatient of my return i must go back she glided off swiftly and i stood by the door waiting for some moments as she did not return i opened it softly and the strong wind off the morning sea took me in the face refreshing me i stepped out upon the deck the sky was as grey as the sea and the silhouette of the spars and funnel was ghost like the sea queen thundered on her course heeling to the broad wash of the water as i stood watching my ears alert for any sound that would give me information i saw a figure detach itself from the bulwarks and move uncertainly about and as it drew near i discovered it was pye's his face was of a colour with the gray steel of his revolver which he held loosely as if he was not aware he held it oh my god he said in a hoarse whisper oh my god i didn't know it was like this oh my god pye i called softly and he started and dropped his pistol pick it up man and keep silence i whispered come this way i took his arm and stealthily withdrew him into the corridor what has happened he gazed at me wildly they've got the ship he said with a whisper oh i didn't know it would be like this i gave him a dose of the brandy which the princess had brought for me and it seemed to pull him together he blinked at me through his glasses and eyed me with some terror and distrust do you know how things stand i asked he shook his head the captain's killed he said falteringly i don't know about the others we've got to find out i said and thought then for i saw he would be of little use to me in his present state i said look here pye i'm going to explore while you keep this door mind you let no one in we'll bolt it see i did so as i spoke and turning found the princess coming down the corridor i explained to her the situation and added that pye would be placed on guard she cast a glance at him and looked at me inquiringly i'm going down to the saloon below i said this set of cabins is isolated except for the doors at each end to the deck and the door that gives on the staircase to the saloon can i depend on you to hold out for five minutes a shout will bring me up at a moment's notice yes she said breathlessly i opened the second door that admitted to the staircase and glanced down no one was visible and no sound was audible i turned nodded reassuringly to the princess and descended the saloon was empty and there were no signs of any struggle i passed along the passage towards the officers' quarters but everything was in order and finally retraced my way towards the kitchens which abutted on the engine room but were separated from it by a thick partition of steel and wood as i went the yacht rolled and sent me against a closed door with a heavy bump from within issued a sound subdued but unmistakable as that of a human voice i reflected that the mutineers would not be here for it was evident that the door was locked and no mutineer would secure himself in a cabin in the midst of his triumph i rapped loudly on the door and called out it's phillimore who is in here after a pause i heard the bolt go back and the door opened a little disclosing the face of lane you doctor he said thank the lord we're not all done yet he flung the door wide and i could see now that his companion was the head steward where's the prince i asked anxiously i don't know he said heaving a big sigh thank the lord there's some one else alive i was forced down the companion and fell lost my weapon too or i'd 'a' showed more fight great scott i rolled all the way down not before i'd done for one or two i tell you well you're wanted upstairs now said i both of you we've got the ladies on our hands and we've got to find out where the prince is day is dead lane whistled poor beggar he observed but jackson must stay here this is our magazine my boy where the grub is if we've got to stand a siege we've got to seize the grub chest the storage chamber's along here the advice seemed excellent yes i answered that is true well let jackson wait here and lie low he won't be discovered here i dare say the cook's somewhere hidden about here sir observed jackson all the better find him if you can and remember that if we pull through this means a big business for you jackson and cook too yes sir he assented mildly now then lane i went on and the purser followed me into the saloon we mounted the staircase and i took the chance of closing the doors at the head that gave access to the deck then i rapped on the door that gave on the prince's corridor it was opened by the princess eagerly we are two more miss morland i said cheerfully and here is one of them but my brother she cried out i've not discovered his whereabouts yet i said evasively do you think that he's she did not finish not a bit of it i said as decidedly as i could for to tell the truth i had my grave doubts i have unearthed mr lane and the steward why shouldn't i unearth mr morland too yet if the others were alive why was the yacht so quiet she sighed and then looked over at the couch on which pye sat huddled that man's no use she said contemptuously he's been doing nothing but drink brandy lane crossed over to him the beggar's drunk said he in disdain then you must hold one door and miss morland the other said i but you she paused i am going on another expedition you must let me out and in two knocks will warn you so saying i slipped the bolt and got out on deck from the appearance of the sky i judged that it was only half an hour since i had found myself in the corridor it was light enough to make out things fairly well and now i could discern on the bridge the portly form of holgate struck with this light the figure of a man was visible a little in front of me by the chart house i heard holgate's voice raised wheezily in orders and the replies of the men came back to me inarticulately as i crouched under the shelter of the cabins on the lee side i became aware of a faint but continuous line just over the bulwarks and then the explanation of the mysterious silence on the yacht dawned on me it was the coast line from which we could not be more than a couple of miles away and in the confusion of the fight no doubt the sea queen had lost her course and been driven inshore it had therefore become imperative for holgate to devote his attention and the activities of his men to the danger that threatened more particularly as the heavy wind had threshed itself into a gale abeam now at this juncture i must confess that i was entirely at a loss i could not move a foot across the deck without being discovered since it was merely the fact that i was in the lee of the cabins and in the deeper shadows of the dawn that enabled me to skulk where i was yet i was reluctant to go back without having carried the search a stage further it was obvious from the calm which reigned among the mutineers that the prince and his following were either dead or prisoners which had been their fate the shadow of the man in front of me scarcely a dozen paces away turned and stopped and seemed to put his ear to the woodwork it must be i reflected the chart house door by which he stood what was he listening for was it possible that some of our men were shut up in the chart house i shuffled a step or two nearer and watched him he was fully armed for i could make out a weapon in his hand and he had something by his side probably a cutlass it was probable that he was placed guard over the prisoners i drew two steps closer still holgate's voice still painfully dominated the wind and water and i ventured yet a pace nearer did he turn now the man must see me for i was in the gray light of the dawn a deeper shadow than the wooden walls by which i lurked my hands twitched and i almost seemed to have sprung before i did spring then i knew i was on his back and had a leg twisted about his legs he fell heavily and i thrust a hand across his mouth he struggled hard writhing upon the deck under the weight of my body like a snake and a choking sputter issued from his throat hastily i dragged a handkerchief from my pocket and pushed it into his mouth the struggling increased i glanced up and found that we had fallen under the door of the chart house also in that same glance i observed that the key was in it no doubt it had been turned on the outside i reached up a hand but missed the key by a few inches the endeavour had loosened my hold of my prisoner and i was flung against the door with a thud but i hurled myself upon him again just in time to prevent him from withdrawing the gag in the struggle which ensued i managed to push him a little closer under the door and then with a desperate effort stretched out and turned the key i was fumbling for the handle when the man once again evicted me from the possession of his body and i fell in a heap jamming the door which opened outwards but on that i was aware that my back was being jarred and scored and the next instant i was tumbled over at the foot of the mutineer who had got on his legs at last the door was thrust open with a noise and men issued from it stepping over my body it is i phillimore i gasped run for the cabins some one helped me to my feet and i saw the mutineer drop with a sword point through him and then we ran i between two of the others one of whom i was conscious was ellison a shout sailed down to us from the bridge and there was the noise of a revolver shot but luckily it missed us and we gained the companion way in safety locked and barred the door and knocked on the entrance to the corridor lane opened it his royal highness by gum he cried excitedly and for the first time i was able to recognise my companions the prince was there safe and scathless and with him barraclough ellison and a fourth man who was grant princess alix rushed on her brother and was taken to his arms he kissed her affectionately yvonne he said she is safe said the princess withdrawing herself she it safe dear but frightened she spoke in german and he nodded ah she would be frightened it is no woman's work this alix we must be tender with her we have done our best she replied i thought a little coldly and at that a door down the corridor opened and mademoiselle herself appeared frederic she cried ecstatically and hastened towards us with graceful movements ah frederic it is cruel to leave me so i wish i were back in paris oh mon dieu what a voyage what a ship as they embraced i turned my head away for this reunion of lovers was no sight for public eyes and as i did so i swept the princess in my vision her face had fallen dead and chill and i thought that a little curl of her lips betrayed some impatience with these demonstrations meanwhile barraclough was narrating in his deliberate way the adventures of the party but i cut him short only asking one question where is legrand they took him up and carried him forward but i couldn't say if he were dead we have no time to lose i said they may attack at any moment and we have too much space to defend for comfort why we can manage this well enough said he easily and be starved said i no we must keep the access to the saloon and the kitchens and that means precautions look at the windows through which we may be approached dr phillimore is right said the prince in his deep voice we must guard the windows we must close them said i grant you can use tools ellison you and grant do what you can there is plenty of woodwork to draw on doors and trappings in the cabins the portholes are useless to the mutineers but they can enter by the skylights or the windows they must be all barred we are in a state of siege you hear your orders said the prince in his imperious voice the doctor speaks sense see that it is done barraclough and lane and the prince himself were left on guard and the rest of us sallied down to hunt for tools and timber to carry out this primitive fortification in this we had the assistance of the steward jackson and the cook who had been discovered in one of his pantries the work took us a full hour or more but at last it was decently accomplished the windows of the saloon and music room that gave on the deck were shuttered as also the windows of the cabins nothing but the skylights remained unprotected and these we could trust ourselves to guard i reckoned that we were in a position to stand a siege indefinitely unless something untoward occurred the fortifications completed we stationed our guards two in the corridor two in the saloon and sat down at last wearied out with the fatigue of that abominable night chapter ix the flag of truce we were not interrupted during all this time and from the sound of the screw we could tell that the yacht was still ploughing her way but clearly it was not now for buenos ayres at six we took some food prepared by the cook and considered the position with more equanimity counting the cook who had not been reckoned in our previous numbering we were now reduced to a party of ten men if pye could be accounted a man after his cowardly behaviour there were six sailors in the hold at present useless and the mutineers even after their losses were not far short of thirty of legrand we knew nothing but could only hope for the best so long as we could hold the saloon we had plenty of food and water and our stock of ammunition was ample the outlook did not appear so bad only on the other side we had to remember that holgate had the ship and could go whither he wished even if coal failed him he had the auxiliary power of the sails our main hope was to hold out until his provisions should be exhausted and he should be obliged to put into some port then would come the hour of reckoning for we were probably better supplied with provisions than was the forecastle the ladies breakfasted in their cabins but the prince was present at our common table showing a right democratic attitude we are all in a common peril gentlemen he said with spirit we must not make differences but there must be discipline he added there was therefore a certain camaraderie reigning which had been foreign to the yacht before and lane gave way to his native garrulity enlivening the table by some anecdotes at which even barraclough condescended to smile my hat cried the purser suddenly slapping his flank they've not got what they fought for and we've none of us thought of it there was a pause it was true none of us had thought of it we had been too busy thinking of other things are you sure said i lane rose let's go and see said he but i've all the keys and i'll swear no one came down in the neighbourhood of the strong room while i was there we trooped down prince and all and it was as the purser had said the safes were untouched barraclough elevated his eyebrows the fools he commented well it doesn't seem to me quite that said i slowly it only looks as if holgate was certain what do you mean he asked and they all looked at me why if he did not take the trouble to touch this he cannot be in a hurry i never came upon a man with a cooler head he's not in a hurry that's a fact it's been deliberate all through from the very moment we left the thames we looked at each other now jerusalem said lane what a savage he's made sure of us then he can wait his time i said he has waited and can wait longer the ship's in his hands you take a gloomy view sir observed the prince with a frown well mr morland i replied drily i don't think we're here to glaze matters over we've got to face things and one of these things is that holgate hasn't worried us since he got possession how are you going to account for that save on my hypothesis they shall be hanged every one he exclaimed angrily the german accent emerging roughly now well we'll do our best sir i replied lightly i shut the strong room door and lane locked it and as i turned i saw the white face of pye in the background he had been missing from breakfast and he looked very sickly very pale and very much abashed the prince noticed him too and addressed him sharply why are you here sir what do you mean by leaving your quarters i will have discipline kept on this ship i have no quarters pleaded pye humbly i was feeling sick and lay down in my bunk you shall get to your quarters now sir declared the prince severely sir john order this man to his post the little man was so downcast and was obviously so unwell that i took pity on him and cheered him as he went upstairs never mind pye i said we'll pull through he shook his head ah it isn't that he said but i disgraced myself doctor i'm not built that way it was awful awful he shuddered yes we'll get our little tum tums full of it now i guess remarked lane cheerfully you freeze on to your barker boy you'll need it before we fetch up at albert docks again it's execution docks for some of us i'll lay have a cigar doctor i accepted but pye refused turning a sallow hue his nerves had not yet recovered and he had certainly drunk a good deal of brandy ellison and jackson were on watch below and when we reached the corridor grant signalled us in a whisper from his peep hole some one coming along this way sir barraclough sprang to his side by heaven it's holgate damn him he said with a flag of truce open that door said the prince evenly grant turned the key and drew the bolt and the door fell ajar holgate's big form was stationed before it and he waved a flag a truce gentlemen he said wheezily i looked at the prince and barraclough for the answer and to my amazement saw that the former had his revolver at the level his finger was on the trigger i leaped forward and struck it up and the bullet buried itself in the walls of the cabin what do you mean sir he thundered turning on me savagely how dare you mr morland said i you spoke of discipline a little ago well how do you keep it this is my ship he said furiously yes said i and it is in the charge of sir john barraclough here who will tell you perhaps that it is against the laws of equity not to say common sense to fire on a flag of truce sir john looked uneasy the doctor is right sir he said we ought to hear what he's got to say he is a villainous murderer i will see that they are hanged said the prince with a scowl at me but he let his arm fall behind him i could see the princess but her face was averted holgate's figure blocked the doorway if i may come in he said smoothly and you're quite done with your pistol practice gentlemen i should like to make a proposal to you it shall be unconditional surrender sir john barraclough said the prince morosely i will have no other terms you may come in said barraclough shortly holgate edged himself through i claim the protection of this flag said he flatly and looked about him i hope my men haven't knocked you about too much doctor my respects to you you've got a head on you come to business sir said barraclough harshly sir john i've saved your ship and i hope you'll lay that to my credit said holgate in his leisurely voice i found her drifting on a lee shore when i took charge and by thunder she'd have floundered in another half hour so whatever you set on one side of the ledger there's that lump on the other we're not here to talk about these matters said barraclough sternly excuse me sir john we are said holgate sweetly we're just on that and nothing else it's pretty clear how you stand but if you like i'll rehearse the situation and i want you to understand where i stand see i don't think that's so clear to you and i want ventilation this is a duffing game for his royal highness there he stands to make nothing out of it as things go and there's precious little in it for any of you here you are prisoners in these palatial rooms outnumbered by more than two to one and not a man of his hands among you if i except the doctor well you can hold out i daresay i know all about that you've got a call on the food cupboard and you're welcome to it but i've got the yacht and she'll canter under my hands not sir john's don't you make any mistake you're not in a first class position gentlemen you're a long time coming to the point said barraclough with exemplary curtness we have no time to waste well gentlemen i'm willing to make a deal that's the short of it a deal that will suit both parties that's the pith of the situation he gazed from one to another of us unembarrassed and even with an expression of amiable cheerfulness and my proposal's this unconditional surrender broke in the prince's harsh voice that so says holgate without concern directing a glance at the speaker i guess mr morland you're in this for more than your health so am i but i should like to know before starting whom i've got to deal with just by way of encouragement so to say he paused i don't want to pry into any secrets but it would suit me better if i knew whom to address owing to the unfortunate decease of the late captain day you infernal ruffian you murderer broke fiercely out of lane's throat you'll hang yet by heaven or i'll eat my hat holgate turned his heavy face and still sombre eyes upon the purser but said nothing nor otherwise remarked his outburst it was barraclough who spoke excuse me mr lane this is my affair not yours he said abruptly go on sir to holgate i can wait of course said the mutineer with cool irony there isn't much hurry about the matter now the ship lays her course but i should prefer a business deal with business people and i take it that that means with you sir john barraclough nodded you may address me he said and you will get your answer from me that's all right then and having settled so much this is what i've got to lay before you proceeded holgate placidly breathing out his words there's been a certain amount of pawn taking in this game and we've both got to pass it over if we're coming to business now you know what i want and by this time you pretty well ought to know what you want also you're in a tight fix well if you'll hand over the contents of the strong room we'll get out a proper contract as thus self to take the said contents agreeing therewith to allow his royal highness or mr morland which you will a moiety of the same provided that the party be landed at a suitable place not more than ten miles from a civilised town and provided always that no more be heard of the steps leading up to this contract he came to a pause and eyed us with a gaze divested of any eagerness even of any significance the prince uttered a loud laugh but barraclough as became his position kept his expression i was a little out of the group and i could pick out the faces of the company the princess had moved forward and leaned now with her chin on her open palm and one foot upon the settee near the door she was frankly staring at the mutineer who made these astounding proposals the prince and barraclough conferred in whispers and presently the latter resumed his position if you want the contents of the strong room he said it is suggested that you had better come and take them holgate's eyebrows went up well i could do that of course he said slowly don't suppose i've overlooked that solution of the little problem but i'm dealing with you squarely when i say i'd rather not for why because i don't want any further mess we've slopped about enough for the present and i should say you gentlemen know it he paused again as if to give us an opportunity of revising our decision and once more the prince and sir john interchanged whispers barraclough shook his head vigorously and a frown gathered on his features in the fine light of the skylights princess alix's silhouette stood out and the soft hair on her forehead was ruffled by the breeze she was still gazing at holgate his bull neck turned and he faced towards her and their glances met neither gave way nor winced before the salvos of the other and i had the odd thought that some strange duel was in progress in which the antagonists were that fair woman and that villainous gross man holgate's eyes shifted only when barraclough spoke next if you leave the yacht at the next port or place of call we shall be powerless to prevent you and the men under you said barraclough in a dry formal voice but the mutiny will be of course reported to the british consul at the most accessible port that's a compromise i reckon observed holgate with a grin which showed his fang that's owner and first officer commanding rolled into one and halved or i'm dutch well i'll let it go but i've offered fair terms and i'll tell you frankly that i wouldn't even have offered those had it not been for the doctor he shook his head wagging it at me oh doctor doctor to think what i lost in you why we could have taken our time over the strong room barring your little intervention you're a real daisy and i won't forget it but now it's in the hands of providence it's war sir john i congratulate the double barrelled leaders there's two captains here and that's one too many i only allow one in my quarters all right gentlemen he took up his flag and waddled towards the door good morning i've done what i could don't blame me on the threshold he paused and his glance marched deliberately over us all landing at last upon the princess may the lord help you says he in his voice of suet may the lord be merciful to you all the door went behind him with a snap i turned almost unconsciously in that direction in which the last shafts of his eyes had flown the accent on the all had been perceptible princess alix had lifted her chin from her hand and set down her foot she held on to the arm of the settee and i could perceive her trembling her face had gone white like paper and she stared at the closed door i moved quickly towards her for i was a doctor if i had no other right there my arrival broke upon her thought she started and the colour flowed back slowly into her face that man is the most awful man i have ever seen she said with a shudder he is not so awful as he thinks i said encouragingly she shook her head and moved away i followed her if i might suggest i would advise you to take a rest i said you have had a most trying night yes i will rest she returned with a sigh and then as we walked down the corridor together i thought you were right when you spoke to to my brother in regard to the revolver but now i don't know i think anything that would rid the world of such a monster is justifiable perhaps i replied but he is making war and we are on terms of war and more or less bound by them at least that is one's general notion but who can tell the ethical boundaries and the borders of honour are indefinable and intangible i think i would have shot him myself she said vehemently i hope we shall hang him yet i answered she looked at me out of her blue lustrous eyes as if deliberating we depend a good deal on you dr phillimore she said next we are all dependent on one another said i do you suppose that man meant what he said she asked no i said i would distrust every statement of his i can't determine what was in his mind or what he is aiming at but this i know that to make a compact with him would be to be at his mercy he is ruthless he would not consider what blood he shed and besides he has committed himself too deeply and is no fool to ignore that she sighed again i am glad she murmured i thought perhaps that it would be wise but my brother would never consent only i was afraid but i am glad it would have been of no use that makes only one course possible only one i said gravely we came to a pause by the door of the cabin i think i had better see to mademoiselle i said in case of emergencies yes please she said with a start and opened the door of the boudoir mademoiselle clad in a wonderful dishabille was seated under the electric light engaged in a game of dominoes with her maid and just threw a glance at us as we entered there tenez la la she said excitedly and marked her board and scrambled up the dominoes in a heap juliette has won never she cried in her broken english i have won three times where is frederic ma cherie he is not fighting non there is no fighting now yvonne replied the princess with admirable restraint as seemed to me frederic is well oh but the noise in the night she rattled on in her own tongue it was dreadful i could not sleep for the guns it was abominable to mutiny ah it is the doctor pardon this light is not good and they have boarded up the windows we must live in darkness she added peevishly but how are you doctor you have not been to cheer us lately it is a dull ship why we consider it pretty lively mademoiselle i answered lightly it keeps us occupied ah yes she laughed but that is over now and you will only have to dispose of the prisoners to guillotine no to hang it is we who are prisoners said the princess abruptly mademoiselle stared mon dieu prisoners oh but it is not so alix juliette shuffle or i will box your ears silly whose prisoners are we the anterooms mademoiselle are cut off from the rest of the ship i explained are you prepared to stand a siege oh but we have gallant defenders enough she said with her pretty laugh i am not afraid it will be experience juliette open open stupid do not stare at monsieur like a pig play i passed on the princess following me when i left her she was in tears she said in a low voice she may be in tears again i said but at present she wants no help from me she suffices entirely for herself our eyes encountered and i am sure of what i saw in hers if we met on no other ground we met on a curious understanding of mademoiselle i took my leave ceremoniously chapter x legrand's wink as i went down the corridor the figure of little pye sprang out upon me from somewhere doctor he said in a piteous voice i stayed doctor i'm very ill i'm just awful i looked at him closely the flesh under his eyes was blue the eyes themselves were bloodshot and his hands shook i felt his pulse and it was racing you're in a blue funk pye said i severely he groaned anything i'll admit anything doctor but for heaven's sake let me go down to my bunk i'll pull together there i'll swear it you'll go down and drink too much i said not if you'll give me something there must be lots of things he pleaded i've never seen i'm not fitted for this oh doctor i've only lived in a street before a suburb tulse hill think of that his voice cracked and with the ghost of his favourite trick his fingers quavered with the glasses on his nose i took a pity for the creature a pity in which there was naturally some disgust very well i said go down and i'll make it all right i'll pay you a visit later he thanked me and scuttled away like a rabbit and i sought barraclough and explained ill said he well if he's ill he's ill enough to count i said he's in a dead funk and about as much use as a radish barraclough's nose wrinkled in smiling contempt better make him steward and promote jackson he said he's part of a man at any rate they'll be on us before we know where we are do you think so i asked well to say the truth holgate puzzles me why did he make that offer because he'll find it infernally difficult to get in here said barraclough easily because it's a frontal attack all the way and a costly business if it's a case of half the party going to glory they'll look out for a cheaper way first that's why you may be right i answered but holgate isn't exactly particular and anyway i want to find out find out he echoed in surprise well holgate used a flag why shouldn't i in my turn i asked he screwed up his mouth well i don't know said he i won't say you nay but look here there's risk phillimore you say holgate isn't particular to put it plain he's a black hearted swine you couldn't put it too plain i replied but i have my notion and i may not be wrong he's black enough god knows but i think i've gauged him a little why didn't he push the assault why doesn't he now no holgate's not all plain and easy it's not like reading print i'm hanged if i know what he's up to but whatever it is it's bad and somehow i feel my way along this and i don't think he'll do any harm at present call it faith call it instinct call it superstition if you will he bit his moustache doubtfully you're on duty in an hour he objected i'll be back before i answered and another thing barraclough there's legrand oh they'll want a doctor that's true well god bless you said he placidly yielding and unlocked the door i had provided myself with a flag and now emerged upon the deck clasping it in one hand i walked past the barred windows of the music room and saloon and past the smoking room beyond until i was level with the chart house i was on the windward side of the yacht and she was heeling gently as she ran down the coastline under a full head of steam above me i could discern also the white spread of her wings and from the look of the long white water that leaped and fell off her sides in a welter i guessed that we must be footing it to a pretty tune if poor mccrae had been right in estimating her rate at eighteen knots she could not be making much less than sixteen now the sails were full of noise and the wind rattled and sang in the ventilators the first sight that struck me as i came back square with the bridge was a man swinging in a travelling cradle and leisurely painting the funnel it seemed so peaceful an occupation and so strangely out of accord with those terrible transactions of the night that i stared in wonder then my eyes went to the bridge and marked something more in keeping with the situation for the bridge had been boarded about in the rear and sides with a wall of timber so that the helmsman and the man in charge holgate or another were invisible from the deck below as also from the hurricane deck i suppose that this structure had been put together in memory of the prince's prowess and of his ruthless performances from the hurricane deck i advanced to the end of the deck and hailed the forecastle waving my flag is mr holgate there i called out i wish to see him and again i waved my flag a man came into the open on the deck below and stared up at me and presently after he was joined by another whom i recognised as gray they exchanged words and i knew also from a sound overhead that some one was peering at me from the bridge once more i called out for holgate brandishing my flag vigorously and then i heard holgate's voice below hold on doctor he emerged into my line of vision and with him was pierce his lank red face upturned to me his lower jaw in its socket gray gesticulated indicating me and holgate stood passively looking at me suddenly the ex boatswain put his hand in his pocket pulled out a revolver and presented at me it was the work of a moment holgate struck his arm up and the bullet whizzed past me and banged into the chart house steady there doctor said holgate glad to see you just in time wasn't i step along down there i moved towards the ladder and descended to the lower deck where holgate met me difficult to keep our respective men in hand isn't it doctor he said with a quizzical look but i won't have any firing on a flag of truce any more than you you and i keep to the code of honour i could have sworn that the piece of comedy which had just been performed had been his i knew for certain now that it was his jest this crude and savage joke that was on the margin of tragedy and might have gone over the border but what would he care this infamous man of astute intelligence cold cunning and ruthless determination his eyes twinkled and he laughed now so as to disclose his abominable fang we are now quits eh doctor he said his royal highness would have had me but for you and now pierce yonder would have potted you but for me i like honourable warfare he chuckled well said i cheerfully for i was resolved to take him in his own way then the prince's offence is wiped out he is forgiven oh there's nothing to forgive about the prince says holgate indifferently i don't want him i want his safe what's a prince or two he looked at me narrowly shall we get to business changed your minds there's not the slightest chance of that i answered you may set that on record say i will said he unexpectedly turning and called out pierce gray come here just listen to the whoop our cockerels give up there now doctor spit it out i have nothing to add to my statement that there is no chance of any terms i said sharply think of that observed holgate to the others they don't know what's good for them well let 'em alone doctor let 'em stew in their juice they'll come round in a brace of shakes after a little argument let's say gray guffawed and pierce grinned his thin face puckering to his eyes an unpleasing sight it was clear who was master here holgate commanded by the sheer force of his individuality and his coolness well to what do we owe the honour of this visit went on holgate easily come to borrow some of our provisions strikes me you're a bit fond of the forecastle we shall have to make room for you got room for a little one inside pierce the joke sent gray off again but i was aware that this gross fooling was as much a piece of acting as had been the feint of shooting at me he was playing to an audience and that audience a gallery that dealt only in crude fun why did he do it what was his object he puzzled me but i made answer very plainly you know my profession mr holgate we had a second officer i paused have he corrected mildly have not of course on active service resting let us say gray giggled his master was as good as the clown in a circus to his tickled ears holgate looked at me there's nothing much the matter with legrand he went on save natural chagrin and a crack on the head you see i got him just so he put both hands together in a comprehensive gesture and it interfered with his vertebrae but better see him doctor better see him and while you're about it we've got a job or two more for you i followed him as he spoke towards the forecastle deck and soon was busy in my professional capacity holgate chatting the while very wheezily in my ear and when i had finished he had the hatch opened and i descended to the prisoners i'm accompanying you doctor explained holgate not because i'm going to spy on you that would be mean and not in the game but as a guarantee of good faith as one might say you see i feel responsible for you and if some one with an imperfect sense of honour say like the prince should take it into his head to clap hatches on you where would my reputation be he smiled took a lamp from one of his men and descended after me the prisoners were standing or squatting moodily about in that small compartment of the hold which was otherwise almost empty and lying on his back with his face turned towards us was the second officer his eyes gave no indication that he was aware of my presence though they were wide open and i confess i was alarmed to see his condition it looked like death i felt his pulse and examined him and all the time his eyes were on me unwavering his high colour had fallen away and his face was now spotted with unhealthy blotches on a pallid skin i pressed my fingers to the back of his neck puzzled and as i did so my body came betwixt holgate with the light and legrand it seemed to me that now the eyes moved and i could have declared that one of them closed sharply and opened again but at the moment holgate shifted his position the eyes were again dull and vacant i drew in my underlip and stood up looking at the mutineer a heavy crack said i well i suppose he came down rather nastily said holgate unperturbed i'm sorry i bear legrand no grudge he was a good navigating officer it looks like brain lesion i said but i should like to examine more carefully welcome doctor welcome said he cheerfully always welcome so long as i command this ship fly a flag and i'll see there's no reigning princes about i'm the only prince here you may take my word for that i thanked him coolly and giving the prisoners some directions for the care of legrand climbed to the deck as i left the lower deck with the suave compliments of holgate in my ears i had two things in my mind to ponder in the first place there was the mystery behind the chief mutineer what ailed him that he had made no attack on our weak garrison and had the deviation of the yacht's cruise been an adequate reason for leaving the strong room untouched again when he had offered terms had he not known that we could not accept them and why had he conducted himself with such easy insolence as to prevent us from accepting them had we been disposed to do so this problem frankly baffled me but the other thought was more consolatory i was convinced that legrand was not much injured and i guessed that he was shamming that he had winked at me to convey his real case seemed obvious my heart rose at the thought for it had been downcast heaven knows but it was something to feel that we had allies forward in the heart of the enemy even if they were at present under hatches i had faith somehow in legrand a silent forcible man and i entered the staterooms with cheerfulness oddly enough the note with which i was received bore some relation to that cheerfulness for i was admitted to the tune of tremulous laughter it was ellison who let me in but the laughter did not proceed from him half way down the corridor was sir john in animated conversation with mademoiselle at least the animation was on her part for he was decorously stolid and favoured me with a nod managed it then phillimore good for you he said with amiable patronage i though it was all up when i heard that shot but mademoiselle put her money on you ah was i not right she asked archly in her pretty english i know the doctor he is an old friend of mine she was dressed in a smart morning gown somewhat open at the throat and her admirable voice seemed to encompass us in its sympathy one could not but feel pleased and flattered by her faith i smiled i am glad to say that legrand's safe but hors de combat i went on perhaps not for long we may have a surprise in store for us at any rate holgate does not know everything he's a little too clever to my mind oh i wish they were all hanged and dead broke out mademoiselle with an impatient gesticulation they will be in due time said barraclough tell me sir john tell me doctor is there any danger she asked vivaciously sir john was ever deliberate and i anticipated him none or very little at present i think ah she beamed on us both then you shall have time to play with me do you play breedge sir john i turned away for it was time to relieve lane in the saloon chapter xi the lull when you consider how i had parted from the prince his subsequent conduct must be regarded as creditable after my watch i fell dead asleep in my bunk and might have slept till night had it not been for the sense of discipline possessed and exhibited by his royal highness he visited me in person and did me the honour to arouse me from my dreamless slumber whereat i sat up cursing it is natural you should feel irritated dr phillimore said he calmly but when you come to yourself you will perceive that duty must be performed it is your watch oh ah i blurted forth you must excuse me sir but i have had a night of it he nodded amiably if you will come to my cabin after your watch he observed i shall have something to say to you i do not know that i looked forward to the interview with any interest i expected some censure of my conduct earlier in the day and i was resolved to defend myself but the prince proved mild and even amiable he offered me a cigar and condescended to discuss some points of policy with me i have been told said he that you have been in the forecastle and have seen mr legrand you think that there is some chance of his joining us well it is good hearing i have no doubt that we shall succeed in destroying the traitors mr morland said i leaning forward to him i would not like to leave you in the thought that this is going to be easy oh no it will not be easy he agreed but plainly he was confident that it was possible which i was not if there was any one in that ship that doubted it was i i said nothing however but remarked that holgate was a man of resource and capacity i am willing to believe that he said after a pause he is a very clever scoundrel oh yes we might be in a better position to counter his plans if we fathom them i suggested he looked at me interrogation in his blue eyes which were and were not so like his sister's the question that puzzles me sir is why holgate did not seize the saloon and the deck below last night when he had the chance for down there is what he wants he had us locked up in the chart house replied the prince with assurance he did not anticipate that we should escape and the yacht was running into danger yes that was the explanation that had occurred to me indeed it was the explanation that hitherto we had all accepted but was it true it was his intention to possess himself of the papers at his leisure continued prince frederic smoking and gazing at me with the air of a preceptor instructing a pupil why should he i asked bluntly the prince smiled pleasantly i will tell you dr phillimore he answered when i left london and europe for good i instructed my lawyers to put my property into three forms of goods drafts on bankers bank of england notes and english currency each kind would be of service to me whose destination was not quite settled but these would make a bulky load for any man there is a large amount of specie and is it not the bank of england that says 'come and carry what gold you will away in your pockets provided you give us l' well there is that difficulty for these villains but i objected do they know how the treasure is made up he cast a dark glance at me i have told you he said i trust such as you in my service doctor but there has been treachery who i am and what i carry became known how i cannot say but it was treachery the whole thing is a conspiracy he cried hammering on the table and it may be that my enemies in hochburg are at the bottom of it i will find out but see you doctor i am mr morland here and hereafter let that be understood and it is as mr morland i will hang these ruffians his frown knit his eyebrows closely and his nostrils heaved while the blue eyes were fired with sudden flame if he had ideas on democracy as reports of him had declared he had also beyond question the temper of the martinet it was possible no doubt to recognise these strange contradictions but at the first sight it seemed difficult i had yet to learn that i was dealing with a type of the fanatic and a representative of that type moreover who exemplified in his blood the fatalism of his ascendants yet the glimpse i had of the man was interesting i began to understand him and even to sympathise with him he had foregone much for the sake of an ideal and that was something but just then i should like to have known exactly what his sister's attitude to that ideal might be for princess alix strange as her brother was was even more baffling than he though we kept a rigid watch all that day and night no attack was delivered and i began once again to speculate as to holgate's policy was he trying to tire us out before he made his assault or had he other ends in view the second day passed as tranquilly as the first and the yacht was still making her best southward she had passed the mouth of the rio la plata and was forging along the argentine coast bound for we knew not whither her destination was in other hands and we must be content to abide the issues alert and equipped for any emergency on the second day i revisited the forecastle with my flag and found holgate as amiable as before you give me your word doctor that you have no weapons said he when i had attended to his wounded men and was proceeding to the hold where the prisoners lay i give you my word i replied he nodded and gave orders for the removal of the hatch and down i went this time unaccompanied legrand still lay on his back staring vacantly and the sailors were grouped about a despondent company in that dark and stuffy hole any improvement said i to one of them not much sir said he with a glance towards the open hatchway where no doubt one of the mutineers stood on guard does mr legrand take any nourishment i asked a bit sir but not too much he doesn't seem to relish his food the man answered does he talk i asked he has spoken about a dozen sentences sir but there don't seem much sense in them ah i feared as much i said i was certain that holgate for all his lordly air of unconcern had taken steps to know what was forward in the hold i made another examination and was the more convinced that there was nothing seriously the matter with legrand this time he frankly grinned in my face as i laid him down no doubt the sailors were in his secret and primed for it i daresay i shall have to operate i said and bidding them farewell i ascended to the deck holgate waved his hand cheerily at me always glad to see you doctor he called out and went on with the conversation in which he was engaged i could have whipped myself that i could not guess what his crafty design was but if i was ignorant no one was likely to assist me barraclough had no views all that his purview compassed was the probability of an immediate fight to which he looked forward with unconcern lane was ridiculously inept in his suggestions one of which involved the idea that holgate desired to bag ladies and treasure with one gun this suggestion irritated me and i snubbed him so far as any one could snub lane the prince i knew was secure in his obstinate conviction and naturally ellison had no views any more than barraclough they were both very excellent examples of pure british phlegm and unimaginativeness this seemed to cast the burden upon me for pye was still confined to his cabin the little man was undoubtedly shaken by the horrid events he had witnessed and though he was confessedly a coward i could not help feeling sorry for him he was an abject creature now and clung to his bunk keeping out of the prince's way and barraclough's as much as possible and pestering me with his consultations i believe i should be better doctor if we were to get into warmer weather he said pleadingly cold does affect a man's nerves doesn't it well you'll have to make love to holgate if you want that said i drily we're at his mercy we were all i think conscious of that if we did not always openly acknowledge the fact yet it was astonishing that no attack was made on the state rooms holgate had promised it and had even struck the shadow of deeper terrors during the concluding words of his interview in the corridor but things went on peacefully the sun rose in blurred heavens of blue and grey and declined into rolling waters and no event of consequence took place the bells were sounded as of old the wheelman in his armoured turret steered the yacht upon her course and every day the sea queen drew southward under the ordinary maritime routine were it not for our memories and for the outward facts of our predicament we might have fancied ourselves merely upon a pleasant excursion there was however this lacking that no one knew our destination the secret was locked in holgate's bosom or perhaps he shared it with one or more of his desperadoes and as if to lull us into a sense of security and to persuade us that all was normal mademoiselle suddenly developed and exhibited a remarkable liveliness she was a thing of moods and impulses restrained by no reason or consideration for others so far as i could judge and having once got the better of her hysteric fear of the mutiny she promptly discarded any thought of it we were prisoners in our part of the yacht it is true but that did not interfere with our comfort we had food and wine to spare we were supplied with every luxury and no one gave us any trouble the guards were set regularly but mademoiselle had no concern with that i doubt if she even recognised that such precautions were taken there was a certain romance in the situation which appealed to her and inflamed her imagination she lived most of the day in her cabins being tired by her maid or playing dominoes or some other childish game and in the afternoon she emerged upon us a glorious figure in fine clothes and gave us the benefit of her society naturally she spent much of her time in company with the prince and his sister but barraclough and myself were by no means denied her favours barraclough spoke french very indifferently as indifferently indeed as mademoiselle spoke english but that did not prevent them from getting on very well together as i have explained barraclough was a tall handsome fellow lean and inflexible of face with the characteristic qualities of his race his eyes admired the lady profoundly and he endeavoured to keep pace with her wits a task rendered difficult by the breaches in two languages this vivacity was crowned by exhibitions of her voice to which she began to treat us she had as i remembered a wonderful mezzo soprano and being pent up in this comfortable prison and denied access to the promenade she used it to effect as i have said the music room surrounding the saloon below as a balcony was in our suite if i may put it in that way and thither was mademoiselle accustomed to repair of an afternoon to keep her voice in practice as she explained the prince usually followed her there and i have seen him more than once seated in the dimness of the farthest corner of the balcony staring before him as a man lost in thought or as one rapt out of himself into some sentimental ecstasy at the sounds of that divine music here we felt more or less that we were in liberty hall and to do him justice prince frederic encouraged us to feel this it was understood that the saloon was open to all and it became a resort for such of us as were off duty in those days a resort that would have been improved by more light for the windows were all barred and shuttered and only the skylights admitted the day the weather was now grown much colder for we were off the coast of patagonia and holgate appeared to be bent on doubling the horn and getting into the pacific in the wilds of that wide domain there would be more chances for this crew of scoundrels to find refuge and security from the arm of the law was it for this he was waiting and yet that was no argument against an immediate attack for it was clear that he might get the business over deal with us as he chose and make for his destination afterwards and at his leisure nor could it be that he doubted as to the issue of the struggle for his forces outnumbered ours greatly and if i knew anything of men holgate was utterly without fear but on the other hand he had a great deal of discretion the only conclusion that emerged from these considerations was the certainty that in the end holgate had decreed our fate that had been settled when day fell perhaps even before that and when poor mccrae was shot by his engines we were doomed to death if any doubt as to our fate dwelt in princess alix's mind she did not show it she was a girl of spirit and energy and she had neat hands thus her time was spent in such work as she deemed useful in the circumstances or such as occupied her mind healthily she made a handsome fur cap for herself against the biting wind which now came snapping off the icy highlands of the coast and she sketched and designed and photographed above all she was cheerful and self reliant there was not much in common between the brother and the sister save perhaps their aloofness from strangers i questioned much if the princess had any of her brother's sentimentality she had all her brother's decision and fire however as i was to see exemplified more than once it was on the third of our quiet afternoons that i was sitting in the corridor with a volume in my hand conscious merely of the many sounds in that silence and scarcely aware of what i read the voyage seemed to partake of the nature of that fabled voyage of the ancient mariner some strange doom hung over us all and yet the sky smiled as it did that moment and the cold breath of the blue sea was inspiring in one's nostrils like wine in the blood i was aware in this dream that a door had opened and shut and that the princess had come into the corridor she sat on a chair not far from me and plied her needles in a way that struck me now as i roused myself as very homely and pleasant i shot a glance at her she was very simply dressed in what for all i know may have been a very extravagant fashion she had the knitted waistcoat she was making i concluded for her brother across her knee and i had a full view of her as she swayed and moved about her task those flowing lines that sweet ripeness the excellent beauty of her face impressed me newly she met my glance and smiled what do you find interests you dr phillimore she asked in her pleasant voice i was reading or pretending to read a book of poems i answered poems she replied plying her needles and then in a little it is strange you should be reading poems and i knitting here it puzzles me said i i rose and went to the window behind her which was not shuttered and for the light from which she had seated herself there the crisp sparkle of the sea rose to eyes and ears when i turned princess alix had ceased from her work and was looking towards me you wonder why she asked i have made many guesses but have never satisfied myself yet why the mutiny is not pushed to its logical conclusion which would mea she said thoughtfully which would mean i interrupted quickly the possession of the treasure there was something deeply significant in her gaze something that was brave and appealed and winced at the same time she went on slowly with her knitting he is waiting his time she remarked in a low voice he will wait too long i said with a little laugh do you think so she asked and laying down her work went to the window as i had done it is cold we are off an icy shore i said yes i found it on the map this morning she nodded we are close to the straits of magellan at that moment the sound of the piano sailed through the door at the end of the corridor she turned her head slightly and then moved away restlessly she went to the chair on which i had been sitting and picked up my tennyson i know him pretty well she remarked turning the pages she halted where i had inserted a marker 'the princess' she said slowly she drummed her fingers on the leaf read for a minute or two and dropped the book lightly we have no literature in comparison with yours dr phillimore but we have sometimes done better than that oh not than the lyrics i protested lightly ask me no more the music from without broke into louder evidence and she turned frowning towards the door do you know dr phillimore she asked hesitatingly if mr morland is in his room he went after lunch i answered she stood considering mademoiselle has a beautiful voice i said tentatively oh yes she assented it is of good quality and training her tone was curt as if she were unwilling to continue the conversation but she still listened einsam wandelt dein freund im fruehlings garten it seemed to me that i could almost hear the words in that uplifted music the song has always been a passionate fancy of mine beguiling the heart of rock to romance sentiment is on wing in every corner of one's consciousness when that song rises in its fulness and falls in its cadences on one's ears and deeper senses in der spiegelnden fluth in schnee der alpen strahlt dein bildniss i could see mademoiselle trebizond at the piano with the vision of the mind her soul enrapt her features transfigured she was a figment of the emotions and the princess and i listened she with a little dubitating look of perplexity paying me no heed now and i singularly moved i walked down the corridor past where princess alix stood and as i went by i could have put out my arm and drawn her to me she was wonderful in her beauty and her pride deutlich schimmert auf jedem purpur blaettchen but i went by and opened the door that gave upon the saloon stairs instantly the flood of music rolled into the room in a tide and glancing back i saw the princess stir she came towards me a voice is a beautiful machine she said uncertainly as the notes died away i could not answer but she may have read an answer in my eyes she passed me just as the singer broke into something new and entered the music gallery a shaft of light struck out her figure boldly i walked round to the second door at the head of the stairs right away in the corner was mademoiselle and by her sir john barraclough lounged on the sofa stroking his moustache uneasily but my eyes lingered on the two not at all for they were drawn forthwith to another sight which filled me with astonishment the barriers had been removed from several of the windows the windows themselves were open and i could discern the figures of men gathered without on the deck with an exclamation i ran forward interrupting the mellifluous course of schubert's serenade and barraclough started to his feet what is it he asked abruptly mademoiselle turned on her stool and regarded me with curiosity and behind the princess was approaching slowly the windows man said i mademoiselle burst into laughter it was so dark she said prettily i could not see plainly i must always have light when i play and i made sir john open them barraclough fidgeted but turned a cold face on me what's all the fuss about he asked surlily i pointed to the figures which we could see through the open windows well that's my business he said shortly i'm in command and i'm not a fool as he spoke he fingered his revolver oh do not be afraid it is all right said mademoiselle cheerfully see we will have more open i will play them something they are listening to my music it will soothe them she cast a look at sir john from her laughing dark eyes and let her hands down on the keys with a bang breaking into a jolly air of the boulevards stay she cried stopping quickly but i know one of your english tunes suitable for the sea how do you call it tom bolling as she spoke she swerved softly into that favourite air the english words running oddly from her lips 'ere a sheer 'ulk lies poor tom bo olling from the deck came a burst of applause she laughed in delight and winked up at me i can do more with them than your guns she said boldly and was sailing into the next verse when the princess intervened mademoiselle she said in french you are inconveniencing the officers they have much to do mademoiselle turned about angrily and met the princess' gaze she seemed about to fly out in a tempest but as suddenly checked herself leaving only a little frown on her forehead to witness to her annoyance she had been engaged in a little triumph that suited her vanity and she had been called away from it i really do not think there was anything more than that in it not then at any rate she rose you are a tyrant my princess she said and nodding sweetly to barraclough and myself left the gallery princess alix followed her face pale and still more than ever was i convinced that whatever feelings the lady had inspired in the prince his sister was not party to them chapter xii in the saloon i think it was from that hour that i began to get on badly with barraclough it was in his power as acting captain no doubt to remit certain precautions but the remission of those precautions was not to the credit of his head he had been beguiled by the siren and she doubtless by her vanity or her freakishness when she had gone he turned on me what the devil do you want interfering phillimore he demanded i'm in charge here there never was a man so insensate i shrugged my shoulders well it was not my interference that was successful i said curtly he walked abruptly to the window and opened it wider i could not be mistaken as to the bulky form that blocked it nice music captain said holgate's wheezing voice i'll give you just three seconds to quit or i'll put a hole through you you infernal rascal said barraclough savagely raising his revolver oh we're in no hurry said the mutineer cheerfully and moved away i suppose that some gleam of reason prevented barraclough from firing he barred the windows afresh and came back to me why the mischief doesn't he attack he exclaimed peevishly i did not know but i was near guessing just then in point of fact i did guess that afternoon i paid my usual visit to the forecastle and the hold legrand played the same farce with remarkable persistence and i was no longer puzzled by him he was biding his time like holgate and his reasons were obvious holgate's dawned on me just then but some of them only as you shall see during the progress of this narrative he maintained his friendliness inquired civilly after our health and how the ladies bore the seclusion i wish i could make it easier for them but i can't doctor he said amiably he was an abominable liar but i had a certain admiration for his effrontery i was glad i could meet him on his own ground so i answered deliberately of course it would spoil your plans to get the job over he eyed me smiling as how my friend he asked you would rather have us in charge of the treasure than yourself i replied he laughed doctor there's imagination in you as i've always said it's a pity i made that blunder about you not that it matters now well you've nicked it what's the odds you are welcome to the truth now there was a perceptible emphasis on his last word you're not afraid of the attack i said he shook his head not much while we have a common object we're all right i'm afraid of success doctor you've a penetrating eye why the treasure might break us up if you had sent it down to me i believe i'd have sent it back that would have been your best chance i wonder you didn't think of it but you've got your flaws if you'd sent that treasure down i'd have had to take it and you might have sat down and waited on events but it's too late now i know where i am and where's that i asked bluntly he smiled craftily we enter the straits of magellan this extra special night he said let's put it at that and what's to come i asked in the same voice lord one would suppose you in the counsels he said equably and in a way you are well you can hand over that treasure which you have been good enough to guard for me better than i could myself as soon as you will i've no objection now good evening doctor he wheeled about and went off humming a tune but i was staggered that meant if he were not lying again that we were near the end of our tether that the truce was up and that my mind shuddered in its train of thought there was only one possible end for us if holgate was to secure himself and he was capable of any infamy as i looked at his broad back and bull neck i felt rage and hatred gather in me and surge together but i was impotent then and there i went back to our quarters sick at heart it was falling dark when i reached the state rooms and all was as usual the same vacant face of quietude was presented to me in the corridor leaving the two men of whom one was grant on guard i went below to my cabin and as i did so thought to look in upon pye faint shafts of light streamed in by the open port but i could see no one pye i called and received no answer well it was of small consequence to us if pye recovered or not for he was negligible as a unit of our defence but i was glad that the little man had sufficiently resumed what what might be called his manhood to be up and about again maybe i thought with some amusement i should find him airing himself in the corridor or disporting in the music room coming out of my cabin i groped my way along the passage in the direction of the stairs when i reached the foot of them it was quite dark and i stopped arrested suddenly by a murmur of voices from the saloon beyond i knew that some one must be on guard there but i did not quite understand the murmur i hesitated making some inquiries in my mind from the hour i came to the conclusion that barraclough was on duty and i turned and entered the saloon the door of which was ajar is that you barraclough i called my voice penetrated the darkness which was here alleviated by the dull gleam from the port holes i heard a rustling and i was sure it was of a woman's skirts what do you want asked barraclough in a leaden voice oh nothing said i as coldly i only thought i heard voices now what the he pulled himself up sharply for with all his faults and heaven knows i had yet to find how many they were he was a gentleman it is the doctor came in mademoiselle's pretty accents oh it is so cold upstairs doctor you must make us some machinery to warm us we shall be colder yet mademoiselle i replied indifferently we shall have the ices of magellan refrigerating us to morrow magellan said barraclough what the mischief does that mean ask mr holgate i answered it's his affair or he thinks it is he has taken it on himself i made my way to the electric light knobs as it seems to be getting dark i said not without irony i will take the liberty of illuminating oh it's none so dark growled barraclough we ought to be used to darkness by this time we're not all children at nurse he sneered palpably i turned the catch but no light came it's gone wrong i exclaimed yes i did try it a little time ago said mademoiselle sweetly when sir john and i were in so deep argument of course it was a lie but what did that matter if i could have seen barraclough's face at that moment i felt sure it would have advertised a sense of shame despite his passivity but mademoiselle well i could see in the dusk the shadow of her face and it was a handsome shadow almost i could see her smile they were seated in the recesses of the saloon i moved towards them i suppose you understand the hang of this sir john i said drily i'm not a patent detective he answered with his arrogant sneer but i paid no heed for i felt sure of settling him then and there i suppose it has occurred to you to reflect on whose grace we have depended for our electric supply i said mildly i know that it comes from the engine room if that's what you mean he replied bluntly and now it's cut off i said there was a pause and it was the lady who broke it what is it that you mean doctor i addressed her the mutineers cut off the light preparatory to an attack you are the most wonderful sleuth hound dr phillimore said barraclough with a hard laugh your talents are quite thrown away i regret to say they are here i answered sharply and where would he be if he had paid some attention to the patent detective i tell you again sir john barraclough that we've got to expect an attack to night and that's why the light is gone a man may endure hostility and defeat he may suffer shame and injustice he may undergo pangs of jealousy and remorse all these things are dispiriting or humiliating but i declare that i would willingly experience them all if i might save myself from the supreme dishonour of appearing in a ridiculous role i had spoken strongly because i felt warmly and there was a note of dictatorial assurance in my voice which might have convinced or at least silenced barraclough but i had left the keys down and to my shocking discomfiture as i finished my declamation the saloon was at a stroke flooded with light the radiance discovered to me mademoiselle's piquante face her eyes smiling her lips full and pouting and close beside her barraclough's fair saxon jowl he grinned at me but said nothing for which perhaps i should have been grateful but i was not but this is in our honour then suggested mademoiselle yvonne prettily i had no fancy for her but i did not mind her little sarcasm i bowed no doubt to celebrate my oratory i said recovering myself but as we do not know how long mr holgate will condescend to continue his compliment we may as well make the most of it you're a cool hand phillimore said barraclough now with the good temper of one who has triumphed but none so cool as holgate i returned him in the same spirit for he has just warned me that his reasons for not attacking us are at an end he regarded me interrogatively holgate is not only a cool hand but a cunning hand a far reasoning hand he has let us take care of his treasure until he was ready for it what do you mean asked barraclough in astonishment his men might have become demoralised if he had seized the safe he has therefore feigned to them that it was not practicable that has been his reason for our security not tender mercy for us you may guess so we have kept his treasure safe and now he wants it why now queried barraclough who frowned that's holgate's secret i suppose he knows what he is going to do and what destination he wants we don't anyway we're turning through magellan to night and he has no further use for us i wish i'd shot that fiend to day said barraclough savagely mademoiselle looked from one to the other a curious expression on her face he is a remarkable man this 'olgate she asked he is pardon mademoiselle the devil said barraclough she laughed her fluting laughter oh but the devil may be perhaps converted she said he may be tamed you say music have powers to tame the savage breast she tapped her bosom dramatically and smiled there is many men that may be tamed she cast a soft glance at barraclough and then at me but i only got the edge of it for at that moment i caught sight of a gray face with little tufts of whisker under the ears and glancing glasses that hung over the railings of the music balcony above it was pye had he been there long in the darkness or had he only just arrived attracted by the light and the voices the latter seemed the more probable assumption for as i looked up he made an awkward movement as if he was embarrassed at being discovered yet if he had been eavesdropping where was the harm but somehow i felt annoyed the others followed my glance but the clerk had gone mademoiselle trebizond sighed and put her small hand over her mouth to hide a yawn it is so what you call dull sir john she protested in her coquettish way nothing but sea sea and not even the chance to go on deck i would sooner have the mutineers oh but it was insensate to leave europe and france no it is a country the most diabolic this side of the ocean what is there under the sea sir john why the fishes mademoiselle said he grinning no no understand me monsieur i mean under the ground what is there she waved her hands sea sea sea nothing else and savages she added thoughtfully they would be interesting i suggested drily she looked at me my good friend doctor you are right she said charmingly more interesting than this company monsieur 'olgate he is interesting is it not we may have an opportunity of judging presently said i lightly mademoiselle got up and peered out of the port holes the glow of the electric light in the luxurious saloon threw into blueness the stark darkness of the evening nothing was visible but through the ports streamed the cadences of the water rising and falling about the hull it had its picturesque side that scene and looked at with sympathetic eyes the setting was romantic whatever tragedy might follow that it was to be tragedy i was assured but this pretty emotional butterfly had no such thoughts why should she have she was safeguarded by the prince of a regnant line she was to be the mistress of millions and she could coquette at will in dark corners with handsome officers she was bored no doubt and when dominoes with her maid failed her she had barraclough to fall back on and there was her art behind all if she had only an audience i began to see the explanation of that astonishing scene earlier in the day she was vain to her finger tips she loved sensations and it was trying even to be the betrothed of a royal prince if divorced from excitements to her vanity after all prince frederic apart from his lineage was an ordinary mortal and his conversation was not stimulating in germany or in paris mademoiselle would have footed it happily as the consort even of a dethroned prince but what was to be got out of the eternal wash and silence of the ocean out of the sea sea sea as she herself phrased it she came back from the port hole it is so dull she said and yawned politely well it was dull but perhaps dulness was more pleasant than the excitements which we were promised with a flirt of her eyes she left us when she was gone barraclough eyed me coldly and steadily you didn't say all you had to say he remarked no i didn't lights or no lights holgate will attack presently i will not pin myself to to night he is where he wants to be or will be soon then he has no use for us i paused women or men good god do you think him that sort of scoundrel he inquired sharply what has he done played with us as a cat with mice oh he's the most unholy ruffian i've ever struck and you know it look at his face no barraclough it's death it's death to every man jack and the women he said hesitatingly i too hesitated no i don't credit him with that he threatened but i don't quite believe yet i don't know no i think it's a question of a terminus for all of us man and woman i paused including your pretty friend there he turned sharply on me but made no remark his eyelids were drawn and heavy and his eyes surcharged he appeared to be under the stress of some severe thought i moved away leaving it at that for it was obvious that he was moved as i reached the door i happened to glance back barraclough stood where i had left him his brows knitted but my eyes passed from him to the gallery and there lighted on mademoiselle who stood with one hand on the railing gazing down at barraclough she had her hand to her heart and her face was white like death but that may have been the effect of the electric light i wondered as i had wondered about pye how long she had been there and if she had heard had she spied on us of a set purpose if so god help her she had taken no good of her eavesdropping a pity for her seized me she was still and silent in the course of my gaze but as i looked the ship heeled her bosom struck the railing heavily and she uttered a tiny cry barraclough glanced up and saw her as i went out a cold blast streamed off the sea and entered the open ports the waters rocked and roared i guessed that we were entering the channel i had made my report to barraclough but i had to report to the prince when i reached his cabin i found him seated before his table engaged in sorting a number of documents he wore glasses which i had never seen on him before and he proffered me a severe frown as i entered i have never to this day rightly assessed the character of prince frederic of hochburg so many odd ingredients entered into it he was dictatorial he was even domineering he was hard working and he was conscientious about these qualities i had already made up my mind but his acts had been wholly in disregard of the rhythmical and regular conventions which he should thus have associated with himself he had broken with his fatherland he had thrown over dynastic laws he had gone by his will alone and no red tape perhaps there was the solution he had gone by his conscience i have said i was convinced of his conscientiousness and possibly in these strange departures from the code of his fathers he was following a new and internal guide to the detriment of his own material interests he had abandoned the essence while retaining the forms of his birth and breeding at least this is but my assumption his actions must explain him for himself i have set down faithfully how he behaved from the first moment i met him let him be judged by that the prince then who had violated the traditions of his house by his proposed alliance was occupied in his accounts that at any rate is what i gathered from the hasty glance i got at the sheets of figures before him well sir said he brusquely i report sir that we have entered the straits of magellan and that we have every reason to look for an attack at any moment i said formally he dropped his pen so he said nodding quite pleasantly it is just as well that it comes doctor we have been too long on the rack it has done us no good i think you are right sir i answered and on the other hand it has been of service to the mutineers he looked perplexed we have taken charge of the safes for them i explained he sat silent awhile and then mechanically curled his moustache upwards yes yes yes he said you are right that then is the reason this man is clever it seemed the echo of what his lady love had said a quarter of an hour before i made no reply as none seemed necessary he went to the barred window in which a gap was open letting in the night and the act recalled again to me mademoiselle was this scion of royalty perishing for an idea he looked very strong very capable and rather wonderful just then i had never been drawn to him but i had at the moment some understanding of what it might be to be the subject of so masterful and unreasonable a man yet now he was not at all unreasonable or even masterful he turned back to me doctor he said gently we must see that the ladies are not incommoded we will all do our best i answered wondering if he knew how inadequate a word he had used incommoded good heavens was my knowledge of holgate to go for nothing what would be the end was the man an idealist he seemed sunk in a dream and i saw his face soften as he stared out at the sea compassion gushed in my heart i turned away chapter xiii the fog my watch ended at ten o'clock and i went direct to my cabin i was a light sleeper and could depend upon awaking at the slightest sound thus i had no fear that i should be wanting in an emergency quite apart from the fact that the steward was stationed at the opening into the saloon with strict orders i suppose it must have been three hours later that i sat up in my bunk with a consciousness that something was wrong i listened but i could hear no sound and i rose to my feet seizing my revolver then i understood it was precisely that there was no sound or rather that sounds had dwindled that i awoke the screw had stopped i opened the door and went along the passage towards the saloon grant was at the foot of the stairs and i hailed him no sir i don't know sir he answered me in respect of my questions well one had to find out at any cost and i ran up the stairs and got access to the corridor of the state rooms here were gathered the prince barraclough lane and the quartermaster i believe he's been on the psnc lane was saying as i came up he ought to be able to pull her through the question is does he want to asked barraclough grimly good heavens who wants to lock his ship in these accursed bilboes cried the purser it's enough to freeze one's hair stiff can you see anything for answer barraclough threw open the door that led upon the deck and it was as if a vent had yawned in the night it was pitch black and what was worse banks of fog rolled along the thwarts lane drew back a step and shivered oh my uncle he exclaimed you do not see any sign of them inquired the prince imperturbably barraclough shook his head if they're coming they'll have their work cut out to find their way he said oh let 'em all come this weather said lane agreeably 'i wish i'd bought ducks' i mean fires he was shivering continuously and i pushed him back don't be a fool said i we want all hands in good form during the next four and twenty hours i peered out of the door but the screen of sea fog shut off the view it was as if i gazed at a blank wall and the cold was intense what do you guess has happened i asked barraclough he's got her in a narrow gut somewhere and is frightened i've only been through here twice in my life and in both cases it was broad daylight this is where they melt fogs for the world oh hang it let's have the door shut he shut it as he spoke and i looked round the prince sat on a sofa and waited lane blew on his fingers and whistled ellison stood the respectful seaman as ever they've been kind about the electric light observed barraclough with a grin at me i said nothing for there was nothing i could rejoin in the circumstances i retraced my way to the door and opened it oh confound it all roared barraclough as the fog rolled in don't you see the ladies are here i turned back but only princess alix was visible she moved white and tall under the lights i shut the door again why has the yacht stopped frederic she asked her brother the fog he answered with a gesture towards the door she looked towards us her upper lip lifted in a charming excitement and the colour flying in her cheeks then she came forward swiftly and even as she did so the sea queen heeled over rolling and trembling from her copper sheathing upwards the shock sent me against the wall and barraclough also staggered princess alix in her flight was precipitated forward and ran upon me she put up her hands instinctively to save herself but in the rush she gathered momentum and swung across the dozen paces between where she had been and the door with the speed of an arrow discharged in the air her palms struck the woodwork with a resounding slap but the full force of her sweet body fell on me for one instant i held her in my arms quite closely her breath upon my face are you hurt princess i gasped oh my hands she cried pitifully and then ceased suddenly she withdrew a little they sting she said also breathlessly but you you must be injured i am a little out of breath i answered but i was never better in my life i cannot say why i blurted this forth somehow i was beyond myself she has struck cried barraclough the sea queen righted herself slowly i can't stand this i said i'm going to find out i glanced at the princess but she stood clinging to the wall her bosom heaving her eyes on barraclough i opened the door and stepping out closed it again behind me i was determined to find out what had happened after all it was not a very hazardous enterprise holgate had shown no disposition to take advantage of my visits to the forecastle and it was pretty clear that no attack was possible at the moment nevertheless i will confess that i experienced a little elation in feeling my way through the dense darkness along the saloon it is not always possible to analyse one's feelings but i think afterwards not at the time i connected this mood with the princess i had held her in my arms her face to mine and i was suddenly exalted to be capable of great things there was nothing i would not have dared then no danger from which i would have shrunk no risk i would not have taken however foolhardy in a sense i walked on air i was lunatic and all because i had held for an instant of time an adorable woman in my arms with no consent of hers i believe now and i hope it will not be counted against me that it was with a little swagger i opened the door and stepped forth into the rolling fog the sea queen stirred a little as if to show she still lived but there was no motion perceptible i had buttoned up my coat round my neck but even so the mists from the ice clad hills on either side of the passage bit hard into me i groped to the chart house and then paused a twinkle of light was visible ahead and aloft it was the bridge i launched myself suddenly into the vacancy before me and went like hoodman blind with arms outstretched towards the railing i struck an iron pillar and guiding myself from it to another reached at last the foot of the ladder that ran up this i mounted very deliberately and carefully until i had come to the bridge itself where a dull light burned by the binnacle instantly i was taken by the throat i struggled with my assailant at a disadvantage as i was unable to reach his face owing to his superior grip of me but i managed to get a leg at the back of his and though the pressure on my windpipe was terrible and i felt that i was weakening fast i threw him back against the railings as i did so a light was thrust into my face and i heard holgate's voice it's the doctor all right pierce hands off man even as he spoke my antagonist loosened his hold and i drew off the relaxed artery jumping in my throat painfully by thunder doctor you were near gone went on holgate in his ruminating voice pierce don't take his fingers off no more than a bull dog when he has once caught on lucky i had a suspicion of you i thought no one would be such a fool as to venture save you glad to see you as always if unexpectedly any news he lighted a cigar as he spoke and the fog was roseate about his head i recovered my breath as best i might as you are reserving us holgate for a destiny of your own i panted and we are not particularly anxious to anticipate it thought i would find out if we are going down he laughed fatly i like you doctor upon my soul i do it's a real pity we couldn't have hit it off no you can sleep calmly there's no going down well not yet i've been through these straits a score of times and in all weathers and i've learned this much that a fog spells the red flag that's all dr phillimore she's got no more than steering way on her and i'll pull her up presently well said i i suppose it matters nothing to us but a wreck is a frightening matter this weather he seemed to be studying me and then laughed all serene if you have made up your mind to your fate there's nothing to be said but i'm in charge here and not sir john barraclough i suppose he has some use but i've not made it out up till now holgate said i suddenly this vessel's in your hands till she's out of the straits if she's ever out i don't deny it but i should like a little further light on destiny so to speak you reckon you can take the safes what more do you want nothing in the world my lad he said comfortably you've hit it nothing in the wide wide world rubbish said i sharply does any one suppose you're going to turn loose witnesses against you he took the cigar from his mouth and though i could not discern his face in the fog i knew its expression well now that's a new idea and not a bad idea he said equably of course i should be running a risk shouldn't i but what's to be done in conflict with a temperament like mine i can't help myself take your oath on one thing doctor and that is i'll die game if the respectable folk whom i take pity on and land somewhere somewhere nice turn on me why i'll die game but of course they won't you know they won't doctor this question was not worth answering indeed i knew it was not meant for an answer it was a palpable gibe i held my tongue but now i knew i should get no information out of this soft voiced ruffian until it suited him to give it our fate was still a mystery if we were beaten in the struggle that was imminent and i could not flatter myself with hopes of our victory i bade him good night for there was no reason to dispense with ceremonies we were still enjoying our armed truce but i had got no farther than the ladder when he hailed me through the gloom i've pitched her to now doctor you can sleep like a babe and the princess too i stopped i knew not why perhaps i had still a faint hope of discovering something that means you will attack i said calmly his figure loomed out upon me in the fog the red cigar end burning in his mouth you don't mean that my lad said he in an easy affectionate tone i'm lancashire born and lancashire bred and i'm shrewd enough to know a bit you don't mean that bless you look ye here doctor go and take your rest and pray god to deliver you from your folly a foolish man you were and that you be you'll die that my lad i fear yet i would give you another chance i liked you when i sat opposite to you in the tavern there ah holgate said i sighing deeply how many weary years ago and your doing i admit that this was theatrical it was designed as such and as a last appeal i was afraid of that man and that is the truth i drew a bow at a venture from the change in the position of the burning edge i gathered that he took his cigar out of his mouth he was perceptibly silent for a time then the light went back well you'll have a sound sleep if you take my advice he said in his normal tones and then a sounder i said lightly you always take too much for granted doctor he replied laughing by the lord i wish i had your forward mind you shall have anything you like of mine directly i said flippantly and began the descent of the ladder i was conscious that he leaned over the barrier of the bridge watching me for i saw the point of his cigar but that was soon swallowed up in the darkness and i saw nothing more the cold was so intense that my fingers had grown numb as i talked with holgate and i could hardly feel the iron moreover my feet were like lumps of ice and seemed to rest on nothing as they met the rungs this i imagine was the reason of my mishap at any rate i missed a rung lost my catch and tumbled heavily down the last three or four steps falling to my surprise not upon the hard deck but upon some warmer softer body remembering vividly and painfully my struggle with pierce i was on my guard and grabbed the man that lay under me for heaven's sake he gasped it's me it's pye i was astounded and relaxed my hold what was the little craven clerk doing there at this time of night and in such weather what i began when he uttered an exclamation of terror as it seemed dr phillimore that is so i answered what on earth are you doing here there was almost a whimper in his voice as he replied the fog doctor i was foolish enough to wander out on the deck and i lost my way i've been straying about for twenty minutes or more i couldn't find the door again well you won't in this direction i assured him this part of the country belongs to the enemy you've strayed afield my friend so if you'll give me your arm i'll do my best to put you straight he thanked me and did as i asked him but as i thought somewhat timorously his hand rested nervously inside my arm as if he would have withdrawn it and fled at a moment's notice and so we stumbled along the deck together to the state cabins i gave the signal on the door and we were admitted by ellison there was no one else in the corridor except lane at the farther end and to my surprise the princess she was seated on a couch under the electric light reading clad in a long and flowing morning gown her hand with the book had dropped a little as we entered and her eyes sought us there will be no alarm to night ellison i said on the spur of the moment and i caught the princess's eye she rose shut her book and came towards us you have come back safely she said in a quick way the fog was the only danger i answered and it nearly did for mr pye you may confide your head to the pillow with a security to night miss morland to night mr holgate is a sailor she did not seem to understand his care is his ship to night i explained you have placed us in your debt she said i do not think my brother knows how much we are indebted to you i looked at pye the praise was pleasant on her lips but i felt a little embarrassed the clerk's eyes were fastened on the princess alix with a certain definite avidity of gaze it was as if some strange animal had suddenly stiffened at the sight of prey and was watching greedily the look repelled me it struck horror to my marrow i could have seized him shaken his miserable little bones and thrown him into a weeping cowardly heap on the floor but as i looked his gaze came round to me and behold it was only the feeble watery eyes behind the gold rimmed spectacles that i saw with a bow to the princess i proceeded on my way to give my report to her brother chapter xiv barraclough takes a hand i did not take holgate's advice although i had instinctively made up my mind that he was sincere in offering it what reason he had for expressing kindliness for me if he had any i could not say i reflected that it might very well be of a piece with his astute plans he might seek to serve some purpose by it i was useful as a doctor attending to his wounded men but i knew enough of him to guess that that alone would not suffice to keep him friendly there must be another reason unless indeed it was as he said and he really had been captivated by my personal charm this solution of the problem was flattering of course but i was not disposed to accept it so deep was my mistrust of the arch schemer that i racked my brain to find an explanation for his conduct this needless to say was not conducive to sleep and i passed a bad night it was profoundly still but towards dawn the screw began to move again and i concluded that the fog had lifted i got up and looked out of the port and could discern dimly the white sheets of the mountains not two furlongs distant the sea queen began to tramp along at a slow pace at first but finally getting speed resumed her normal rate of progress if i knew holgate he was still on the bridge and he would remain there until the danger was over if he was an abominable scoundrel he was indubitably also an admirable seaman with a sense of duty to his ship i fell asleep shortly after that and when i awoke the sun was full up but setting low in the east glittering upon a field of snowy pinnacles i ascended to the state rooms and there found barraclough who had just come on duty he had a cheerful eye and scanned me curiously well are we going to get through this he asked we're going to get out of the straits i believe i answered ah he said and frowned as he was accustomed to do when thinking deeply he was not a man of much thought and after that said he abruptly the deluge said i shrugging my shoulders look here phillimore do you believe we can hold out against holgate's forces he asked seriously i think we shall have to try i replied evasively i'm damned if we can he said bluffly it's all infernal nonsense well we've got to try i repeated impatiently oh well yes we've got to try he admitted unless holgate will hear reason good lord man do you suppose he's risked all this to listen to reason now i asked in amazement barraclough turned away well you see him you ought to know he growled if he doesn't we're done i don't advise you to tell the others that i said drily he turned on me fiercely who said i would he snapped do you take me for a fool and who's captain here dr phillimore i'll have you know your place he cried in a black passion unusual in him i'm commanding officer and responsible to none not even the mr morland by heaven no not on this ship anyway and with that remarkable tempest of unreasonable fury he strode angrily away leaving me annoyed and something abashed assuredly the situation the waiting the suspense had played havoc with all our nerves even with this stolid english gentleman's there was the development in fact as plain as a pike staff this tension had worn on us barraclough lost his temper for inadequate reasons the prince shut himself in his room morosely for i shall come to that presently and lane growled and grumbled so that it was difficult to avoid quarrelling with him indeed it was only by silence that i averted an open collision on more than one occasion little pye was as nervous as a hen a sound set him jumping as i came up the stairs noiselessly i encountered him and his whole body started good gracious man said i with good humoured contempt you'll be skipping away from your own shadow next how do you expect to stand up against holgate with a spirit like that he was pale even through the strong colour that the sun had beaten into him he eyed me without replying for a moment and then with the ghost of his old manner answered i expect i shall sit down to him the fingers with which he readjusted the glasses his favourite trick were tremulous pye was to be counted out in case of an emergency but pye somehow set me thinking pye's cowardice was manifest rampant if one may use such a term yet he had ventured into the fog the night before not only so but upon a deck which was filled in his eyes with horrid enemies prowling in search of victims how had he achieved that spirited action it seemed incredible yet i had come upon him at the foot of the bridge stairs and i had his explanation what induced the timid rabbit to venture out of his hutch upon such a night and in such circumstances frankly the riddle beat me and i should have worried over it had it not been for other matters that seemed more immediately important i have spoken of the prince's seclusion i admit now that it had already made an impression on me he was as became his nature and his training a disciplinarian each man had his place and his duties and prince frederic appeared at due seasons and shared in the responsibilities he did not shirk in accordance with his promise but for the rest he had withdrawn himself now for three days from the general company his meals were served with his sister and mademoiselle but from what i saw he was most often in his own cabin and here it was i got a glimpse of him once again a glimpse i mean into that strange and compound character i forget the occasion but it was necessary that i should see him and i entered the cabin after knocking when we were done he pulled his papers before him and sat looking at them dully have you any literary qualities dr phillimore he asked me quite unexpectedly i hesitated if so they are quite undeveloped i replied i have no reason to suppose so ah he sighed and taking a volume which lay on the table he opened it do you know german i told him that i could read the language he nodded it has never been properly appreciated he said slowly the german literature is wonderful ah wonderful and he appeared to meditate over his page then he set the book down and looked across at me you are married doctor ah no he nodded again and once more resumed his meditations i might have taken it for granted that i was free to go but for some reason i lingered he frowned deeply and sighed again there is a passage in schiller but you would not know it he gave me no chance of saying and i answered nothing only sat and stared at him there is more music in germany's little finger than in all the world else in composition i mean he added that has always been my opinion i ventured at last he turned his dull blue eyes on me as if wondering what i did there so he said and heaved a bigger sigh from his very heart as it seemed when the attack is made doctor he broke off and asked sharply when will they attack do you say any moment now sir i replied he rose we must remember the ladies doctor he said yes we are not likely to forget them i replied he eyed me do you think and paused that is all sir he said with a curt nod it was not a ceremonious or even a fitting dismissal seeing the common peril in which we stood in that danger surely we should have drifted together more drifted into a situation where princes and commoners were not where employers and hirelings did not exist yet i was not annoyed for i had seen some way into his soul and it was turbid and tortured black care had settled on prince frederic and he looked on me out of eyes of gloom the iron had entered into him and he was no longer a prince but a mortal man undergoing travail and anguish by the afternoon we were clear of the straits and the nose of the yacht turned northward still there was no sign from the mutineers and that being so i felt myself at liberty to pay my accustomed visit to legrand in the forecastle no one interfered with me and i did not see holgate but the man on guard at the hatch made no difficulty about letting me down as i descended it came into my mind how easy it would be to dispose of yet another fighting man of the meagre force at the prince's disposal by clapping the hatch over my head it would have been a grim joke quite in keeping with holgate's character and for a moment i turned as in doubt but the next second banishing my misgivings i went down to the floor captivity was telling on the prisoners beyond doubt for here they got no sight of sun and the light was that of the gloaming i remembered that i had forgotten to take a lantern from the sentry as soon as this twilight gloomed on me and i was turning back when i heard a sound hsst hsst i stopped who is that i asked in a whisper it's me jones sir said one of the hands i walked towards him for the light that streamed in by the open hatchway sufficed to reveal him anything wrong with you said i casually well i could do with a bit more light and a smoke sir said the man respectfully cheerful but it was not his words it was his action that arrested me for he jerked his thumb incessantly as he spoke towards the darker recesses of the hold all right my man said i i'll speak to mr holgate he oughtn't to keep you in such close confinement if you are to remain human beings so saying i waded into the deeper shadows and as i did i felt my hand seized and dragged downwards s s s h said a very still voice and i obeyed what was it i was drawn downward and at last i knelt i knew now and somehow my heart leaped within me i had never really understood legrand i had taken him for a very ordinary ship's officer but i had come slowly to another conclusion i bent down heart pretty bad i said in a mechanical way there's only one way out whispered a voice below me and that's through the bulkheads into the engine room i've been waiting and i think i can do it i don't like the look of the eyes i remarked indifferently does he eat well not very well sir it's a job to get him to take it said jones we've had four days at it with a knife said the whisper and by thunder we see light now we'll get through phillimore how do you stand sleep at all well i inquired i couldn't say sir said jones just lays there like a log attack may be made at any moment i whispered back there are some ten of us holding the state rooms and the ladies he gripped my hand and i rose to my feet well i'm afraid i can't do any more i said he's going on pretty much the same good bye men they returned the farewell and i made my way to the ladder and ascended the guard with emotionless face helped me out and the first man my eyes fell on was holgate standing with his hands in his pockets looking at me he whistled as he eyed me and his teeth showed in his grin for sheer arduous pursuit of duty i don't know your equal doctor said he you just hang on to work as if you loved it how's the patient i told him that it was a question of time but that there was no reason why legrand should not get over the injury to his spine not that he will ever be the same man again i added no said he reflectively he won't and he wants time does he well perhaps we can give him time though mark you my lad i don't promise it he said with his ugly fang showing in a smile he took ten paces along the deck with me seeming to be wrapped up in his thoughts and then he paused tell me doctor are you in this move he asked brusquely what move i asked in turn what do you mean he waved a hand towards the upper deck why barraclough's of course he replied are you working with him because if so i'd like to know if only for amusement i haven't the faintest idea what you're talking of i replied you're not making terms eh said he heavily leaden of face by gosh you might be doctor but you ain't more fool you then it's barraclough is it playing on his own he chuckled that man treated me as pretty dirt all along didn't he i'll go bail it was public property barraclough's real blue blood prick him and see my son he's got to be pricked but i'm no surgeon i understand nothing of all this i replied you enjoy mystification holgate and your talents are remarkable you can beat sir john out of his boots but i wish you'd used your talents elsewhere better have buried them for you've given us a stiff job and we've simply got to lick you you will see that i broke out here in his own vein i had come to the conclusion that this was my best card to play i could sum up holgate to a point but i did not know him all through and i was wise enough to recognise that i think if i had been under thirty and not over that sagacious age i should have judged more rashly but i had that unknown area of holgate's character to meet and i thought to meet it by emulating his own bearing i am not by nature communicative but i feigned the virtue i spoke to him as an equal exchanging views upon the situation as one might exchange them on a cricket match and i believe he appreciated my tone if you had as little character as sir john and more prudence i would have bet on your future doctor he said soberly but you must play your own cards and if sir john wants terms he must be generous generosity becomes the victor he smiled and nodded farewell and i left him considerably puzzled i had no guess as to what he meant by his talk of barraclough and terms it could only mean one thing on the face of it and that was that barraclough had been in communication with him if so was this by the prince's desire and if so again why had not i heard of it our company was so small and our plight so desperate that it was unseemly to confine policy or diplomacy within a narrow circle surely we had all a right to a knowledge of what was forward at least all of us who were in positions of responsibility as i went back i was consumed with annoyance that such an important matter as a possible compromise with the mutineers had been concealed from me but then was it a compromise authorised by the prince if i had read that obstinate and that fanatical proud heart aright i could not credit it when i reached the state rooms i inquired for barraclough and then remembered that he would be on duty in the saloon i immediately sought him there but found only grant who informed me that he had relieved sir john at his orders half an hour earlier he could not give any information beyond that it was possible barraclough had gone to his cabin and so i repaired thither but without success i made inquiries of ellison who had not seen the first officer and of the steward who was in a like case it was lane who gave me the clue in a vein which i will set down without comment he's on a perch and crowing like a rooster is the bart you need not look for flies on barraclough doctor he's his own chauffeur this trip i don't fancy the joy myself but the bart is rorty and what would you say to mademoiselle eh oh let's be plain lane i said impatiently he jerked his thumb across the corridor mademoiselle wants a partner at dominoes matador or bridge doctor and the bart plays a good game if you have to choose between your maid and a bart you bet your life you'll pocket the bart oh this trip's about enough for me where's it going to end and where are we he made a wry face and sank in a heap on his chair if you've got any influence with holgate make him come in i'm sick of this damn sentry go if it suits germans it don't suit a true born englishman is sir john with mademoiselle i asked simply guess again and you'll guess wrong said lane moodily kicking his feet about i was not interested in his feelings at the moment my mind was occupied with other considerations but it certainly gave me pause that what i had myself seen was apparently now common knowledge that sir john had been fascinated by the coquettish parisian was obvious to me if it was obvious to lane was it hidden from others who were more concerned i had my answer as regards one almost immediately if sir john were in the ladies' boudoir it was not for me to disturb him and i turned away and passed out of the corridor as i was preparing to descend to the cabins i heard the low strains of the small organ which the piety of a former owner of the sea queen had placed at the end of the music gallery i entered and in the customary twilight made out a figure at the farther end of the room perhaps it was the dim light that gave the old air its significance it had somewhat the effect upon me that music in a church heard faintly and moving with simple solemnity has always had what is there that speaks so gravely in the wind notes and reeds of an organ ein feste burg ist unser gott i knew the words as familiarly as i knew the music and yet that was almost the last place and time in which i should have expected to hear it it was not mademoiselle who played so low and soft to hear oh i felt sure of that the touch was lighter graver and quieter i drew near the player and listened i had heard mademoiselle sing that wonderful song adelaide and she had sung it divinely but i would have given a dozen adelaide's for that simple air rendered by no voice but merely by sympathetic fingers on those austere keys i listened as i say and into my heart crept something i know not what that gave me a feeling of fulness of heart of a surcharge of strange and not wholly painful sentiment i was still battling with these sensations when the music ceased and the player arose she started slightly on seeing me and i found myself stammering an excuse for my presence i was looking for sir john barraclough come she said after a moment's pause i will find him for you i followed her into the corridor until she paused outside a door and opened it abruptly without knocking i waited without but i heard her voice strangely harsh and clear sir john barraclough you are being sought by dr phillimore three minutes later barraclough joined me red and discomposed anything the matter he growled i knew now that i had been used as a definite excuse to get rid of barraclough whose presence was not welcome to the princess alix and with that knowledge i framed my answer yes what terms have you made with holgate he started as if i had struck him stared at me and his jaw came out in a heavy obstinate fashion he had what's that to you only this said i that my life is as valuable to me as yours or the prince's to you or him and that therefore i have a right to know he laughed shortly i'm commanding officer oh i'm sick of these airs i replied if you will not answer me i will go to the prince and get an answer from him he at least will see the reasonableness of my request for information he changed his attitude at that you needn't do that phillimore said he i can tell you all you need know after all as you say you've a certain right he looked at me with his hard unfriendly look and i met him with one of expectancy you know what my opinion is he resumed it's only a bluff to say that we have a chance against holgate he's got the ship and he's got the men i want to see if we can't make some arrangement and he will i inquired sceptically barraclough hesitated he's inclined to he's to let me know i think he's a bit impressed by our bluff all the same and if we could hit on a suitable middle course he stopped hang it there are the women phillimore he said vehemently and you suppose holgate will take them into consideration i said well perhaps he may i don't think either you or i really know much of holgate but i think i know more than you he's sociable and friendly isn't he one wouldn't take him for a rascally mutineer he's a most infernal ruffian said he with an oath yet you would trust him in the matter of terms i suggested barraclough frowned we've got to he said curtly unless you can show me a way to hold out oh men have been in worse cases than ours and emerged all right a little battered no doubt and then there's the coal we can't cruise indefinitely holgate's got to put in somewhere oh he's not going to wait for that said barraclough moodily look here phillimore have you a guess at what he means to do i have about ten guesses i replied shaking my head and none of them fits the case what's he going to do with us that's his real difficulty and ours the money problem's simple i can't see what's at the back of that black mind but i don't think it's hopeful for us women included there you are he exploded savagely anything if we can prevent the worst yes i assented provided you can trust to holgate's word but would he let us off at any price and run the risk and moreover the prince what of him he would refuse he wouldn't budge he's a nuisance said barraclough moodily he's our stumbling block quite so and if we all caved in but mr morland what must his fate be and we should look on shouldn't we and then go home in a tramp steamer a happy family party with a nice little secret of our own ten twelve well say sixteen of us i can see holgate trusting to that and comfortably lolling back in yokohama deck chairs and i can also see sir john barraclough reporting the total loss of the yacht sea queen captain and owner and so and so going down with her i can read it all in the papers here and now it will be excellent food for the ha'pennies the frown deepened on his face as i proceeded but contrary to my expectation he did not display any temper at my mocking speech he shrugged his shoulders i'll admit the difficulties it looks like impossibility but so's the alternative i'm in despair there's only one thing will solve the problem i said he looked up action you mean holgate won't wait till his coal's out he's free for an attack now in god's name let him said barraclough viciously chapter xv the fight in the music room the sea queen was making way on her northerly course athwart the long rollers of the pacific the wind blew briskly from the west and the sea ran high so that the yacht lay over with a strong list as she battled through the rough water my watch began at twelve o'clock that night and i took the precaution to lie down for a rest about eight i fell asleep to the sound of the sea against my porthole window but awoke in good time it was full dark and save for the screw and the eternal long wash without there was silence somehow the very persistence of these sounds seemed profounder silence i groped my way into the passage with the screw kicking under my feet and passed barraclough's cabin still there was no sound or sign of life but i perceived the glimmer of a light beyond and seeing that it issued from pye's cabin i turned the handle of the door it was locked who is that demanded a tremulous voice it's i let me in i called back the door was opened slowly and little pye stood before me in the illumination of the incandescent wire he stood out ghastly white it's you doctor he said weakly the smell of spirits pervaded the cabin i looked across and saw a tumbler in the rack half full of whisky and water he noticed the direction of my gaze i can't sleep said he this heavy water has given me a touch of sea sickness i feel awfully queer i don't suppose whisky will do you any good said i he laughed feebly and vacantly oh but it does it stays the stomach different people are affected different ways doctor as he spoke he took down the glass with quivering fingers and drank from it in a clumsy gulp i shall be better if i can get to sleep he said nervously and drank again pye you're making trouble for yourself said i you'll be pretty bad before morning oh for goodness' sake don't talk about morning he broke out in a fit of terror i gazed at him in astonishment and he tried to recover under my eyes that's not your first glass said i he did not deny it i can't go on without it let me alone doctor for heaven's sake let me alone i gave him up well if you are going to obfuscate yourself in this foolish manner i said my voice disclosing my contempt at least take my advice and don't lock yourself in none but hysterical women do that i was closing the door when he put a hand out doctor doctor i paused and he looked at me piteously could you give me a sleeping draught if you'll leave that alone i will i said and i returned to my cabin and brought some sulphonal tabloids this will do you less harm than whisky i said now buck up and be a man pye he thanked me and stood looking at me his hands nervously adjusted his glasses on his nose he took one of the tabloids and shakily lifted his whisky and water to wash it down his throat he coughed and sputtered and with a shiver turned away from me he lifted the glass again and drained it good bye doctor good night i mean he said hoarsely with his back still to me i'm all right i think i shall go to sleep now well that's wise said i and i'll look in and see how you go on when my watch is over he started turned half way to me and stopped right you are he said with a struggle after cheerfulness his back was still to me he had degrading cowardice in his very appearance somehow i was moved to pat him on the shoulder that's all right man get to sleep for answer he broke into tears and blubbered aloud throwing himself face downwards on his bunk come pye said i why what's this man i'm a bit upset he said regaining some control of himself i think the sea sickness has upset me but i'm all right he lay on his face and was silent and so for i was due now in the corridor i left him as i turned away i could have sworn i heard the key click in the door he had locked himself in again lane was on duty at the farther end of the corridor and i had the door near the entrance connecting with the music balcony two electric lights shed a faint glow through the length and breadth of the corridor and over all was silence as i sat in my chair fingering my revolver my thoughts turned over the situation helplessly and swung round finally to the problem of barraclough and mademoiselle the princess and i had guessed what was forward and lane also had an inkling only the prince was ignorant of the signal flirtation which was in progress under his nose i suppose such a woman could not remain without victims it did not suffice for her that she had captured a prince of the blood had dislocated the policy of a kingdom and had ruined a man's life she must have other trophies of her beauty and barraclough was one i was sorry for him though i cannot say that i liked him the dull unimaginative and wholesome briton had toppled over before the sensuous arts of the french beauty his anxiety was for her he had not shown himself timorous as to the result before doubtless she had infected him with her fears possibly even it was at the lady's suggestion that he had made advances to holgate suddenly my thoughts were diverted by a slight noise and looking round i saw lane advancing swiftly towards me i say phillimore he said in a hoarse whisper i've lost the key key i echoed what key for i did not at once take in his meaning why man the purser's key the key of the strong room he said impatiently i gazed in silence at him but you must have left it below i said at last not i he answered emphatically i'm no juggins they're always on me i go to bed in them so to speak see here he pulled a ring of keys from his pocket this is how i keep 'em on my double chain they don't leave me save at nights when i undress well it's gone and i'm damned if i know when it went or how it went he gazed frowning deeply at his bunch that's odd i commented it puts me in a hole said he how the mischief can i have lost it i can't think how it can have slipped off and it's the only one gone too it didn't slip off said i it's been stolen he looked at me queerly that makes it rather worse old chap he said hesitatingly for it don't go out of my hands save at night said i he was silent hang it what does any blighter want to steal it for he demanded in perplexity well we know what's in the strong room i said yes but there was a sound to your door said i quick man lane sped along the corridor to his station and just as he reached it a door opened and princess alix emerged she hesitated for a moment and then came towards me it was bitterly cold and she was clad in her furs she came to a pause near me i could not sleep and it is early yet she said are you expecting danger we have always to act as if we were i said evasively she was examining my face attentively and now looked away as if her scrutiny had satisfied her why has this man never made any attempt to get the safes she asked next i wish i knew i replied and yet in my mind was that strange piece of information i had just had from lane who had stolen the key the princess uttered a little sigh and turning began to walk to and fro it is sometimes difficult to keep one's feet when the floor is at this angle she remarked as she drew near to me and then she paced again into the distance she was nervous and distressed i could see though her face had not betrayed the fact yet how was i to comfort her we were all on edge once again she paused near me what are our chances they are hopeful said i as cheerfully as i might the fortress has always more chances than the leaguers providing rations hold out and there is no fear of ours ah tell me the truth she cried with agitation madam i have said what is exactly true i replied gravely i have spoken of chances and if we lose she asked after a pause her eyes encountered mine fully i have no information i said slowly and very little material to go on in guessing but i hope we shall not lose i added this can't go on forever dr phillimore she said with a little catch in her voice it has gone on so long my heart bled for her she had been so courageous she had shown such fortitude such resistance such common sense this beautiful proud woman and she was now breaking down before one of her brother's employees it can't go on much longer i said again gravely it will come to its own conclusion presently ah but what conclusion she cried who knows who knows the sight of her agitation of that splendid woman nigh to tears thrilled me to the marrow with a storm of compassion and something more i was carried out of myself god be witness i cried that while i live you shall be safe from any harm god be my witness for that she uttered a tiny sob and put out her hand impulsively you are good she said brokenly i am a coward to give way but i was alone i have brooded over it all and frederic thank you oh thank you to have said so much perhaps has helped me oh we shall all live live to talk of these days with shudders and thankfulness to god you are right to call god to witness he is our witness now he looks down on us both and he will help us i will pray to him this night as i have prayed three times a day she spoke in a voice full of emotion and very low and earnest and her hand was still in mine and as she finished the two electric lights in the corridor went out leaving us in pitch darkness i felt the princess shudder be brave i whispered oh be brave you have called to god he will hear you yes yes she whispered back and clutched my hand tighter drawing nearer me till her furs rested against my breast but what is it what does it mean it may mean nothing i replied but it may mean i put my ear to the door still holding her and listened through the noises of the sea i could make out other and alien sounds they come you must go can you find your way let me stay she murmured breathlessly no no go i said your place is in your cabin just now remember i know where it is and i can find you yes find me she panted please find me see i i have this she put the butt of a revolver into my hand that has been by me since the first but come find me if if it is necessary i raised her hand to my lips and she melted away i turned to the door lane i called lane his voice sailed back to me what's gone wrong with the lights they're coming i said look to your door and even as i spoke a bar crashed upon mine from without in an instant the corridor was full of noises the mutineers were upon us but they had divided their forces and were coming at different quarters it remained to be seen at which spot their main attack was to be delivered i put my revolver through one of the holes we had drilled in the door and fired it was impossible to say if my shot took effect but i hoped so and i heard the sound of lane's repeater at the farther end the blows on the door were redoubled and it seemed to me to be yielding i emptied two more cartridges through the hole at a venture and that one went home i knew since i had touched a body with the muzzle as i pulled the trigger ellison was on guard in the saloon below and grant and the cook in the music saloon and i judged from the sounds that reached me in the melee that they also were at work by this time barraclough and jackson and the prince had arrived on the scene the last with a lantern which he swung over his head barraclough joined me and jackson was despatched to grope his way into the saloon to assist ellison the prince himself took his station with lane and i heard the noise of his weapon several times my door had not yet given way but i was afraid of those swinging blows and both barraclough and i continued to fire the corridor filled with smoke and the smell of powder do you think he's made up his mind to get through here asked barraclough i don't know i shouted back he's attacking in three places at any rate we can't afford to neglect any one of them confound this darkness he exclaimed furiously oh for an hour of dawn the blows descended on the door but still it held and i began to wonder why surely a body of men with axes should have destroyed the flimsy boards by this time it looked as if this was not the real objective of the attack i sprang to the bolt and was drawing it when barraclough called out for he could see in the dim light of the lantern good heavens man are you mad no i called back stand ready to fire i believe there's practically no one behind this and having now released the bolt i flung open the door simultaneously barraclough fired through the open darkness and a body took the deck heavily floundering on the threshold the rest was silence no one was visible or audible but at my feet lay two bodies i thought so i said excitedly this was mere bluff and so's the attack on lane's door see there's no force there i will settle that i delivered a pistol shot along the deck in the direction of some shadows and retreated bolting the door behind me where is it gasped barraclough out of breath one at each door will do said i fetch lane here i think its the music room you and i had better get there as fast as we can without disputing my assumption of authority he ran down the corridor and explained our discovery returning presently with lane then we made for the music room it was pitch black on the stairs but we groped our way through guided by the sounds within barraclough struck a match and shed a light on the scene for an instant it flared and sputtered discovering to us the situation in that cockpit the place was a shambles grant was at bay in a corner the cook lay dead and half a dozen mutineers were struggling in the foreground with some persons i could not see while through the broken boards of the windows other men were climbing with an oath barraclough dropped his match and rushed forward my revolver had barked as he did so and one of the ruffians who was crawling through the window toppled head first into the saloon but the darkness hampered us for it was impossible to tell who was friend or enemy and i believe it had hampered the mutineers also or they must have triumphed long ere this i engaged in a hand to hand struggle with some one who gripped me by the throat and struck at me with a knife i felt it rip along my shoulder and a throb of pain jumped in my arm but the next moment i had him under foot and had used the last cartridge in my chamber where are you grant barraclough ellison i called out and i heard above the din of oaths and feet and bumping a voice call hoarsely to me whose it was i could not say and upon that came an exclamation of pain or cry my god with the frenzy of the lust of blood upon me i seized some one and drove my revolver heavily into his skull i threw another man to the floor from behind and was then seized as in a grasp of a vice i turned about and struggled fiercely and together my assailant and i rocked and rolled from point to point neither of us had any weapon it appeared and all that we could do was to struggle in that mutual and tenacious grip and trust to chance i felt myself growing weaker but i did not relax my hold and indeed came to the conclusion that if i was to survive it must be by making a superhuman effort with all the force of my muscles and the weight of my body i pushed my man forward at the same time striving to bend him backward he gave way a little and struck the railings that surrounded the well of the saloon bumping along them heavily then recovering he exerted all his strength against me and we swayed together suddenly there was a crack in my ears the rail parted asunder and we both toppled over into space a thud followed which seemed to be in my very brain and then i knew nothing when i was next capable of taking in impressions with my senses i was aware of a great stillness vacantly my mind groped its way back to the past and i recalled that i had fallen and must be now in the saloon immediately on that i was conscious that i was resting upon some still body which must be that of my opponent who had fallen under me what had happened i could hear no sounds of any conflict in progress had the enemy taken possession of the state rooms and were all of our party prisoners or dead i rose painfully into a sitting posture and put out a hand to guide myself it fell on a quiet face the man was dead it was with infinite difficulty that i got to my feet sore aching and dizzy and groped my way to the wall which way was i to go which way led out the only sound i seemed to hear was the regular thumping of the screw below me which was almost as if it had been in the arteries of my head beating in consonance with my heart then an idea struck me flooding me with horror and bracing my shattered nerves the princess i had promised to go to her if all was lost i had betrayed my trust as i thought this i staggered down the saloon clutching the wall and came abruptly against a pillar which supported the balcony above from this i let myself go at a venture and walked into the closed door forthright congratulating myself on my luck i turned the handle and passed into the darkness of the passages beyond and now a sound of voices flowed toward me voices raised in some excitement and i could perceive a light some way along the passage in the direction of the officers' cabins as i stood waiting resolute not knowing if these were friends or foes and fearing the latter a man emerged toward me with a lantern if that fool would only switch on the light it would be easier he said in a voice which i did not recognise but the face over the lantern was familiar to me it was pierce the murderer of mccrae and the chief figure after holgate in that mutiny and massacre i shrank back behind the half open door but he did not see me he had turned and gone back with an angry exclamation stand away there i heard in a voice of authority and i knew the voice this time it was holgate's the mutineers had the ship what then had become of the prince's party what fate had enveloped them i waited no longer but staggered rather than slipped out of the saloon and groped in the darkness toward the stairs once on them i pulled myself up by the balustrade until i reached the landing where the entrance hall gave on the state rooms i was panting i was aching every bone seemed broken in my body and i had no weapon how was i to face the ruffians who might be in possession of the rooms i tried the handle of the door but it was locked i knocked and then knocked louder with my knuckles was it possible that some one remained alive summoning my wits to my aid i gave the signal which had been used by me on previous occasions on returning from my expeditions there was a pause then a key turned the door opened and i fell forward into the corridor chapter xvi pye i looked up into barraclough's face then you're all right i said weakly and the princess we've held these rooms and by heaven we'll keep 'em said he vigorously i saw now that his left arm was in a sling but my gaze wandered afield under the lantern in search of others the prince and the princess are safe said he in explanation but it's been a bad business for us we've lost the cook jackson and grant and that little beggar pye i breathed a sigh of relief at his first words and then as i took in the remainder of his sentence what is pye dead well he's missing anyway said barraclough indifferently but he's not much loss perhaps he's in his cabin he locked himself in earlier i said give me an arm like a good fellow i'm winged and i'm all bruises i fell into the saloon gad is that so said he and i was aware that some one else was listening near i raised my head and taking barraclough's hand looked round it was princess alix i could make her out from her figure but i could not see her face you have broken an arm she said quickly it is not so bad as that miss morland i answered i got a scrape on the shoulder and the fall dazed me i was now on my feet again and barraclough dropped me into a chair they got in by the windows of the music room i said yes he assented ellison and jackson ran up from the saloon on the alarm apparently just in time to meet the rush ellison's bad bullet in the groin i must see to him i said struggling up a hand pressed me gently on the shoulder and even so i winced with pain you must not go yet said the princess there is yourself to consider you are not fit i looked past her towards the windows some of which had been unbarred in the conflict i fear i can't afford to be an invalid i said there is so much to do i will lie up presently miss morland if sir john will be good enough to get me my bag which is in the ante chamber i think i can make up on what i have barraclough departed silently and i was alone with the princess i did not come i said i betrayed my trust she came a little nearer to my seat you would have come if there had been danger she said earnestly yet why do we argue thus when death is everywhere three honest men have perished and we are nearer home by so much home said i wondering yes i mean home she said in a quick low voice don't think that i am a mere foolish woman i have always seen the end and sometimes it appears to me that we are wasting time in fighting i know what threatens what must fall and i thank god i am prepared for it see did i not show you before and here she laid her hand upon her bosom which was heaving i shook my head you are wrong said i feebly there is nothing certain yet think i beg you how many chances god scatters in this world and how to turn a corner to pause a moment may change the face of destiny a breath a wind the escape of a jet of steam a valve astray a jagged rock in the ocean the murmur of a voice a handshake anything the least in this world may cause the greatest revolution in this world no you must not give up hope i will not she said i will hope on but i am ready for the worst and the prince i asked i think he has changed much of late she said slowly he is altered yet i do think he too is ready the prison closes upon us she had endured so bravely that delicate nature had breasted so nobly these savage perils and mischances that it was no wonder her fortitude had now given way but that occasion was the only time she exhibited anything in common with the strange fatalism of her brother of which i must say something presently it was the only time i knew that intrepid girl to fail and even then she failed with dignity barraclough returned with my bag and i selected from it what i wanted i knew that beyond bruises and shock there was little the matter with me and for that i must thank the chance that had flung me on the body of my assailant and not underneath it there was need of me at that crisis as i felt and it was no hour for the respectable and judicious methods of ordinary practice i had to get myself up to the norm of physique and i did so well said lane who had been attending to ellison they've appropriated the coker nut it wasn't my fault for the beggars kept me and the prince busy at the door and then before you could say 'knife' they were off a mean dirty trick's what i call it oh that's in the campaign i said and what said the prince swore like a private in the line at least i took it for swearing for it was german and then we ran as hard as we could split to the row but it was too late there wasn't any one left all was over save the shouting then the prince is well i asked not a pimple on him old man said the efflorescent lane and he's writing like blue blazes in his cabin what was he writing was that dull blue eye eloquent of fate when he should be afoot what did he at his desk even as i pondered this question a high voice fluted through the corridor and a door opened with a bang it was mademoiselle she dashed across a flutter of skirts and a flurry of agitation and disappeared into the apartments occupied by the prince princess alix stood on the threshold with a disturbed look upon her face she's gone to raise cain said lane with a grimace we've got enough cain already said i and walked to the window opposite dawn was now flowing slowly into the sky and objects stood out greyly in a grey mist from the deck a noise broke loudly and lane joined us another attack said he they're bound to have us now i said nothing barraclough was listening at the farther end and i think princess alix had turned her attention from mademoiselle i heard holgate's voice lifted quite calmly in the racket it's death to two at all events so let me know who makes choice you garrison let's finish the job cried a voice we've had enough and there was an outcry of applause immediately on that there was a loud rapping on the door near us when i've played my cards and fail gentlemen said holgate's voice i'll resign the game into your hands what is it shouted barraclough fire and be hanged you mistake sir john called out holgate we're not anxious for another scrap we've got our bellies full all we want is a little matter that can be settled amicably i won't ask you to open for i can't quite trust the tempers of my friends here but if you can hear me please say so i hear said barraclough that's all right then i won't offer to come in for william tell may be knocking about we can talk straight out here we want the contents of those safes that's all a mere modest request in the circumstances you've got the safes shouted barraclough let us alone softly sir john bart said the mutineer the safes are there safe enough but there's nothing in 'em you've got back on us this time by thunder you have and the beauty of the game was its simplicity well here's terms again since we're bound to do it in style of plenipotentiaries give us the contents of the safes and i'll land you on the coast here within twelve hours with a week's provisions there was a moment's pause on this and barraclough looked toward me in the dim light as if he would ask my advice they've got the safes he said in perplexity this is more treachery i suppose shoot 'em said lane furiously don't trust the brutes wait a bit said i hurriedly don't let's be rash we had better call mr morland there's something behind this tell them that we will answer presently barraclough shouted the necessary statement and i hurried off to the prince's cabin i knocked and entered abruptly mademoiselle sat in a chair with a face suffused with tears her pretty head bowed in her hands she looked up what are we to do doctor the prince says we must fight but there is another way is there not she said in french surely we can make peace i will make peace myself this agitates my nerves this fighting and the dead and oh frederic you must make peace with this 'olgate the prince sat awkwardly silent his eyes blinking and his mouth twitching what he had said i know not but despite the heaviness of his appearance he looked abjectly miserable it is not possible yvonne he said hoarsely these men must be handed over to justice i confess i had some sympathy with mademoiselle at the moment so obstinately stupid was this obsession of his to talk of handing the mutineers over to justice when we were within an ace of our end and death knocking veritably on the door the men sir wish to parley with you i said somewhat brusquely they are without and offer terms he got up ah they are being defeated he said and nodded our resistance is too much for them i could not have contradicted him just then for it would probably have led to an explosion on the lady's part but it came upon me to wonder if the prince knew anything of the contents of the safes they were his and he had a right to remove them had he done so i couldn't blame him if he had he walked out with a ceremonious bow to mademoiselle and i followed she had dried her eyes and was looking at me eagerly she passed into the corridor in front of me and pressed forward to where barraclough and lane stood the mutineers sir offer terms said barraclough to the prince they propose that if we hand over the contents of the safes we shall be landed on the coast with a week's provisions the prince gazed stolidly and stupidly at his officer i do not understand said he the scoundrels are in possession of the safes that is precisely what we should all have supposed i said drily but it seems they are not look here holgate called out barraclough after a moment's silence are we to understand that you have not got the safes open it seemed odd questioning a burglar as to his success but the position made it necessary we have the safes open right enough called holgate hoarsely but there's nothing there they're just empty and so if you'll be so good as to fork out the swag captain we'll make a deal in the terms i have said it is a lie they have everything said the prince angrily then why the deuce are they here and what are they playing at said barraclough frowning only a pretty little game of baccarat oh my hat said lane it seems to me that there's a good deal more in this than is apparent i said the safes were full and the strong room was secure we are most of us witnesses to that but what has happened i think sir john it would be well if we asked the mr morland forthwith if he has removed his property he has a key no sir i have not interfered said the prince emphatically i committed my property to the charge of this ship and to her officers i have not interfered barraclough and i looked at each other lane whistled and his colour deepened there doctor that's where i come in i told you so that's a give away for me i've got the other key or had had exclaimed the prince turning on him abruptly yes said lane with sheepish surliness i was telling the doctor about it not long ago my key's gone off my bunch i found it out just now some one's poached it the prince's eyes gleamed ferociously as if he would have sprung on the little purser who slunk against the wall sullenly when did you miss it asked barraclough sharply oh about an hour and a half ago said lane in an offhand way he has stolen it he is the thief thundered the prince lane glanced up at him with a scowl oh talk your head off said he moodily i don't care a damn if you're prince or pot boy we're all on a level here and we're not thieves each one looked at the other we're cornered said barraclough it will make 'em mad if they haven't got that there's no chance of a bargain it is not my desire there should be any bargain said the prince stiffly barraclough shrugged his shoulders and said nothing but it was plain to all that we were in a hole the mutineers were probably infuriated by finding the treasure gone and at any moment might renew their attack there was but a small prospect that we could hold out against them we must tell them said i at least we must come to some arrangement with them the question is whether we shall pretend to fall in with their wishes or at least feign to have what they want it will give us time but how long there is no sense in that remarked prince frederic in his autocratic way we will send them about their business and let them do what they can sir you forget the ladies i said boldly dr phillimore i forget nothing he replied formally but will you be good enough to tell me what the advantage of postponing the discovery will be well when it came to the point i really did not know it was wholly a desire to delay an instinct in favour of procrastination that influenced me i shrank from the risks of an assault in our weakened state i struggled with my answer it is only to gain time and what then he inquired coldly i shrugged my shoulders as sir john had shrugged his this was common sense carried to the verge of insanity there must fall a time when there is no further room for reasoning and surely it had come now you will be good enough to inform the mutineers sir john barraclough pursued the prince having thus silenced me that we have not the treasure they are in search of and that undoubtedly it is already in their hands or in the hands of some of them possibly by the assistance of confederates with which his eyes slowed round to lane the words foolish beyond conception as i deemed them suddenly struck home to me some of them if the prince had not shifted his treasure certainly lane had not i knew enough of the purser to go bail for him in such a case and he had lost his key i think it was perhaps the mere mention of confederates that set my wits to work and what directed them to pye i know not wait one moment said i putting my hand on barraclough i'd like to ask a question before you precipitate war and raising my voice i cried is holgate there yes doctor and waiting for an answer but i've got some tigers behind me then what's become of pye i asked loudly there was a perceptible pause ere the reply came can't you find him no said i he was last seen in his cabin about midnight when he locked himself in well no doubt he is there now said holgate with a fat laugh and a wise man too i always betted on the little cockney's astuteness but doctor if you don't hurry up i fear we shall want sky pilots along what is this why are you preventing my orders being carried out asked the prince bluffly i fell back do as you will said i our lives are in your hands barraclough shouted the answer dictated to him and there came a sound of angry voices from the other side of the door an axe descended on it and it shivered stand by there said barraclough sharply and lane closed up outside the noise continued but no further blow was struck and at last holgate's voice was raised again we will give you till eight o'clock this evening captain and good day to you if you part with the goods then i'll keep my promise and put you ashore in the morning if not he went off without finishing his sentence he will not keep his promise oh he won't said a tense voice in my ear and turning i beheld the princess that is not the trouble said i as low as she it is that we have not the treasure and we are supposed to be in possession of it who has it she asked quickly your brother denies that he has shifted it but the mutineers undoubtedly found it gone it is an unfathomed secret so far but she said looking at me eagerly you have a suspicion it is none of us i said with an embracing glance that need not be said she replied quickly i know honest men she continued to hold me with her interrogating eyes and an answer was indirectly wrung from me i should like to know where pye is i said she took this not unnaturally as an evasion but he's of no use she said you have told me so we have seen so together it was pleasant to be coupled with her in that way even in that moment of wonder and fear i stared across at the door which gave access to the stairs of the saloon it is possible they have left no one down below i said musingly she followed my meaning this time oh you mustn't venture it she said it would be foolhardy you have run risks enough and you are wounded miss morland i answered this is a time when we can hardly stop to consider everything hinges on the next few hours i say it to you frankly and i will remember my promise this time you remembered it before you would have come she said with a sudden burst of emotion and somehow i was glad i liked her faith in me what the deuce do you make of it said barraclough to me i shook my head i'll tell you later when i've thought it over i answered at present i'm bewildered also shocked i've had a startler barraclough he stared at me i'll walk round and see but i don't know if it will get us any further there's only one thing that will do that said he significantly you mean we must make this sanguinary brute compromise if he will land us somewhere oh he won't i said i've no faith in him well if they haven't the treasure they may make terms to get it he said in perplexity if they have not i said he looked at me the question is who has the treasure i continued good heavens man if you know speak out he said impatiently when i know i'll speak i said but i will say this much that whoever is ignorant of its whereabouts holgate isn't i give it up said barraclough unhappily it won't give us up i rejoined we are to be attacked this evening if we don't part with what we haven't got he walked away apparently in despair of arriving at any conclusion by continuing the conversation i went toward the door for i still had my idea i wondered if there was anything in it princess alix had moved away on the approach of sir john but now she interrupted me you're not going she asked anxiously my surgery is below said i i must get some things from it she hesitated won't wouldn't that man holgate let you have them you are running too great a risk that is my safety i said smiling i go down if no one is there so much the better if some one crops up i have my excuse the risk is not great will you be good enough to bar the door after me this was not quite true but it served my purpose she let me pass looking after me with wondering eyes i unlocked the door and went out into the lobby that gave on the staircase there was no sound audible above the noises of the ship i descended firmly my hand on the butt of a revolver i had picked up no one was visible at the entrance to the saloon i turned up one of the passages toward my own cabin i entered the surgery and shut the door as i was looking for what i wanted or might want i formulated my chain of reflections here they are the key had been stolen from lane it could only have been stolen by some one in our own part of the ship since the purser had not ventured among the enemy who had stolen it here was a break but my links began a little further on in this way if the person who had stolen the key the traitor that is in our camp had acted in his own interests alone both parties were at a loss but that was not the hypothesis to which i leaned if on the other hand the traitor had acted in holgate's interests who was he before i could continue my chain to the end i had something to do a search to make i left the surgery noiselessly and passed along the alley to pye's cabin the handle turned and the door gave i opened it no one was there that settled my links for me the man whom i had encountered in the fog at the foot of the bridge was the man who was in communication with holgate that pitiful little coward whose stomach had turned at the sight of blood and on the assault of the desperadoes was their creature as these thoughts flashed through my mind it went back further in a leaf of memory i recalled the room in the three tuns on that dirty november evening i saw holgate and the little clerk facing each other across the table and myself drinking wine with them there was the place in which i had made the third officer's acquaintance and that had been brought about by pye there too i had first heard of prince frederic of hochburg and back into my memory flashed the stranger's talk the little clerk's stare and holgate's frown the conspiracy had been hatched then its roots had gone deep then from that moment the sea queen and her owner had been doomed i turned and left the cabin abruptly and soon was knocking with the concocted signal on the door barraclough admitted me i have it said i let's find the prince man we can't afford to leave the doors we may be attacked said he no they won't venture just yet i replied it's not their game at least not holgate's he's giving us time to find the treasure and then he'll attack i wish you wouldn't talk riddles said barraclough shortly i'll speak out when we get to the prince i said and forthwith we hastened to his room mr morland i burst out pye came aboard as representing your solicitors that is so he replied with some surprise in his voice and manner he was privy then to your affairs i refer to your financial affairs i pursued my solicitors in london whom i chose in preference to german solicitors were naturally in possession of such facts relating to myself as were necessary to their advice said the prince somewhat formally and pye knew what they knew the contents of the safes in the strong room he inclined his head it was intended that he should return from buenos ayres after certain arrangements had been made for which he would lend his assistance then sir said i pye has sold us pye is the source of the plot pye has the treasure what do you mean exclaimed the prince rising why that pye has been in league with the mutineers all along and good lord now i understand what was the meaning of his hints last night he knew the attack was to be made and he is a coward he locked himself up to drink now he is gone gone echoed barraclough and lane together and there was momentary silence which the latter broke by gum pye's done us brown browner than a kipper by gum to think of that little wart getting the bulge on us i should like to know your reasons doctor said prince frederic at last i'm hanged if i can puzzle it out yet myself said barraclough if they've got it why the deuce do they come and demand it from us oh they haven't got it i said it's only holgate and pye the rank and file know nothing i'll swear as for my reasons sir here they are and with that i told them what i knew of pye from my first meeting with him giving an account of the transactions in the three tuns and narrating many incidents which now seemed in the light of my discovery to point to the treachery of the clerk when i had done lane whistled the prince's brow was black but barraclough's face was impassive he looked at me then you are of opinion that holgate is running this show for himself he asked i will wager ten to one on it i answered that's like him he'll leave the others in the lurch if he can he's aiming at it and he'll leave pye there too i shouldn't wonder and if so what sort of a man is that to make terms with barraclough made no answer for a man of his even nature he looked troubled if this it so what are you in favour of he said at last the prince too looked at me inquiringly which showed that he had fully accepted my theory go on as we are doing and trust to luck said i luck said the prince raising his fingers chance destiny providence whatever be the term we must abide it it is written gentlemen is has been always written if god design us our escape we shall yet avoid and upset the calculations of these ruffians yes it is written you are right dr phillimore there must be no faint heart sir john give your orders and make your dispositions i will take my orders from you this significant speech was delivered with a fine spontaneity and i must say the man's fervour impressed me if he was a fatalist he was a fighting fatalist and i am sure he believed in his fortune i was not able to do that but i thought we had in the vulgar phrase a sporting chance and that i was right events proved as you will presently see chapter xvii the third attack holgate had given us till eight o'clock but it was of course uncertain if he would adhere to this hour if i were right in my suppositions and i could see no flaw in my reasoning he would present himself at that time and carry out the farce it was due to his men to the other scoundrels of the pack whom he was cheating and what would happen when we maintained that we had no knowledge of the treasure it was clear that the men would insist on an assault and if so what chance had we against the infuriated ruffians on the other hand we had nothing to hope for from a compromise with such men altogether the outlook was very black and lowering when the prince and all that remained with him were swept away and were as if they had never been holgate would be free to deal with the mutineers according to his tender mercies and then with such confederates as he might have in the original plot come into possession of the plunder for which so many innocent lives and so many guilty ones would have been sacrificed by now the wind had sprung into a gale and the sea queen was running under bare sticks the water rolled heavily from the southwest and the yacht groaned under the buffets it became difficult to stand at least for a landsman we had hitherto experienced such equable fine weather that i think we had taken for granted that it must continue but now we were undeceived the yacht pitched uneasily and rolled to her scuppers and it was as much as we could do to keep our legs holgate too must have been occupied by the duties of his position for he was a good mariner which was perhaps as well for us chance decides according to her fancy and the most trivial accidents are important in the scheme of destiny mademoiselle had an attack of mal de mer and had recourse to me nothing in the world mattered save her sensations which were probably very unpleasant i admit but the yacht might go to the bottom and holgate might storm the state rooms at the head of his mutineers it was all one to the lady who was groaning over her symptoms on her bed she kept me an unconscionable time and when i at length got away to what i regarded as more important duties i was followed by her maid this girl juliette was a trim sensible and practical woman who had grown accustomed to her mistress's vagaries took them with philosophy and showed few signs of emotion but now a certain fear flowed in her eye would monsieur tell her if there were any danger monsieur looked up balanced himself neatly against the wall as the yacht reared and declared that he had gone through much worse gales she shook her head with some energy no no it was not that there were the sailors those demons was it true that they had offered to put us all ashore yes said i if we give them what we have not got that is what they promise juliette but would you like to trust them she considered a moment her plain capable face in thought no she shook her head mademoiselle would do well to beware of them yes yes and with a nod she left me now what did that mean i asked myself and i could only jump to the conclusion that mademoiselle had thoughts of making a bargain with holgate on her own account i knew she was capable of yielding to any caprice or impulse if there had not been tragedy in the air it would have amused me to ponder the possibilities of that conflict of wits and brains between holgate and the lady but she was a victim to sea sickness and our hour drew near indeed it was then but two hours to eight o'clock it was necessary to take such precautions as we might in case holgate kept his word but it was possible that in that wind and sea he would not however to be prepared for the worst we had a council there were now but the prince barraclough lane and myself available for ellison was in a bad way the spareness of our forces was thus betrayed by this meeting which was in effect a council of despair we made our arrangements as speedily as possible and then i asked the ladies we must have some definite plan the prince nodded they must be locked in the boudoir he said it has entrances from both their cabins the last stand then is there i remarked casually he echoed the word there i had my duties in addition to those imposed by our dispositions and i was not going to fail i knew i should not fail outside in the corridor we sat and nursed our weapons silently i don't think that any one was disposed to talk but presently the prince rose and retired to his room he returned presently with a magnum of champagne and barraclough drew the cork while lane obtained some glasses let's have a wet that's a good idea said the purser the prince ceremoniously lifted his glass to us and took our eyes lane quaffed his emitting his usual gag hoarsely fortune how amazingly odd it sounded like the ironic exclamation of some onlooking demon of sarcasm fortune i drank my wine at a gulp to a good end if may be i said to rest at least barraclough held his glass coolly and examined it critically it's pommery isn't it sir he asked i do not think the prince answered barraclough sipped i'll swear it is said he let's look at the bottle lane he solved his doubts and drank and looked at his watch if they're coming they should be here now the weather's not going to save us i observed bitterly she goes smoother it was true enough the wind and the sea had both moderated barraclough examined the chambers of his revolver sir john barraclough a voice hailed us loudly from the deck sir john moved slowly to the door and turned back to look at us in its way it was an invitation he did not speak but i think he invoked our aid or at least our support in that look we followed yes he called back i'm here we've come for the answer said the voice you've had plenty of time to turn it over so what's it to be the terms offered or war is it holgate said lane in a whisper oh it's holgate no doubt steady remember who has the treasure barraclough the treasure is not in our possession sang out barraclough but we believe it to be in the possession of holgate one of yourselves oh come that won't do that game won't play said a familiar wheezy voice from behind us and we all fell back in alarm and amazement the boards had fallen loose from one of the windows and holgate's head protruded into the corridor in a flash the prince's fingers went to his revolver and a report echoed from the walls the louder for that confined space holgate had disappeared barraclough ran to the window and peered out he looked round that opens it he said deliberately and stood with a look of perplexity and doubt on his face since you have chosen war and begun the offensive we have no option shouted holgate through the boarding all right drive ahead growled lane and sucked his teeth crash came an iron bar on the door barraclough inserted his revolver through the open window and fired one said he two by thunder said lane discharging through one of the holes pierced in the door they'll play us the same trick as before said i and dashed across to the entrance from the music room noises arose from below i tested the locks and bars and then running hastily into one of the cabins brought forth a table and used it to strengthen the barricade prince frederic observing this nodded and gave instructions to lane who went on a similar errand on behalf of the other door crash fell the axe on my door and the wood splintered lane and prince frederic were busy firing through the loopholes with what result i could not guess and probably they themselves knew little more barraclough stood at his peephole and fired now and then and i did the same through the holes drilled in my door but it must have been easy for any one on the outside to avoid the line of fire if he were careful i was reminded that two could play at this game by a bullet which sang past my face and buried itself in the woodwork behind me the light was now failing fast and we fought in a gloaming within those walls though without the mutineers must have seen better the axe fell again and again and the door was giving in several places once there was a respite following on a cry and i rejoiced that one of my shots had gone home but the work was resumed presently with increased vigour and now of a sudden an outcry on my left startled me i turned and saw prince frederic in combat with a man and beyond in the twilight some other figures the door to the deck had fallen leaving my own door to take care of itself i hastened to what was the immediate seat of danger and shot one fellow through the body he fell like a bullock and then the prince gave way and struck against me his left arm had dropped to his side but in his right hand he now held a sword and recovering he thrust viciously and with agility before him before that gallant assault two more went down and as lane and barraclough seemed to be holding their own it seemed almost as if we should get the better of the attack but just then i heard rather than saw the second door yielding and with shouts the enemy clambered over the table and were upon us from that quarter also beneath this combined attack we slowly gave way and retreated down the corridor fighting savagely the mutineers must have come to the end of their ammunition for they did not use revolvers but knives and axes one ruffian whom in the uncertain light i could not identify bore a huge axe which he swung over his head and aimed at me with terrific force as i dodged it missed me and crashed into the woodwork of the cabins from which no effort could withdraw it i had stepped aside and although taking a knife wound in my thigh slipped a blade through the fellow but still they bore us back and i knew in my inmost mind where instinct rather than thought moved now that it was time to think of the boudoir and my promise we were being driven in that direction and if i could only reach the handle i had resolved what to do but now it seemed again that i must be doomed to break my word for how was it possible to resist that onset there were so far as i could guess a dozen of the mutineers but it was that fact possibly that helped us a little as owing to their numbers they impeded one another prince frederic was a marvellous swordsman and he swept a passage clear before him but at last his blade snapped in the middle and he was left defenceless i saw some one rush at him and the light gleaming on his face i recognised pierce with my left hand i hurled my revolver into it with all the power of my muscles it struck him full in the mouth that ugly lipless mouth which i abhorred he uttered a cry of pain and paused for a moment but in that moment abstracted from my own difficulties i had given a chance to one of my opponents whose uplifted knife menaced me i had no time to draw back and if i ducked i felt i should go under and be trodden upon by the feet of the infuriated enemy once down i should never rise again it seemed all over for me as well as for the prince and in far less time than it takes to relate this the thought had flashed into my head flashed together with that other thought that the princess would wait and wait for me in vain ah but would she wait if i knew her fine tempered spirit she would not hesitate she had the means of her salvation she carried it in her bosom and feared not no i could not be afraid for her as i have said these reflections were almost instantaneous and they had scarcely passed in a blaze of wonder through my brain when the yacht lurched heavily the deck slipped away from us and the whole body of fighting struggling men was precipitated with a crash against the opposite wall some had fallen to the floor and others crawled against the woodwork shouting oaths and crying for assistance i had fallen with the rest and lay against a big fellow whose back was towards me i struggled from him and was climbing the slope of the deck when she righted herself and rolled sharply over on the other side this caused an incontinent rush of bodies across the corridor again and for a moment all thought of renewing the conflict was abandoned i recognised prince frederic as the man by me and i whispered loudly in his ears so that my voice carried through the clamour and the noises of the wind that roared outside round the state rooms better make our last stand here i mean the ladies he nodded it will be better he answered harshly yes better he turned about with his hand on the door knob behind him and now i saw that we had reached the entrance to the boudoir alix yvonne he called loudly through the keyhole you know what to do beloved farewell i had refilled my revolver in the pause and with a fast beating heart turned now to that horrid cockpit once more the first person my eyes lighted on was holgate broad clean faced and grinning like a demon he shall die at any rate said prince frederic and lifted his revolver which he had reloaded it missed fire the second shot grazed holgate's arm and felled a man behind him no luck prince said the fellow in his mocking voice and in his turn raised a weapon of his own but he did not fire instead he turned swiftly round and made a dash towards the other end of the corridor to me men this way by heaven and thunder his voice fat as it was pierced the din and acted as a rallying cry several of the mutineers now confronting us again turned and followed him and there was the noise of a struggle issuing from the darkness of the top end of the corridor what the deuce is this screamed barraclough in my ear i don't know let's fall on there's an alarm they're now by the lord it's legrand thank god legrand legrand bully for legrand cried barraclough wiping some blood from his face and he set upon the mutineers from the rear those left to face us had scarcely recovered from their astonishment at the alarm when the prince shot two and a third went down to me the others retreated towards their companions and the three of us followed them up i say the three for i could not see lane anywhere and i feared that he had fallen the conflict thus renewed upon more equal terms found nevertheless most of the participants worn and exhausted at least i can answer for myself and i am sure that my companions were in a like case the twilight that reigned disguised the scene of the struggle so that each man saw but little beyond his own part in the affair yet i was conscious that the mutineers were being pushed back towards the deck door they had been caught between the two parties as it appeared and legrand's unexpected onset from the music saloon entrance had thrown them into confusion it was obvious that legrand and his men were armed for i heard a shot or two issuing from the melee and above the noise of the oaths and thuds and thumpings was the clash of steel presently my man who had engaged me over long dropped and before me was a little vacancy of space at the end of which hard by the door i discerned the bulky form of holgate he was leaning against the wall as if faint and a revolver dropped from his fingers by god doctor if i'd had any idea of this i'd have crucified 'em all he said to me savagely but i'll get square yet first you and now legrand i'll be square yet as he spoke panting he heaved himself higher against the wall and levelled his revolver in a flash my arm descended and knocked the weapon to the floor i could see his grin even in the dim light well it was empty anyway man he said but i'll give you best for the present i've my ship to look after i could have struck him down then and there and i raised my point to do so but he seized my arm don't be a fool my lad she'll be gone in this wind if i don't take charge have your fling if you want it he screamed in my face above the clamour for the noise of the wind was now increased and grown into a roar it sounded as a menace in the ears and i involuntarily paused and looked out of the doorway the heavens were black the waters ran white to the gunwale and the sea queen staggered like a drunkard on her course holgate's practised eye had taken in the situation and he had seen that he was necessary to the navigation of the yacht and yet i marvelled at his coolness at the strength of will and heroic resolution which could turn him of a sudden from one filled with the lust of blood and greed and battle into the patient sailor with his ship to save these thoughts ran through my head as i paused it was only a brief pause so brief that it was no time ere i rejoined my companions in their attack on the failing mutineers but in it i had a glimpse deep into the chief mutineer's nature i let him go his argument came home to me i do not know that i could be said to have considered rather his individuality dominated me in this appeal to something beyond our immediate quarrel to a more ultimate good perhaps his very assurance which was almost contemptuous in its expression helped to dissuade me i dropped my arm and he went outside as i turned back i saw him stay a moment and look upon us that pack of desperate wolves and watch dogs almost i could think he lifted his lips in a grin over his fancy then he disappeared into the gathering gloom and as i say i returned to the attack a few minutes later the mutineers broke and scattered their resistance was at an end and they fled out into the night leaving our party breathless wounded but secure and triumphant i say secure but alas the price of that security had been heavy legrand with two of his men had escaped unhurt but two were dead and two seriously wounded lane had his face cut open barraclough had come off with a nasty stab in the ribs and prince frederic was not to be found we hunted in that scene of carnage and i discovered him at last under the body of a dead mutineer when we had got him forth he was still unconscious but breathed heavily and i found traces of internal injuries i administered what was necessary including a restorative and he came to presently well sir said he weakly what's the report by heaven sir we've licked them i cried good news sir the dogs have run they shall be hanged in due course said he in a loud voice my luck holds doctor he waved his hand weakly down the corridor tell the ladies acquaint her royal highness it was the first time he had given his sister her proper style and in a way this might be taken by those who look for omens as auspicious did his luck indeed hold as he said i took the office on myself the sea queen was galloping like a racer and plunged as she ran two steps took me to the boudoir door before which lay the body of one of our enemies as the ship rolled it slipped away and began to creep down the corridor the yacht reared before she dipped again and a cascade of spray streamed over the side and entered by the broken door i rapped loudly and called loudly and in a trice the door opened and the princess alix stood before me glimmering like a ghost in the darkness they are gone i shouted we have won thank god he has heard us she exclaimed i could hear nothing for the sound of the sea and the wind but oh the suspense was terrible my hair should be white mademoiselle i asked mademoiselle sleeps said she and i thought there was something significant in her voice it was well that mademoiselle slept i left her and went back to the prince for more than he needed my care and as i reached the group the roll of the yacht sent me flying legrand caught me we can't spare you yet doctor he shouted thank god for you i answered fervently you came in the nick of time i thought we might have cut our way out last night but i found we couldn't he explained you see we only had one knife and it has been a tough job to get through the heavy wood of the partition thank god i repeated and clutched at him again as the floor rose up i'm not accustomed to this i said with a laugh it's worse than the mutineers he answered nothing for his gaze was directed towards the door we must take charge he shouted good lord there's no time to lose holgate's there i screamed back he went to look after the ship we stood holding on to each other and barraclough lane and the prince were holding on by the brass rods on the cabin doors she rolled and kicked and stood up at an angle of deg what is it i screamed legrand pointed to the blackness without we'll get it in a little i hope to god it will be no worse than this she can't stand on her head with safety suddenly the roar swelled louder and dismal shrieks and whistlings sounded in the ears the sea queen sank and a whole tide of sea rushed over the bulwarks and flooded the state rooms the water ran knee deep and set the bodies of the dead awash one struck against me in the whirlpool it was a ghastly scene set in that gathered darkness nothing can be done we've got to hold on said legrand he's a good seaman i'll say that for him but how many's he got with him he's undermanned it's all on the engine room now we were silent again mainly because it was almost impossible to hear anything through that tempest of wind and volcanic sea she came right for a moment and our grip of each other relaxed i'm going legrand i called to him don't be a fool said he oh i'm all right i've forgotten something i shouted i'll see to myself and i cut myself adrift from him i crossed the corridor successfully and then the yacht heeled and i was almost precipitated to the other end of it she was being knocked about like a tin pot in a gale i seized a door handle and hung on and when the vessel recovered somewhat i twisted it but it did not give the boudoir must be farther on i crept on by means of the brass railing and at last reached a door which gave i opened it and called out princess princess blackness filled the room i could hear and see nothing human i entered and the door swung to behind with a clang princess i shouted but i could hear no answer i groped in the darkness with both hands and then i touched an arm i seized it and drew the owner to me gently princess i called and this time an answer reached me through the raging elements it is i thank god you're safe do not be alarmed i said speaking into her ear the yacht's caught in a hurricane but there fell at that instant a resounding crash far above the noise of the storm and we were thrown headlong against the outer wall of the boudoir i knew that only and then i knew no more chapter xviii at dead of night consciousness flowed back upon me slowly and i emerged in pain and in intense bewilderment from my swoon the first sound that came to me in my awakening was the terrific roar of the water against the side of the yacht the next a woman's scream recalling now the incidents exactly preceding my fall i stirred and endeavoured to sit up and then i was aware of being pinned down by a weight it was as will be remembered pitch dark but i put out my hand and felt the beating of a heart there was also unmistakably a woman's bodice under my fingers it was princess alix who had fallen with me but what had happened and what noise was screaming through the night even above all that awful tumult of waste water and wild wind i answered the second query first it was mademoiselle well she could wait my first concern must be for the princess who lay upon me a dead weight but as i knew a living breathing body i carefully extricated myself and raised her the yacht was stooping at an angle and i was forced back against the wall with my burden if it had been only light and i had known which way to move i laid the princess on the couch which i discovered by groping and tried to open the door it was jammed then it dawned upon me that the screw had stopped the noise of its beating was not among the many noises i heard if it had stopped only one thing could have happened the sea queen must be ashore that was the explanation we had struck i was now the more anxious as you may conceive to get out of the cabin for if we had struck it was essential to know how we stood and what degree of risk we ran for all i knew the yacht might be sinking at that moment or breaking up upon rocks finding egress through the door impossible i made my way with difficulty to the other side of the boudoir where i knew there was a communication with the bedrooms this door stood open as it had been flung by the shock and i was now able to locate the sounds of the screaming they came from the cabin beyond which i knew to be mademoiselle's i guided myself as well as i could to the door giving access to the corridor and unlocked it as i did so a speck of light gleamed in the darkness and arrested me it enlarged and emerged upon me till it took the shape of a candle and underneath it i beheld the capable face of the french maid juliette it is necessary i should have something to quiet mademoiselle monsieur said she in her tranquil way i am in search of something now for the princess juliette i explained thank god for your light how did you get it i always have a candle with me when i travel monsieur she replied she was the most sensible woman i had ever met and i could have embraced her the yacht has gone aground i said i will find out how much damage has been done i will bring back what is necessary the princess lies in there see to her with that i left her and stepped into the corridor like the cabins it was opaque with the night but i groped my way across it without hearing any sounds of living people only that terrible turmoil of waters without i knew where my bag was it was in the small cabin which the prince used as his smoking room and in which we had sometimes played cards to pass the time during those days of anxiety and trouble the first door i opened seemed to give me access to the open sea the wind ramped in my face and would have thrown me back and i was drenched with a cascade of water i thought i must have opened the door to the deck until i remembered that that had been destroyed in the fight i put out a hand and it touched a piece of furniture and then once again the sea broke over me there could be no other solution of the puzzle than this that the outer wall of the cabin had been carried away i judged that i was in the prince's room i retraced my way opening the door with difficulty and once more in the shelter of the corridor felt my way along the railing there seemed to be a foot of water about my legs and it was icy chill the next handle i hit upon i turned as before and the door came back upon me with a rush almost sending me headlong i entered the cabin and by dint of groping i reached the upholstered couch at the back my bag was not where i had left it but it could not be far away the salt water flowed and oozed on the floor but i dropped to my knees and hunted for it and was at last rewarded by finding it jammed into a corner under a cupboard getting back into the corridor i had now to determine whether to return at once to the princess or to go in search of news i stood wavering reluctant to leave her in her swoon all untended and yet conscious that it would be wiser to ascertain the extent of our damages happily the decision was not forced upon me for i saw in the distance a swinging lantern which seemed to be advancing towards me down the corridor i shouted and the dim figure behind it stopped and turned the light upon me you phillimore it was barraclough's voice what has happened i asked struck on a reef he roared back she's tight yet i think but where are the ladies let me have your lantern and i'll take you to them said i and thanking providence for that signal mercy i crossed the corridor with him the lantern shed a benign light upon the wreck of the boudoir the princess lay where i had left her but her eyes were open and i made use of my flask of cognac with beneficial results then i was plucked by the arm and barraclough claimed my attention mademoiselle trebizond is ill he called give her something you must see to her of course that was my duty and i took such steps as seemed necessary for one of so neurotic a nature she is all right i explained if the ship's in no danger just now they are best here the maid has a candle i returned to princess alix and found her recovered and i bade her be of good cheer shouting for it was always shouting that we had defied the mutineers successfully and that we should also successfully defy the elements then i went back for i had other work to do barraclough informed me that the prince had been taken to the music saloon and lane also was there i therefore joined the relics of our company in that devastated chamber and did what my skill availed to do for the injured the prince had been struck on the head and in the body but the marks were not very apparent he breathed heavily but had still his old air of authority lane bubbled over with alternate fumes of petulance and passion but he had his excuse as he was suffering a great deal of pain ellison too wounded as he was had dragged himself from his temporary hospital to the music room but one of legrand's men had vanished and it was supposed he had gone overboard in one of the great tides of sea that swept over the yacht legrand had ventured on deck and clinging to the railings had endeavoured to get some notion of the position of things but he had seen and heard nothing beyond the storm she's firm so far he shouted in my ears and the night's clearing i can see a star the star of hope i answered he shrugged his shoulders they may be at the pumps but the sea's moderating and the wind's dropping we shall know presently something was now drawing me irresistibly back to the princess my heart pined for the sight of her and the assurance that she had suffered no injury i grew restless at the inaction and weary and bruised as i was i think passion gave me wings and endurance i left the music saloon and emerged into the lobby where the stairs went down to the saloon below the sea was breaking through the shattered door on the one side but on the lee the sea queen was tilted upwards and it was there she lay in irons no doubt upon some rocks or shores if only the day would dawn as i stood awhile before entering the corridor through another shattered doorway the glimmer of a light caught my eye it came from the door upon the farther side of the lobby seeming to shine through the keyhole as i watched the door opened and let in a blast of wind that shook the broken woodwork it also let in the figure of a man and that man seen dimly in the shades of the light he carried was holgate i drew myself up into the fastness of the gloom and stared at him he had turned the shutter in his lantern now for it was a bull's eye and the darkness was once more universal but i had a feeling that he had a companion and although i necessarily lost sight of holgate i was assured in myself that he had descended the stairway any noise his heavy feet might make would be absorbed into the general racket of the night i stood and wondered what was holgate's object in this silent expedition i confess my curiosity rose high to a pitch indeed at which it might not be denied a surmise sprang into my mind but i hardly allowed it time to formulate for not a minute after the recognition i too was on my way down the stairs it was comparatively easy to descend for as i have said there was no danger of discovery from noise and i had the balustrade under my hand when i had reached the floor below i caught the gleam of the lantern in the distance and i pursued it down one of the passages this pursuit took me past the cabins towards the kitchen and then i came to an abrupt pause for the lantern too had stopped i could make out holgate's bulky form and the light flashing on the walls and now too i found that my senses had not deceived me and that there was a second man he stood in the shadow so that i could not identify him and both men were peering into an open door my position in the passage began to assume a perilous character and i made investigations in my neighbourhood near me was the door of a cabin which i opened without difficulty and entered now by putting out my head i could see the mutineers while i had a refuge in the event of their turning back they were still bent forwards peering into the room i thought that with good luck i might venture farther while they were so engrossed with their occupation so leaving my hiding place i stole forwards boldly to the next cabin and entered it as i had entered the former i was now quite close to them and suddenly i saw who was holgate's companion it was pye with equal celerity did my brain take in the situation and interpret it indeed i should have guessed at it long before i think had not the events of the night thrown me into a state of confusion it was the treasure they looked at and this was where pye had concealed it as this truth came home to me holgate lifted his head and i drew back setting the cabin door ajar presently after the bull's eye flashed through the crack of the door and stayed there for a moment i thought all was up and that my retreat had been discovered but i was soon reassured the noise of the water had fallen and above it or rather through it i could hear holgate's voice fatly decisive she'll hold i tell you for twenty four hours at any rate even without pumps hang it man do you suppose i can take the risk now they're sick enough as it is all blood and no money we must let it lie for a bit and take our opportunity pye's voice followed i could not hear what he said but holgate's was in answer and coldly impatient you've the stomach of a nursery governess good heavens to run in harness with you what the deuce do i know we're cast away that's certain but i will be hanged if i lose what i've played for mr pye so put that in your pipe the light went out and the voice faded presently i opened the door and looked out upon profound darkness i knew my way about the yacht by that time and was not discomposed by the situation the mutineer and his treacherous confederate were gone and i must make the best of my time to follow them nothing could be effected without a light and i had no means of procuring one in those nether regions i retraced my way more or less by instinct until i came out at the foot of the stairway and knew it was easy to regain the upper regions instead of going to the boudoir i sought the group in the music room and was challenged by barraclough who's that phillimore i answered we must have more light have we no more lanterns yes sir said ellison's cheerful voice there's some in the steward's room good for you said i if some one will give me matches i think i'll go on a hunt the other sailor produced a box of vestas from his pocket and as he was unwounded i took him with me on my return journey in the steward's room we found several lanterns as well as some bottles of beer and some cold fowl we made a selection from this and got safely back to our friends here we lit two or three of the lanterns and i opened some of the beer and left them to a repast you will be thinking that i had not kept my word and had neglected what should have been my prime duty i had not forgotten however was it likely and i made haste at once to the quarters of the ladies taking with me something which should make me welcome which was a lighted lantern princess alix was quite recovered but showed great anxiety for news of her brother i was able to quiet her fears by describing the supper at which i had left him and her eyes brightened he is so good and brave she said simply he is so noble he has always thought of others that the prince was fond of his sister was manifest and it was patent too that he was attached to the woman for whom he had thrown all away and was thus imperilled yet i should not have attributed to him inordinate unselfishness i made no reply however beyond urging her to follow her brother's example and fortify herself with food she waved it aside no no i am not hungry i am only anxious she said tell me are we safe for the present i said i gather that most of the mutineers are at the pumps then we are sinking she cried it does not follow i answered holgate has his own hand to play and he will play it we are safe just now god answered your prayers princess she looked me earnestly in the face and sighed yes she said softly meanwhile i discovered that mademoiselle had picked up her spirits she complained of the noise of the darkness and of the lack of sleep but she found some compensations now that it was clear that we were not going to the bottom it was magnificent monsieur that storm she exclaimed i could see the demons raging in it oh ciel it was like the terrors of the erl koenig yes but what have you there doctor oh it is beer english beer i am tired of champagne give me some beer i love the bocks it calls to mind the boulevards oh the boulevards that i shall not see never never in my life i consoled her comforting her with the assurance that we were nearer the boulevards now than we had been a few hours ago which in a way was true enough she inquired after the prince pleasantly also after barraclough and asked with cheerful curiosity when we were going to land i said i hoped it would be soon but she was content with her new toy which was english bottled ale and i left her eating daintily and sipping the foam from her toilette glass with satisfaction i returned to the music room and joined the company and after a little silence fell upon us and i found myself drift into the slumber of the weary i awoke with the grey dawn streaming in by the shattered skylights and sitting up looked about me my companions were all wrapped in slumber lane tossing restlessly with the pain of his wound i walked to the door and looked out the sea had gone down and now lapped and washed along the sides of the sea queen the sky was clear and far in the east were the banners of the morning the gentle air of the dawn was grateful to my flesh and stimulated my lungs i opened my chest to draw it in and then recrossing the lobby i peered out through the windows on the port side the dim loom of land saluted my eyes and nearer still a precipice of rocks by which the seafowl were screaming we had gone ashore on some sort of island this discovery relieved one of the anxieties that had weighed upon me at last we had a refuge not only from the violence and treachery of the ocean but also from the murderous ruffians who had possession of the yacht it was therefore with a lighter heart that i descended into the cabins and made my way along the passage to the point where i had seen holgate and pye stop i identified the door which they had opened and after a little manoeuvring i succeeded in getting it open it was the cook's pantry in which i now found myself and i proceeded to examine carefully every drawer and every cupboard by the meagre light of the dawn i had not been at work ten minutes before i came upon the contents of the safes safely stowed in a locker well if the documents and gold could be shifted once they could be shifted again and forthwith i set about the job it pleased me i know not why to choose no other place than pye's cabin in which to rehide them i think the irony of the choice decided me upon it and also it was scarcely likely that holgate and his accomplice would think of looking for the treasure in the latter's room it took me quite an hour to make the transfer during which time i was not interrupted by any alarm whatever holgate and his men were doing they evidently did not deem that there was any center of interest in the saloon cabins at that moment my task accomplished i returned to the music room in which the wounded men still slept restlessly i occupied my time in preparing a meal and i took a strong glass of whisky and water for my strength was beginning to ebb i had endured much and fought hard and had slept but little as i stood looking down on my companions i was aware of a grey shadow that the slender sunlight cast as a ghost upon the wall i turned and saw the princess she was clad as for a journey and warmly against the cold and her face was pale and anxious you are astir dr phillimore she said yes said i i could not sleep nor i she returned with a sigh i sometimes feel that i shall never sleep again the sound of the storm and the noises of the fight the oaths the cries they are forever beating in my brain they will pass i replied encouragingly i do believe we are destined to safety look forth there and you will see the morning mists on the island yes she assented i saw that we had struck on an island and that is why i am here our chance is given us dr phillimore we must go i looked doubtfully at the sleeping men yes yes i know but my brother will be more reasonable now she pursued he will see things in another light he has done all for honour that honour calls for he has done too much said i somewhat bitterly for i realised how greatly he had imperilled his sister she made no answer to that but approached and looked down at the prince who lay with his head pillowed on the cushioned seat he is well enough she asked he is well enough to leave the yacht if he will consent i answered perhaps it was the sound of our voices though we had both pitched them low at any rate prince frederic stirred and sat up slowly good morning alix he said affectionately and his eyes alighted on me as if wondering the princess went forward and embraced him dr phillimore has kindly got breakfast for you she said you must eat frederic for we are going to leave the yacht this morning she spoke decisively as if she had taken control of affairs out of his hands and he smiled back are those your orders alix you were always wilful from a child no no she cried smiling too i always obeyed your orders frederic it was you who were hero to me not karl or wilhelm only you he patted her hand and glanced at the food i had obtained we owe to dr phillimore a debt of gratitude he said in his friendliest manner the talking had disturbed barraclough also who now awoke and saluted us he made no difficulty of beginning at once on his breakfast cracking a joke at my expense it was a strangely pacific gathering after the terrible night but i suppose we were all too worn to take things in duly there is a limit to the power of facts to make impressions on one's senses and i think we had reached it for the most part we were just animals with an appetite but there was my news and i hastened to break it it was not startling but it had an interest for us all the prince deliberated it is fate he said slowly it is the luck of the hochburgers barraclough's comment was from a different aspect that's a trick to us we've a shot in the locker yet what is it you mean asked the prince why that we can drive a bargain with them replied barraclough we've got the whip hand there shall no bargain be made with murderers said the prince in his deep voice frederic said princess alix in a quick impulsive way let us escape while there is time the way is clear now we can get to the island and be quit forever of those dreadful men and horrible scenes the prince let his glance fall on her there is something to be done here he said at last the luck of the hochburgers holds he was ill for certain perhaps he was more than ill but at that moment i had no patience with him i turned on my heel and left the room chapter xix the tragedy it was quite obvious that we could not offer any resistance to another attack if one should be made all told and excluding the women there were but seven of us and three of these were disabled by their wounds we did not of course know how the mutineers had fared but it was certain that their assault had cost them dear the heavy seas had washed overboard dead and dying and it was impossible for us to say how many enemies were left to us it might be that with their diminished numbers they would not risk another attack particularly as they had found us develop so fierce a resistance but on the other hand the rank and file of the mutineers believed us to be in possession of the treasure as we actually were once more and it was likely that they would make yet another attempt to gain it but they on their side could not tell how we had suffered and they would be sure to use caution for these reasons i did not think that we need fear an immediate assault but we thought it advisable to concentrate our forces against an emergency we therefore abandoned the music room and secured ourselves as well as possible in the wreck of the state rooms using furniture and trunks and boxes as barricades for my part my heart echoed the princess's wish i was in favour of abandoning the yacht and trusting to the chances of the island as the sun rose higher we got glimpses of this through the windows and the verdure looked inviting after so many weary weeks of desolate water the tops of the hills seemed barren but i had no doubt that there was more fertility in the valleys which were not swept by the bluff winds of the wild sea but the prince was obstinate and relying upon his luck was dragging down with him the lives of the two women he loved to say nothing of the rest of our company we had therefore to make the best of the situation and to sit down and await issues with what composure we might the prince himself had recovered wonderfully though i did not like the look of the dent on his head which had been dealt apparently by the back of an axe his power of recuperation astonished me and i was amazed on leaving the cabin in which lane was housed to find him entering the doorway that led from the lobby i remonstrated with him for it was evident that he had been wandering and i wanted him to rest so as to have all his strength for use later should it be necessary he smiled queerly yet you would have me take a turn on the island doctor he said i saw it in your eyes i will not have you encourage the princess so it is my wish to stay i will see my luck to the end this was the frame of his mind and you will conceive how impossible to move one so fanatically fixed on his course indeed the futility of argument was evident from the first and i made no attempt barraclough too retired defeated though it was by no means his last word on the point as you shall hear i was seated in the corridor some three hours later near what should have been four bells when i heard my name called softly i looked about me without seeing any one the wounded men were resting and legrand was at the farther end of the corridor acting as sentinel over our makeshift of a fortress i sat wondering and then my name was called again called in a whisper that nevertheless penetrated to my ears and seemed to carry on the quiet air i rose and went towards legrand did you call i asked he shook his head no said he i heard my name distinctly i said oh don't get fancying things phillimore he said with impatient earnestness my dear fellow there's only you and barraclough and me now well i'd better swallow some of my own medicine i retorted grimly and left him i walked back again and turned as i did so the call came to me so clearly and so softly that i knew it was no fancy on my part and now i involuntarily lifted my eyes upwards to the skylights one of these had been shattered in the gale doctor i gazed in amazement and suddenly holgate's face passed momentarily over the hole in the glass doctor can you spare me ten minutes what in the name of wonder was this i paused looked down the corridor towards legrand and reflected then i took it in at a guess and i resolved to see him where i asked in a voice so modulated that it did not reach legrand here the promenade came back the reply i whistled softly but made no answer then i walked away legrand said i i'm going for a turn i've got an idea don't let your idea get you said he bluffly i assured him that i was particular about my personal safety and with his assistance the door was opened behind the barricade for the first time for two days i found myself on the deck and in the open air hastily glancing about me to make sure that no mutineers were in the neighbourhood i walked to the foot of the ladder that gave access to the promenade deck above and quickly clambered to the top at first i could see no sign of holgate and then a head emerged from behind the raised skylights and he beckoned to me sit here doctor said he you'll be safe here no harm shall come to you he indicated a seat under cover of one of the extra boats which was swung inside the promenade deck for use in the event of emergencies and he himself set me the example of sitting i suppose you've come armed he said i tapped my breast pocket significantly so said he smiling well you're plucky but you're not a fool and i won't forget that little affair downstairs i'll admit you might have dusted me right up if you'd chosen but you didn't you had a clear head and refrained on the contrary said i i've been thinking ever since what a dolt i was not to shoot you don't shoot the man at the wheel lad said he with a grin oh you weren't that you were only the enemy why we struck half an hour later yes he assented but we're not down under yet and you can take your solemn alfred that that's where we should be now if you hadn't let me pass no doctor you spared the rod and saved the ship well she's piled up my good sir i declared so she is he admitted but she's saved all the same and i'll let you into a little secret doctor what d'ye suppose my men are busy about eh why pumping pumping for all they're worth i keep 'em well employed by thunder he laughed if it's not fight it's pump and if it weren't pump by the blazes it would be fight so you owe me one doctor you and those fine friends of yours who wouldn't pick you out of a gutter supposing we get to the point i suggested curtly that's all right there's a point about here sure enough well we're piled up on blessed hurricane island doctor as you see we struck her at a proper angle see here lies the sea queen with a bulge in her and her nose for the water she'd like to crawl off and could he waved his hand as he spoke and for the first time my gaze took in the scene we lay crooked up upon a ridge of rock and sand beyond to the right the cliffs rose in a cloud of gulls and nearer and leftwards the long rollers broke upon a little beach which sloped up to the verdure of a tiny valley it was a solitary but a not unhandsome prospect and my eyes devoured it with inward satisfaction even with longing far away a little hill was crowned with trees and the sun was shining warmly on the gray sand and blue water i turned and holgate's eye was on me she's piled up for certain but i guess she could get up and waddle if we urged her he said slowly come holgate i have no idea what this means said i i only know that a few hours ago you would have annihilated us and that we must look for the same attempt again i confess there's nothing else plain to me i'll make it plain lad said he with his lancashire accent uppermost i'm not denying what you say i told you long ago that i was going through with this and that holds i'm not going to let go now no by thunder not when i'm within an ace of it but there's been a bit of manoeuvring doctor and i think we can help each other you want a compromise i said you can call it that if you will he said but the terms i offered yesterday i repeat to day why do you take this method of offering them i inquired why not approach the prince officially well you see doctor i don't hanker after seeing the prince as you might say and then between you and me you're more reasonable and know when the butter's on the bread and there's another reason said i he slapped his thigh and laughed ah ah doctor there's no getting behind you you're a fair daisy he said good humouredly yes there's another reason which is by way of manoeuvring as i have said my men are at the pumps or they would be at you you see you've got the treasure oh only a few hours since i said lightly his fang showed that's so but so far as my men know you've had it all along now i wonder where you hid it perchance in a steward's pantry doctor very likely i assented his sombre eyes which never smiled scrutinised me i'd put my shirt on it that 'twas you doctor he said presently what a man you are it couldn't be that worm pye naturally so it must be you i'm nuts on you i rose i'm afraid holgate you can't offer any terms which would be acceptable i said drily well it's a fair exchange he said i guess i can keep my men aloof for a bit and we can get her off there's not much the matter with the yacht i'll land your party on the coast in return for the boodle the prince would not do it i answered nor would i advise him to do so for one reason if for no other i spoke deliberately and looked him in the face fully what may that be he asked meeting my gaze you would not keep your word i said he shook his head you're wrong doctor you're wholly wrong you haven't got my measure yet hanged if you have i thought you had a clearer eye what interest have i in your destruction none in the world credit me with some common sense holgate i replied sharply dead men tell no tales nor dead women he said meaningly and i shuddered but good lord i kill no man save in fight surrender and i'll keep the wolves off you they only want the money which they would not get i put in he smiled not resenting this insinuation that's between me and my maker he said with bold blasphemy anyway i'm not afraid of putting your party at liberty i know a corner or two i can look after myself i've got my earths to run to it's no use i said firmly well there's an alternative he said showing his teeth and that's war and when it comes to war lives don't count of either sex no by blazes they don't dr phillimore he stood up and faced me his mouth open his teeth apart and that malicious grin wrinkling all but his smouldering feral eyes i turned my back on him without a word and descended to the deck i had not a notion what was to be done but i knew better than to trust to the ravening mercies of that arch mutineer holgate was aware that the treasure was gone and he wished to jockey us into a surrender that was the gist of my interview which i hastened to communicate to my companions legrand and barraclough listened with varying faces expressions flitted over the former's as shadows over a sea but the baronet was still as rock yes and as hard it seemed to me you people have all got a bee in your bonnet in respect of a compromise he said with a sneer you follow the prince and god knows he's no judge he's a fanatic hang it phillimore haven't you tumbled to that yet he was a fanatic it was true but i did not like barraclough's tone then you would trust the lives of this company including the ladies to holgate i asked sharply with proper reservations and safeguards he said i threw out my hands you talk of safeguards and you're dealing with a cut throat what safeguards could you have well we might stipulate for a surrender of all the firearms said barraclough knitting his brow it wouldn't wash said legrand decidedly do you think they'd give up all they had no it would only be a pretence a sham i agree with the doctor that holgate's safety is only spelled out by our deaths there you have it in a nutshell the man can't afford to let us go free barraclough assumed a mule like look very well said he then we're wiped out as soon as he cares to move and he turned away angrily an hour later i was passing the ladies' cabins when a door flew open and mademoiselle jumped out on me in a state of agitation what is this doctor she cried this 'olgate offers to put us on shore safe and you refuse refuse to give him up the money you must not you must bargain with him our lives depend on it and you will arrange that he leaves us sufficient to get to civilisation again mademoiselle said i quietly i am not in authority here it is the prince the prince he is ill she went on in her voluble french he is not master of himself as you well know he is not to be trusted to make a decision sir john shall do it he is captain it should be done with all my heart and now mademoiselle i said if we could put any reliance on the man's word but how can we after his acts after this bloody mutiny she clasped her hands together in terror then we shall be doomed to death monsieur ah try consent let us see what he will offer sir john shall do it for me whose life is at stake i was sorry for her fears and her agitation embarrassed me heaven knew i understood the situation even more clearly than she and to me it was formidable pregnant with peril but what could i do i did what i could to reassure her which was little enough and i left her weeping the singing bird had become suddenly conscious of her danger and was beating wildly against the bars of her cage poor singing bird princess alix had taken upon herself the office of nurse to her brother and although he refused to acknowledge the necessity of a nurse he seemed glad to have her in his room when i entered early in the afternoon after tending my other patients they were talking low together in german a tongue with which as i think i have said i was not very familiar but i caught some words and i guessed that it was of home they spoke and the linden trees in the avenue before the castle of hochburg the princess's face wore a sad smile which strove to be tender and playful at once but failed pitifully and she dropped the pretence when she faced me dr phillimore my brother is not so well he he has been wandering she said anxiously under her breath i had been afraid of the dent in the head i approached him and felt his pulse it will not be long doctor before we have these scoundrels hanged he said confidently nodding to me in his grave way we have nearly finished our work yes said i very nearly i did not like his looks he raised himself in his chair 'den lieben langen tag' alix why don't you sing that now you used to sing it when you were but a child he said relapsing into german sing alix he stared about as if suddenly remembering something if yvonne were here she would sing her voice is beautiful ach so beautiful there was a moment's silence and the princess looked at me inquiringly as it appeared to me i nodded to her and she parted her lips sweet and soft and plaintive were the strains of that old world song ah how strangely did that slender voice of beauty touch the heart while mademoiselle had sung in vain with all her art and accomplishment den lieben langen tag hab ich nur schmerz und plag und darf am abend doch nit weine wen ich am fendersteh und in die nacht nei seh so ganz alleine so muss ich weine her voice had scarce died away gently when a sound from without drew my ears and i turned towards the door the prince had closed his eyes and lay back in his chair as if he slept and his face was that of a happy child motioning to the princess to let him stay so undisturbed i moved to the door and opened it noiselessly i heard legrand's voice raised high as if in angry altercation and i stepped into the corridor and closed the door behind me i hurried down to the barricade and found barraclough and legrand struggling furiously shame i called shame what is it and i pulled legrand back he has only one arm man i said reproachfully i don't care if he has none he's betrayed us cried legrand savagely angry i stared what does it mean why that his friends are outside and that he wants to admit them said legrand with an oath barraclough met my gaze unblinkingly it's more or less true he said bluntly and i'm going to let them in i'm sick of this business and i've taken the matter in hand myself i'm captain here he spoke with morose authority and eyed me coolly i shrugged my shoulders we could not afford to quarrel but the man's obduracy angered me alas i did not guess how soon he was to pay the penalty then you have come to terms as you call it on your own account with holgate i asked yes he said defiantly and what terms may i ask he hesitated they can have the treasure in return for our safety you know my views and you know mine said i then i may take it you have revealed the secret of the treasure what the devil's it got to do with you he replied sullenly stand out of the way there i'm going to open the door and why pray if they already have the treasure you fool it's only holgate and he's here to get us to sign a document meaning said i that we are not to split on him and to keep silent as to all these bloody transactions it's our only chance he said savagely out of the way i hesitated if holgate were alone there was not much to be feared and the treasure being now in his hands what could move him to visit us surely he could have no sinister motive just then could he after all be willing to trust to his luck and release us his predestined victims as the unhappy prince had trusted to his the omen was ill the barricades had been removed evidently before legrand had arrived on the scene to interfere and even as i hesitated barraclough turned the key and the door fell open holgate waddled heavily into the corridor and took us all three in with his rolling eyes his face seemed to be broader more substantial and darker than ever and his mouth and chin marked the resolute animal even more determinedly the open door was behind him as sir john will have told you he began slowly moving his gaze from one to another i have come on a little business with him which we've got to settle before we part legrand stood in angry bewilderment and as for me i knew not how to take this had he come in good faith i would be damned if i would have struck a bargain with you holgate or dreamed of trusting you said legrand fuming but as it's done and you have the spoils what's your game now holgate sent a quick look at him and passed his hand over his forehead then he eyed me what do you suppose i'm here for he asked his eyes looking out as tigers waiting in their lair all unarmed and trusting as i am it is only reasonable to suppose that i come to fulfill my promise to sir john here he knows what that was and he's done enough to have got his money's worth we will sign if you produce the document said barraclough curtly you'll sign phillimore and you he said looking at legrand it had the air of a command but what else could we do we were at holgate's mercy and the act of signature could do us no harm on the other hand it might save us yes i said reluctantly i'll sign as it's come to that i'll follow growled legrand but if i'd known hang it let's get it over said barraclough you shall have our word of honour as gentlemen it's a pretty big thing you're asking said legrand moodily i don't know let's think it out and the prince said holgate he must sign you can manage him barraclough frowned after all it seemed more complex now with the cold light of reason on the compact look here man said he and i never was nearer liking him if you'll put us ashore within forty eight hours after floating and you can on the chili coast you'll have a fortnight's start and can chance the rest hang it holgate take your risks holgate showed his teeth in a grin i have lived forty years said he slowly and by thunder i've never taken an unnecessary risk in my life no by god i haven't and he whistled shrilly through his teeth instantaneously for they must have been in waiting half a dozen of the mutineers dashed through the doorway and before any of us could finger a weapon we were in their grip it was the simplest booby trap that ever was laid and yet it was prepared with consummate skill he had come alone and unarmed he had held us in converse and when we had lost our sense of suspicion and precaution he had brought his men upon us down went the lid of the trap i could have kicked myself legrand struggled as did barraclough but what did resistance avail the infamous pierce who had me on one side twisted my arm in warning lest i should kick futilely against the pricks steady said i it is not a question of war just now but of parley and i raised my voice so as to be heard above the noise what does this mean holgate more treachery of a special black die he seated himself on the barricade you may call it revenge said he considering me i exonerate sir john and i think legrand there but cuss me if i'm sure about you you're a black traitor cried barraclough impotently fierce whoa there sir john whoa there said the mutineer equably i've already said i exonerate you but hang it man you're a flat they've diddled you i'm no traitor i'd have struck to my bargain and trusted you but by the lord what am i to do when i find i'm dealing with a pack of hucksters what's your game repeated legrand blowing hard holgate indicated barraclough if he had carried out his part i was prepared to carry out mine as he hasn't he left his end in space you haven't the treasure i cried in surprise but holgate's gaze had gone beyond us and was directed at something down the corridor i moved my head with difficulty and as i did so i saw holgate take a revolver from one of his men he sat fingering it and that was all i observed for my eyes slewing round had caught sight of the prince and princess the prince moved heavily towards us with an uncertain gait and alix's face was full of terror and wonder in that instant i remembered something and i saw in my mind's eye the figure of the prince labouring through the doorway that gave access to the stairs to the lower deck it was he who had removed the treasure and holgate had been cheated a second time even as this revelation came to me i wondered at the self restraint of the man he was as cool as if he sat at dinner among friends merely resting a finger on the trigger of his weapon the muzzle of which he held to the ground what is this sir demanded the prince coming to a pause and staring at the scene holgate answered nothing i doubt if the prince had seen him from where he stood for he addressed barraclough and now he repeated his question with dignity at that moment a door opened somewhere with a click and mademoiselle entered the corridor barraclough made no sign but with his teeth on his under lip stared before him helplessly but you have the treasure suddenly cried a tremulous voice in broken english and mademoiselle was in our midst go back messieurs you have broke your word you have the treasure the prince stared at her what treasure he asked with a puzzled expression sir john has made peace with them she cried excitedly he has delivered up the treasure and they will let us go free it is all settled let him go 'olgate you shall let him go why said the prince with a singular expression on his face it means i am surrounded with traitors there is treachery everywhere yvonne you have betrayed me ah non non she cried plaintively clasping her hands together we shall be saved sir john sees to that so you made terms said the prince to barraclough in his deep voice of fury i acted for the best said barraclough and now that he met the storm he faced it with dignity perhaps i alone knew the measure of his temptation he had fallen a victim to the arts of a beautiful woman there was nought else could have melted that obdurate british heart or turned that obstinate british mind this obtuseness had been his ruin and he must have recognised it then for he had admitted the enemy and our stronghold was in their hands but the last blow had yet to fall fool said the prince with a bitter laugh the treasure is not there you have played without cards i will be damned if i didn't think it was his royal highness said holgate in his even voice and as he spoke he rose into sight it was grotesque as it sounded certainly not a bit like the prelude of high tragedy yet that was on the way and fell at once holgate's voice arrested the prince and he started as if now for the first time aware of the presence of the mutineers till that moment he had merely been bent on rating a servant with the swiftness of lightning he drew and levelled a revolver i saw holgate's fat bull neck and body lean to one side and drop awkwardly and then an exclamation sprang up on my left where gray and another were holding barraclough captive the bullet had gone over holgate's head as he dodged it and had found its home in sir john's heart his body dropped between the captors the princess gave a cry of horror holgate cast a glance behind him you're too mighty dangerous he said easily and put up his own weapon but before it could reach the level the prince with a slight start clapped the revolver to his own head and pulled the trigger alix he cried weakly and then something low in german and as he fell the life must have left him his sister bent over him her face white like the cerements of the dead and mademoiselle ran forward frederic she cried mon frederic and broke into violent sobs good god said legrand trembling chapter xx the escape the shock of the tragedy which had taken place in so brief a space and so unexpectedly threw me into confusion i knew i was gazing at the princess who was bent over her brother and i heard the weeping of mademoiselle trebizond punctuating the deep silence which had fallen after those two reports there was some movement among the mutineers which i did not understand and presently i found that legrand and i were being marched to one of the cabins doctor do you know anything of this sounded a voice in my ear and i was aware that holgate was speaking the treasure man the treasure he added seeing i suppose some bewilderment in my face no said i shortly the only man who did is dead very well said he sharply i'll deal with you when i have time and he hurried off our captors shoved legrand and myself into what had been the prince's smoking room and gave us to understand that we were to be shot down if we made any attempt to escape the rest of these pirates i conceived must be in full cry after the spoils for i heard the sound of the doors being opened and the noise of voices exchanging calls and sour oaths presently the door was thrust aside and the princess and mademoiselle were ushered in unceremoniously by the foul faced pierce they were resolved to box us up in our prison until they had settled on a fate for us the princess was pale but quiet in contrast with her companion who was still in a storm of sobs she declared that she was doomed that she was betrayed and in a breath vowed that her frederic would have saved her had he been alive she appealed to us in turn for aid and called god to witness that we were cowards and would desert her and hand her over to death in a word she behaved with that hysterical exhibition of nerves which i had noted in her at the outset of our hapless voyage princess alix on the other hand was still and silent she made no attempt to calm her companion and it was as if she heard not those weak and selfish wailings once her blank gaze fell upon me as it wandered and i was alarmed so tragic were the eyes i got up and put my hand impulsively on her arm princess i said in a low voice her lip quivered she hid her face i went back to my seat who was i that i should intervene upon that infinite private sorrow no the past was not for me the future faced me pressed upon me staring bleakly and cruelly upon our condition was all over had we to remain there merely at holgate's pleasure helpless victims to his will sheep ready for the slaughter that he destined for us i swore in my heart in that hour that it should not be not without a struggle i took god to witness in my inmost soul that i would die before harm should touch the princess no all was not lost yet not so long as we were free to move and breathe and think intelligently but if anything were to be done it must be attempted ere holgate remembered us again he had placed the guard upon us and he would not turn his thoughts our way again until he had either found what he was looking for or despaired of finding it how long would the search go on as i resolved the situation in my head ideas began to assume form in my quickening brain in the cabin under watch and ward were the two ladies legrand and myself lane and ellison were elsewhere if they had not been killed by the mutineers as i almost feared also there was juliette mademoiselle's maid what had become of her it was not death i feared for her but the mutineers it was quite certain would think of nothing but running to earth the treasure for the present the prince had successfully concealed it but of course the space on a yacht is limited and it seemed as if in time the discovery must be made how long would it be but then came in a flash a disturbing thought they would abandon their hunt when the light failed until the following morning and the interlude would direct their attention to their unfortunate prisoners if they found the treasure by that time it might be too late for us but if they went on till dark i thought i saw light at last in these reflections we must wait and act as soon as darkness fell one thing that gave me hope was that our guards showed no special vigilance i suppose this was partly because we were considered to be safely disposed of and partly because they were interested in the progress of the search now and then one of them opened the door and glanced in shutting it again abruptly to resume conversation with his companion we had been deprived of our weapons and the outward windows towards the deck were so small as to forbid the possibility of escape that way even had the intermittent visitations of our sentries been wanting another thing encouraged me which was that we were free to talk unheeded what could the communion of helpless unarmed prisoners matter i glanced at legrand who sat back his eyes staring at the ceiling his arms folded a deep frown bitten in his forehead legrand i whispered his eyes dropped to my level they will be busy till dark what about dusk he stirred and shifted towards me odd i've been thinking the same he answered in a low tone we may have one more chance if we make it we must make it said i i'll tell you what it is phillimore said he there's something we can't do without in our circumstances and i think i know where to find it he rose and opened a cupboard in the wall from which he brought out a bottle of brandy some glasses and some tinned foods there's always been some kept here he added and as i live a knife if only a jack knife well she'll do man first to open the tins and then he left his meaning in the air when the tins were opened i endeavoured to persuade the princess to eat she refused at first from lips of marble but i used my authority as a doctor come i said with asperity you're under orders here princess you must do as you're told her lips quivered i will try she said in a strangled voice mademoiselle had sat up some time ago and dried her tears i think she had worn herself out with that passion of weeping and her nimble wits began to flow again you are right doctor she said it is well to eat otherwise we become weak i will eat and then see what may be done bravo mademoiselle said i that is spoken like a sensible woman yes she went on i will try my eloquence upon them those beasts they will not harm me if i speak to them it was sir john before and he was only a man and clumsy i will sing to them if necessary i will charm them have i not done it before i wondered if the poor lady had any guess in her mind had any realisation at all of what human passions let loose as upon that ship amounted to she spoke as a child as a vain and hopeful child boasting of her influence but it was the mood i wanted rather than the hysterical state of tears we ate and drank a little brandy and water without interruption from without and turned once more to the thought of escape the search was still going on as sounds that came to our ears indicated and slowly the room darkened with the enveloping night i could just see the princess across the cabin legrand whispered to me they're still hard at work we shall have our chance soon our plan was simple if we could once get quit of our guards one of the smaller boats lay on the starboard side and hanging outwards from the davits could from the slant of the sea queen as she lay on the rocks be easily dropped and floated if we could lower her into the water and get the ladies into her it would be possible under cover of the darkness and the preoccupation of the mutineers to reach the island once there we must of course trust to our luck for food and shelter legrand got to his feet and moved noiselessly towards the door the yacht was comparatively still and we could hear the lapping of the quiet sea beyond the broken windows i followed him we have one jack knife i whispered in his ear he nodded and there are two men he whispered back is the door locked he fumbled softly i don't think so they did not turn the key last time but it's a question of who's outside if the body of the mutineers are still there we're done if the two are alone they are alone i whispered i can hear no noise they're hunting elsewhere the darkness about suits us now explain to the ladies he said under his breath let them be ready directly we are i went back to the couch and poured out my story through the darkness i spoke to two shadows and as i did so a hand moved in the air and touched mine i took it and it was cold like the snows in january i pressed it softly be of good heart i will come back and do not cry out even as i stole back in that critical moment my heart bounded for i knew to whom the hand belonged body of love should not i know it in the grave i reached legrand ready i said you take the nearest said he a jack knife carries farther i shall want it i said i have only my fingers you shall have it he said grimly one at a time fingers or throat mind you and no noise have you got your muscles back you're a strong man phillimore but by heaven all rests on your fingers and you have been wounded i could tear down the pillars of gaza at this moment i replied my blood's afire god be with us he muttered and slowly turned the handle the door opened inwards and in the darkness loomed a single figure legrand sprang and the two disappeared in a heap upon the floor i had leapt to one side and was feeling in the air for my enemy but my hands took nothing nor could my eyes make out any other figure in the gloom presently something rose from the floor and i heard legrand's voice he's alone there was only the one yes i whispered back and the mutineers are gone from here faint noises issued from below acquainting us in what direction the search had flowed all the better said legrand the way's clear for us where are the women i found my way into the cabin again and called them in a low voice give me your hand said i to the first that reached me i recognised the tall figure mademoiselle was petite i conducted both through the doorway and the princess stumbled and gave vent to a little moan it was the dead man i pulled her to me legrand said i you must take mademoiselle she will not find her way alone and i must have an arm free i want two he growled at that moment a beam of light flashed from the cabins across the way legrand gave vent to a hiss of warning and moved off i could see his shadow for a moment and then it was swallowed in the blackness he was waiting and watching outside the cabin the light streamed out in a fan towards us and revealed in the opening of a door a man's form and even as it did legrand struck the man went down in silence and legrand bent over and picked up the lantern which had clashed to the floor he stooped and examined the face of his victim then he crossed to us and on my arm a hand was trembling like a leaf in the wind courage i whispered and i groped for mademoiselle on the other side it was the other man said legrand calmly i don't know what he did there but we've got a bull's eye which is so much to the good come let's get on we passed down the corridor and through the bare doorway to the deck here the breath of the night blew softly on our faces legrand moved along the bulwarks till he reached the davits from which the boat depended standing into the opaque blackness he cut at the ropes above presently i heard a splash i did not offer to assist for he had the knife and the knowledge the two women were my charge it must have been twenty minutes that we waited there silently deep in the security of the darkness she's down said legrand in my ear it's not a long drop but it's a job for women do you think you can manage it i'm going to try i said and i whispered to the princess will you trust yourself to me i must lower you into the boat yes yes she answered in a low voice legrand said i you go first i'll lower them and then i'll follow he made no answer but slipped over the railing and presently his voice sounded softly from below now i took the princess's hand from my arm you must go said i legrand is awaiting you if i put you over can you hang by the rope and lower yourself he will catch you yes she said in the same voice i lifted her gently to the top of the bulwarks and put the rope in her hands and i felt her go down slowly i had faith in her yet i waited anxiously until i heard the voice below safe i turned to where i had left mademoiselle but my hands moving in the darkness encountered nothing she was gone what had become of her i moved a little way and almost fell on my face over some obstacle which was soft and moved i stooped and felt there on the deck with a sudden misgiving it was mademoiselle trebizond who had gone off in a swoon what was to be done i racked my brains and could not see any means by which she could be lowered in that unconscious state to the boat i called out to legrand softly informing him of the situation and i heard an oath float on the air suddenly a thought came to me and i leaned over wait i said i have an idea i will be back shortly i had the bull's eye and now i turned it on and lighted myself back into the corridor in a flash i had had a thought as to what the second guard had wanted in the cabin and i retraced my way to it along the deserted corridor and found the door open and the man's body blocking it i stepped over this and threw the light about i had guessed it was the boudoir i pushed into the farther room which had been mademoiselle's and a cry greeted me i had conjectured rightly the second man had been set as guard on other prisoners juliette ran to me quickly mademoiselle said she is safe i answered but wants your help come i cast the light on lane can you walk lane yes he said i'm fit for anything ellison yes sir well follow me if you'd known it your prison was open for you be as silent as you can there's no time to lose as i issued from the doorway i stopped and took the revolver and cartridge belt from the dead man and ellison followed my example in respect of the other sentry we reached the deck without a word and i shut off the lantern i called to legrand and he answered hush he said there's been some one along here just now be careful i told him what had happened and as there was no time for more words stooped to find mademoiselle's unconscious form it was not there perplexed i communicated my discovery to my companions and we searched in the dark for some minutes but it then became apparent that she had vanished utterly i heard legrand's voice in warning below there's a light coming aft quick we can't wait i was fairly distracted and knew not what to do it was plain that if we lingered there we should be detected and it seemed equally plain that there was no chance of discovering mademoiselle some one who had passed that way had lighted upon her unconscious body quick man said legrand all will be lost i ordered juliette down the rope and as she protested talking of her mistress i told her all would be well if she would only descend thus reassured for she had understood but imperfectly what had happened through her ignorance of english she jumped on the rail alertly and disappeared lane followed and ellison despite his wound was lithe as a cat then i mounted heaven was a vault of darkness and the sea poured multitudinous small noises in my ears as it rippled against the side of the sea queen there was visible but the loom of the funnel and the stack of the state rooms turning night into deeper night noises now arose from the saloon and streamed up to me i put my hands on the rope and then a voice wheezed almost in my ear i'll lay it's the doctor it was holgate as civil and indifferent as if he were greeting a friend on the quarterdeck i started and gripped my revolver tightly it couldn't be any one else pursued holgate and now his bulk was a blacker shadow than the empty blackness around got a little party down there i dare say well now i never thought of that doctor for one thing i hadn't an idea that you would have left a lady all alone in a faint it wasn't like your gallantry doctor so i didn't tumble to it but it's no odds you're welcome i make you a present of your party good night doctor i slipped down the rope and reached the boat ere this astounding speech was ended he was a fiend why did he torture us thus let her go man said i fiercely to legrand he's the devil in the flesh the rope was overboard and the oars dipped a lantern flashed from the side of the yacht and a trail of light spread faint over the quiet water shall i give him a barrel sir asked ellison respectfully no said i shortly we shall have enough to do with our barrels presently besides you wouldn't hit him the boat sped out beyond the channel of light good night doctor called out holgate we've got a little business on but when that's over i hope to drop in to tea you're not going far no one answered and the wash of the water foamed about the nose of the boat as she turned seaward chapter xxi on the island we were not however bound to sea a course which would in our situation have been madness better have perished under the bloody hands of the mutineers than adventure on a wide ocean without sail or food or compass to die of thirst exposure or starvation legrand took the boat well out upon that tranquil water before swinging her round to reach the island far away from the sea queen we had no guess as to what size the island might be but hoped that it might be sufficiently large to provide us a hiding place as well as with opportunities of securing food the night was placid and the sea like a smooth lake when we had got some way out and the sounds of the water on the yacht together with the human noises of her crew had faded a singular silence fell the plash of the oars was the only sound that broke on the ears the air was soft and serene nature seemed to have at last relented and to be out of key with those tragic deeds committed on the sea as i sat passing such reflections in my mind i heard a voice at my ear in french but monsieur where is my mistress it was juliette faithful still i had to explain and she cried out in alarm and then was silent she was above all a practical woman as i had gathered and no doubt she saw the position mademoiselle was gone and it was patent how she was gone holgate's words had put her fate beyond uncertainty she was in the hands of the mutineers but with what object i could not guess possibly holgate had some thought that she was privy to the hiding of the treasure if he had i knew better but meanwhile whatever design he had it was not likely that mademoiselle was in danger probably indeed she was suffering less discomfort at the moment than she had endured during the last few hours if we were destined to destruction by the mutineers as i had no doubt holgate was biding his time it might be that he still had some suspicion that one or more of us knew the secret he sought so he held his hand under legrand's guidance the boat grounded with a dull soft swishing noise on sand and in the darkness we effected our landing that done it remained to conceal our craft in case of emergencies which we succeeded in doing under a spreading patch of bushes well above the reach of the tides then the question of shelter faced us this part of the island appeared from the trend of the ground to move gently upwards among dwarf trees and shrubs and plunging almost at random in the night we hit upon a knoll at the base of which was a hollow screened by some bushes here we decided to stay till the sun was up legrand helped lane who was badly fatigued and ellison made himself useful all round paying complimentary attentions to the french maid as for me i am not ashamed to say that i had but one thought just then and that was to render the princess comfortable i found some dry ferns and piled them up as a couch so that she was protected from the hard unyielding earth and then i bade her sleep she had not spoken since we had entered the boat and she rendered herself submissively as a helpless child to my directions she lay down and i was aware that she was looking into the depth of heaven where a few stars shone dimly she was thinking of her brother and dear heart i pitied her i yearned towards her as a lover yearns to his mistress with the single desire that he may comfort and solace and protect her ah well my secret had been no secret to me for many days there was only one divine woman on earth and she lay upon a rude couch in a savage island under the naked stars and stared disconsolately to heaven i fell asleep at last and when i awoke stiff from the earthy bed the night was receding westward the dawn was merging in pearls and gray and a little light was suffused about the hollow it was still warm my companions slept some tossing restlessly but the princess lay almost as if she had been sleeping under the hand of death her bosom moved regularly her parted lips disclosed the even white of her teeth she was safe from fears and immune from sorrows now at least and i thanked god i got up and pushed my way through the bushes towards the beach on which the high tide rumbled monotonously each moment the light grew stronger and i had walked only a little way before i was enabled to make out the loom of the yacht some half mile or more away i mounted the rise behind our sleeping place and now perceived that the land ran upwards from where we were into a central ridge dotted on the slopes with trees on the south easterly side the island appeared to be broken and to conclude in rocks and here was where the sea queen lay with a seaward list it was plain then that so small a sanctuary would not offer us adequate protection from holgate if he wished to pursue us and my heart sank as i considered the position would he at the best leave us to our fate on the island and if so would that be more merciful than despatching us by the bullet of the assassin i returned to my companions to find legrand and the french maid awake juliette was serviceable as of old she inquired of me sweetly what chance her mistress had and took my assurances philosophically she would do her duty i was sure but i doubted the depth of her affections she came of sound sensible peasant blood and this was what was needed at the moment for we had to see to some breakfast legrand agreed to mount guard while i went on an excursion of investigation along the north shore here i was hidden from the eyes of those on board the sea queen by the intervening range of hills it took me just twenty minutes of strolling to reach the farther end of the island where the barren rocks swarmed with gulls and other sea birds from which you may draw some idea as to the dimensions of our domain i obtained some sea gulls' eggs from the nests on the rocks having to beat off some of the infuriated creatures to secure my booty and thus supplied returned to the camp the remainder of the party were now awake and juliette prepared the eggs roasting them in the sand by the aid of hot ashes as we were well nigh famished i think we all ate with appetite except the princess who was still very silent and listless princess i said to her presently if a man lose half his treasure will he then throw away the other half recklessly she looked at me in wonder you have lost a brother i continued but you have your own life which god gave you to guard yes she said slowly i know you are right but it is hard i will try but she shivered it is hard so hard to forget i live in a nightmare by day it is only in sleep i can forget but she ate her breakfast after that and a little later accompanied me to a spring ellison had discovered for a drink of water as we stood there in the morning sunshine the fair wind tossing her skirts she faced me gravely you have not given up hope then no said i frankly we are not beaten yet i think i shall be able to restore you to europe to hand you back to your uncle's palace she looked away to sea we were to have given up that for always frederic and i she said softly we arranged it between us princess i said you did not approve i have always known it you consented out of love for him and now you shall go back she shook her head it is too late the mill will never grind with the waters that are passed i did not i was afraid yes but i made up my mind he was all i had and now i have nothing i am alone it was impossible to assure her there was no consolation possible now whatever might come hereafter her eyes encountered mine but i am grateful oh so grateful to those who stood by him to the end and risked their lives for him she said in a broken voice and with tears in her eyes and she put out her hand impulsively i took it and my voice was almost as broken as hers it is not true you are alone i said for those who stood by your brother belong to you they would die for you my friend she murmured no i am not alone legrand expressed great anxiety that we should improve our position which indeed left us a prey to any attack we therefore wended our way along the northern beach towards the rocks in the hope of hitting upon a situation in which we might have some chance of defence the scarp descended boldly into the blue water here and the edges were planted with brushwood brushwood too covered the slope of the hills interspersed with larger trees here and there the rough rock outcropped and was broken no doubt by the winds of that tempestuous sea or by the frosts legrand and i mounted leaving the others below and ascended to the top of the rise from which the shafts of our eyes went down upon the southern beach but the sea queen was concealed from view by the abutment of hill which sloped outwards and formed an arm to a pleasant little ravine from the top of this a stream bubbled out of the rock and fell downwards in a jet of silver legrand stooped to refresh himself with a draught preparatory to turning back for it was not advisable that we should venture lower upon that side of the hills as he did so he stopped suddenly and straightened himself with his hand he beckoned to me pointing to the hillside i looked and saw what was in his mind just under the summit the rock stratum emerged in mass and on one side the earth yawned in a hole cautiously we approached it was the mouth of a shallow cavern some twelve feet through and some twenty feet in width the cave admitted us by stooping the very place said he significantly it's near water too and has this advantage that we can overlook the beach by which any movement will be made that was in my thoughts also and we rejoined our companions well satisfied but some preparations were necessary before we installed ourselves in our new quarters we made a larder of eggs and piled a heap of brushwood before the door of our house so long as there were no mutineers in sight we should have liberty to come and go over the brow of the hill and upon the north side in a little dip we built our fireplace so that the smoke should not rise and attract the notice of the sea queen these arrangements occupied a great part of the morning during all which time we saw nothing of holgate's men no doubt they were busily engaged in their hunt for the prince's treasure the day passed wearily enough but in safety and with the fall of night we felt even more secure for our hiding place could not be discovered in the darkness i reckoned that we were not as the crow flies more than a few hundred yards from where the yacht lay aground and in the greater stillness that seems to fall at night sounds reached us from the mutineers as i sat at the door of the cave with the stars overhead i caught a snatch of song rolling up from below and presently other voices joined in a little later there was a riotous burst of noise as from a quarrel in progress had the treasure been found and were the sailors celebrating their triumph or was this merely a drunken debauch it sounded as if the latter were the true alternative in their disappointment the mutineers had gone to the rum cask for consolation as time went on the sounds increased and i listened to them with a trembling fear for the unfortunate woman who was still aboard black of heart as those men undoubtedly were in their sober moments and under the influence of the lust of gold what would they be when inflamed by spirits and in the throes of angry chagrin as i watched i was conscious that some one had issued from the cave on light feet and stood by my side a low voice addressed me but before she had spoken i knew who it was my heart could not have failed to recognise her do you fear attack no princess said i not to night they don't know where we are and besides they are quarrelling among themselves she was silent for a time and then that unhappy woman she sighed she has lost all she cared for i am sorry for her i answered yes she said slowly i suppose so but what does any one of us care for what does it all mean the puzzle is too great for me i am shaken you must trust yourself i said impulsive trust to those who care for you you are good she replied softly princess i began but she interposed quickly do not call me that i am no princess i have given all up i am just alix morland you will go back said i and resume your rightful place in courts and this will only remain to you as a horrid nightmare i shall remember the evil dream yes she said but i shall also remember some heroic souls and noble deeds but it will not be in courts she was silent again but presently said in a hesitating voice dr phillimore i never wanted that marriage i was always against it and now i am sorry poor frederic i was a traitor to him no no i said but a loyal and devoted heart why are you here because even though you mistrusted his judgment you sacrificed yourself to your affection for him the test of true affection is to stand by when you disapprove any one can stand by if he approves and it has all come to this she said with a sigh this is not the end said i stoutly suddenly she laid her hand on my arm what has become of her she asked what has been her fate to say the truth i knew not what to reply and the trouble in her voice declared itself again can we do nothing she asked distressfully i did not like her but can we do nothing it is dreadful to i found my voice then not to night but to morrow i replied soothingly she will take no harm to night but i wished i had been as sure as i seemed about noon on the following day we took our first sight of the mutineers a knot emerged into view on the beach below and spread out presently towards the wooded valley this gave me some concern for i guessed that they might be searching for us by holgate's directions he had threatened to visit us was he now fulfilling that threat in any case if they were hunting for us we must in the end be run to earth in that small island and then would come the final act we had two revolvers and a limited amount of ammunition to defend ourselves against the resources of the mutineers to whom the yacht was open we saw no more of them however for two hours and then they came straggling back towards the little bluff behind which the sea queen lay if they had been looking for us they were so far foiled but that was not the last of them the boat which had landed the first lot of mutineers had returned to the yacht and now again struck the beach with a fresh complement of hands were they to renew the pursuit i looked down from our eyrie scarcely more than half a mile away with some misgivings legrand was upon the other side of the hill on an exploration of his own and lane and ellison were still wounded men i peered from behind our pile of brushwood and awaited events the second gang of mutineers had brought a keg with them and i saw them tap it only too clearly was its nature revealed they had come ashore to an orgie i counted ten of them and thought i recognised one or two of the figures gray's and pierce's for certain holgate evidently was not with them for his form would have been unmistakable nor could i discern pye but why were they there i could only answer my question on the assumption that they had found the treasure and were making merry yet it was not like holgate to give them the reins so completely unless he had some purpose to serve by his complaisance hurricane island as the mutineer had dubbed it lay under the broad face of the sun and the cascade sparkled at my feet on its run to the sea down below the ruffians were engaged in drinking themselves into a condition of maudlin merriment well so much the better i reflected for i had made up my mind that now if ever was the time to inquire into the fate of mademoiselle when legrand returned the debauch had developed and the boat was clumsily put to sea by two of the hands evidently a fresh supply of rum had been requisitioned for shortly afterwards the boat returned and two more kegs were rolled out upon the beach this time it also brought holgate himself together with a companion whom i made out to be pye the men lolled in the sun smoking and drinking and now singing snatches of songs what was holgate about to let them get into this condition well holgate probably knew his own affairs if he had not carefully calculated every step in this situation i should have been much astonished he himself as far as i could see took little part in the orgie but the clamour of voices grew louder and reached us in our retreat very distinctly we could even catch the names and some of the words that flew about the talk was boisterous but i doubted if it was overmerry had they been baffled by the treasure after all i counted them again and came to the conclusion that almost the whole of the decimated company must be ashore if that were so it was time for my excursion presently when the dark came it might be too late my plan as i explained it to legrand was this i would descend across the spur of the hill under cover of the bushes and climb down the steeper heights that faced the sea queen she lay scarce more than a hundred yards from the island and it would be easy to reach her by swimming if mademoiselle were safe on board as i conjectured we could take advantage of a boat to reach the northern beach and so make our escape without being seen by any of the mutineers ashore as for the mutineers on the ship if there were any i must deal with them as chance suggested legrand was doubtful as to my venture his philosophy being summed up in the adage let well alone but he consented that the experiment should be tried when i pressed it he had in the course of his ramblings discovered in the north side of the hill another cavern which he declared would serve us on an emergency as a second hiding place it was quite possible that we might be driven from burrow to burrow like rabbits and so it behooved us to examine well the lines of our retreat i started on my journey just as the sun went down spreading a deep rose colour on the western waters i walked cautiously and deliberately making deviations in my slanting course across the spur so as to keep within the screen of the bushes i had not gone more than a hundred yards when i was aware that i was being followed and i stopped and looked back to my amazement i saw the princess coming up rapidly in my wake she had evidently sped down the ravine and was a little out of breath this had imparted some colour to her pale face a colour which made her radiantly beautiful princess i said in surprise i am come after you she said hurriedly because i don't want you to go oh don't go please i did not know you were going until you were gone mr legrand told me so when i asked after you but you must not go i know you are going because of what i said last night but you must not it is too dangerous oh did you not see that band of assassins there they are wolves they are ravening fierce wolves you will perish my heart throbbed hard harder than it had done before through all those terrible days of anxiety i took her hand princess i said i must go i held her hand tightly you see that i must go but ah i will not forget your kindness they will kill you she burst out no i shook my head and smiled god bless you you are the most kind and most beautiful woman in life god bless and keep you i kissed her hand and turned and went down she stood awhile as if lost in thought and when i looked back i thought i could read upon her face trouble and fear i would have gone back to her if i had dared but had i done so i must have taken her in my arms i kept my face steadily towards the descent and when i at last summoned courage to adventure the gaze she had turned and was slowly mounting the hill my eyes left her and went downwards to the beach i was almost at the top of the spur which rolled over towards the bay on which the yacht had stranded what was my horror to notice some excitement among the mutineers and to see a man with his face towards the hill and an uplifted arm good heavens the princess had been discovered i stood stock still rooted to the ground with my apprehensions and then several of the mutineers began to run towards the ravine i started at once on a race up the slope looking down i saw the full pack streaming up the valley and i redoubled my exertions i was some distance away but i had not so far to go as they the princess stopped arrested by the drunken shouts from below and then suddenly broke into a run she had recognised her danger i bounded through the bushes and cut across to intercept the wolves it was all a matter of little more than five minutes and then i stopped and awaited their arrival the first man who was without a weapon came to a pause a dozen paces from me stand or i fire i said levelling my weapon he looked uncertainly round for his companions two or three joined him and encouraged by this accession to the force he said jeeringly put that down or it will be the worse for you we've had enough of you and now we've got you in a mucky hole that remains to be seen said i calmly for i noticed that they did not seem to be supplied with weapons i could see others climbing up below and among them holgate a little lull fell on the scene it was as if fate hung undecided not certain whether the scales should go down on this side or that i stood facing the group of dismayed and angry ruffians and without turning my head was aware of some one running behind me i do not think i gave this a single thought so preoccupied was i with the situation in front the group was enlarged by arrivals and one of these stumbling uttered an oath shoot him he said and himself lifted a pistol at me i raised mine also and a second and a third were now levelled at me the scales were against me but even as this flashed across my mind a report sounded behind me and the drunken creature fell i glanced about and there was legrand with his steady hand and flaming eye my heart thrilled a shout of fury went up in front shoot them shoot them and the barrels directed at us seemed to be suddenly many holgate had come to a pause on the outer edge of the group and was observing the scene with interest he made no movement death touched us with the breath of his passage an arm was flung sharply about me if you die i die too cried a voice a voice ah so well remembered and so dear ah heaven was it alix a pistol barked and i swerved almost losing my feet if we must die we should die hard i fired and one of the mutineers uttered an exclamation stay there called holgate easy men don't let's kill the goose that lays the golden eggs let's have a few questions answered dent's down sang out one well there'll be all the more for those that are left said holgate easily steering his way through the knot a faint laugh followed on this but i think even the mutineers brutal as they were were aghast at this revolting cynicism let's have a parley first said holgate now in the forefront of the gang business first pleasure afterwards now doctor out with it where's that treasure i have told you said i that the prince removed it alix's arms were about me still i was dazed obstinate mule said holgate with a grin see that boys i've given 'em every chance let her go in response to his command revolvers were raised it marked the end the fall of the curtain on that long tragedy alix's arms were about me and suddenly my brain cleared i saw as sharply and as definitely as if i had been aloof and unconcerned in that disturbing crisis stop men said i i have one thing to say before we go further two things you shall hear about the treasure there was a pause holgate turned his black incurious eyes on me as if he wondered i will tell you where the treasure is if you will allow me to give you the history of a transaction i said my mind was quick my nerve was cool there was a chance in delay spit it out said one of the men encouragingly the funeral will wait men you've been taken in by that scoundrel there your leader i said pointing at holgate he's diddled you all through ask him about the treasure ask him the eyes of all went round to holgate who stood without a sign of discomposure well are you going to let 'em go was all he said once again the interest of the group returned to me but i was fighting hard for alix who was it planned this mutiny and the seizing of the treasure i cried why holgate you know well holgate and pye and who brought about the rising holgate again why didn't you push through and get hold of the treasure at the first i suppose you were told it was too difficult well it would have been difficult but that wasn't the reason it was because this man had got his accomplice aft stealing the treasure against your coming and so when you came where was it gone look here men i swear to you i saw this man and pye gloating over the treasure they had removed before your coming oh he's a cunning devil is holgate and he's diddled you there were some murmurs among the mutineers who looked dubiously at their master and pierce spoke that's all very well but how are we to know it's not mere bluff you're putting up a bluff on us holgate still stood there with his unpleasing smile and he answered nothing it was the truth i had spoken but now i was to bluff well i will prove my words said i you asked me where the treasure is and i'll tell you it was removed from holgate's hiding place by me and hidden in pye's cabin and afterwards the prince and i removed it again and concealed it where where shouted several voices but holgate did not budge or speak if we saved this situation we should at least have a respite another chance there was no alternative but death why in its proper place to be sure said i in the strong room where it should be i suppose none of you thought of that you're too clever for that pierce by god cried pierce suddenly but at the moment i was startled by a change in holgate i had fired a barrel at random and now he shot on me a diabolical glance his eyes gleamed like creatures about to leap from cover his lips in a snarl revealed his teeth a flash of inspiration came to me and i knew then for certain that wherever the prince had concealed the treasure it was now lying in the very place i had named in the presence of all those ruffians holgate glanced a swift glance from left to right what's he take us for he said in a hoarse fat voice in which rage burned and trembled who's he stuffing with these fairy tales pierce his thin lips moving stared at him anyway it's worth trying he said meaningly you've had your shot i'll have mine damn it he's fooling you called out holgate furiously but already two or three of the mutineers had started down the ravine and the others turned excitement seized upon them as it had been a panic and then suddenly a cry arose look by thunder look the sun was gone but the beautiful twilight lingered serene and gracious and in that clear light we could descry the form of the sea queen forging slowly out to sea and rolling as she moved on the ebb good lord she's floated off she came off on the high tide cried pierce and instantly there was a stampede from the hillside towards the beach pell mell the mutineers tumbled down over bush and brier at a breakneck speed to reach the boat that tossed idly on the water to its moorings chapter xxii holgate's last hand the first thought that passed through my mind was that we had lost our one hope of escape from hurricane island insensibly i had come to look on the sea queen as the vehicle of our rescue and there she was before my eyes adrift on a tide that was steadily drawing her seawards there could be no doubt as to that for even as i gazed she made perceptible way and seemed to be footing it fast i turned to alix who was by me staring also i will come back i said rapidly i must go down no no she said detaining me dear they will take no heed of me now i am perfectly safe for the present they are taken up with more important matters i squeezed her hands in both mine turned and left her holgate was some hundred yards in front of me plunging heavily through the bushes he called to mind some evil and monstrous beast of the forest that broke clumsily in wrath upon its enemy down on the beach i could see that pierce and some of the others who had already arrived were casting the boat from her moorings i laboured after holgate and came out on the beach near him he ran down to the water's edge and called aloud put back put back damn you the boat was some fifty yards from land by now and was awash in a broken current three men bent to the oars holgate levelled his revolver and fired one of the men lay down grotesquely on his oar he fired again and one of the remaining two stood up shook a fist towards the shore and staggering backwards capsized the boat in the surf he must have sunk like lead with his wound for he never rose to the surface but the last man who was pierce battled gallantly with the flood and endeavoured to reach the boat which was bottom upwards in this however he failed for the tide seemed to suck him away the boat drifted outwards and after a few ineffectual struggles finding probably that his strength was failing him pierce struck out towards the shore he landed a hundred yards or more away from holgate between the two men were gathered in a bunch irresolute and divided in counsels the remaining mutineers for the moment i think i was so taken up with the situation that i did not consider my own case no one had eyes for me in the fast descending dusk and behind the shelter of a bush i watched the course of that singular drama holgate had indifferently reloaded his revolver and now stood holding it carelessly by his side gray is that you come here he called but the knot of men did not move and now pierce was walking rapidly towards it it opened to receive him and swallowed him up again cautiously as if there was safety in that circle against the arch mutineer holgate strode leisurely towards them i suppose you guess where we are he said in his malevolent fluent wheezing tones you've dished us pierce my man pierce replied from the group with an oath and there was an undercurrent of murmur as if a consultation was in progress say where's that damned little lawyer cuss asked a voice that of an american who was one of the hands holgate put one hand in his trousers' pocket how should i know he said and what's that got to do with the situation it's your doing you've put us in this hole you've strung us up to day in this blooming island said gray fiercely what did you shoot for haven't you any other use for your pop gun come out gray come out my man and talk it over said holgate suavely you were always good at the gab step out in front man and he played with his revolver but gray did not budge i wondered why he was not shot there and then if they were in this temper for it was plain that some of them were armed but i suppose that they were overawed by the bearing of the man and lawless ruffians as they were were yet under the influence of some discipline holgate had known how to rule in his triumph and the ghost of that authority was with him still in his defeat look here called out pierce after further consultation this is as good as a trial this is you're standing for your life mr holgate and don't you forget it what d'ye say bill speak up give 'im 'is counts we accuse you of treachery and not behaving like a mate on ship about the treasure sang out gray in a loud high monotone we accuse you mr holgate of the murder of our two companions smith and alabaster we accuse you furthermore mr holgate of a conspiracy to cheat the company us all being comrades now bill gray that's a very parsonical view of yours isn't it said holgate with a sneer by gum you regularly hit me off gray you're the man to see his way through a brick wall i killed smith and alabaster did i well what's the odds here was this man pierce who's frightened to face me in there with you and his two pals making for the sea queen to rob you and me don't i know him and you too where would we have been if i hadn't dropped 'em why left my good man left that's what we are now said one of the mutineers regularly busted busted and left we're done that's so said holgate suavely but at least smith and alabaster have paid their shot and lot too and by thunder that skunk behind you shall do it too come out there pierce sneak and dog and take your gruel he did not raise his voice perceptibly but it seemed to wither the mutineers who stood about ten paces from him he waddled towards them out of the way men and let me see him blind me i'd sooner have taken a bug into my confidence than pierce he gets ahead of us with his long thin legs and without so much as 'by your leave' swims out to sea to cop what belongs to you and me and all of us there was a murmur at this and it was quite impossible to tell how the sympathies of the gang were going but one called out again where's that damn pye where's your spy so says holgate you are thinking of the doctor's story are you you fool he was only playing for his life and the life of his best girl haven't you got the sense of a louse between you find pye then and screw it out of him thumbscrew him till he tells and see how much he has to tell it'll be worth your while garratt why you fool he's just a little clerk that was useful and was going to get a tip for his pains he wasn't standing in on our level we came in on bed rock there was a hoarse discordant laugh with the yacht gone and us on a godforsaken tea tray in mid ocean said a voice upon that in the dwindling light a shot came from the group and holgate lifted his barrel deliberately so that's pierce by thunder is it well johnny pierce you're a brave man and i'd take off my hat to you if my hands were free stand aside there men and let's see johnny pierce's ugly mug now then divide d'ye hear divide i never could determine whether holgate in that moment realized that all was up and the end was come and had carried things through with a swagger or whether he had a hope of escape nothing showed in his voice or in his manner save extreme resolution and contemptuous indifference these men he had misled and cheated were to him no more than brutes of the field to be despised and ridiculed and browbeaten at his words indeed the old habit of obedience asserted itself and the knot fell apart as it did i saw pierce with his revolver up but holgate did not move he fired carefully and pierce uttered a curse then another weapon barked and holgate moved a pace forwards he fired again and a man dropped two or more shots rang out and the arch mutineer lifted his left hand slowly to his breast bully for you pierce he said and fired yet once more the knot now had dissolved and gray ran in the gathering gloom a little way up the beach he halted and raising his weapon fired it was abominable it may have been execution but it was horribly like murder as gray fired holgate turned and put his hand to his shoulder immediately he let his last barrel go ha that's done you pierce he wheezed out by heavens i thought i'd do for you crack went gray's pistol again from his rear and he swung round his weapon dropped and he began to walk up the beach steadily towards me in the blue gloom i could see his eyes stolidly black and furtive and i could hear him puffing he came within ten paces of me and then stood still and coughed in a sickening inhuman way then he dropped and rolled heavily upon his back i had witnessed enough heaven knows we had no reason to show mercy to that criminal but that last hopeless struggle against odds had enlisted some sympathy and i had a feeling of nausea at the sight of that collapse he must have fallen riddled with bullets he had played for high stakes had sacrificed many innocent lives and had died the death of a dog and there he would rest and rot in that remote and desert island i stole from my bush and crept upwards through the darkness i had not gone a hundred yards before my ears were caught by a rustling on my left had i put up some animal i came to a pause and then there was a swift rush and a man's figure broke through the undergrowth and disappeared across the slope of the hill it was near dark but i thought in that instant i recognised it as the figure of the little lawyer's clerk when i reached the cavern i found no sign of any one and i was wondering what could have become of my companions when i heard a voice calling low through the gloaming dr phillimore it was alix i sprang to her side and took her hands then i learnt that legrand had decided as a counsel of prudence to occupy the second cavern on the northern slope which he considered more private than that which we had found first and you came back to warn me i asked in a low voice no i waited said she as low i was afraid although you told me ah but you have never told me wrong yet i believe you implicitly princess i said with emotion no no she whispered not any more never any more alix i whispered low and i held her closer she gave a little cry what is it i asked anxiously for answer her head lay quiet on my shoulder and the stars looked down upon a pale sweet face she had fainted now the hand which clasped her arm felt warm and wet and i shifted it hastily and bent down to her it was blood she was wounded tenderly i bound my handkerchief about the arm and waited in distress for her to revive if we had only some of the mutineers' brandy but presently she opened her eyes dearest dearest she murmured faintly you are wounded darling i said oh why did you not tell me it was the first shot she said in a drowsy voice when when i had my arm about you i kissed that fair white arm and then for the first time i kissed her lips we reached legrand's cave after alix had rested and i related the tragedy that had passed under my eyes on the beach below legrand listened silently and then he was a black scoundrel he died as he should he said shortly and said no more wearied with our exertions and exhausted by the anxieties of the day we gradually sank to sleep and as i passed off alix's hand lay in mine she slept sweetly for all the profound miseries of those past days i awoke to the sound of a bird that twittered in the bushes and emerging from the cavern looked around the sun was bright on the water the foam sparkled and the blue tossed and danced as if nature were revisiting happily the scene of pleasant memories it seemed as if those deeds of the previous night that long fight against fate those dismal forebodings the tragedy of the prince were all separated from us by a gulf of years it was almost impossible to conceive of them as belonging to our immediate precedent past and as colouring our present and our future and as my gaze swept the horizon for the orient towards the west it landed upon nothing less than the sea queen i could have rubbed my eyes and i started in amazement my heart beat heavily but it was true there rode the yacht in the offing idly swinging and plunging on the tide and clearly under no man's control she must have drifted in upon hurricane island again through the stress of some backward tide and here she bobbed on the broken water safe from the eyes of the mutineers as soon as i had recovered from the shock of surprise i reentered the cavern and woke legrand and in less than five minutes all of us were outside our shelter and gazing at the welcome sight we have the boat hidden said legrand we must work our way back to it and the sooner the better too much risk said i i know a better way at the tail of the island we may be seen and pursued there are boats aboard and she's not more than three hundred yards out what swim he asked and looked rueful he was one of the many sailors i have known who had not that useful art i nodded it won't take me long as i passed alix caught my hand she said nothing but her eyes devoured me and her bosom heaved i smiled my princess i whispered and her soul was in her look i can't see a sign of any one on board said legrand with his hand over his eyes mademoiselle would not be awake yet it can't be later than five said lane who was much better to day i make it said legrand we have some time to ourselves if we have luck after last night those fiends will sleep well and with easy consciences he spoke grimly have everything ready i called as i left we must not lose a chance or hazard anything what do you think said lane in his old cheerful manner i quickly descended to the beach threw off my coat waistcoat and boots and tightened my belt then i waded into the sea it was cold and when i first entered struck a chill into me but presently as i walked out into the deepening waters with the sparkling reflection of the sun in my eyes from a thousand facets of ripples i began to grow warm i reached water waist high and next moment i was swimming the tide sucked at me in a strong current and soon i perceived would carry me across the sea queen's bows unless i made a struggle the water was racing under me and i felt that my strength was as nothing compared with it i was thrown this way and that as the flood moved my passage had been taken incredibly quick and now i was conscious that i was past the level of the yacht and i turned and battled back so far as i could see i made no impression on the space that separated me from her and i began to despair of reaching the yacht in my mind i revolved the possibility of going with the flood and trusting to work ashore at the tail of the island if that were not practicable i was lost for i should be blown out to the open sea just as these desperate reflections crossed my mind the sea queen's stern off which i was struggling backed she came round to the wind and jammed so that the flutter of canvas which she still carried cracked above the voice of the seas then her nose swung right round upon me with the bubble under her cutwater it was almost as if she had sighted a doomed wretch and was come to his assistance her broadside now broke the tide for me and i began to see that i was creeping up to her and thus encouraged step by step made my way until at last i reached her and by the aid of a trailing sheet got aboard it had been half an hour since i left the island once aboard i waved across the intervening stretch of sea to my friends and looked about me there was no sign or sound of life anywhere on the yacht she swung noisily with creaks and groans to the pulse of the tide but there was no witness to human presence there mademoiselle immediately was in my thoughts and i found my way to the state rooms to reassure her if she should be awake they were as we had left them save that every cabin had been ransacked and every box turned inside out the cabins were empty and so was the boudoir clearly mademoiselle trebizond was not there i went down into the saloon but nothing rewarded me there and afterwards i turned along the passage that led to the officers' quarters and farther on the steward's room here too was my own surgery and instinctively i stopped when i reached it the door stood ajar no doubt i thought like every other place it had suffered the ravages of the mutineers i opened it wide and started back for there on the floor a bottle in her hand and her features still and tragic lay yvonne trebizond i stooped to her but i knew it was useless even without glancing at the bottle she held she had sought death in the despair of her loneliness the sea queen had carried out upon the face of the dark waters the previous evening an unhappy woman to a fate which she could not face she had chosen death to that terrible solitude on the wilderness of the ocean i lifted her gently and carried her to one of the cabins disposing the body on a bunk then i returned to the deck for i had work to do that pressed i experienced no difficulty in loosing one of the remaining boats and dropping into her i began to row towards the island legrand had the party at the water's edge and they were in the boat in a very brief space of time we shoved off and now legrand and ellison had oars in addition to myself so that what with that and the tide we made good progress we had not however got more than halfway to the yacht when legrand paused on his oars and i saw his face directed along the beach i followed his glance and saw to my astonishment a boat bobbing off the spit of the island it's our boat said i yes he said the ruffians are up and about give way give way we bent to the oars but as we did so a number of figures appeared round the bend of the land where we had passed our first night shouts reached us the figure in the boat was working his oars with frantic haste and now legrand called out suddenly pye pye it was and it was also apparent now that he was aiming for us and that he was striving to get away from the mutineers he stood out to sea and pulled obliquely towards the yacht obviously he was better content to trust himself to our mercies than to the ruffians with whom he had consorted he was a coward i knew and i remembered then his white face and his terror at the time of the first onslaught i remembered too how vaguely how timidly and how ineffectually he had endeavoured to warn me of the coming massacre he was a miserable cur he had been largely responsible for the bloody voyage but i could not help feeling some pity for him i hung on my oars shall we pick him up i asked legrand's only answer was an oath he had forgotten the presence of alix i think his eyes blazed above his red cheeks let him drown he said by the time we reached the sea queen some of the mutineers who had started running when they saw us had got to the water's edge opposite to us and one or two of them plunged in in the distance the others were pursuing pye and his boat legrand meanwhile had taken the wheel and ellison set about the sails i did what i could to help and it was not many minutes ere we had the topsails going under that pressure the yacht began to walk slowly seeing this the mutineers on the shore raised a howl and two more jumped in to join the swimmers who were now halfway to us legrand cried out an order and ellison had the jib sail set and the sea queen quickened her pace under the brisk breeze the swimming mutineers dropped behind there must have been half a dozen of them in the water and now we saw that they had given up the attempt to reach us in that way and had fallen back on a new idea they turned aside to intercept pye the little lawyer's clerk was paddling for life and knew it but he made no way the yacht moved faster and he sent up to heaven a dreadful scream that tingled in my ears i made a step towards legrand but he merely gave one glance backward towards the boat and then fixed his gaze on the wide horizon of interminable sea as though he thus turned his back forever on hurricane island and all there he pulled the spokes of the wheel and the sea queen breasting the foam heads began to leap we were moving at a brisk pace i looked back to the unhappy man he had fallen away now but still laboured at his oars the swimmers could not have been more than twenty yards from him just then alix's voice was low with agitation in my ears yvonne where is yvonne i turned to her and took her hand she will need no further care of yours sweetheart i said she has played her last tragedy a tragedy she thought destined for a comedy alix looking at me sighed and ere she could say more lane intervened in huge excitement good heavens phillimore the treasure's all in my safes again by crikey is it all a dream yes i answered looking at alix all a bad nightmare i looked away across the sea for somehow i could not help it what are you looking at she asked they cannot catch us can they the foremost mutineers had reached the boat and were climbing aboard the little clerk white and gasping raised his oar and struck at them with screams of terror striking and screaming again hush don't look darling said i and i put my hands before her eyes it is the judgment of god she shuddered pye's shrieks rang in my ear i glanced off the taffrail and saw that the mutineers had possession of the boat they were busy with the oars i could see no one else the boat was headed towards us legrand cast a glance of indifference backwards if you care to hold the wheel phillimore we can rig that other sail he said i took the wheel alix was by my side and the breeze sang in the sheets we're going home dear heart i whispered she moved closer to me shuddered and sighed and i think the sigh was a sigh of contentment the sea queen dipped her nose and broke into a sharper pace she was going home the end good fiction

point of publication darnley is that work by mr james which follows richelieu and if rumor can be credited it was owing to the advice and insistence of our own washington irving that we are indebted

hesitated he had been eminently successful in giving to the world the portrait of richelieu as a man and by attempting a similar task with wolsey as the theme was much like tempting fortune irving insisted that darnley came naturally in sequence and this opinion being supported by sir walter scott the author set about the work as a historical romance darnley is a book that can be taken up pleasurably again and again for there is about it that subtle charm which those who are strangers to the works of g p r james have claimed was only to be imparted by dumas if there was nothing more
