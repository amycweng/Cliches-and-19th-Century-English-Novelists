she was quite out of control for a good five minutes to night reflect on your misdeeds to morrow we will treat of your ransom the pursuit was lively but short it was his first essay as coiffeur as a battering ram against the first and second buttons of his waistcoat hold it back screamed tinker over these agreeable occupations they talked and she paused to let the splendour of the gift sink in it's time these lubbers walked the plank the admirable tinker chapter one sir tancred's quest it is said lord crosland deucedly odd what said sir tancred beauleigh that after seeing nothing of one another for nearly three years we should arrive at this caravanserai from different stations at the same time to find that our letters engaging this set of rooms came by the same post it comes of having been born on the same day said sir tancred besides i always told you that the only possible place to live in in town was the top left hand corner of the hotel cecil with this view up the river and a nice open breezy space in front of you lord crosland who was walking up and down the room as he talked stopped to gaze out of the window at westminster and sir tancred lighted another cigarette what i like about it is it's retired out of the world said lord crosland it was just that recommended it to me a waiter came in and cleared away the breakfast lord crosland admired the view sir tancred lay back in his easy chair gazing with vacant sombre eyes into the clear blue vault of the summer sky i can't see why we shouldn't share these rooms for the season said lord crosland when the waiter had gone with his tray we shall get on all right we always did at vane's well said sir tancred slowly i have a child a boy somewhere i don't know where i've got to find him i'm going to find him before i do anything else the deuce you have well i'll be shot to think that you're married i was married when i said good bye to you nearly three years ago said sir tancred i was married to pamela vane you were married to miss vane cried lord crosland but how how on earth did you manage it it was impossible i committed that legal misdemeanour known as false entry said sir tancred coolly i added the necessary years to our ages oh yes that of course said lord crosland you wouldn't let an informality of that kind stand in your way but miss vane how did you persuade her i should have thought it impossible absolutely impossible it ran as near impossibility as anything i can think of said sir tancred slowly and half dreamily but when you are in love with one another impossibilities fade and i was masterful you were that said lord crosland with conviction poor pamela she was wretched at having to keep it from her father and i was sorry enough but it had to be done when you are eighteen and in love with one another twenty one seems ages away don't you know of course and once done i don't believe honestly i don't believe that she regretted it said sir tancred and his sombre eyes were shining heavens how happy we were for four months but as you'll learn if ever you have it happiness is a deucedly expensive thing i paid a price for it i did pay a price and he shivered at the end of four months it came out and it was all up then that was why vane gave up coaching sold stanley house and went abroad said lord crosland quickly we could none of us make it out that was why when it came out my stepmother came on the scene she's about as remarkable a creature as you'll chance on between now and the blue moon she has one idea in her head the glory of the beauleighs i believe she's as mad as a hatter about it she was one of the stryke wigrams the bankers a miss wigram and i think don't you know that rising out of that wealthy and respectable firm she felt bound to be the bluest blooded possible that's what i fancy at any rate she's more of a beauleigh than any beauleigh since the flood i know said lord crosland and he nodded gravely with the immeasurable sapience of a boy of twenty one i must say too sir tancred went on thoughtfully that she's been the most important beauleigh for generations she brought thirty thousand a year to the restoration of our dilapidated fortunes and she did restore them you know what a county is well little by little she got a grip on the county and now she just runs it i tell you the county has taken to spending every bit of the year it can in town or abroad when it gets within thirty miles of her it daren't call its life its own by jove said lord crosland earnestly she must be a holy terror they call it force of character when she's within thirty miles of them said sir tancred drily and then he went on with more emphasis but the banker streak comes out in her she thinks too much of money she doesn't understand that money's a thing you spend on things that amuse you she's always making shows with it dull shows so it was part of her scheme for the glory of beauleigh that if billions couldn't be got i was to marry millions you can imagine her fury when she learned that i was married to pamela i can that said lord crosland she got me back to beauleigh on some rotten pretence of legal business about mortgages and made a descent on mr vane you know that he was as decent a soul as ever lived and as sensitive i'm afraid that there was a lot of stryke wigram in that interview you know talk about having entrapped me into marriage with his daughter the last man in the world to dream of it fortunately as i gathered from her talk later she made him angry enough to turn her out of the house without seeing pamela she had to content herself with writing to her it must have been a letter why on earth didn't you interfere i wouldn't have stood it said lord crosland i was at beauleigh i was pretty soon suspicious that our secret had been discovered when three days passed without my getting a letter from pamela i was sure of it and then fortune played into my stepmother's hands i had a bad fall with a young horse and injured my spine for two months it was touch and go whether i was a cripple for life and i was another four months on my back by jove said lord crosland with profound sympathy ah but it was when i began to mend that my troubles began there were no letters for me not a letter just think of it i knew that pamela must be wanting me and there i lay a helpless log i was sure that she had written and knowing my stepmother i was sure that i should never see the letters i sent for her and asked for them she coolly told me that she and her brother my other guardian sir everard wigram bumpkin wigram he's generally called had decided that i was to be saved if possible from the results of my folly at any cost they would have taken steps to have the marriage nullified if it hadn't been for the risk of my being prosecuted for false entry then she talked of my ingratitude after all her efforts to raise the beauleighs to their former glory i couldn't stand any more that day and the nurse came in and fetched her out that interview didn't do me any good it hardly sounds the thing for an injured spine said lord crosland a few days later we had another and she had the cheek to tell me that one day i should be grateful to her for having saved me from the clutches of a designing girl rank idiocy you see for she was only keeping us apart for the time being but it set me talking about the firm of stryke wigram and for once i got her really angry it did me good yet you know she really believed it she believed that she was acting for the best of course said lord crosland thoughtfully she didn't know miss vane i mean lady beauleigh your wife it would have made all the difference i've made that excuse for her often enough said sir tancred but it doesn't carry very far just look at the cold bloodedness of it there was i a helpless cripple in a good deal of pain most of the time mad for a word of my wife and that damned woman kept back her letters talk about the cruelty of the chinese an ordinary woman can give them points and do it cheerfully they are terrors said lord crosland with conviction well there i lay and i had to grin and bear it but well i don't want to talk about it the only relief was that once a week my stepmother seemed to feel bound to come and tell me that it was all for my good and i could talk to her about the manners and customs of the banking classes then after five and a half months of it when i was looking forward to getting free and to my wife she came and told me that pamela was dead i refused to believe it and she gave me a letter from vane's solicitor informing her of the fact poor beggar said lord crosland sir tancred was silent he was staring at nothing with sombre eyes lord crosland looked at him compassionately presently he said it explains your face the change in it i was wondering at it i couldn't understand it what change what's the matter with my face said sir tancred indifferently well you used to be a cheerful looking beggar don't you know now you look like what do you call him who fell from heaven lucifer son of the morning i read about him at vane's mugging up poetry for that exam you'll hardly believe it said sir tancred very seriously but i took to reading books myself at beauleigh when i got all right reading books and mooning about i had no energy i went and saw vane's solicitor of course but he could tell me nothing or wouldn't tell me said his client had called on him and told him to inform my stepmother of pamela's death and had not told him where she died or where he was now living i fancied he was keeping something back but i had no energy and i didn't drag it out of him i went to stanley house it was to be let no one could tell me where the vanes had gone i stayed at beauleigh mooning about i wouldn't go to oxford and i wouldn't travel i mooned about six months ago i came across vicary at a meet you remember vicary at vane's he told me that vane had died in jersey i went to jersey and found vane's grave next to it was my wife's again sir tancred fell silent in a gloomy musing well said lord crosland gently the oddest thing happened it doesn't sound exactly credible and you won't understand it i don't but as i stood by the grave i suddenly felt that there was something for me to do something very important that had to be done it was odd very odd i went back to my hotel quite harassed puzzling and racking my brains then an idea struck me and i had a hunt through the registers i found that two days before she died a boy was born hildebrand anne beauleigh the old beauleigh names she knew that i should like him to be called by them from the registers i learnt where they had been living i rushed off to the house and found it empty and to let always these shut up houses i made inquiries and inquiries from the house agents and the tradespeople i could learn nothing they had lived very quietly but there was a child people had seen him wheeled about in a perambulator he had disappeared i suspected my stepmother at once and i hurried back to beauleigh it had bucked me up don't you know to think that i had a child i had it out with my stepmother and what do you think she told me can't guess but i'm laying odds that it doesn't surprise me said lord crosland she said that the fact of my having a son and heir would stand in the way of my making the marriage she hoped that the boy was in the hands of a respectable couple where i need never hope to find him that he would be brought up in the station of life suitable to his mother's having been the daughter of a tutor my word i did talk about the firm of stryke wigram i should think you must have said lord crosland i lost no time but put the matter in the hands of a crack private inquiry agency when they learned what i was doing i'm hanged if my stepmother and uncle bumpkin didn't stop my allowance he laughed ruefully however i kept the inquiries going by selling my two horses my jewellery my guns and my clothes that's why i'm in these rags but no good came of it the private detective discovered nothing and charged me nearly three hundred for discovering it but the crowning point of my stepmother's madness came yesterday we had the proper business interview on my coming of age and she and uncle bumpkin handed me over six hundred a year and six thousand ready money then she made me an offer she would give me ten thousand a year to enable me to keep up the glory of the beauleighs and marry the millions to increase it if i would give up searching for the boy and consent to his being brought up in his respectable position i didn't talk about swindling him out of his rights for i've come to the conclusion that it's no good talking of justice to a woman they don't understand what you're driving at those of the banking classes anyhow i told her she could stick to beauleigh court since it would only be a white elephant to me with my six hundred a year and go on ruling the county but i was going to clear out and i couldn't help saying that i hoped her path and mine would never cross again it was deuced little to say said lord crosland oh what was the good she couldn't have understood she's mad mad as a hatter about the glory of the beauleighs but it did one good thing it made her cast me off for good and all she'd toiled for the family and this was her reward i might go to the workhouse my own way now you see she won't interfere to stop my finding the boy and i'm going to find him if i have to spend ten years on it and every penny i have and when i have found him i'm going to look after him myself and keep him with me i don't suppose i shall find it much in my line i'm not fond of children and i'm not an affectionate person that sort of thing is rather dried up in me but it was little enough i could do for my wife while she was alive and now i should like to do the only thing i can i see said lord crosland well you can understand that though i've agreed to share these rooms with you for the next few days i can't make it a permanent arrangement i may have to be off anywhere at a moment's notice on the other hand by offering a thumping big reward as i can do at last i shall probably find him at once and you wouldn't care for rooms with a small child about oh i don't know i rather like kids said lord crosland they're amusing little beggars often enough ah but this one is so small only two and a half said sir tancred and now i'll write the advertisement chapter two the finding of tinker sir tancred went to the writing table sat down and began to write he wrote slowly pausing to think and made many erasures i think the advertisement will make my stepmother squirm it'll make the county talk he said thoughtfully it seems to me you can't help giving the show away said lord crosland there came a knock at the door and a waiter came in please sir tancred there's a lady leastways a person wanting to see you to see me said sir tancred with some surprise who can it be show her up he went on with his writing and presently the waiter ushered in a tall gaunt woman with a rugged hard featured face dressed in the rustiest black and carrying a brown paper parcel sir tancred turned round in his chair and she said very nervously good morning sir good morning said sir tancred then he sprang up and cried why why it's selina goodyear yes sir it's me i was afraid you wouldn't remember me after all this time and and it's a liberty i'm taking coming to see you like this she went on with a voluble nervous eagerness twisting her hands but not getting any answer to my letters i went down to beauleigh court yesterday on the chance of getting a word with you for i knew you'd be bound to be there seeing as it was your coming of age but i didn't get a chance and came back to london by the last train not knowing as you was in it till i came out of victoria and saw you getting into a cab and heard you tell the cabman to drive here and i made up my mind to come and see you here though i know it's a liberty i'm taking but i can't help it and her voice suddenly grew fierce it's about the boy the boy my boy cried sir tancred yes sir you see i was his nurse from the first poor miss pamela i mean lady beauleigh sir gave him to me to take care of before she died leastways she didn't give him to me she was too weak poor dear but she told me to take care of him as i wrote to you sir as you wrote yes go on and i did take care of him till mr vane died and oh he was such a dear baby then when the young lawyer came with mrs bostock and told me as how you had arranged for her to have charge of him and i had to give him over to her it nearly broke my heart but it isn't about myself i came to talk but about him i know it's troubling you sir and a gentleman has his pleasures and they take up his time but after all he's your own son sir and if you'd only come and see him for yourself you wouldn't let him be treated like he is you know where he is sir tancred almost shouted why of course sir i told you in my letters he's living with them bostocks out catford way you must take me to him at once cried sir tancred and he rushed into his bedroom and came out with a hat and stick look here old chap said lord crosland i'm going to clear out for a few days you'd like the kid to yourself at first then i'll come back and share the rooms if you like oh no it'll be all right said sir tancred and he hurried selina from the room to the lift from the lift to a cab they were no sooner settled in it and the driver was getting quickly through the traffic under the stimulus of a promise of treble his fare than sir tancred turned to selina and said quickly what do you mean by saying that i would not let the child be treated as he is how's he treated i mean that he's starved and beaten that's what i mean sir said selina just what i said in my letters but i was told he was in the hands of respectable people respectable exclaimed selina but i told you in my letters all about them sir when did you write to me said sir tancred first when miss pamela died and then when mr vane died sir tancred saw how his stepmother had obtained the information which enabled her to get possession of the child and three times since october since october cried sir tancred he had never dreamed that the suppression of his letters had continued after his recovery i only found the boy in october said selina look here said sir tancred you'd better tell me the whole story from the beginning i didn't get your letters you didn't get them said selina and her face cleared i thought you couldn't have sir i knew you wasn't the one to take no notice of them well it was like this sir when mrs bostock took the boy away i began to worry and worry about him i kind of pined for him then i thought if i could see him sometimes i should feel better and i never liked the looks of mrs bostock she looked like a drinker though all the time she was in jersey with the lawyer she kept sober enough i had got another place in st hellers but i couldn't stand worrying about him and wondering if he was well treated and i didn't like the way she wouldn't tell me where she lived i had my savings too so i gave up my place and came to london to look for her i knew she lived in south london from something she let drop and i took a room in lambeth and looked for her in neighbourhoods which would be likely for her to live in but it's a large place sir and i was months and months doing it moving from neighbourhood to neighbourhood i used to trapse and trapse about all day and at night i used to go into publics the saloon bars as well as the common bars for i didn't know which class she really belonged to i went into hundreds of publics but i never set eyes on her then last october when i'd nearly come to the end of my savings i saw her going into a public at new cross i couldn't believe it it seemed too good to be true i thought i must have made a mistake i daren't go in for fear she should know me and i thought she never would come out when she did come out and i saw it was really 'er i nearly fainted right away but i follered 'er and she went from public to public with two shops in between and it was nearly ten o'clock when she took the tram and past eleven when she got to her cottage at catford for she stopped at two more publics but i walked about all night for i wasn't going to take no chances and next morning i found sure enough that the child was there but he was that changed and he didn't know me her harsh voice sank to the mournfullest tone and she paused sir tancred said nothing he could say nothing he was amazed and profoundly touched by the persistence of this passionate single eyed devotion in this hard featured harsh voiced rugged creature well sir selina went on i moved to eltham and took a room i soon found out what sort the bostocks were every saturday they drew two pounds for the keep of the child and they were hardly ever sober till thursday and they starved the child sir and sometimes they beat him now and then when they were drunk i've got food good food to him but not often for he was their livelihood and however drunk they was they kept an eye on him mostly he's locked up in a bedroom i wrote to you sir three times and waited and waited for answers till i was sick at heart and things was getting worse and worse i couldn't have stood it any longer i was just going to steal him and carry him off somewhere where i could look after him without no one interfering but i thought i'd see you and tell you about it first and now sir if you'd let me have charge of him her eyes fairly blazed with eagerness i'd look after him properly i would indeed and i shouldn't want no two pounds a week why five shillings five shillings would be ample sir i'm a capable woman and i can get as much charring as ever i can do of course you shall have charge of him said sir tancred you seem to be the only person in the world who has any right to have charge of him oh thank you sir said selina in a husky voice and she dabbed at her eyes it's not for you to thank me it's for me to thank you said sir tancred oh no sir said selina quickly i know what gentlemen are i've been in service in good houses they have their sport and their pleasures and they can't attend to things like this i've been looking for him for six months ever since i knew that i had a child said sir tancred in a very bitter voice have you now sir said selina ah if i'd only known and come to you her story had tided them over the greater part of their journey and for the rest of it they were silent sir tancred immersed in a bitter reverie selina sitting with a hand on each knee bent forward with shining eyes breathing quickly towards the end of their journey she had to direct the cabman and past the last long row or little red brick villas in a waste from which the agriculturalist had retired in favour of the jerry builder they came to the goal three dirty tumble down cottages the cab stopped at the third cottage selina sat back in the seat and pulled down her veil in case mrs bostock should recognise her sir tancred got down and knocked at the door a long drawn snore was the only answer he hammered on the door with his cane till he heard the grating of a chair on a brick floor the door opened and a blowsy red faced woman peered at him with blinking eyes you have a little boy here in your charge i've come for him said sir tancred the woman only blinked at him stupidly i've come for the little boy said sir tancred loudly a look of drunken cunning stole into the woman's muddled face she said thickly there ain't no lil boy 'ere and tried to shut the door sir tancred thrust it open with a vigour which sent her staggering into a chair and stepped into the squalid reeking room hunched up in a chair opposite the woman sat a snoring man come said sir tancred i want no nonsense where's the child a dull muddled rage gathered in the woman's eyes she made an effort to rise on quite irresponsive legs halbut she howled halbut wake up here's a thief an' a burglar trying to steal the brat the man grunted and jerked out of his sleep with the mystic word washishish it'sh burglarsh halbut cried the woman who seemed suddenly to see two or more sir tancreds they're shtealing bratsh bash 'em halbut jerked onto his feet and stood lurching englishmansh oush ish ish cashle he said with a ferocity which petered out in an idiotic grin thash it bash 'em cried the woman halbut advanced in a circular movement on sir tancred with his fists up englishmansh oush ish ish cashle he said firmly sir tancred lunged smartly at his chest with his cane and he tumbled down with his face to the wall englishmansh oush ish ish cashle he said drowsily to the wainscot and was still sir tancred took the woman gingerly by the shoulder and gave her a shake where's the child he said apparently he had shaken the fumes up and the intelligence down for her only answer was a burst of sibilant incoherence with an exclamation of impatient disgust he loosed her and went into the back room it was empty he went up the rickety stairs and as he had expected found the door of the bedroom locked he kicked it open and went into the frowsy room the child was not in it he came downstairs and opened the back door as he did so he heard a scuttling rustle the garden was empty but the rustle he had heard set him exploring the dirty rag covered hedge with keen eyes he saw nothing and walked down the garden stooping and peering into the bottom of the hedge half way down it his eyes fell on two little black feet just sticking out and above them two frightened eyes stared through the twigs sir tancred put his hands in among them gently and drew out a tiny child his peaked little face was black his thin little arms and legs were black he was clothed in filthy rags and his yellowish hair was a tangled mat the child struggled like a very feeble little wild beast clawing and scratching but silent with a terrible silence which showed how he had learned to dread drawing attention to himself quiet quiet i'm not going to hurt you said sir tancred in a gentle voice a little husky with a piercing emotion which had invaded him and something in its tones really did quiet the child for he struggled no more though his breath came in a quick faint terrified panting sir tancred took him through the house and felt a quivering throb run through him at the sight of the brutes who had fallen back into their drunken slumbers he brought him out to the cab and said hoarsely to selina is this the child that's him sir that's him said selina holding out her hands for him and the tears of joy trickled down her rugged cheeks sir tancred gave him to her bade the cab man drive to the hotel cecil and got into the cab selina had untied the brown paper parcel and was putting a little coat on the child i took the liberty of getting it to bring him away in case you should let me have charge of him she said the child still panted but most of the terror had faded from his eyes he had recognised his friend sir tancred looked at him hungrily his soul so long starved was feasting on the sight of that atom of humanity so grimy so shocking to the eye but his own child they call you hildebrand anne do they he said with a broken joyful laugh tinker's the name for you chapter three tinker accepts his name the child sat very still on selina's lap shrinking back as far as possible from sir tancred selina kept talking to him and his father spoke to him several times but he uttered never a sound once when sir tancred moved suddenly he threw up his little thin arm to guard his face and sir tancred swore they agreed that he would be happier if they took no notice of him for a while and sat quiet he seemed relieved for he sank into an easier position on selina's lap and presently they saw him stroke his coat with a caressing gesture as though its softness pleased him after a long while he sat up looked at the horse said in a quaint thin whisper gee gee mine like gee gee and then looked swiftly round with frightened eyes fearful lest he had drawn attention to his existence suddenly he began to blink then lulled by the motion of the cab he fell asleep they sat quiet and had reached a more civilised part of london when sir tancred said do you think i could hold him without waking him selina nodded and lifted him into his arms and so they came to the hotel cecil when the cab stopped the child awoke frightened and at once began to struggle sir tancred handed him over to selina who soothed him and carried him to the lift as soon as they were in his rooms sir tancred rang for a waiter and when he came bade him bring up bread and hot milk at once the child heard the words and said plaintively mine hungly mine hungly all right my lamb said selina you shall have dinner very soon when the waiter brought the bread and milk selina prepared it and sat down at the table with the child on her knee in a flash his grimy little hands were in the basin and he was thrusting the bread and milk into his mouth with both of them selina pushed the bowl out of his reach and fed him with a spoon very slowly nor did she give him much sir tancred watched his ravenous eating with a constricted heart when she had given him as much as she thought good for him selina put the bowl out of sight the look of supreme content on his little face was even more pathetic in its extravagance than his ravenous hunger he curled himself up on selina's lap surveyed the room for a while with drowsy eyes and fell asleep sir tancred opened the note from lord crosland which he had left unheeded on the table it ran dear beauleigh i have moved myself and my belongings to and till you have got things arranged i'm off to lord's for the day but shall dine at the cecil let us dine together yours sincerely crosland sir tancred felt relieved and grateful for lord crosland's thoughtfulness we shall be able to have these rooms to ourselves he said to selina yes sir said selina and he'll want some clothes when he's had a little sleep and i've given him a bath i'd better go out and get some no i'll go now myself said sir tancred then when he's had his bath they'll be ready for him he hurried down into a cab and drove to swan edgar's there he bought the finest little vests and petticoat and frocks and socks and coats they could find him on his way back with his purchases he remembered shoes stopped the cab at the boot maker's and bought a dozen pairs when he came back to his rooms followed by two waiters loaded with parcels he heard a splashing in the bathroom and when they had set down their loads and were gone selina came to him and said i should like you to come and look at him sir she had been crying sir tancred went into the bathroom and found hildebrand anne splashing in the bath hallo tinker he said cheerfully and turned sick at the sight of the wales and bruises about the thin little body look at that sir said selina fiercely and she touched the worst of them the child winced at her touch gentle as it was and said in his quaint thin voice halbut did do that mine not like halbut no mine not like halbut and he shook his little head vigorously sir tancred groaned and wished with all his heart that he had taken advantage of his brief meeting with halbut to give him a sound thrashing then he thought with a vindictive satisfaction how bitterly the brute would feel the loss of liquors consequent upon the loss of his income he went out rang for a waiter and bade him send for a doctor when the doctor came he examined the bruises and felt all the tiny bones carefully he declared that none of them were broken and that in spite of having been starved the child was sound and healthy the moment the doctor's grip on him loosed tinker wriggled off his knee and fled to selina who carried him away along with a selection from the parcels to dress him a bad case said the doctor but i've seen worse much worse i hope you'll put the matter into the hands of the society for the prevention of cruelty to children and have the parents prosecuted picked him up in the gutter i suppose i haven't made up my mind about prosecuting them said sir tancred oh have them prosecuted have them prosecuted it stops others said the doctor and besides they might get the cat it's the only thing brutes of this kind understand then he added thoughtfully there's one uncommon thing about this child quite uncommon what's that his vitality he ought to be in bed half dying with those bruises and starved as he is but you saw how he struggled to get away from me well i'll write you a prescription for as strong a tonic as i dare give a child he wrote the prescription promised to be round every morning and took his fee as he went away he said someone ought to get six month's hard labour for maltreating him after a while selina brought in tinker dressed in his new clothes with his mat of hair cut close to his head he was still grimy many baths were yet needed before he would be clean but sir tancred saw that once clean and his peaked face filled out a little he would be a very pretty baby his features were fine his eyes of a deep blue his head was small and well shaped and the close cut hair clustered about it in little curls he clung to selina's gown and sir tancred bade her sit down and see what he would do it was a long time before he stirred from her side and then only a little way moving with a curious stealthy gait casting fearful glances at sir tancred he was attracted by the bright stuffs which covered the furniture and went from piece to piece stroking it then he saw himself in the unnecessarily mirrored door of the sideboard and surveyed his image with an almost excited curiosity and it almost seemed approbation illustration he surveyed himself with an excited curiosity an idea struck sir tancred he went out took a cab came back with an armful of toys and set them in the middle of the room the child stared and stared at them with great eyes after a long while in his stealthy timid way he made a few steps towards them and scuttled back to selina he sallied out again came nearer to them and fled back in the fourth attempt he carried off a little horse and escaped with it behind the sofa there he played with it or rather sat hugging it stroking it or fingering it in a dead silence sir tancred watched his every movement his every expression missing nothing his eyes could not have enough of him twice again selina fed him and twice he was again ravenous at half past six she put him to bed sir tancred dressed for dinner made arrangements for the feeding of selina and went into the smoking room there lord crosland found him and they dined together after dinner lord crosland pressed him to go to a theatre or a music hall but sir tancred would not the discoveries of the day had left him no heart for amusement he saw lord crosland set out in search of diversion came back to his room and sent selina to her supper while he watched over the child he sat by the window looking up the river and smoking in an unhappy reverie now and again he went and looked long at his sleeping boy when selina came up from her supper he heard for the first time the story of his wife's death and received her last message which had been so long delivering it was no little comfort to him in this revival of sorrow to hear that she had learned of the accident which prevented him from coming to her and sure of their ultimate meeting had come to bear patiently their separation and the knowledge that she must die without seeing him again had come to her in the merciful and indifferent weariness so often the forerunner of death when he had heard and heard again all that selina could tell him he gave her a cheque for five hundred pounds putting aside her protestations that she had never looked for it and would rather not have it with the declaration that he had actually written out the advertisement offering that reward for information about his missing child when she had brought it long after she had gone to bed he sat thinking over her story immersed in unhappy memories and unavailing regrets and his bitterness against his stepmother and uncle grew and grew in him at the ill treatment his child had endured through their interference and neglect to a strength to which his own wrongs had never brought it the suppression and ignoring of selina's last letters was inexplicable to him he could only suppose that his stepmother had burnt them on reading only the signature or had believed them to be the misrepresentations of a person trying to supplant mrs bostock he thought for a while of writing to his stepmother out of the fulness of his heart and then he told himself that it was no use at last he went heavily to bed three times in the night he awoke and went and listened at the door of the boy's bedroom there was no sound he was sleeping peacefully after his morning bath tinker looked a shade less grimy and even the few meals he had enjoyed since his rescue had filled out his face a little about eleven it was decided that a walk in the embankment gardens would be good for him and selina carried him out but it was very soon plain that it was anything but good for him every passer by thrilled him with a fresh terror in three minutes he clung to selina panting and gasping with fright his little fingers gripping her with a convulsive clutch his eyes starting out of his head but all in a terrible silence it was appalling to see such an extremity of emotion not dare to find a vocal expression quickly they perceived that there was no reassuring or soothing him sir tancred blindfolded him with his handkerchief took him from selina and carried him quickly back to the hotel he sat on selina's lap recovering very slowly for nearly an hour then he got to his toys that afternoon sir tancred made a search and discovered a staircase leading up to the roof it was somewhat besprent with blacks but there the child could take an airing unterrified in a solitude a trois and in a very fresh air when a south or west wind blew by the afternoon of the next day he had grown used to sir tancred and when he was tired of his silent play with his toys would sit on his knee in perfect content the skin of his face was almost white now only his knees were really grimy on the evening of the fourth day as he was having his supper eating it with much less of the ravenous fervour of a wolf in winter time sir tancred distinctly saw him smile it was very faint but it was an undoubted smile three mornings later sir tancred was lying awake when his door was pushed wider open and tinker stole in hallo tinker come here you'll catch cold what are you looking for said sir tancred gee gee said tinker come here and get warm after a little thought tinker accepted the invitation and sir tancred lifted him into bed he huddled up to sir tancred and presently found that his unshaven chin was rough and stroked it with some wonder you are a funny little tinker said sir tancred fondly mine tinker mine tinker said the child with a faint crow chapter four the training of tinker sir tancred had a very sound theory that the air of london is as healthy an air as can be breathed in england but for all that tinker enjoyed the best quality of that air on the roof of the hotel cecil varied by the ozone of brighton and the air of many parts of the country it was many a long day before he showed a real tendency towards sturdiness and outgrew the effects of his privations he was long too outgrowing his terror of strangers meanwhile sir tancred was trying to slake his intolerable thirst for distraction distraction from his memories and regrets in that section of london society which let us hope cannot see itself for its own brilliancy or hear itself for its own noise that curious collection of princes and millionaires aristocrats and tradesmen great ladies and upper bohemians about which the only fitting thing is its title found for it by some inspired journalist of the smart set there where life forever bubbles a cheap and exceedingly dry champagne of a very doubtful exhilaration he did now and again find a poor respite from regret till time blunted the edge of his sorrows and when his sorrow was no longer acute he had formed a reckless and extravagant habit of life from which even when the reason for it had passed he never sought to free himself indeed it never occurred to him to try but he never let his effort to drown his sorrow in the whirlpool of this strenuous life of pleasure interfere with his care of his little son in truth tinker's society was his chief relaxation from the laborious and exacting round wherever he might be in london paris vienna monte carlo or a country house tinker was at hand in his hotel or lodged in the neighbourhood under the care of the faithful selina a singularly early riser for one who sojourns in the polite or to be exact the impolite world even in london he breakfasted at ten sir tancred was able to devote two or three hours every morning to the child before the serious and exacting pleasures of the day and before three years had passed he had grown a veritable connoisseur in wooden bricks tin soldiers and composite animals however late he returned at night he never failed to look at tinker in his cot in the room adjoining his bedroom to assure himself that he was warm enough or if need were lift him more comfortably on to his pillow he watched him in his childish complaints with more care than the careful nurses he paid to watch him or even than the fond and faithful selina and yet he did not spoil him till tinker was six years old they were playmates then little by little sir tancred found himself drifting into the position of general instructor and after a while began to give serious thought to the matter it was not perhaps a sound education that he gave the child the classical side of it and the commercial were alike neglected the historical was forgotten the spelling was weak and the handwriting was very bad but riding fencing and boxing were very carefully cultivated with the result that tinker though he lacked the lumps of muscle which disfigured that eminent ancient might very well have vied in strength and agility with the child hercules in the matter of languages by dint of spending some of each year in the different european capitals he learned to speak better french than he did english for his father enjoyed far better society on the continent than he did in london in the same way by sojourning in the land he learned to make himself understood in german and two months at rome gave him a fair italian it must be admitted that he was as bad at spelling in all three of those languages as he was in his own again his geography was hardly of the ornamental kind he was entirely and happily ignorant of the whereabouts of leeds and crim tartary it is doubtful whether the balearic isles which most boys of the western world could point you out on a map were even a name to him but by the time he was ten he could so deal with continental or english bradshaw that in five or six minutes he could tell you the quickest or the most comfortable way of reaching any town in which a self respecting person would care to find himself and his knowledge of steamer routes and the great american railways was no less sound besides these accomplishments he was acquiring a wide knowledge of the world by his eleventh birthday though inexperienced in lestrygons and lotos eaters he had seen the cities of more men than that way worn wanderer ulysses at the end of his voyages and he had no mean understanding of their disposition besides as the years went on sir tancred's debts increased to live the really strenuous london life you need a great deal of money and though fortune so cruel to him in love was kind at bridge her kindness was not continuous and sometimes the ungracious importunities of his creditors drove him into retirement in the country during these times of exile tinker was for the most part his only companion save for brief visits from lord crosland and since sir tancred made a point of talking to him as his equal in age and experience he gained from these times of close intimacy a yet wider knowledge of the world these retirements never lasted long not long enough indeed for tinker who was always happy enough in the country sir tancred after a while grew impatient for the distractions of which he had acquired so deep rooted a habit moreover in the country out of a well filled country house or shooting box he might at any time fall into the old sorrowful brooding on his lost happiness the most uncommon part of tinker's education was the careful cultivation of his faculty of observation sir tancred himself had a natural gift of understanding his fellow creatures which along with his finer brain little by little placed him in the noble but unenviable position of being the first person to whom his friends flew to be extricated from their scrapes he had found that his gift stood him in such good stead in his varying fortunes that he spared no pains to equip tinker with the faculty even more finely developed in forming tinker's manners he was at once aided and hindered by many women the faithful selina with all the best hearted intentions in the world of spoiling the child was foiled partly by sir tancred's watchfulness and partly by the uncertainty of her own temper she was liable to the sudden gusty rages of her class and one of these rages undid the harm of many days' indulgence when however tinker was nine she resigned with many misgivings tears and upbraidings of conscience her charge of him to marry a middle aged parisian hairdresser of scotch nationality and the name of angus mcneill sir tancred had far more trouble with the women who fell in love with him and many women fell in love with him or thought themselves in love with him for his handsome melancholy face his reputation for recklessness and above all for his cold insensibility to their charm in ten years of the strenuous smart life his name was never coupled with that of any woman all and each of these made a pet of tinker since they found it the surest way to abate his father's coldness on the other hand the great ladies of the faubourg de st germain petted him because his seraph's face and delightful manners charmed them while any nice woman petted him because she could not help it fortunately tinker did not like being petted his sentiments indeed on the matter of being kissed by the effusive verged on the ungallant he liked to be a nice woman's familiar friend his attitude toward her could be almost avuncular but if a woman would pet him he endured it with the exquisite patience with which his father forever taught him to treat the sex in weaker hands than those of his father he would doubtless have become a precocious and irritating monkey always and painfully in evidence but sir tancred and his creditors saw to it that his life in the world was broken by spells of healthy boyish life and he remained modest enough and simple hearted as to his nerves though they were always high strung the effects of his cruel treatment as a baby wore little by little and slowly away until there was left only a faint dread or rather dislike of being alone in the dark and a tendency to awake once in a month or so crying out from a bad dream chapter five tinker's birthday bloodhound hildebrand anne came out of the long glass doors of the morning room of the refuge as sir tancred had happily named the cottage at farndon pryze which he had bought soon after jeddah won the derby at a hundred to one and whither he retired when he was at loggerheads with fortune or hildebrand anne began to look fagged by london life his father was reading a newspaper at the end of the lawn and he walked across to him sir tancred looked up from his paper and said with a sigh i'm afraid there's no birthday present for you tinker that's all right sir said tinker cheerfully father and son made an admirable pair a pair of an extraordinary distinction reckless pride and sorrow had impressed on sir tancred's dark sombre face much of the look of lucifer son of the morning tinker was very fair with close cropped golden curls clustering round his small head features as finely cut as those of his father sunny blue eyes lips curved like cupid's bow and the air of a seraph the name had clung to him from its perfect inappropriateness a tinker is but a gritty sight and hildebrand anne had grown up to the eye an angel child of a cleanliness uncanny in a small boy even if there were anything to buy in farndon pryze our fortunes are at a low ebb said sir tancred with faint sorrow tinker heaved a sympathetic sigh and said again oh that's all right sir and the papers offer no suggestions for a new campaign and sir tancred looking with some contempt at the score of grey pink yellow and green sheets which littered the grass around his long cane chair fanned himself with his panama for though the month was may the morning was hot we shall have lots of money soon said tinker cheerily well i hope so it is no use my reading these wretched rags unless they put me in the way of a coup we always do said tinker with conviction and he strolled away pondering idly the question of riches from the end of the garden of the refuge tinker scanned the country round with dissatisfied eyes none of the low hills was hollowed by a pirates' or brigands' or even a smugglers' cave with its buried hoard no ruin tottered above a secret treasure chamber for himself he did not mind it was all one to him whether he hunted his prey in the champs elysees or the long straggling street of farndon pryze there were men in both places and though the methods of enraging them were different they grew crimson to much the same fieriness he found indeed an angry frenchman more entertaining than an angry englishman but he was no epicure in sensations only he liked them exciting but he would fain have discovered treasure for the sake of his father who as he well knew did not find in farndon pryze the entertainment which satisfied his simpler boyish heart as he scanned the unsatisfactory landscape he heard the sound of hoofs and looking round saw james alloway a young farmer of the neighbourhood riding along the highway his face brightened the coast was clear it was the very morning to play toreador in a breath he was through the hedge and on the way to the village he approached it after the manner of a red indian only pausing to cut a switch from a hedge he had a score to settle with josiah wilby a boy whose talebearing had procured him his last well earned whacking fortune favoured him he spied his prey playing in careless security with two other boys on the village green crept between two cottages and was out on him or ever he was aware of the coming of an avenger at the sight of tinker josiah bolted for home but he had not gone twenty yards before the stinging switch was curling round him he ran the harder howling and roaring and tinker accompanied him to the door of his father's cottage as the roaring josiah rushed in the infuriated mrs wilby rushed out and tinker withdrew from a convenient distance he raised his hat and protested his regret at having had to instruct her son in the first principles of honour mrs wilby took his politeness as an insult and with a rustic disregard of his pretty manners called him a limb and threatened him with merciless punishment on the return of her husband tinker shrugged his shoulders spread out his hands gestures he had acquired in france and hurried off on his main errand he came swiftly to a small field in which there browsed a large and solitary ram by name billy tinker's playfellow in the game of bull fighting with a somewhat unfair casting of the star part tinker always played the matador billy played the bull drawing a stout wooden sword the handiwork of sir tancred who never dreamed of the purpose it served from its hiding place in the hedge tinker slipped over the gate billy greeted his playfellow with an ill conditioned grunt expressive of no joy at all tinker saluted walked up to within ten yards and waved his hat at him billy watched him with a wicked eye affected to graze and of a sudden charged with all his speed tinker sprang aside as the ram's head went down to butt and as he hurtled past prodded him with the sword behind the shoulder billy pulled himself up as soon as he could check his momentum and turned and stood blinking twice he rapped the ground hard with his forefoot tinker again drew to within ten yards of him again billy charged and again he was prodded behind the shoulder it was a beautiful game and tinker's lightness of foot quickness of eye and coolness of head did every credit to the education he had received from his father it was indeed a fine game but as dangerous as it was fine if billy had once downed the boy he would never have left him till he had ground the life out of him this tinker did not know so that he did not draw all the excitement out of the game he would have done it had grown more and more dangerous also for by dint of playing it billy who had started as a fat clumsy and sulky beast had grown thin nimble and vicious alloway indeed often declared that he did not know what ailed the ram his food never seemed to be doing him any good and neither man woman nor child dare cross the field in which he browsed the game lasted some twenty minutes and tinker's skill sureness and lightness of movement was the prettiest sight sometimes with a snorting bleat billy would turn sharply at the end of his charge and charge again then the concentration on the matter in hand which his father had so carefully cultivated in tinker proved a most fortunate possession he was never caught off his guard but he was beginning to think that he had had enough of it and billy was sure that he had when there came a roar from the road and there sat alloway on his horse or rather he was no longer sitting on his horse he was throwing himself off it without one word of thanks to his playfellow for the pleasant game he had enjoyed with him tinker bolted for the further hedge billy after him and alloway after both tinker knew the ground ran for a post and rails which filled a gap and skipped over them a few yards ahead of his energetic playfellow who stood gazing after him with a rueful vindictiveness alloway came rushing up and took no heed of the disappointed ram who butted his right leg against the rails with great promptitude and violence alloway emulated his violence not only in his language but by cutting him as hard as he could with the whip he carried and rushed on after tinker tinker could run at an admirable pace for a boy of eleven and he was used to keeping it up longer than the rustic wind would last but alloway was brisker than a farm hand or a keeper and at the end of a couple of fields he began to gain tinker was soon aware of the painful fact and knew that retribution was on him but though he could not escape he could postpone and his quick mind leaped to the fact that the more done alloway was the less vigorously would he ply his whip besides there was a chance that he might suddenly collapse at the entrance to the village there was a bare fifty yards between them as he came up to the smithy blazer the blacksmith's dog the terror of the village began to bark and tinker's saving idea came to him he ran into the yard and walked quietly up to blazer who barked and strained at his chain with every advertisement of savage fury tinker knew a good deal about dogs he came quietly up to him and tried to pat his head blazer caught at the hand and tinker left it passive in his teeth blazer's teeth bruised the skin but did not pierce and suddenly he realised that he did not know what to do with it with a sheepish air he let it go and resumed his barking tinker stepped right up to his kennel and the barking blazer danced about him in an agony of indecision alloway rushed into the yard and crying i've got you you young devil have i made for tinker blazer saw a happy way out of his awkward uncertainty and bit alloway's leg alloway jumped back with a roar and lashing at blazer hopped about the blacksmith ran out of the smithy and took in the situation at a glance take away your dog green take him away shouted alloway i'm going to warm the young gentleman's jacket he's been worriting my ram alloway was a good customer but tinker was a familiar friend and the astute blacksmith scratched his head at great length before he said slowly if zo be as you've 'it blaazer you'll 'av ter tak 'im away yoursel' i dussn't go near 'im no not wuz it ever so i'm going to larrup the young limb cried alloway obstinately you'll 'ave to wait then till blaazer gits quiet i dussn't meddle with 'im an' i'm shoeing mr 'utton's graay maare and with a natural untrained diplomacy the blacksmith retired quickly into the smithy for a minute or two alloway cursed and blazer barked then tinker sat quietly down on the threshold of the kennel and fanned himself with his hat the empurpled alloway grew purpler at the sight of a coolness he did not share you young rip he roared dancing lightly in his exasperation i'll larrup you if i stay here till to morrow morning if you're speaking to me mr alloway you needn't speak so loud i'm not deaf said tinker with gentle severity mr alloway in his violent rustic way uttered a good many remarks quite unfit for boyish ears tinker paid no heed to him but chirrupped to blazer who came to him in a wondering sulkiness and with many protesting growls suffered himself to be patted alloway put his hands in his pockets and stood stolidly with his legs wide apart a picture of florid manliness and grim but whiskered determination some small boys heavy with their midday meal came to the gate of the yard and in an idle repletion exhausted themselves in conjectures as to the true inwardness of tinker's relation with blazer and alloway's absorption in it twice the blacksmith came to the smithy door and a large slow grin spread painfully over his bovine face tinker continued to pet blazer till the surprised and mollified dog sat down between his feet and put his head on his knee then tinker began to apply that power of concentration in which he had been trained by his father to the discovery of a method of final escape presently alloway went to the gate and climbing onto it sat waiting for his triumph in a stubborn doggedness after a while tinker said gently that's a good horse you ride mr alloway the farmer said nothing he's young isn't he said tinker an acute and scornful expression of you don't get round me filled all of the farmer's face that was not covered with whiskers did you think to tie him up before you ran after me said tinker earnestly alloway sprang from the gate as though a very sharp nail had of a sudden sprouted up immediately beneath him slapped his thigh and stood shaking his whip at tinker with expressive but starting eyes i dare say he's out of the county by now said tinker thoughtfully you young blackguard said alloway and stepped towards the kennel blazer shot out to the length of his chain and alloway in his fury cut him savagely with his whip blazer roared rather than barked the noise stimulated tinker's wits and he saw his way alloway recovered himself sufficiently to say with choking emphasis horse or no horse you don't get me to leave here and went back to the gate tinker let him climb on it and then he said gently have you ever played at being a runaway slave hunted by bloodhounds mr alloway alloway scowled at him most malignantly i should think it would be quite an exciting game it doesn't really matter that blazer's only a bull terrier we can call him a bloodhound you know tinker went on looking at the dog a little regretfully alloway coddling his fury scarcely heard him i'll be the slave owner said tinker fumbling with the chain it came out of the staple and alloway roared what are you doing you young rascal oh it's all right said tinker don't be frightened i'll keep him on leash till you get a good lead alloway jumped down from the gate on the other side of it his anger changed to uncertainty spiced with discomfort blazer felt the chain loosen and darted forward jerking tinker after him i can't hold him yelled tinker illustration i can't hold him alloway turned dropped his whip and bolted up through the village blazer dashed at the gate clawing it tinker got a better grip on the chain opened the gate snatched up the whip as blazer jerked him through and they set off down the road after alloway the farmer ran better than ever faster than he had run after tinker faster probably than he had ever run before in his life blazer though tinker dragged for all he was worth made a very fair pace after him but by the time they were a hundred yards beyond the village the throttling drag began to tell blazer slowed down and alloway still going hard disappeared round the corner blazer and tinker fell into a walk and then stopped sir tancred beauleigh on his quiet way to the village post office was surprised at being nearly knocked down by one of the most respectable young farmers of the neighbourhood who was running with the speed and face of a man pursued by all the tigers of bengal a hundred yards further on he heard yells and screams and shouts of laughter and coming round a corner he saw a small boy rolling in recurring paroxysms of joy on the grass by the roadside watched by a puzzled bull terrier he had no difficulty in connecting them with the flying farmer he came up to the absorbed pair unnoticed and standing over them said quietly what's the joke tinker tinker sprang to his feet and wiping away the joyful tears said i have been playing at hunting runaway slaves ah alloway was the slave said sir tancred yes sir said tinker sir tancred dropped the subject he knew by experience that the truth might be painful hearing and that he would probably hear it from tinker's flying partner in the game quite soon enough what are you doing with that dog he said i borrowed him said tinker sir tancred looked blazer carefully over he's a very good dog he said how would you like him for a birthday present tinker's eyes shone as a long vista of scrapes out of which blazer's teeth might help him opened before his mind ever so much he said quickly come on then we'll go and try to buy him and they set out for the village mr green stood in the door of the smithy and grinned enormously at the sight of the returning tinker sir tancred said good morning green do you care to sell this dog i'll give you three pounds for him mr green said three pound and stared helplessly at the cottages opposite confused by the need to assimilate on the spur of the moment a new idea three pounds said tinker quickly why he only cost fifteen shillings a year ago an orfer is an orfer said mr green quickly his wits spurred at the sudden prospect of a lowering of the price and i takes it as he led away blazer with a new proprietary pride tinker said firmly to sir tancred i shall go on considering him a bloodhound sir chapter six the rescue of elizabeth kernaby sir tancred paused now and again in his leisurely breakfast to scowl across the dining room at mr biggleswade who with his sour looking wife and woebegone little girl was breakfasting at an opposite table the royal victoria hotel was second rate the cooking was poor the wine was bad and solesgate itself was dull but these misfortunes sir tancred would have endured cheerfully because the place suited hildebrand anne who had but lately recovered from an attack of scarlet fever at farndon pryze but he could not endure mr biggleswade it was not so much that he had reckoned up mr biggleswade as a large fat greasy rogue nor was it that no snub once and for all stopped mr biggleswade from thrusting himself upon him with a snobbish obsequiousness it was mr biggleswade's noisy and haphazard methods of disposing of his food which left small portions of each course nestling in his straggling beard and filled the air with the sound of the feeding of pigs this sir tancred found unendurable and the more unendurable that mr biggleswade had made up his mind that he enjoyed his meals more in the presence of a baronet and always waited for his coming sir tancred was eating his breakfast mournfully therefore reflecting on the unkindness of fortune who had afflicted tinker with his fever at so inconvenient a time for he had not been able to raise the money to take him to make his convalescence at one of the more expensive watering places whither resort millionaires and the smart whose fondness for games of chance and skill would have kept him in careless luxury he had been driven to bring him to solesgate a town of six bathing machines and there the rest of his ready money dwindled to a few shillings a sudden cessation of the sound of the feeding of pigs caught him from his mournful reflections he looked up quickly to see mr biggleswade staring at his newspaper with a most striking expression of triumphant greed on the instant sir tancred filled with the liveliest interest emotion especially curious emotion in his fellow creatures always aroused his interest and not infrequently brought him profit and mr biggleswade's emotion seemed to him curiously violent to be excited by the perusal of a newspaper he made half a movement to show it to his wife caught sir tancred's eye and setting it down went on hastily with his breakfast he had not been so quick but that sir tancred had seen that the paper was the daily telegraph and the exciting paragraph on the first page sir tancred brightened to the rest of his breakfast he had little doubt that he was on the track of some roguery or other and he promised himself a hunt through the paper till he found it when the biggleswades having finished their breakfast went down to the beach he lighted a cigar took his folding chair and his pile of newspapers and settled down sixty yards away from them as he had expected their first act was to discuss the newspaper with great animation handing it backwards and forwards to one another and he took the daily telegraph from his pile and set about seeking the source of their excitement he passed over the first advertisement in the agony column the offer of a reward for the recovery of the stolen child of kernaby the marmalade millionaire merely noting that it had been raised to pounds and came to the conclusion that the second advertisement was genuine while the third which set forth at great length the woes of a young woman parted from a young man seemed to him to read like thieves communicating he had begun to eliminate the superfluous words when tinker with blazer his bull terrier came suddenly up to him from behind and bade him good morning tinker had breakfasted some three hours earlier probably in the hotel kitchen for as was his invariable custom he was on the best of terms with the servants and for all that he had spent the intervening hours on the uncovered slimy rocks was in his usual state of spotless cleanliness he is the one living boy to whom dirt does not cling how have you been amusing yourself said his father his stern face lighting up with a delightful smile i'm still teaching blazer to be a bloodhound he's slow very slow blazer cocked an apologetic ear and sniffed it must be tiring work yes said tinker sadly and his eyes wandered slowly along the shore sir tancred flipped the ash off his cigar those biggleswades are beasts tinker broke out suddenly when his eyes fell on them they treat that little girl of theirs shamefully when i went to bed last night she was crying again she always is i don't believe she's their little girl at all i believe they've stolen her the deuce cried sir tancred and catching up his daily telegraph he read again the marmalade millionaire's advertisement it ran pound reward pound reward pound reward the above sum will be paid to any person giving information leading to the recovery of elizabeth e kernaby aged seven years she strayed or was stolen in kensington gardens between the hours of and a m on the th ultimo she is fair with blue eyes and long flaxen hair speaks with a lisp and answers to the name of bessie any person bringing information to messrs datchett hobb's lincoln's inn fields or to mr joseph w kernaby a cadogan square will receive pound reward pound reward pound reward he laid the paper on his knee and began to consider the facts of the kidnapping as he remembered them from the newspaper reports her nurse had taken her to kensington gardens where she had foregathered with the little daughters of sir william uglow the children's play had little by little drawn them away from their gossipping nurses right out of their sight and when their nurses went to look for them they found only the little uglows elizabeth kernaby had gone the children said that a tall gentleman had come to them and telling her that her mamma had sent him for her had taken her away in a cab the nurse had thought it strange but suspected nothing wrong till she reached home and found that elizabeth had not returned she did not return and since that day in spite of all the efforts of scotland yard and the private detective agencies nothing had been seen or heard of her the reward offered for her recovery had risen from pounds to pounds it had been a crime of a masterly simplicity and sir tancred had been sure that the child would not be forthcoming till the reward satisfied the cupidity of the child stealers he had reason to believe that the present reward did satisfy the cupidity of the child stealers and after a thoughtful glance at the biggleswades he turned to tinker tinker could be of help to him he turned to him and said do you remember my telling you of a little girl elizabeth kernaby who was stolen a week or two ago elizabeth kernaby aged seven blue eyes long flaxen hair speaks with a lisp and answers to the name of bessie said tinker glibly in the manner of one reciting a lesson quite right said sir tancred approvingly you'll be another sherlock holmes some day well i have reason to believe that the little girl with the biggleswades is elizabeth kernaby tinker's face brightened her eyes are blue but her hair is black and it's not very long hair can be dyed yes and it doesn't match her face it doesn't doesn't it well i want to know if she lisps and if she answers to the name of bessie you will find out yes i'll find out but mrs biggleswade never lets her speak to anyone i must think it out with that tinker sat down set his elbows on his knees his chin on his hands and plunged into deep thought his father sat equally thoughtful and their similar employment brought out extraordinarily their strong likeness for all that tinker was a fair angel child and his father's face as dark and proud and stern as lucifer's for a long while neither said a word nor moved sir tancred was trying to see how to work the affair on seven shillings and debating whether to call in the help of the police instinct assured him that he had no time to lose no time to walk to beachley and pawn his watch that he must not lose sight of them and in delicate matters he relied chiefly on instinct mr biggleswade would not have looked so triumphant had not the pound reward satisfied him it seemed likely that he would leave for town that very day on the other hand sir tancred was averse to going to the police he knew what the provincial police were what was excellent evidence to him would seem no evidence at all to them and they would move too late or if they moved in time would muddle the whole business and let the biggleswades know they were suspected besides it hurt his self love to seek aid from anyone no the proper game was to rob the robbers and he had seven shillings to play it with suddenly tinker stirred i'm going to try now he said sir tancred looked at the biggleswades mr biggleswade lay sprawled on his back a handkerchief spread over his face and mellowed by the distance the music of a long drawn snore murmured over the sands mrs biggleswade was nodding over a book tinker rose bade blazer stay where he was and walked off towards the hotel sir tancred twisted round his chair tore a hole in his daily telegraph and watched him tinker fetched a circuit to within a hundred yards of the backs of the biggleswades threw his straw hat on the sand dropped on to his stomach and began to squirm along towards them taking advantage of every ridge and hollow it was a long business but at last he lay in a hollow thirty yards away he raised his head cautiously and in a low clear voice said bessie the little girl sprang to her feet and stared about her wildly tinker dropped his head and lay still mrs biggleswade roused from her napping caught the child by the arm and shaking her said savagely sit down you little brat keep quiet the child sank down and began to cry tinker lay still for a while and then began to squirm away when he reached his hat he rose to his feet knocked the sand off his clothes and walked slowly back to his father she answers to the name of bessie sir he said quietly good said sir tancred and he rose they walked down to the railway station and on the way sir tancred informed tinker that he was to take elizabeth kernaby up to london to a cadogan square and at a cost of six out of his seven shillings bought two half third class tickets on their way back he learned no less to his surprise than his joy that tinker was the possessor of eighteenpence to make assurance surer therefore he bought a basket of strawberries and when the biggleswades returned to the hotel for lunch they found the beauleighs in the porch eating them would you like some strawberries little girl said tinker as they passed and he held out the basket to the child yeth pleath she said and stepped forward to take one no no keziah broke in mrs biggleswade you know they don't agree with you and she caught her away and hurried her into the hotel children like sweet things but they sometimes don't agree with them said mr biggleswade sapiently his loose and flabby bulk swelling yet bigger at the thought that he was speaking to a member of the aristocracy that is very true said sir tancred pleasantly surprised by this affability but swift to seize on a conversational opening with a baronet mr biggleswade stayed talking with him in the porch he talked to him all lunch time and he talked to him on the sands after lunch his unbridled appetite for the society of the aristocracy proved his undoing for at a few minutes to three sir tancred proposed a stroll along the shore they went slowly mr biggleswade rising to the great social occasion for which he had so long hankered and proving himself in his talk a thorough man of the world as they passed round the promontory at the end of the little bay and sir tancred took out his handkerchief tinker was awaiting the signal impatient but cool and as they passed out of sight he began to steal up behind the drowsy mrs biggleswade and presently touching the child on the shoulder beckoned her to come with him she looked timidly at mrs biggleswade whose eyes were closed and rose tinker drew her quietly away they had not gone twenty yards when a jerking nod awoke mrs biggleswade and she missed the child she scrambled up turned and saw her and cried come here you naughty girl come here at once are you bessie kernaby said tinker to the child yeth yeth she said turning to go to her tyrant tinker gripped her arm and cried pstt pstt hold her blazer hold her and waved him at mrs biggleswade blazer darted forward growling with a fine show of teeth mrs biggleswade like a wise woman stood stock still and sent a shrill scream ringing down the shore and another and another and another tinker caught elizabeth's hand and cried come on come on we've only just time to catch the train and the two children set off running to the station on the edge of the sands tinker stopped for a moment whistled shrilly brought blazer racing after them and ran on again he could hear the far away rattle of the express mr biggleswade was too deeply engrossed in his talk with sir tancred to notice the first half dozen screams from his wife and they came faintly round the promontory then he heard them said by jove that's maria and started to run back sir tancred ran by his side when they came round the promontory they saw mrs biggleswade waving frantically towards the station and half way to it two little figures running mr biggleswade showed himself a man of action he swung round and with the swiftness of an accomplished boxer dealt sir tancred an unexpected blow on the side of the head which knocked him over half stunned and almost in the same moment started to run after the children he was half a mile from them and they were less than a quarter of a mile from the station but naturally he ran much faster as the children reached the platform the express steamed in tinker hurried his prize into an empty third class carriage in the forepart of the train and pushed the ticketless blazer under the seat then he put his head out of the window and saw to his disgust mr biggleswade his coat tails flying two hundred yards from the station yelling lustily but making a very good pace indeed for his flabby bulk the doors were shutting and tinker watched the guard breathlessly when he whistled mr biggleswade had yet fifty yards to go at the sound he yelled louder than ever and made a tremendous spurt the train was well on the move when he rushed into the station but he dashed at a compartment in the last carriage wrenched the door open scrambled on to the footboard and tumbled in amidst the shouts of the indignant porters tinker drew in his head with a blank face it had been no part of his father's plan that mr biggleswade should travel by the same train to london and his heart sank a little but remembering blazer his spirits rose and he turned to the little girl with a cheerful face she was panting crying and wringing her hands in a paroxysm of nervous excitement he sat down beside her thumped her on the back a way he had with tearful females wiped away her tears with his handkerchief and poured comforting assurances of safety into her ears illustration he poured comforting assurances of safety into her ears when at last he had soothed her he began to question her and drew from her the story of her captivity she had driven miles and miles with the gentleman who had fetched her from kensington gardens to a little house in a long street there she had found the biggleswades mrs biggleswade had taken away her nice clothes and dressed her in these common things then she had cut off her hair i was wondering about your hair interrupted tinker for answer the little girl lifted up her black locks hat and all displayed a fuzzy little fair poll underneath them and let them drop on it again i see said tinker and he went on with his questioning she had stayed with the biggleswades shut up in a room upstairs she did not know how many days and then they had come down to solesgate all the while mrs biggleswade had been very unkind to her and slapped her whenever she cried for her mother the remembrance of her misfortunes set her crying again and again with quiet patience he consoled her presently she was babbling cheerfully of her home her mother and her dolls and asking many questions he made the replies politeness demanded but he lent an abstracted ear to her talk for he was considering different plans for escaping mr biggleswade most of them useless by reason of the slowness of elizabeth he could only make up his mind that they must dash for a cab as quickly as they could and trust to blazer for protection it seemed to him a very long journey and even when he had made his plan he found it no little task to take his part in the conversation as the train ran into london he told her that mr biggleswade was in the train and they must bolt for the cab at once she was all panic and tears and he had much ado to brace her for effort before the train slowed down at the terminus before it had stopped he was out of the carriage helping her down they ran towards the barrier but the platform was long and elizabeth was slow while they were yet thirty yards from it mr biggleswade was on them with a savage blow he sent tinker flying caught up the screaming elizabeth and dashed on crying loudly the nearest hospital the nearest hospital my little girl my little girl everyone made way for him but tinker picked himself up bolted after him hissing on blazer took a flying leap on to his back and locked his arms round his neck in a strangling grip as the prompt and nimble blazer buried his teeth in his calf mr biggleswade dropped elizabeth and tore viciously at tinker's hands the passengers and porters came crowding round and the moment the throng was thick enough tinker dropped to his feet and gripped elizabeth by the arm shouting police police mr biggleswade struggled to choke blazer off his leg a police inspector pushed through the crowd and cried what's all this the young rascal has enticed away my little girl and brought her up to london cried mr biggleswade who had divested himself of blazer and was holding him off by the collar and with the other hand he grabbed at elizabeth it's a lie cried tinker as the inspector grasped his shoulder this is elizabeth kernaby he stole her and on the words he jerked off her hat and wig at the sight of the fuzzy little bare poll light slowly dawned on the inspector but even more quickly mr biggleswade had seen that the game was up flung blazer away from him and bolted through the barrier the inspector rushed after him but blazer who apparently had not had enough of mr biggleswade's calf outstripped him and pinned the fugitive on the very step of a hansom when tinker and elizabeth escorted by an excited and applauding crowd came out of the station they found mr biggleswade the inspector two constables and blazer in a tangled battling group tinker saw his chance of escaping any further aid from the police thrust elizabeth into a hansom gave the cabman the address whistled blazer out of the fight jumped in after her and drove off amid the cheers of the crowd by the time the dishevelled police had mr biggleswade secured and could turn their attention to them the children were half a mile away tinker's hands had been torn by the savage rascal and on the way to cadogan square he was busy staunching their bleeding by tearing his handkerchief in two he managed with elizabeth's aid to bandage both but he was vexed that they must make such an unpleasant appearance before her relatives when they reached cadogan square he paid the cabman and rang the bell but when the door opened elizabeth assumed the leadership she caught tinker's hand dragged him past the astonished footman hurried him up the stairs and burst with him into a drawing room where half a score of mournful people were discussing over their tea the further measures for her recovery i've come back mamma and this is hildebrand anne beauleigh but his real name is tinker cried elizabeth in a breath mrs kernaby had her in her arms there were screams and pantings and a bandying to and fro of smelling salts everyone was hugging elizabeth or shaking hands with mr kernaby or slapping one another on the back and assuring one another that they had always said so tinker watched their exuberance with some distaste which redoubled when elizabeth's tangled and incoherent tale drew upon him the embraces of half a dozen animated and highly scented ladies of the kind who haunt the houses of unprotected millionaires when at last quiet was restored he told his story omitting as many of his own doings as were not absolutely necessary to make it clear in a fear lest they should provoke another outburst of embraces when he had clearly grasped the fact that tinker was the son of sir tancred beauleigh all the warm heartedness of his native drumtochty bubbled up in mr joseph kernaby he shook him warmly by the hand and cried mah mannie eh but you're a braw sonsie laddie an' aiblins ye need it nor yoursel' nor any o' your noble an' deesteengueeshed family shall ne'er ask the twice a wee bit bite or soop unner this humble roof tinker not having the gaelic was somewhat taken aback by the cryptic utterance but an anxious looking younger son of an embarrassed peer who for a considerable consideration was bear leading the millionaire through the social labyrinth hurriedly interpreted it to him as a standing invitation to dinner he thanked mr kernaby and begged that a telegram might at once be sent to his father informing him of his success and safety they tallygrams they yanners the saxpences mah mannie said the millionaire with a falling face a poostcaird is a verra but the anxious looking younger son cut him short said that it should be sent at once and bade the footman charged with its despatch bring also a doctor to dress tinker's wounded hands meanwhile sir tancred as soon as he learnt that mr biggleswade had caught the express had hurried hot foot in a devouring anxiety to beachley where dwelt a pawnbroker raised money and caught there a train to town when he reached cadogan square he found tinker making an excellent tea after his exhausting labours and giving an account of the biggleswades to a detective from scotland yard when he had heard sir tancred's story too the detective said that mr biggleswade would get five years and the event proved him right there was no getting away from the grateful kernabys but after the cooking of the royal victoria hotel sir tancred was more than ready for a good dinner he found in his host and hostess a strong disposition to adopt tinker forthwith and before the end of dinner he found them no less inclined to adopt him too but it could not be after dinner disregarding the faint expostulations of the anxious looking younger son the millionaire rose to his feet and pronounced a glowing fervid but save for the couplet the rank is but the guinea stamp the maan's the maan for a' that unintelligible eulogy on the family of beauleigh as he drove away with tinker to the hotel cecil sir tancred crinkled the millionaire's cheque in his waistcoat pocket and said four thousand pounds is a good day's work two thousand for you and two thousand for me we'll move to brighton but i spent some of the most horrible hours of my life wondering if that beast had got into the same compartment with you none of the fools at the station could tell me i was afraid you'd be anxious sir said tinker patting his arm but i think that blazer and i could have dealt with him then he gave blazer who distended by the fat of the land was snoring heavily through happy dreams of the human calf at the bottom of the cab a gentle kick and said with sad severity i shall never make a real bloodhound of blazer bloodhounds leap at a man's throat they don't collar him by the leg chapter seven the stolen flying machine you vas a vonder child said herr schlugst you know dat machine as good as me and his goggle eyes stared out of his round good natured face at hildebrand anne in a wondering admiration yes i think i have got the hang of her said hildebrand anne with some pride looking up at the great cigar shaped balloon which hung motionless in the still air vat for do dey call thee tinkar you vas not look like a tinkar and you vas not haf do not haf de tinkar brain well i've been called tinker ever since i can remember and one name's as good as another said hildebrand anne indifferently but you'll let me cross over to paris with you to

and you i vould not take no not for de oder tousand pound bah you vas not at all von vonder child you vas von foolish good night mine young friend good night and herr schlugst went into the galvanised iron hut where for the time being he lived watching over his precious machine the tinker came out of the palisade which surrounded it and walked down the cliff into brighton quite disconsolate he could not see how to get his way he came into the paragon hotel and dressed for dinner as sulky as a naturally cheerful soul could be he showed no readiness to talk and his father presently condoled with him on his lowness of spirits tinker said briefly that he had had a disappointment ah they are terrible things disappointments when one is eleven years old said sir tancred later in life they lose their edge on his words there came into the dining room a rotund middle aged jewish gentleman coated with dust and wearing a harassed air look said sir tancred that's blumenruth the jungle millionaire the financier gazed gloomily round the room looking for a table at the sight of sir tancred an idea seemed to strike him his face brightened a little and he came to them how do you do sir tancred beauleigh he said shaking hands warmly may i dine at your table i want a word with you a word which may be profitable to both of us by all means said sir tancred in the manner he always adopted towards profitable financiers of hamburg extraction a manner extremely condescending without being offensive the financier sat down smudged the dust across his face with a coloured silk handkerchief and breathed heavily then he looked at tinker as though he would like him sent away anything you may say before him will go no further said sir tancred quick to mark the meaning of the look let me introduce you mr blumenruth my son hildebrand the financier bowed but he still looked unhappy at tinker's presence a waiter brought him some soup and he began upon it hurriedly sir tancred went on with his dinner in a tranquil indifference the financier finished his soup looked again at tinker and burst out well it can't make any difference i want your help sir tancred and you're the one man in england who can help me you're used to these things and he smudged the dust on his face a little more sir tancred murmured politely only too pleased i must be in paris either to night or to morrow morning for an hour's talk with meyer before the bourse opens and i must leave england without anyone knowing i've left it it may make a difference to me of of a hundred thousand pounds pardon me said sir tancred suavely i like my clients to be open with me it will make a difference of ruin the cohens have you in a hole the millionaire gasped my goodness how did you know it means ruin or or i make a hundred thousand i see said sir tancred well i left london quietly in a motor car before i'd gone twenty miles a racing panhard stuffed with private detectives men i've sometimes employed myself he almost sobbed at the thought passed me and another came up and dropped back to a mile behind they're here in brighton i'd given it up i was going to dine here sleep the night and go back to london to fight it out not that it's of any use unless i can see meyer when i saw you i'll give i'll give five thousand pounds to anyone who can get me across to paris secretly it's here in my pocket and he tapped his breast sir tancred thought earnestly for fully five minutes then he said it can't be done don't say so now don't said the financier the money's here here and he again slapped his breast pocket it's no use said sir tancred i might smuggle you out of the hotel but there isn't any sort of vessel steamer steam yacht or launch to take you across let's go to dover in my car what's the use the detectives would follow in theirs the financier groaned and some large tears ran down his face he bent his head to hide them and for all that he was not pleasant to look upon tinker felt sorry for him cheer up man said sir tancred you can always begin again but the financier would not be heartened he made a wretched dinner after it he followed sir tancred into the billiard room and steadily drinking brandies and sodas watched him play pool at eleven he went to bed tinker had gone to bed long before but his door was just open and he saw the financier go into his room five minutes later he stole across the corridor and without knocking opened the door and went in the financier was sitting at a table gazing through a mist of tears at a nice new nickel plated revolver he had no real intention of blowing his brains out but with the childlike emotional spirit of his race he had persuaded himself that he had and was luxuriating in his woe what do you want he moaned i've come to show you a way of getting to paris said tinker closing the door softly mein gott cried the millionaire relapsing into his vernacular in his excitement how how by herr schlugst's flying machine a flying machine is the boy mad no i'm not i've been with herr schlugst on three trial trips and the last two he let me work it most of the time it's as easy as winking once you know how to do it and he says i understand it as well as he does it's all ready for the journey we've only got to get into it without waking him and he sleeps like a log mein gott mein gott what a plan i'm to fly in the air with a little boy oh good gracious me good gracious me what am i to do and he stamped up and down wringing his hands it's that or the revolver said tinker sweetly the financier clutched at his hair and raved fear and avarice conflicting tore at his vitals he owed his millions to no genuine force of character but to luck industry and dishonesty in this great crisis of his life he was helpless tinker trained from babyhood by his wise father to study his fellow creatures understood something of this and began to goad him to the effort it's a lot of money to lose said he thoughtfully the sweat of my brow the sweat of my brow groaned the financier who had really made it by the nimbleness of his tongue and it seems a pity to blow your brains out which hurts a good deal before you've tried every chance said tinker the financier groaned at any rate if we did come a cropper you'd be no worse off ah cried the financier stopping short why shouldn't i wake herr schlugst and get him to take me because he won't said tinker quietly he told me that nothing would induce him to try a flight in the night he's all right in the daytime but the darkness funks him foreigners are like that they'll go to a certain point all right but there they stop that's what i've noticed i notice these things you know he spoke indulgently it never occurred to the financier to doubt him he was already a little under the influence of the cooler head he walked up and down a little longer and tinker said no more he had been taught to leave people to themselves when he saw them beginning to come to his way of thinking at last with a horrible grimace which showed the depth of his agony the financier cried i'll come i'll come i'll trust my life oh my precious life to you after all you rescued the kernaby child and you had to fight to do it i'll risk it oh my money my money very good said tinker i'll come for you at half past twelve put on your warmest great coat it'll be cold and he slipped gently out of the room five minutes later the distracted financier rang his bell and ordered a bottle of liqueur brandy it was the best thing he could have done a private detective who was sitting on guard in a room lower down the corridor to see that he did not go downstairs again believed him to have thrown up the sponge and to be drowning his sorrow and allowed himself to become immersed in the current number of the family herald as was his practice sir tancred on his way to bed looked in on tinker and found him sleeping the profound sleep of youth and innocence but no sooner did he hear his father in bed and still than he rose from that profound sleep of youth and innocence dressed even to his great coat he took a letter from his pocket and put it prominently on the dressing table it ran dear father i have taken bloomenroot to parris in herr shlugst flyingmacheen bring him to meet me at the ifell tower your affectionate son tinker then with his boots in his hand he stole across to the financier's room thanks to the brandy the financier looked very much wound up tinker bade him write on a sheet of notepaper don't call me till eleven pinned it on the outside of his bedroom door locked it and took the key he left the sitting room door unlocked then he opened the window and followed by his protege who was already shivering with dread he stepped out on to the balcony with the air of the leader of an army the balcony ran round the hotel as a way of escape during a fire it was broad and since the night was starry but fairly dark they were little likely to be seen from below by the detectives watching the hotel doors they walked round to the back came through a window into a bathroom through the bathroom on to the servants' staircase and went right down into the basement i get up early in the morning before the servants and i had to find a way out said tinker in an explanatory whisper he led the way through the kitchen into a long passage set with the doors of cellars on either side at the end of the passage was a short ladder with rounded iron rungs by which barrels were lowered and tinker mounting three rungs pushed back a bolt raised the heavy trap a little and peered about from under it the street's clear he said come on he slipped out on to the pavement helped the clumsy financier through the trap caught his hand and ran him across the street into a narrow lane there he said cheerfully that's the most difficult part of the business you're out of the hotel and not a soul knows it the financier's spirits brightened tinker had shown him his mettle and he began to have confidence besides he had drunk a good deal of the bottle of brandy they hurried through the town by byways and up on to the cliffs as they neared the palisade and saw the great bulk of the balloon looming through the starlight the panting financier's spirits sank his teeth chattered and his knees knocked together oh buck up buck up said tinker impatiently you're all right you're all right it was a matter of a few seconds for him to climb the door of the palisades drop lightly on the other side and open it he steered the financier gingerly round the planes past the propelling and steering fans and got him into the car he set him well forward in the bows of it and began to let the rope unwind from the windlass which moored the flying machine all the while he heard the steady snores of herr schlugst sleeping in his iron hut the flying machine rose slowly with very little creaking for all the greatness of the planes the last of the rope ran out and the lights of the town sank like stones in water beneath them right away cried tinker joyfully and the financier gasped when the lights of the town were a mere blur beneath them tinker switched on the electric lamps and the millionaire saw him sitting on a wicker seat in the stern of the boat shaped car surrounded by levers instruments and dials tinker bade him grip the steel rails on either side of the car and get ready for a swoop then he set the motor going and steered round the flying machine on to her course she rose and rose moving steadily forward at the same time far above the sound of the waves of the channel now herr schlugst did not rely so much on his propeller for speed as on his skilful adaptation of the principle on which the bird swoops when the aneroid told tinker that the car had reached the height of feet he opened a valve and let the gas escape slowly from the balloon the instant she began to sink he switched to a slight downward angle the great planes some seventy feet long which were fixed parallel to the car the machine began to glide downwards on them gathering momentum from the weight of the car at a quickly increasing speed until she was tearing through the air at the rate of forty miles an hour and sinking a hundred feet in the mile the financier sat hunched up gasping and shivering as the air whizzed past his ears and shrilled among the ropes tinker with an air of cheerful excitement kept the machine on her course and watched the aneroid his face of a seraph was peculiarly appropriate to these high altitudes though the millionaire was too busy with his fears to observe the fact in half an hour the machine had rushed down to five hundred feet above the sea tinker switched the planes to the same angle upwards and the momentum drove her up the incline of the air with little diminished speed then he turned a tap and let the stored gas compressed in an aluminum cylinder flow into the balloon and restored the whole machine to its former buoyancy moving more and more slowly the higher it rose the flying machine once more gained the height of feet and once more swooped down from it at the beginning of the upward sweep tinker said another swoop like that will bring us to paris the financier who had spent the time qualifying for a place among the invertebrates only groaned tinker was disgusted but he said cheer up you're the first man who has ever crossed the channel in a flying machine you'll be in the history books the car rose and rose tinker had just resolved to swoop from feet this time when of a sudden she rose out of the windless area into a stiff breeze icily chill they learnt what had happened by the balloon bumping down on their heads with apparent intent to smother them and in a breath the car was spinning round and jerking furiously to and fro the millionaire screamed and bumped about the car and bumped and screamed tinker set his teeth jammed the flying machine into the teeth of the wind switched down the planes and tried to drive her down it was no use she was whirled along like a piece of thistledown then he opened the valve and let her sink in three minutes she had fallen below the wind and was shooting swiftly on the downward swoop the financier was staring at him with a frenzied eye tinker closed the valve and said with a joyous brightness she was quite out of control for a good five minutes illustration she was quite out of control for a good five minutes the financier frankly gave it up with a rending gasp he fell back in a dead faint tinker shrugged his shoulders regulated the pace of the machine by letting gas flow from the cylinder into the balloon till it was of the proper buoyancy then roped the senseless financier to the bottom of the car and came back to the helm the wind they had risen into had been blowing towards the east so they had not lost ground during their tossing but they had been driven south of their course and he did not know exactly how to get back to it on the dark earth beneath he could see towns as blurs of light on all sides of him but no one of them was big enough to be paris he let the machine swoop on down to five hundred feet and up again on the upward course from fifteen hundred feet he saw a great blur of light on the northern horizon it was paris and he was swooping past it he steered the machine round without taking the way off her and swooped down towards the city at the end of the swoop he was already over the suburbs and he switched off the electric lamps he took the way off the machine by switching up the planes and then using only the propeller circled round seeking for the eiffel tower presently he saw it looming through the first dim grey light of the dawn steered over it let fall a grapnel and hooked it into the railings which ran round it took a turn of the rope round the windlass and wound the machine down to within twenty feet of the top then he went to the financier unroped him and kicked him in the ribs ungently as he kicked saying get up get up an astonished voice below cried qui vive looking over the side of the car tinker saw dimly the figure of a gendarme and said briskly santos dumont vive santos dumont cried the gendarme with enthusiasm tinker went back to the financier and kicked him again where am i where am i he murmured faintly on the top of the eiffel tower said tinker what saved saved cried the financier for all the world as though he had been in a melodrama and he sat up i should like the five thousand pounds please said tinker brought back by the touch of earth from his aerial dreams to cold reality five thousand pounds cried the financier every faculty alert at the mention of money no no how am i to get five thousand pounds five hundred now five hundred pounds is an enormous sum an enormous sum for a little boy or even fifty yes yes fifty that's really very tiresome said tinker very gently i never thought you'd be so foolish as to leave all that money in empty rooms in an hotel well well we must fly straight back and get it i hope we shall have as good luck as we had coming over and he turned to the levers here here here screamed the financier tore a button off his coat in his haste to get at his breast pocket whipped out his notecase and with trembling fingers took five notes from the bundle which stuffed it and thrust them into tinker's hand tinker counted them made sure that each was for a thousand pounds and put them in his pocket then he looked down at the gendarme and said in french i want to drop my assistant will you conduct him to the bottom of the tower mais oui avec plaisir monsieur le comte cried the gendarme striking himself hard on the chest to show his eager enthusiasm merci bien said tinker lowering the rope ladder the gendarme held it steady and the financier descended gingerly when he was off it and the gendarme had loosed it tinker said au revoir and mind you wire to my father at once and let the grapnel rope slip out of the windlass lightened of the financier the machine shot up into the air tinker's task was done he had only to restore the machine to herr schlugst but he had a long while to wait he realised suddenly that he was hungry and very very sleepy by letting some gas escape he reduced the machine to a controllable buoyancy and set about warming the coffee which the thoughtful herr schlugst had ready made then with brown bread butter and german sausage he made an excellent breakfast it was light by the time he had finished and he set about looking for a sleeping place for he could not keep awake long a wood on a hill some miles away seemed to him the spot he sought he swooped gently for it and was soon anchored to a tree top and sleeping peacefully it was past noon when a shouting awoke him he looked down to find the wood full of people four or five bold photographic spirits in the tree to which he was anchored but nowhere near his grapnel which was among the smaller branches the roads leading to the wood were choked with bicycles motor cars and pedestrians and a station near was disgorging a crowd of people from an excursion train it was time to be going he cut the grapnel rope and started leisurely for paris he reached it in about an hour and circled about it observing it from above then he came to the eiffel tower and practised steering round it to the great joy of an excited and applauding crowd which thronged its top and stages it was a great moment he steered away over paris made a meal of the coffee brown bread and sausage left and came back he was growing tired of waiting and was meditating crossing over the top of the tower and pouring a little water from the ballast tank on the sympathetic crowd when he saw his father and herr schlugst forcing their way through it at once he rose above the tower and let down the grapnel a dozen hands seized it and drew down the machine tinker let the stored gas flow into the balloon to allow for herr schlugst's extra weight and lowered the rope ladder the bursting teuton came clambering up it forcing down the car and planes by his weight on to the heads of the crowd which was forced to hold them up with a thousand hands ach you young tevil my machine to sdeal he cried tumbling into the car you shouldn't have refused to take me with you said tinker preparing to slip over the other side on to anyone's head what haf you broke what haf you broke cried herr schlugst looking round at the instruments with a practised eye and seeing them unharmed nothing what should i break anything for said tinker scornfully no dere is nodings broke schoundrel but vere vere is mine von tousand pound i ask you vare is mine von tousand pound you haf ruined me ruined me oh that's all right said tinker i had a passenger who paid his fare here are two thousand pounds and he gave him two of the notes herr schlugst opened his mouth and stared at the notes doo tousand pound doo tousand pound he muttered thickly you vas von vonder child von vonder child tinker bade him good bye and slipped out of the car leaving him to fly to some smooth place in the environs where he could dismantle his machine sir tancred was too thankful for tinker's safety to be very angry with him and they descended the tower surrounded by gendarmes who were put to it to preserve tinker from the embraces of excited persons of either sex one fat frenchman indeed kissed him on both cheeks crying vive le rosbif vive le rosbif before he could ward him off at the bottom of the tower mr blumenruth radiant and triumphant burst through the throng flung himself upon them and dragged them to a smart victoria which awaited them he told them joyously that he had cleared eighty seven thousand pounds and protested that they should be his guests at his hotel as long as they stayed in paris on the way to it sir tancred got down to buy some cigars and he was barely in the shop when the financier said in a jerky way to tinker i saw a very neat little motor car which i should like to make you a present of but i say i don't want you to tell anyone how how ill i was up there my spirit was all right of course but that rarefied air acting on business worries produced a state of nervous prostration i i wasn't quite myself in fact tinker looked at him with intelligent interest and closing one of his sunny blue eyes said thoughtfully nervous prostration is the motor a panhard yes said mr blumenruth if you hadn't been so so upset i've no doubt you'd have sailed the machine yourself said tinker warmly chapter eight the baron and the money lender sir tancred would only stay four days in paris with the grateful blumenruth because he wished hildebrand anne to have the sea air for it seemed to him that he had not yet got back his full strength after the scarlet fever they returned therefore to brighton and when the weather grew hotter removed to the more bracing east coast tinker was for sharing the three thousand pounds he had made out of his trip in the flying machine equally with his father but sir tancred would not hear of it chiefly to please him however he borrowed a thousand of it at five per cent and invested the rest in tinker's name with this thousand pound note and three notes of fifty pounds he paid off the loan of a thousand pounds which he had borrowed from mr robert lambert a money lender five years before with the balance of the interest up to date and found himself once more unencumbered save for a few small debts and with plenty of money for his immediate needs during august and september they stayed at different country houses and fortune being in a kindly mood the money remained untouched in the middle of october they came to london to their usual rooms in the hotel cecil and sir tancred was one morning at breakfast disagreeably surprised to receive from mr robert lambert a demand for the immediate payment of pounds at first he thought it was a mistake then he remembered that he had paid mr lambert in notes and that mr lambert had promised to get at once from his bank the promissory note on which the money had been borrowed and send it to him the promissory note had not come and the matter had passed from sir tancred's mind now he perceived that if mr lambert chose to deny that payment he was in no little of a plight after breakfast therefore he took a hansom and drove to mr lambert's office the worthy money lender received him at once and with no less delay began to deny with every appearance of honest indignation that he had been paid the debt sir tancred grew exceedingly disagreeable he set forth with perfect frankness his opinion of mr lambert's character declared that he would rather go to that uncomfortable abode of contemptuous debtors holloway than be swindled in so barefaced a fashion and exclaiming you may go to your native jericho before i pay you a farthing you thieving rascal went out of the office and banged the door behind him the worthy money lender smiled an uncomfortable and malignant smile at the banged door and at once gave instructions to his manager to take proceedings sir tancred explained the transaction to tinker warned him against laxness in matters of business prepared for immediate flight and they caught the midnight mail from euston by the time an indefatigable bailiff had ascertained next day that they had left london they were eating their dinner in a secure peace at ardrochan lodge in ardrochan forest which sir tancred had borrowed for the while from his friend lord crosland hildebrand anne was used to long periods unenlivened by companions of his own age and he began forthwith to make the best of the forest some days he stalked the red deer with his father some days were devoted to his education fencing boxing and gymnastics and on the others he explored the forest on a shaggy pony it was of a comfortable size forty square miles or thereabouts stretches of wild heath broken by strips of wood craggy hills and swamps full of streams and abounding in many kinds of animals it was an admirable place for indians outlaws brigands and robber barons and tinker practised all these professions in turn with the liveliest satisfaction at first it was something of a tax on his imagination to be a whole band of these engaging persons himself with one companion it would have been easy enough but his imagination presently compassed the task and when he found his way to the deil's den a low stone tower on a hill some six miles from ardrochan his favourite occupation was that of robber baron it would have been more proper to put the tower to its old use of a lair of a highland cateran but to his shame tinker funked the dialect with which such a person must necessarily be cursed the deil's den had earned its name in earlier centuries from the bloody deeds of its first owners no gillie would go within a mile of it even in bright sunshine tinker's carelessness of its ghosts a headless woman and a redheaded man with his throat cut had won him the deepest respect of the village or rather hamlet of ardrochan twice he had constrained himself to wait in the tower till dusk in the hope that his fearful but inquiring spirit would be gratified by the sight of one or other of these psychic curiosities it was a two storied building and its stone seemed likely to last as long as the hills from which it had been quarried in some thought that it might be used as a watch tower by his keepers lord crosland had repaired its inside and fitted it with a stout door and two ladders one running to the second story and another to the roof from here the keen eyes of hildebrand anne baron of ardrochan scanned often the countryside looking for travelling merchants or wandering knights while his gallant steed black rudolph whose coat was drab and dingy waited saddled and bridled below and blazer the bloodhound sniffed about the burn hard by blazer had a weakness for rats quite uncommon in bloodhounds tinker cherished but a faint hope that fortune would ever send him a prisoner even a braw shock headed lad or sonsie savage lassie of the country but he did not do justice to that goddess's love of mischief it was she who inspired into mr robert lambert the desire to shine in the great world and it was she who gave him the idea of taking for the season lord hardacre's house and forest of tullispaith in lieu of the cash which he would never get thither he invited certain spirited young clients who had practically only the choice of being mr lambert's guests at tullispaith or king edward's at holloway thither he came a week beforehand to make ready for them at once he set about becoming an accomplished deer stalker for three days he rode or tramped about the forest of tullispaith in search of red deer which in quite foolish estimate of their peril insisted always on putting a hill between themselves and his rifle on the fourth day he rested for though his spirit was willing his legs were weak this inactivity irked him for he knew the tireless energy of the english sportsman and at noon fortune inspired him with the most disastrous idea of all the idea of taking a stroll by himself he took his rifle and a packet of sandwiches and set out now to the unpractised eye any one brae or glen or burn of bonnie scotland is exactly like any other brae or glen or burn of that picturesque land he had not gone two miles before he had lost his way he did not mind for he was sure that he knew his direction he was wrong he may have been like his oriental ancestors in some of his qualities but he lacked their ingrained sense of orientation and he was walking steadily away from the house of tullispaith he rested often and he looked often at his watch he passed over the border of tullispaith into the forest of ardrochan and wandered wearily on and on the autumn sun was moving down the western sky at a disquieting speed when at last he caught sight of the dell's den and with a new energy hurried towards it at about the same time hildebrand anne the robber baron of ardrochan caught sight of him mounted black rudolph and rode down to meet him ready to drag or lure him to his stronghold the angel face of tinker had never looked more angelic to human being than it looked to the weary money lender he had never seen him before therefore he had no reason to suppose that that face was not the index to an angelic nature unfortunately tinker knew by sight most of his father's friends and enemies and at the first glance he recognised the squat figure the thick square nose and muddy complexion of mr robert lambert my lad said the money lender failing to perceive that he was addressing one of the worst kind of man in all romance i've lost my way i want to get to the house of tullispaith which is the road there is no road and it's eight miles away said tinker knitting his brow into the gloomy and forbidding frown of a robber baron eight miles what am i to do where is the nearest place i can get a conveyance it would be a twenty mile drive if you got a cart and there's no cart nearer than ardrochan and that's six miles away well then a horse or a pony and a guide you could get a pony at hamish beg's and one of his sons could guide you where does he live how can i get there three miles the other side of that tower will you show me the way i'll give you i'll give you half a crown hildebrand anne of ardrochan is not the hired varlet of every wandering chapster said tinker with a splendid air i'm not a wandering chapster said the money lender i'm a gentleman of london i'll give you five shillings half a sovereign a pound the offer of money to one in whose veins flows the proudest blood of the north is an insult said tinker in a terrible voice no offence no offence said mr lambert cursing what he believed to be the penniless highland pride under his breath suddenly tinker saw his way from the top of yon tower i can show you the path to hamish beg's follow me he said turned his pony and led the way up the hill with a sinister air with a groan the money lender quite unobservant of the sinister air breasted the ascent he set down his rifle by the door of the tower and followed tinker up the ladders you see those two pine trees between those two far hills said tinker mr lambert drew round his field glasses and after long fumbling focussed them on the pines well he said there was no answer he turned to his angel guide and found himself alone on the tower he ran to the top of the ladder and looked down at the bottom stood tinker regarding him with an excellent sardonic smile ha ha he cried in a gruff triumphant voice trapped trapped and he turned on his heel the money lender heard the door slam and the key turn in the lock he ran to the parapet and saw tinker mounting his pony with an easy grace and the air of one who has performed a meritorious action hi hullo what are you up to cried mr lambert foul extortioner your crimes have found you out you have consigned many a poor soul to the dungeon it is your turn now said tinker with admirable grandiloquence then dropping to his ordinary voice he added plaintively of course it's not really a dungeon it ought to be underground with rats but we must make the best of it look here my lad said mr lambert thickly i don't want any of your silly games i shall be late enough home as it is you unlock that door and show me the way to this beg's at once d'ye hear tinker laughed a good scornful laugh lambert of london he said returning to the romantic vein to night reflect on your misdeeds to morrow we will treat of your ransom hans breithelm and jorgan schwartz ye answer for this caitiff's safe keeping with your heads i charge ye watch him well to horse my brave men we ride to ardrochan and he turned his pony illustration to night reflect on your misdeeds to morrow we will treat of your ransom the money lender broke into threats and abuse then as the pony drew further away he passed to entreaties tinker never turned his head he rode on brimming with joyous triumph he had a real prisoner mr lambert shouted after him till he was hoarse he shouted after him till his voice was a wheezy croak tinker passed out of sight without a glance back and for a while that iron hearted inexorable man of many loans sobbed like a child with mingled rage and fear then he scrambled down the ladder and tried the door there was no chance of his bursting it open that was a feat far beyond his strength and though he might have worked the rusted bars out of the window he could never have forced his rotundity through it then he bethought himself of passers by and hurried to the top of the tower there was no one in sight he shouted and shouted till he lost his voice again the echoes died away among the empty hills he leaned upon the parapet waiting with the faintest hope that the diabolical boy would tire of his joke return and set him free again and again he asked himself who was this boy who had recognised him in this scotch desert the dusk gathered till he could not see a hundred yards from the tower then he came down struck a match and examined the bottom room it was being borne in upon him that he was destined to spend the night in it it was some twelve feet square and the stone floor was clean in one corner was a pile of heather but there was no way of stopping up the window and the night was setting in chill he went back to the top of the tower it was dark now he shouted again the conviction of the hopelessness of his plight was taking a strong hold upon him and he was growing hungry he stamped wearily round the top of the tower to warm his chilling body pondering a hundred futile plans of escape breaking off to consign to perdition the deceptive angel child and meditating many different revenges at the end of an hour he went down the ladder and flung himself on the pile of heather in a paroxysm of despair till nearly ten o'clock he went now and again to the top of the tower and shouted he was beginning to grow very hungry at ten o'clock he buried himself in the heather and slept for an hour he awoke cold and stiff and his sensitive stomach used to the tenderest indulgence was clamouring angrily he was learning what the cold and hunger which by a skilful manipulation of the laws of his adopted country he had been able to mete out to many foolish innocents with no grudging hand really were he went to the top of the tower and shouted fruitlessly he warmed himself by stamping up and down then he came and slept again this was his round all the night through snatches of uneasy sleep cold and hungry awakenings shoutings and stampings round the top of the tower meanwhile tinker had ridden joyously home and shown himself in such cheerful spirits during dinner that sir tancred had observed him with no little suspicion wondering if it could really be that he had found opportunities of mischief even in a deer forest after dinner tinker went into the kitchen where he found hamish beg supping he talked to him for a while on matters of sport then he said i say you told me about the headless woman and the red headed man with his throat cut at the deil's den but you never told me about the man in brown who shouts and waves from the top of the tower and when you come to it it's empty hamish the cook and the two maids burst into a torrent of exclamations in their strange language yes said tinker a man in brown who shouts and waves from the top of the tower and when you come to it no one's there he kept his story to this and presently came back to his father assured that the more loudly mr lambert yelled and the more wildly he waved the further would any inhabitant of ardrochan fly from the deil's den he went to bed in a gloating joy which kept him awake a while and it was during those wakeful moments that a memory of monte cristo suggested that he should gain a practical advantage from what had so far been merely an act of abstract justice it was past eleven when tinker came riding over the hills at the head of his merry but imaginary men horribly hungry but warmed by the sun to a quite passable malignity the money lender watched his coming from the top of the tower pondering how to catch him and thrash him within an inch of his life he did not know that far more active men than he had cherished vainly that arrogant ambition but tinker's cheerful and confident air afforded little encouragement to his purpose halt cried the robber baron reining up his pony hans and jorgan is your captive safe good bring him forth he turned to his invisible band to your quarters varlets i would confer alone with the usurious he rolled the satisfying word finely off his tongue rogue hand on hip he sat and watched his merry figments dismount and lead away their horses he turned and frowned splendidly on the prisoner what think ye of our hospitality lambert of london he said mr lambert scowled his emotion was too deep for words suddenly tinker dropped the robber baron and became his frank and engaging self i'm sorry to be so late he said with a charming air of apology but i had to send a message to tullispaith to say that you would not be back till saturday or perhaps monday what screamed mr lambert what do you mean well i didn't want them to hunt for you i'm going to keep you here till you do what i want said tinker with a seraphic smile you young rascal you mean to try and keep me here screamed mr lambert jumping about in a light but ungainly fashion oh i'll teach you i'll make you repent this till your dying day you think you can keep me here you shall see the first shepherd the first keeper who passes will let me out and i won't rest and he swore an oath quite unfit for boyish ears till i've hunted you down no one will come within a mile of the deil's den said the unruffled tinker it's haunted by a headless woman and a redheaded man with his throat cut but perhaps you've seen them besides i've told them that there's a man in brown who shouts and waves and then disappears when anyone comes to the tower why if they see you they'll run for their lives he spoke with a convicting quietness mr lambert doubled up over the parapet in a gasping anguish you're not going to leave here till you give me a letter for your clerk telling him to hand over sir tancred beauleigh's promissory note said tinker mr lambert rejected the suggestion in extravagant language you bandy words with me cried the baron hildebrand anne of ardrochan lambert of london beware think rash rogue on your grinders hans and jorgan prepare the red hot pincers you have a quarter of an hour to reflect lambert he flung himself off his pony tethered it strode down to the spring which trickled out of the hillside some forty yards away and came back bearing a big jug full of water mr lambert watched him in a bursting fury at whiles scanning the empty hills with a raging eye suddenly light dawned on him are you the boy who stole the flying machine he cried you mind your own business said tinker tartly it was his cherished belief that he had borrowed the flying machine mr lambert understood at last with whom he had to deal and the knowledge was not cheering his angry stomach clamoured at him to come to terms but his greed was still too strong for it the time is up lambert of london said tinker presently very sternly will you ransom your base carcase the money lender turned his back on him with a lofty dignity ha ha hunger shall tame that proud spirit said the baron of ardrochan suddenly the money lender heard the door opened and he dashed for the ladder he scrambled down it in time to hear the key turn again but the jug of water stood inside he took it up and drank a deep draught he had not known that he was so thirsty never dreamed that water could be so appetising he heard tinker summon his men and when he came back to the top of the tower he was riding away he watched him go with a sinking heart and since he was so empty it had a good depth to sink to twice he opened his mouth to call him back but greed prevailed the day wore wearily through his spoilt stomach was now raving at him in a savage frenzy now and again he shouted but less often as the afternoon drew on for he knew surely that it was hopeless as the dusk fell he found himself remembering tinker's words about the headless woman and the redheaded man and began to curse his folly in not having come to terms at times his hunger was a veritable anguish this night was a thousand times worse than the night before his hunger gave him little rest and he awoke from his brief sleep in fits of abject terror fancying that the redheaded man was staring in through the window he saw his gashed throat quite plainly he grew colder and colder for he was too faint with hunger to stamp about the top of the tower later he must have grown delirious for he saw the headless woman climbing up the ladder to the second story it must have been delirium for the figure he saw wore an ordinary nightrail whereas the lady of the legend wore a russet gown some years later as it seemed to him the dawn came it grew warmer and he huddled into the pile of heather and slept he was awakened by a shout of lambert of london awake and tottering to the window groaning he beheld a cold grouse a three pound chunk of venison two loaves and a small bottle of whiskey neatly set out on a napkin his mouth opened and shut and opened and shut the letter rogue are you going to give me the letter shouted the baron hildebrand anne fiercely mr lambert tore himself from the window and flung himself down on the heather sobbing fourteen hundred and fifty pounds he moaned fourteen hundred and fifty pounds and costs suddenly his wits cleared what a fool he'd been why shouldn't he give the boy the letter and wire countermanding his instructions oh he had been a fool he hurried to the window and cried yes yes i'll give it you give me the paper i've got a fountain pen you'd better have a drink of whiskey first your hand will be too shaky to write your usual handwriting said the thoughtful tinker handing him the bottle along with the note paper mr lambert took a drink and indeed it steadied his hand sure that he could make it useless he wrote a careful and complete letter lying at full length on the floor his only possible writing table he scrambled up and thrust it through the window crying here you are let me out tinker spelled the letter carefully through and put it into another letter he had already prepared to send to sir tancred's solicitors then he handed the money lender a thick venison sandwich cut while he had been writing the tears ran down mr lambert's face as his furious jaws bit into it don't wolf it said tinker sternly starving men should feed slowly mr lambert had no restraint he did wolf it then he asked for more in a quarter of an hour said tinker and he gave him nothing sooner for all his clamorous entreaties after a second sandwich the money lender was another man and tinker seeing that he was not ill said i must be going i have a long ride to post this letter and he began to hand in the rest of the food through the window be careful not to eat it all up at once he said it's got to last you till to morrow what's this what's this cried mr lambert you promised to release me when you got the letter when i get the promissory note or when my father's solicitor gets it i've told him to wire the money lender snarled like a dog his brilliant idea had proved of no good he stormed and stormed tinker was cheerful but indifferent he thrust a rug he had brought with him through the window summoned his phantom band and rode away mr lambert spent a gloomy but thanks to the soothing of his stomach a not uncomfortable day he was very sad that he had lost the chance of swindling sir tancred beauleigh out of pounds and his sadness and an occasional twinge of rheumatism filled him with thoughts of revenge slowly he formed a plan of disabling tinker by an unexpected kick when he opened the door thrashing him within an inch of his life riding off on his pony and leaving him helpless to starve or not according as he might be found this plan was a real comfort to him he passed an unhaunted night and next morning tinker brought him more food for some hours he played at robber baron and now and again held conversations about the money lender with his band none of them contained compliments mr lambert watched him with a sulky malignity and matured his plan the next morning he awoke late but very cheerful at the prospect of freedom and revenge he came to the window rubbing his hands joyfully and saw a little parcel hanging from the bars he opened it and found the key of the door a little compass and a letter swearing at his vanished chance of revenge he opened it it ran fly at once steer n e for tulyspathe hamish believes you are uncanny and has molded a silver bullet out of a half crown to lay your resless spirrit with his rifel is oldfashuned but he will not miss and waist the half crown he is so thriffty a sekret worner mr lambert steered ne at once he went not like the wind but as much like the wind as his soft short legs would carry him he scanned every bush and gully with fearful eyes he gave every thicket a wide berth and every time he saw hamish and he saw him behind a thousand bushes and boulders he shouted i'm mr lambert from london i'm not a spirit it was indeed a wasted and dirty money lender who reached tullispaith late in the day he had but one thought in his mind to fly immediately after dinner from this expansive and terrifying country he wired to his guests not to come he discharged his servants and as he crossed the border next day he bade farewell to the stern and wild caledonia in a most impressive malediction when sir tancred beauleigh received his lawyer's letter containing the promissory note he was not a little bewildered tinker was quick to enlighten him and he heard that angel child's explanation of his application of mediaeval german methods to a modern monetary difficulty with a grateful astonishment chapter nine tinker intervenes sir tancred lingered on at ardrochan lodge for he saw that in that strong air tinker was losing the last of the delicacy which had been the effect of his attack of scarlet fever and when lord crosland and two other men joined him there he was very well contented the others shared his content tinker more and more the baron hildebrand of ardrochan was quite happy and there they stayed till the scotch winter came down on them in all its fell severity then they moved southwards to melton mowbray and hunted till the frost put an end to that sport on the third night of the frost as they were cutting for partners for a fresh rubber of bridge lord crosland said i tell you what beauleigh the sooner we get out of this weather the better let's be off to monte carlo make up a pool and try that system of yours it's a very good idea said sir tancred the only question is whether the english winter isn't good for tinker it's hardening you know always tinker said lord crosland with a smile i tell you what nature ought to have made you a woman what a splendid mother you'd have made i think she'd have found she'd made a pretty bad mistake said sir tancred besides said lord crosland the admirable is as hard as a tenpenny nail as it is i've never seen the little beggar tired yet and i've seen him at the end of some hardish days well we'll see said sir tancred we're partners and the game went on next morning he asked tinker if he would like to go to the south of france or stay and be hardened tinker thought a while made up his mind that his father would like to go to the south of france and said i think i'm hard enough sir to go on with besides when the wind is in the east it's neither fit for man nor beast in fact it shrivels me up i should like some sunshine then we will go said sir tancred accordingly the middle of the next week found them lodged at the hotel des princes monte carlo enjoying the nourishing sunshine of the riviera at least tinker was enjoying it the demands of a system required his father and lord crosland to spend most of their day in the darker though hardly cooler air of the temple of fortune but the system went well and they did not repine the first time he dined in the restaurant of the hotel sir tancred was disagreeably surprised to see sitting at a neighbouring table his loathed uncle sir everard wigram they had met now and again during the past nine years but as such a meeting had always resulted in some severe wound to the baronet's dignity he shunned his nephew like the pest and abused him from a distance at the same table sat a charming peach complexioned english girl after a careful scrutiny of her sir tancred decided that she must be his cousin claire sir everard's eldest child and admitted with a very grudging reluctance that even the rule that thorns do not produce grapes is proved by exceptions the third person at their table was a handsome young man with glossy black hair a high coloured florid face and a roving black eye sir tancred's gaze rested on him with a malicious satisfaction he knew all about mr arthur courtnay presently lord crosland's eye fell on that table hullo he said sharply how on earth comes that bounder courtnay to be dining with the wigrams like to like said sir tancred with a surprising cheerful animation a few mornings later sir tancred tinker and lord crosland were sitting in the gardens of the temple of fortune and on a bench hard by sat claire and courtnay he was bending over her talking volubly in a loverlike attitude exceedingly offensive in so public a place to sir tancred's shrewd eyes he seemed to be deliberately advertising their intimacy she was gazing dreamily before her with happy eyes over the sea lord crosland grew more and more fidgety and at last he said hotly you ought to interfere not i said sir tancred i'm not going to interfere i have enough to do to keep tinker out of mischief without acting as dry nurse to the children of uncle bumpkin but hang it all the man's a regular bad hat said lord crosland he was advised to resign from the bridge club and i happen to know that he is actually wanted in london about a cheque and in paris berlin petersburg vienna and buda pesth men who speak french as well as he does always are said sir tancred which reminds me tinker your accent is getting too good the honest english tongue was never made to speak french like a frenchman let up on it a little yes sir said hildebrand anne but you ought to do something don't you know said lord crosland the child's very pretty and nice and sweet and all that it would be no end of a shame if she came to grief with that bounder courtnay i won't stir a finger said sir tancred firmly for two reasons one bumpkin wigram helped my stepmother spoil my early life two if this bounder courtnay has got round bumpkin words would be wasted bumpkin is as dense and as obstinate as any clodhopper who ever chawed bacon but she's a pretty child and worth saving said lord crosland what do you think tinker i should think she was rather inexperienced said hildebrand anne with admirable judgment solomon va said lord crosland clutching the boy's ribs and drawing from him a sudden yell well come along we have a hard day's work before us said sir tancred and the two of them rose and strolled off towards the temple of fortune they left tinker sitting still and thoughtful the prey of a case of conscience he knew the story of his father's marriage his separation from his wife by the action of lady beauleigh and sir everard he had been trained to detest them and to believe any revenge on them a mere act of justice but his dead mother was but a shadowy figure to him and this girl was very charming and sweet and kind for he had had a long talk with her one evening and she had shared a box of chocolates with him did those chocolates constitute the tie of bread and salt between them which his father had taught him was so binding he wished to help the girl therefore he made up his mind that they did with a sigh of satisfaction he rose sauntered up to the absorbed lovers and began to parade up and down before them his nearness put something of a check on the eloquence of mr arthur courtnay and every time tinker's shadow fell on them he looked up and frowned at last he said go away my lad and play somewhere else i don't want any cheek from a hairdresser's assistant said tinker with blithe readiness there is nothing so wounding as the truth and courtnay knew that he was weak about the hair he never could bring himself to keep it properly cropped it was so glossy his florid face became quickly florider and he cried you impudent young dog do not speak to me until you've been introduced you're always forcing your acquaintance upon someone roland macassar said tinker it was again the wounding truth and courtnay sprang up and dashed for him tinker bolted round a group of shrubs courtnay after him finding him unpleasantly quick on his feet tinker bolted into the shrubs courtnay plunged after him right into a well grown specimen of the flowering cactus it brought him up short he began to swear and though he could have sworn with equal fluency and infelicity in french german or italian in the depth of his genuine emotion he returned to the tongue of his boyhood and swore in english when he came out of the shrubs adorned on one side of his face and both hands with neat little beads of blood he found that claire had risen from her seat and was looking shocked surprised and worst of all disgusted he did not mend matters much by mixing his apologies with threats of vengeance on tinker but his temper once out of control was not easily curbed he made a most unfortunate impression on her the beads of blood scarcely excited her pity at all meanwhile tinker had taken advantage of his pursuer's meeting with the cactus to leave the terrace swiftly he went back to the hotel des princes and took out blazer for a walk and as he walked his seraph like face glowed with the pleasantest complacency blazer did not like monte carlo at all for him there was no sport and little exercise in it tinker liked it very much he had made many friends in it and enjoyed many amusements the chief a pleasant perpetual war against the heavy liveried guardians of the gambling rooms it was his opinion that people came to monte carlo to gamble it was the opinion of the societe des bains de mer de monte carlo that children ought not to be admitted to the tables they asserted their opinion and tinker asserted his with the result that his bolt into the salles de jeu and his difficult extrication from them by the brawny but liveried officials was fast becoming one of the events of the day sometimes tinker would make his bolt from the outermost portal sometimes with the decorous air of one going to church he would join the throng filing into the concert room and bolt from the midst of it the process of expulsion was always conducted with the greatest courtesy on either side for his bolt had become an agreeable variety in the monotonous lives of the guardians they never knew when or in what fashion it would come next now he had another occupation the shadowing of mr arthur courtnay that florid adonis never grew used to hearing a gentle voice singing softly get your hair cut get your hair cut or oh tatcho oh tatcho rejoice ye bald and weary men you'll soon be regular hairy men sing rejoice let your voices go sprinkle some on your cranium what ho tatcho the poetry was vulgar but long ago his insight into the heart of man had taught tinker to attack the vulgar with the only weapon effective against them vulgarity sooner or later whether he was walking or sitting with claire those vulgar strains would be wafted to mr arthur courtnay's ears and they injured his cause they kept alive in the girl's mind an uneasy doubt whether her father was right in asserting arthur courtnay to be one of the nicest fellows he had ever met a veritable gentleman of the old school an opinion founded on the fact that courtnay was the only man who had ever given two hours' close attention to his views on protection but for all this lurking doubt courtnay's influence over her was growing stronger and stronger he was forever appealing to her pity by telling her of the hard and lonely life he had lived since his father a poor gentleman of good family had died in exile at boulogne really his father a stout but impecunious horse dealer of the name of budgett certainly in exile at boulogne owing to a standing difference with the bankruptcy laws of his country was alive still but arthur was very fond of himself and once in the mood of self pity he could invent pathetic anecdote after pathetic anecdote of his privations which would have touched the heart of a hardened grandmother much more of a susceptible girl she fell into the way of calling him king arthur to herself he devoted himself to winning her with an unrelaxing energy for she had forty thousand pounds of her own but he cared very little for her and sometimes he found his love making hard work she was not the type of girl whom he admired her delicacy irritated him he preferred what the poet has called an armful of girl buxom and hearty often therefore when she had gone to bed he would refresh himself by a vigorous flirtation with madame seraphine de belle ile a brisk and vivacious young widow who affected always gowns of a peculiarly vivid and searching scarlet and this self indulgence proved in the end the ruin of his fine scheme of establishing himself in life on a sound monetary basis tinker was about to get into bed one evening and found himself slow about it his conscience was worrying him about some duty left undone and he could not remember what the duty was of a sudden his terrible omission flashed into his mind in his patient application to the task of shadowing and annoying mr arthur courtnay he had forgotten his daily bolt into the gambling rooms reluctant but firm he slipped on his pumps and went downstairs four minutes later the feverish gamblers in the salles de jeu were gratified by the sight of a seraph like child in blue silk pyjamas who flew gaily round the tables pursued by two stout and joyfully excited southern europeans in livery the pursuit was lively but short for tinker ran into the arms of a wily croupier who had slipped from his seat and unexpectedly joined the chase he was handed over to his pursuers and conducted from the rooms amidst the plaudits of the gamblers he bade good night to his liveried friends on the threshold of the casino congratulating them on their increasing efficiency in le sport and warm but happy with the sense of one more duty done he strolled into the gardens to cool illustration the pursuit was lively but short he was noiseless in his pumps and coming quietly round a clump of shrubs he caught mr arthur courtnay in the act of trying to kiss madame de belle ile with a fervour only justified by the most romantic attachment oh said tinker reproachfully and even more reproachfully he began to sing coupez vos cheveux coupez vos cheveux with an execration which was by no means muttered mr arthur courtnay sprang up tinker darted away and courtnay followed they pelted through the gardens courtnay gaining but as he passed a couple of gendarmes standing in front of the casino tinker yelled gare le voyou gare le voyou instinctively the gendarmes flung themselves before courtnay and his impetus brought the three of them to the ground with some violence with one fleeting glance behind tinker scudded on to the hotel and once safely in his room abandoned himself without restraint to convulsions of inextinguishable delight when he recovered his habitual calm he saw that fortune had given him a weapon with which he might save his cousin mr arthur courtnay and the gendarmes picked themselves up he made his explanations and wisely compensated them for the bruises they had received in his fall then giving no more thought to madame de belle ile who sat awaiting him eagerly he returned gloomily to his hotel reflecting on the carelessness which had delivered him into the hands of an indefatigable imp of mischief the upshot of his reflection was a resolve to press his wooing to an immediate conclusion the next day and the day after therefore he redoubled his lamentations that the smallness of his means prevented him from going as his natural honesty dictated straight to claire's father and asking for her hand and protested that he dare not risk the loss of her which would work irreparable havoc in his life it was only another step to suggest that once they were married her father's strong liking for him would soon bring about their forgiveness he pressed and pressed these points pausing at times to declare the vastness of his affection for her until at last against her better judgment and in spite of a lurking distrust of him of which she could not rid herself she yielded to his persistence and the overwhelming influence of his stronger personality and consented to elope with him two days later as tinker sir tancred and lord crosland were at dejeuner claire and courtnay passed them on their way to the gardens i shouldn't wonder if those two ran away together said lord crosland and his cheerful face fell gloomy they have the air said sir tancred coolly look here you ought to interfere don't you know you ought really said lord crosland who had fallen under the fascination of claire's fresh charm why don't you said sir tancred well said lord crosland uncomfortably i did go to sir everard and tell him to keep an eye on courtnay and he as good as told me to go to jericho just like bumpkin said sir tancred contemptuously i'll bet you a fiver they bolt to night by the train des decaves i don't want to bet about it said lord crosland very gloomily their talk made tinker thoughtful it would have been easy enough to settle the matter by revealing courtnay's injudicious display of affection towards madame de belle ile but that was not tinker's way he had a passion for keeping things in his own hands and a pretty eye for dramatic possibilities besides he had taken a great dislike to courtnay and was eager to make his discomfiture signal at half past four in the afternoon he knocked at the door of madame de belle ile's suite of rooms and her maid conducted so prominent a figure in monte carlo society straight to her mistress madame de belle ile having just changed from a bright scarlet costume into a brighter was taking her afternoon tea before returning to the tables bonjour monsieur le vaurien she said with a bright smile have you at last succeeded in gambling no it would be no pleasure to me to gamble unless your bright eyes were shining on the table said tinker with a happy recollection of a compliment he had overheard farceur va said the lady with a pleased smile i came to ask if you would like to sup with mr courtnay to night said the unscrupulous tinker ah le bel artur cried the lady but with pleasure where oh in the restaurant of the hotel said tinker the lady's face fell a little she would have preferred to sup in a less public place one more suited to protestations of devotion at about eleven she said at half past said tinker and i think he'd like a note from you accepting it it would please him i'm sure he he could take it out and look at it you know it was a little clumsy but though he had thought it out carefully it was the best that he could do you think so what a lot we know about these things said madame de belle ile with a pleased laugh and she went forthwith to the ecritoire and in ten minutes composed the tenderest of billets doux tinker received it from her with a very lively satisfaction and after a few bonbons and a desultory chat with her escorted her down to the casino the rest of the day seemed very long to his impatience while to claire harassed by vague doubt and real dread it seemed exceedingly short when the hour for action came she braced herself by an effort to play her part but it was with a sinking heart that she stole thickly veiled and bearing a small hand bag out of the hotel and down to the station she was far too troubled to notice that she was followed by two guardian angels in the shape of a small boy and a brindled bull terrier courtnay met her on the top of the steps which lead down to the station and when she found him in a most inharmonious mood of triumph she began even so early to repent of her rashness then went down to the station as the train des decaves the train of the stony broke steamed in and they settled themselves in an empty first class compartment her heart seemed to sink to her shoes as she felt the train move then the door opened and hauling the panting blazer by the scruff of his neck tinker tumbled into the carriage claire gave a great gasp of relief the sight of him gave her a faint hope of escape his presence was a respite tinker lifted blazer on to the seat between him and courtnay crying cheerfully i thought i'd just missed you i've got a note for you from madame de belle ile and i knew she'd never forgive me if i didn't give it to you courtnay's florid face had already lost a little colour at the mere intrusion of his inveterate persecutor that alone presaged disaster at his words his eyes displayed a lively but uncomfortable tendency to start out of his head i don't know what you mean he stuttered i don't know madame de belle ile you don't know madame de belle ile cried tinker in well affected amazement and surprise why only three nights ago i saw you trying to kiss her in the gardens it's a lie roared courtnay the beauleighs don't lie said tinker curtly for the moment breathless with rage courtnay could find no words and claire very pale stared from one to the other with startled searching eyes at any rate here's her letter said tinker stiffly holding it out over blazer's back claire stooped swiftly forward and took the letter i am the person to read that letter she said with a spirit courtnay had never dreamed of in her it is my right she tore it open and had just time to read mon artur adore when courtnay with a growl of rage snatched it from her and tore it into pieces crying i will not have you victimised by this mischievous young dog it's an absurd imposition i claim your trust but the doubt of him which had lurked always in the bottom of claire's heart had sprung to sudden strength she looked at him with eyes that were veritably chilling in their coldness and turning to tinker she said is it true it is on my honour said tinker there was a quivering movement in claire's throat as she choked down a sob she rose and walked down the carriage to the seat opposite tinker farthest from courtnay slowly collecting his wits courtnay grew eloquent and ran through the whole gamut of the emotions proper to the occasion honourable indignation and passion so deep as to be ready to forgive even this heart breaking distrust she listened to him in silence with an unchanging face her lips set thin her sombre eyes gazing straight before her suddenly despair seized courtnay and he gave the rein to the fury which he had been repressing with such difficulty at any rate i'll be even with you you young dog he cried savagely i'm going to throw you out of the train oh no you're not said tinker pleasantly by the time you've thrown blazer out there won't be enough of you left to throw me out courtnay jumped up with a demonstrative hostility tinker hissed with an angry snarl blazer drew in his tongue and put out his teeth and courtnay sat down for a while he was silent seeking for an object to vent his rage on they could hear him grinding his teeth then he burst out at claire taunting jeering and abusing that's enough cried tinker angrily pstt pstt at him blazer at him for a few seconds courtnay tried fighting but his upbringing in france had not fitted him to cope with a heavy bull terrier when the train ran into the station at nice he was out on the footboard on the further side yelling lustily come on quick before there's a fuss cried tinker catching up claire's handbag and opening the door they jumped down tinker whistled blazer and the three of them bustled along the platform i've no ticket gasped claire who every moment expected courtnay to be upon them i thought of that i've got one for you said tinker and before courtnay had quite realised that the train had stopped they were out of the station tinker hurried his charge along the line of fiacres and stopped at a victoria and pair hola cocher he said from the couronne d'or wired for to drive a lady and a boy to monte carlo oui monsieur cried the driver gaily cracking his whip they scrambled in and the horses stepped out tinker knelt on the seat looking back over the hood they were almost out of sight of the station when he fancied that he saw a hatless figure run out of it into the road it might have been only fancy they were so far off he could not trust his sight three minutes later he dropped down on the seat with a sigh of relief that's all right he said oh said claire how can i ever thank you you've saved me oh what haven't you saved me from a bad hat a regular bad hat said tinker gravely you wonderful boy she cried threw her arms around his neck and kissed him tinker wriggled uncomfortably he often wished that there were not quite so many women in the world who insisted on embracing him well you're a kind of cousin you see he said by way of defence after a while claire cooled from her excitement to the cold understanding of her folly then she grew very naturally bitterly unhappy and to his horror tinker heard the sound of a stifled sob i think if you'll excuse me he said hurriedly i'll go to sleep and happily for his comfort his pretence at slumber was soon a reality it was no less a comfort to claire she had her cry out and felt the better for it when the carriage drew up before the hotel des princes they found an excited group about the doorway sir everard wigram was the centre of it raging and lamenting he had missed his daughter and with his usual good sense was taking all the world into his confidence lord crosland and sir tancred stood on one side and it is to be feared that sir tancred was enjoying exceedingly the distress of his enemy leave the bag to me i'll give it to you to morrow whispered tinker as the horses stopped say we've been for a drive i shan't split as claire stepped out of the carriage her father rushed up to her crying what does this mean where have you been what have you been doing oh said claire coolly raising her voice that all the curious group might hear i've been for a drive with cousin hildebrand i couldn't find you to tell you i was going and taking out her purse she stepped forward to pay the coachman tinker keeping the bag as low as he could slipped through the group lord crosland hurried after him and caught him by the shoulder where have you really been he said what happened where's courtnay i've been for a drive with my cousin said tinker looking up at him with eyes of a limpid frankness ah let's see what you've got in that bag can't it's locked said tinker shortly well never mind i owe you fifty pound said lord crosland joyfully tinker stopped short and his face grew very bright do you he said i think i should like it in gold a fiver at a time chapter ten tinker's foundling on the following afternoon tinker met madame de belle ile hurrying out of the hotel in a scarlet travelling costume at the sight of him she stopped short and cried have you heard the sad news no what sad news said tinker about poor monsieur courtnay he has had an accident he is laid up at nice ill among strangers i go i fly to nurse him nurse that brute said tinker quickly that that is a waste of kindness madame de belle ile's face fell and then flushed with anger you are a horrid and detestable boy she cried angrily oh no i'm not it's quite true said tinker quietly and he looked at her seriously he wanted to warn her then he saw that he could not do so without revealing claire's secret i wish i could tell you about him he went on but i can't he really is a sweep you are an impertinent little wretch she said and left him au revoir said tinker gently but she only tossed her head and hurried on yet tinker's honest expression of opinion had impressed her she had a belief in the instinct of children generally and like most people who came into contact with him she had a strong belief in the instinct of tinker she tried to forget his words but they kept recurring to her and in spite of herself unconsciously they put her on her guard tinker watched her out of sight then he had half a thought of telling claire that she had gone to courtnay doubtless at his summons but he saw quickly that there was no need and dismissed the thought from his mind also he kept out of his cousin's way for some days he had a feeling that however grateful she might be to him the sight of him reminding her of how badly courtnay had behaved would be unpleasant to her however he watched her from a distance and saw that she was pale and listless then he saw with great pleasure that lord crosland contrived to be with her a good deal that he even neglected the system for her but for all this pleasure he was not quite easy in his mind the knowledge that he had done his grand uncle bumpkin the service of saving him from such a son in law as courtnay was a discomfort to him he felt that this was a matter which must be set right and he kept his eyes open for a chance he looked too for the return of courtnay and madame de belle ile but the days passed and they did not return one morning he found himself in an unhappy mood it seemed to him that his wits had come to a standstill for three days no new mischief had come the way of his idle hands and his regular dally mischievous practices had grown so regular as almost to have acquired the tastelessness of duties the peculiar brightness and gaiety of monte carlo life had begun to pall upon him loneliness was eating into his soul for of all the french boys who paraded the gardens of the temple of fortune he could make nothing their costumes which were of velvet and satin and lace revolted him their lack of spirit their distaste for violent movement their joy in parading their revolting costumes filled him with wondering contempt as for the little french girls he was at any time uninterested in girls and these spindle shanked precocities walked on two inch heels and tried to fascinate him with the graces of mature coquettes his careful politeness was hard put to it to conceal his distaste for their conversation possibly he was hankering after a healthier life but at any rate he who was generally so full of energy had mooned listlessly about the gardens all the morning with a far away look in his eyes and the air of a strayed seraph during his mooning about he had passed several times a little girl who looked english she sat on a seat in the far corner a strange shy timid child watching with a half frightened wonder the strikingly dressed women and children who strolled up and down chattering shrilly he gave her but indifferent glances as he passed but thanks to his father's careful training of his natural gift of observation the indifferent glance of that child of the world took in more of a fellow creature than most men's careful scrutiny he saw that she was frail and big eyed that her frock was ill fitting and shabby her hat shabbier her shoes ready made that she wore no gloves and that her mass of silky hair owed its unsuccessful attempts at tidiness to her own brushing he summed her up as that archetype of patience the gambler's neglected child just before he went to his dejeuner he saw that she was sitting there still he took that meal with his father and lord crosland and instead of hurrying off directly he had eaten his dessert to some pressing and generally mischievous business he sat listening to their talk over their coffee and cigars and only left them at the doors of the casino he strolled along the terrace moody and disconsolate able to think of nothing to amuse him and as he came to the end of the gardens he saw a group of french children gathered in front of the seat on which the little girl was sitting and coming nearer he heard jeering cries of sale anglaise sale anglaise in a flash tinker's face shone with a very ecstasy of pure delight and he swooped down on the group the child was clutching the arm of the seat and staring at her tormentors with parted lips and terrified eyes for their part they were enjoying themselves to the full they had found a game which afforded them the maximum of pleasure with the minimum of effort and just as tinker swooped down a cropped and bullet headed boy in blue velvet threw a handful of gravel into her face she threw up her hands and burst into tears the children's laughter rose to a shrill yell and with extreme swiftness tinker caught the bullet headed boy a ringing box on the right ear and another on the left the boy squealed turned clawing and kicking on tinker and in ten seconds of crowded life had learned the true significance of those cryptic terms an upper cut on the potato trap a hook on the jaw a rattler on the conk and a buster on the mark he lay down on the path to digest the lesson and his little friends fled squealing away the little girl slipped off the seat and said thank you between two sobs tinker's face was one bright seraphic smile as he took off his hat and with an admirable bow said may i take you to your people the bullet headed boy rose to his feet and staggered away uncle's still in that big house said the little girl striving bravely to check her sobs that's a nuisance said tinker thoughtfully for we can't get at him i think he's forgotten all about me he often does said the little girl without any resentment and she dusted the gravel off her frock i might bolt in and remind him they won't let us in only grown ups said the little girl uncle tried to get them to let me in but they wouldn't they're used to letting me in said tinker and hauling me out again he added it brightens them up you tell me what he's like being a girl the child was able to describe her uncle accurately but when she had done tinker shook his head he must be just like a dozen other englishmen in there he said and they wouldn't give me time to ask each one if he were your uncle the little girl sighed and said it doesn't matter thank you and sitting down again on the seat resumed her patient waiting drooping forward with eyes rather dim tinker studied her face and his keen eye told him what was wrong have you had dejeuner he said sharply no o o said the little girl reluctantly then you've had nothing since your coffee this morning no but it doesn't matter uncle is rather forgetful said the little girl but her lips moved at the thought of food as a hungry child's will this won't do at all come along with me it's rather late but we'll find something her face brightened for a moment but she shook her head and said no i mustn't go away from here uncle might come back and he would be so angry if he had to look for me tinker shrugged his shoulders turned on his heel and was gone she looked after him sadly she would have liked him to stay a little longer it was so nice to talk to an english boy after ten days in this strange land and he seemed such a nice boy but she only drooped a little more and stared out over the bright sea with misty eyes composing herself to endure her hunger tinker went swiftly to the restaurant of the hotel des princes where the waiters greeted him with affectionate grins and addressing himself to the manager set forth his new friend's plight and his wishes the manager fell in with them on the instant only too pleased to have the chance of obliging his most popular customer and in five minutes tinker left the restaurant followed by a waiter bearing a tray of dainties all carefully chosen to tempt the appetite of a child they took their way to the gardens and the little girl brightened up at the sight of the returning tinker but when the waiter set the tray on the seat she flushed painfully and though she could not draw her hungry eyes away from the food she stammered t t thank you very m m much b b but i haven't any money tinker gave the waiter a couple of francs and bade him come for the tray in half an hour then he said cheerfully that's all right the food's paid for and whether you eat it or not makes no difference in fact you may as well the child looked from his face to the food and back again wavering then said with a little gasp oh i am so hungry tinker took this for a consent put some aspic of pate de foie gras on her plate and watched her satisfy her hunger with great pleasure which was not lessened by the fact that for all her hunger she ate with a delicate niceness he had feared from her neglected air that her manners had also been neglected after the aspic he carved the breast of the chicken for her helped her to salad and mixed the ice water with the sirop to exactly the strength he liked himself after the chicken he helped her to meringues and after the meringues lighted the kirsch of the poires au kirsch which he had chosen because it always pleased him to see the kirsch burn and ate one of the pears himself while she ate the others when she had finished her little sigh of content warmed his heart he put the tray behind the seat and settled down beside her for a talk now that she was no longer hungry she was no longer woebegone and her laugh though faint was so pretty that he found himself making every effort to set her laughing they talked about themselves with the simple egoism of children and he learned that her name was elsie brand that she was ten years old nearly two years younger than himself that her mother had died many years ago and that she had lived with her father in his devonshire parsonage by the sea till last year when he too had died then her uncle richard had taken her away to live with him in london her story of her life in london lodgings set tinker wondering about that uncle richard and piecing together the details elsie let fall about his late rising his late going to bed his morning headache and distaste for breakfast he came to the conclusion that he was a bad hat who lived by his somewhat inferior wits at the end of her story he tried to persuade her to come to the sea with him and seek amusement there but he failed she would not leave the seat he gathered indeed from her fear of vexing her uncle that that bad hat was in the habit of slapping her if she angered him and for a breath he was filled with a fierce indignation which surprised him she looked so frail but he did not ask her if it were so for his delicacy forewarned him that the question would provoke a struggle between her loyalty and her truthfulness he entertained her therefore with his reminiscences and enjoyed to the full the admiration and wonder which filled her face as he talked absorbed in one another they paid no heed to the passing of the hours and the sudden fall of twilight surprised them they began to speculate whether uncle richard had had enough of his gambling and would come and fetch her but even now elsie was not impatient so inured had she been to neglect she only looked anxious again tinker on the other hand was impatient very impatient with uncle richard whom he was disposed to regard as a gentleman in great need of a kicking moreover the chill hour after sunset so dangerous on that littoral was upon them and he considered with disquiet the thin stuff of the child's frock presently he said abruptly i've promised my father to wear an overcoat during the fever hour i must be off and get it and a wrap for you you won't be frightened if i leave you alone no elsie said bravely but her tone belied the word well walk up and down quickly so that you don't get a chill if you keep near the seat your uncle can't miss you if he comes very well said elsie rising obediently only only if you could get back soon i will said tinker and he bolted for the hotel elsie walked up and down trying to feel brave but the odd shapes which the bushes assumed in the dim light daunted her not a little and she strove to drive away the fancy that she saw people lurking among them tinker was gone a bare seven minutes but to the timid child it seemed a very long while and she welcomed his return with a gasp of relief he wore a smart close fitting brown racing overcoat which reached to his ankles and for her he brought his fur lined ulster here i am he said cheerfully get into this and he held out the ulster she put her arms into the sleeves and he drew it around her and buttoned it up you are a kind boy she said with a little break in her voice a sudden strong but inexplicable impulse moved tinker he bent forward and kissed her on the lips while you might count a score the children stood quite still staring at one another with eyes luminous in the starlight elsie's face was one pink flush and tinker was scarlet that that was a very funny kiss she said in a curious voice oh what's a kiss said tinker with forced bravado consumed with boyish shame for the lapse i i liked it said elsie no one has kissed me since father died and her breath seemed to catch girls like kissing said tinker in a tone of a dispassionate observer then he seemed to thrust the matter away from him with some eagerness and slipping her arm through his he said come on let's walk up and down they walked up and down chattering away till eight o'clock then he said my father will be expecting me he dines at eight won't you come too no no thank you i must wait for uncle richard i must really but her arm tightened round his involuntarily tinker thought a while the gardens were brighter now the stars were shining with their full radiance and the lamps were alight so that even their retired corner was faintly bright well you go on walking up and down you won't feel so lonely as sitting still and i'll be back as soon as i can he said and off he went he found his father and lord crosland beginning their soup and sitting down he told them of elsie's plight they were duly sympathetic and his father at once gave him leave to take some dinner to her and dine with her thereupon after a brief but serious conference with the manager tinker departed again followed by a waiter with a tray elsie had not looked for his return for a long while and she was indeed pleased to be so soon freed from the struggle against her timidity they ate their dinner with great cheerfulness and good appetite and for an hour after it they chattered away happily then elsie grew drowsy very drowsy indeed and presently nestled against tinker she fell asleep fortunately the southern night was warm and in the fur lined ulster she could take no harm he sat holding her to him listening to her breathing looking out over the sea and revolving many memories and more schemes till at last the lights began to dance before his eyes and he too fell asleep he knew no more until he was awakened by someone shaking his arm and found his father and lord crosland standing over them the lamps of the casino and the gardens were out only the dim starlight lighted the scene the two children sat up and stared about them elsie sleepily tinker wide awake we've found you at last hasn't your little friend's uncle come for her said sir tancred no one has come said tinker sir tancred and lord crosland looked at one another desertion murmured lord crosland softly well come along said sir tancred cheerfully we must put her up for to night the children slipped off the seat tinker put elsie's arm through his and holding her up when she stumbled over the long ulster followed his father and lord crosland there were some empty bedrooms in their corridor and elsie was settled for the night in one of them tinker awoke next morning very cheerful at the thought of having a companion to join in his amusements he made haste to knock at elsie's door and bid her come out for a swim before their coffee she was soon dressed and found him waiting for her she flushed a little as she greeted him and he greeted her with a seraph's smile i thought you'd like a bathe before our coffee he said it would be nice said elsie wistfully but my hair it is such a trouble even without being wetted by sea water tinker looked at the fine silky mass of it and said with sympathetic seriousness i saw it was beyond you but we'll manage he caught her hand they ran down the stairs out of the hotel and most of the way to the beach then he took her to a lady's bathing tent and instructed the attendant to provide elsie with the prettiest costume she had changed himself and in five minutes they were in the sea to his joy he found that she could swim nearly as well as he but he was very careful of her and the moment she looked cold he took her ashore they came back to the hotel very hungry and tinker led the way through the passages at the back of the hall down into the hotel kitchen where he was welcomed with affectionate joy by the kitchen staff the end of a long table had been laid with the finest napery and plate of the hotel they sat down at it and were forthwith served with an exquisitely cooked dish of fresh mullet wonderful hot cakes and steaming cups of fragrant cafe au lait as he breakfasted tinker conversed with the chattering staff with a cheerful kindliness and a thorough knowledge of all their private concerns keeping elsie informed of the matters under discussion by such phrases as it's adolphe's wife she beats him or lucie has consulted a fortune teller who says she is going to marry a millionaire or jean's eldest daughter has just made her first communion they say she looked like a pretty little angel but he did not tell her of the chaffing congratulations heaped on him on the prospect of his settling down with his beautiful blonde demoiselle he accepted them with a smile of angelic indulgence when they had done they went upstairs and on the way tinker said i must have a shot at that hair of yours it it really gets on my nerves it's no use said elsie with her ready flush i brush it as well as i can but i can't do it very well there's such a lot of it well i'll do what i can said tinker and he measured with thoughtful eye the silken mass tangled and matted by the sea water he led the way into his room and set her in a chair took off his coat turned up his sleeves took his hair brushes and began upon it it was his first essay as coiffeur but his natural and trained deftness stood him in good stead he kept a watchful eye on her face in the glass and whenever it puckered brushed more gently but at times in his absorption in his task he so far forgot himself as to hiss like a groom cleaning a horse in the middle of it sir tancred came in and it was significant that he saw tinker's occupation without a smile made no joke upon it but seemed to take it as the most natural thing in the world that his son should be discharging a function of the lady's maid he greeted the children gravely sat down and watched the brushing with a respectful attention now and again he asked elsie a question which seemed too idle to be impertinent but her answers told him all he wished to know and presently he felt with tinker that her uncle was a gentleman in great need of kicking illustration it was his first essay as coiffeur at last tinker had finished elsie rose with a luxurious sigh and he looked at his work with fond pride it was very beautiful fine hair and its sheen of changing light well repaid him for his trouble sir tancred proposed that they should stroll down to the casino and find her uncle lord crosland joined them in the hall and went with them when they came to the casino they found a little crowd already gathered about its doors waiting for them to open but richard brand was not in it and at once elsie's face grew anxious as soon as the doors opened sir tancred went in to ask if her uncle has made any inquiries about elsie or left word where she might find him in ten minutes he came out again and said no he has made no inquiries suppose you stroll with elsie along towards the condamine crosland that is the way he would come tinker and i will wait here lord crosland looked at his face said come along missie and strolled off with the anxious child when they were out of hearing sir tancred said i'm afraid the child is in a bad mess this disgusting uncle of hers lost every penny at roulette last night and the authorities with their usual kindness took his ticket to london and put him in the train with twenty five francs in his pocket what a cad said tinker shortly well she is on our hands and we must look after her till we can make arrangements deposit her in a home or something tinker said nothing for a while he seemed plunged in profound thought he kicked a little stone ten yards away then raised his eyes to his father's face and said in the firm voice of one whose mind is made up i should like to adopt her adopt her said sir tancred with some surprise yes i should like to very much well thanks to your industry in the matter of flying machines and stolen children you have a nice little income so we needn't consider the question of expense you can afford it but in what capacity would you adopt her as father uncle guardian or what the formalities must be observed i think as a brother said tinker sir tancred thought a while then he said you will find it a great responsibility yes but i don't mind i i like her don't you know sir tancred's stern face relaxed into one of his rare and charming smiles very good he said you shall adopt her thank you sir said tinker and his smile matched his father's and may i have some money to dress her her clothes are dreadful they are said sir tancred and taking out his notecase he gave him a thousand franc note thank you said tinker beaming i'll break it to her about her uncle he hurried off towards the condamine and overtaking elsie and lord crosland told her that it was all right that they had arranged to take care of her for a few days and carried her away to fetch blazer for his morning walk it is to be feared that he gave her the impression that her uncle had been a party to the arrangement but by a flood of talk he diverted successfully her mind from the matter from an unworthy jealousy blazer was at first disposed to sniff at elsie but when he found that she joined heartily in the few poor amusements the place afforded an honest dog he became more gracious the children made their dejeuner with sir tancred and lord crosland and after it having restored the reluctant blazer to his lodging in the basement of the hotel they took the train to nice tinker hired the largest commissionaire at the station and bought a small trunk which he gave him to carry then he went straight to madame aline's and having insisted on seeing madame herself explained that the bright and elaborate fashions affected by the little french girls would not suit elsie madame agreed with him but said simplicity is so expensive tinker waved away the consideration and showed madame the thousand franc note at once she fell a victim to his irresistible charm and set about meeting his taste with the liveliest energy with the result that in less than an hour elsie was provided with an evening frock of an exquisite shade of heliotrope an afternoon frock of no less exquisite shade of blue and a hat stockings and gloves to match they were packed in the trunk and with them two pairs of shoes which madame sent for from a no less expensive bootmaker and various other garments when they came out of her shop tinker considered for a while the hole he had made in the thousand franc note and said the time has come to be economical he examined the shops with a keen eye till he came to one which seemed more of the popular kind and there he bought a frock of serge and three of dark blue linen stouter shoes slippers and two hats here he waited while elsie changed and when she came out looking another creature he said with a sigh of relief i knew you'd look all right if you had a chance they had ices at a cafe and caught a train back to monte carlo elsie seemed dazed with her sudden wealth while tinker was full of a quiet restful satisfaction but it was in the evening that the great triumph came when she came out of her room in her evening frock tinker regarded her for a moment with a satisfaction that was almost solemn then he turned her round and said we match do you really think so said elsie in an awed voice with humid eyes there's no doubt about it said tinker with calm dispassionate and judicial impartiality when they came into the restaurant there was a faint murmur of delighted surprise from the tables they passed and one stout but sentimental baroness cried viola des seraphin and truly if you can conceive of a seraph in an eton suit a low cut white waistcoat and a white tie there was something in what she said at the sight of them sir tancred smiled and lord crosland said i congratulate you on your taste young people it was tinker's said elsie and she looked at him with a world of thankfulness and devotion in her eyes after dinner tinker was uncomfortable he felt bound to break to elsie her uncle's desertion and he was afraid of tears with a vague notion of emphasising the difference between her uncle's regime and his own he led the way to the corner of the gardens where they had first met and standing before the seat on which she had waited so long and hungrily he said i say don't you think we could do without your uncle do without uncle said elsie surprised yes suppose instead of living with your uncle and his looking after you you lived with us and i looked after you suppose you were to be my adopted sister for good and all said elsie in a hushed voice yes for answer she threw her arms round his neck kissed him and cried oh i do love you so by a splendid effort tinker repressed a wriggle we'll consider it settled then he said elsie loosed him with a little deprecating cough and a delicate tentativeness he said about kissing of course now that you're my sister you have a right to kiss me sometimes and and of course it's all right but don't you think you could manage with once a day when we say good night in the morning too said elsie greedily well twice a day said tinker with a sigh chapter eleven tinker from the machine by elsie's coming into it tinker's life was changed at first she was not only a companion she was an occupation a score of little arrangements to secure her greater comfort had to be made each of them after careful consideration he was no longer dull they were together from morning till night and he found in her a considerable aptitude for the post of lieutenant to a pirate captain a smuggler a brigand chief or a south african scout she kept him out of mischief as far as he could be kept out of mischief the demands her welfare made upon his intelligence prevented his devoting it to the elaboration of ingenious schemes for the discomfiture of his fellow creatures and he had to think twice before he flung himself into any casual piece of mischief which presented itself lest he should involve her in disastrous consequences on second thoughts he generally refrained with regret the one practice he did not suffer to fall into desuetude was his daily bolt into the salles de jeu of that she could always be a secure and interested spectator for her part she was entirely happy she had been so long starved of care and affection that now she had them she wanted nothing more they filled her life taking his responsibility thus seriously tinker was greatly exercised in mind whether he should get her a maid or a governess he could not afford both elsie with absolute conviction declared that she needed neither that all she wanted was someone to brush her hair and she was sure that he did that far better than anyone else would tinker shook his head one has to be educated don't you know he said look at me it was one of his weaknesses to cherish the conviction that in the matter of learning he lacked nothing though had he been confronted by even the vulgarest fraction he would have been quite helpless having at last made up his mind he sought out sir tancred and said with a very serious air i've been thinking it over sir and i've come to the conclusion that i ought to get elsie a governess my dear tinker said his father if you add to our household at your present rate i foresee myself buying a caravan and traversing europe in state like a circus said tinker brightening it would be great fun for a while i think he added thoughtfully that i could brighten europe up a bit i do not doubt it said sir tancred politely well you see sir it's like this said tinker when i adopted elsie you said that i was to take all responsibility and i think i ought to look after her education it's no good adopting sisters by halves you are right of course said sir tancred but i'm sorry for you for a boy of nearly twelve your knowledge of the things taught by governesses is small your spelling now it is shall we say phonetic i don't think a gentleman ought to spell too well any more than he ought to speak french with too good an accent said tinker firmly there's a good deal in what you say said sir tancred but i'm afraid that when elsie has learnt geography say the position of schleswig holstein and roumania and leeds and other such places to which we should never dream of going she might look down on you for only knowing the towns on the great railways of europe and america and the steamer routes of the world she might but i don't think she's like that though of course with a girl you never can tell i think it's more likely she would want to teach me where they are but she ought to be educated and i must chance it well if you ought you must said sir tancred but one thing i do beg of you do not have her taught the piano the barrel organ if you like but not the piano no i won't a piano would be so awkward to move about it would want a van to itself i was thinking rather of the peculiar noises it makes in the hands of the inexperienced said sir tancred i know said tinker in a tone of genuine sympathy tinker went to elsie whom he had left in the gardens of the casino and told her that his father had given him leave to get her a governess on hearing that the matter was so near accomplishment her face fell and she said don't don't you think i ought to help choose her it wouldn't be regular said tinker firmly after dejeuner he caught a train to nice and went straight to madame butler that stay of those who seek maids companions nurses or governesses on the riviera he sent in his card and was straightway ushered into the office where she received her clients she was sitting at a desk and by one of the windows sat a very pretty young lady who looked as if she were waiting to interview a possible employee a certain surprise showed itself on the face of madame butler at the sight of tinker she had plainly expected a client of more mature years tinker bowed and sat down in the chair by the desk in which clients sat and set forth their needs you wished to see me on business said madame butler with some hesitation yes said tinker i want a governess for my sister my adopted sister i'm responsible for her and i've decided that she must be educated i told my father sir tancred beauleigh and he gave me leave to get her a governess so i came to you yes said madame butler smiling and what kind of a governess do you want the pretty young lady who had been regarding tinker with smiling interest turned away with the proper delicacy and looked out of the window tinker's face wore a very serious almost anxious air i've worked it out carefully he said elsie's ten years old two years younger than i am and there is no need for her governess to have degrees or certificates or that kind of thing she will only have to teach her to write nicely and do sums not fractions of course useful sums and some needlework and look after her when i'm not about so i want a lady young and english and i should like her to be a bit of a sportswoman don't you know i mean he added in careful explanation i should like her to be cheerful and good natured and not fussy about the things that really don't matter i think i know the kind of governess you want said madame butler she ran her eye over two or three pages of her ledger and added but i'm very much afraid that i haven't one of that kind on my books at present that's a pity said tinker should i have long to wait i'm afraid you might people chiefly want ladles with certificates and degrees so the others don't offer themselves the pretty young lady turned from the window with the quickness of one suddenly making up her mind how should i do she said in a charming voice madame butler turned towards her quickly with raised eyebrows but said nothing tinker turned too and his face lighted up with an angelic smile he looked at the pretty young lady carefully and then at the pretty young lady's tailor made gown and the smile faded out of his face i'm afraid he said sorrowfully you would be too expensive what salary were you thinking of giving she said with a brisk businesslike directness thirty pounds a year said tinker and then he added hastily of course it's very little but really the work would be quite light and we should try and make things pleasant for her but surely for a governess without certificates that is a very good salary isn't it madame butler it is indeed said madame butler it can't be really said tinker but i suppose people are mean well it would satisfy me said the pretty young lady but unfortunately i am an american and you want an englishwoman i only don't want a foreigner said tinker i should be awfully pleased if you would take the post the pleasure will be mine said the pretty young lady and about references i'm afraid i cannot get them in less than ten days pardon said tinker your face if you will excuse my saying so is reference enough the pretty young lady flushed with pleasure and said that is very nice of you but your father might think them necessary this is my show i mean this matter is entirely in my hands i look after elsie altogether and i think we might consider it settled my name is hildebrand anne beauleigh oh you are the boy who borrowed the flying machine tinker was charmed that she should take the right view of the matter he found that so many people including the bulk of the english american and continental press were disposed in an unintelligent way to regard him as having stolen it yes he said my name is dorothy rayner rayner said tinker with sudden alertness there is an american millionaire called rainer i spell my name with a y said dorothy quickly madame butler once more raised her eyebrows well when will you come to us we are staying at the hotel des princes at monte carlo to day is wednesday shall we say saturday morning yes that will do very well oh by the way i was quite forgetting about music i'm afraid said dorothy and her face fell i can't teach music that's all right said tinker cheerfully my father was terribly afraid that anyone i got would want to he explained to dorothy their nomadic fashion of life paid madame butler her fee bade them good bye and went his way on his return he found elsie full of anxious curiosity but his account of his find set her mind at rest he ended by saying it will be awfully nice for you don't you know she looked as though she would let you kiss her as often as you wanted to but i shall kiss you just the same night and morning said elsie firmly of course of course said tinker quickly and by a manful effort he kept the brightness in his face he told his father that he had found a governess references all right said sir tancred yes she carries them about with her said tinker diplomatically i suppose i ought to see them don't you think you will said tinker on her arrival on saturday morning dorothy found the children awaiting her on the steps of the hotel and to tinker's extreme satisfaction she at once kissed elsie when she had been taken to her room which was next to elsie's and her trunks had been brought up it was time to go to dejeuner and tinker conducted her to the restaurant they found sir tancred and lord crosland already at table they rose at the sight of dorothy and tinker introduced them to her gravely sir tancred was naturally surprised at being suddenly confronted by a startling vision of beauty when he had expected an ordinary young fresh coloured good natured englishwoman but for all the change worked in his face by that surprise he might have been confronted by a vision of corkscrew curls lord crosland however so far forgot the proper dignity of a peer as to kick tinker gently under the table tinker looked at him with a pained and disapproving air dorothy was even more surprised by the sight of sir tancred she had given the matter little thought but had supposed that she would find tinker's father a sedate man of some fifty summers when she found him a young man of thirty and exceedingly handsome and distinguished at that she was invaded by no slight doubt as to the wisdom of indulging the spirit of whim which had led her to take the post of tinker's governess without going a little more into the matter this uneasiness made her at first somewhat constrained but sir tancred and lord crosland contrived soon to put her at her ease and presently she was taking her part in the talk without an effort when she went away with the children lord crosland lighted a cigarette and said thoughtfully well tinker has made a find she is a lady i should be inclined to say gentlewoman said sir tancred lady is a word a trifle in disrepute there are so many of them and so various don't you know gentlewoman be it said lord crosland but he's a wonderful young beggar for getting hold of the right thing what a beautiful creature she is she is beautiful said sir tancred grudgingly woman hater va said lord crosland dorothy found herself admitted to a frank intimacy in this little circle into which whim had led her she spent most of her time with the children she gave elsie two hours' lessons a day and since she had a knack of making them interesting tinker often enjoyed the benefit of her teaching after lessons she shared most of their amusements and learned to be a pirate a brigand an english sailor a boer and every kind of captive and conspirator since she occupied some of elsie's time tinker had once more leisure for mischief and dorothy rarely tried to restrain his fondness for pulling the legs of his fellow creatures for she found that he had the happiest knack of choosing such fellow creatures as would be benefited morally by the operation but she was a check upon his more reckless moods and kept him from one or two outrageous pranks for his part he found the responsibility of looking after her and elsie not a little sobering and he was quite alive to the fact that at monte carlo that place of call of the adventurers of the world one's womankind need a protecting male presence quietly and unobtrusively sir tancred seconded him in this matter if dorothy had the fancy to take the air in the gardens after dinner she found that he or lord crosland or both of them deserted the tables till she went back to the hotel and strolled with her and the children she was growing very friendly with the two men and beginning to take a far deeper interest in sir tancred than she would have cared to admit even to herself his face of lucifer son of the morning his perfect thoughtfulness his unfailing gentle politeness his melancholy and his very coldness attracted her and always watching him she had now and again a glimpse of the possibilities of energy and passion which underlay the mask of his languor at times too her woman's intuition assured her that for all his dislike or rather distaste of women she attracted him unfortunately but naturally sir tancred and lord crosland were not the only men who found her beautiful monsieur le comte sigismond de puy de dome hero of many duels and more scandals and darling of the nationalist press also saw her beauty with him to see was to act and he never passed her without a conquering twirl of his waxed moustache and a staring leer which he fondly believed to be a glance teeming with passion since even he conscious as he was of his extraordinary fascination could hardly mistake her look of annoyance for the glow of responsive passion he resolved on more masterly action he kept a careful watch and one afternoon followed her and tinker and elsie on one of their walks they went briskly and at the end of a mile he was maintaining a continuous passionate monologue in tones charged with heartfelt emotion on the subject of his tight but patent leather boots a mile and a half on the way to mentone they turned aside down a road into the hills he followed them for a while over the loose stones and along the ruts of the roadway with considerable pain and was on the very point of abandoning the pursuit when he came on dorothy and elsie sitting in a shady dell by the roadside from which the wooded slopes of the hills rose steeply careless of his boots and of the fact that they had suffused his face with an unbecoming purple he strode gallantly up to them and set about making dorothy's acquaintance he began by talking with an airy graciousness of the charm of the spot in which he had found her and of how greatly that charm was enhanced by her presence but soon seeing that she took not the slightest notice of him that her eyes to all seeming looked through him at the trees on the further side of the dell he lost his gracious air and began to halt and stumble in his speech then he lost his head and plunged into a detailed account of the passion with which dorothy's beauty had inflamed his heart wearing the while his finest air of a conqueror dictating terms dorothy surveyed him with a contemptuous wonder over which her sense of the ludicrous was slowly gaining the mastery elsie stared at him at last he ended the impassioned description of his emotions with a yet more impassioned appeal to dorothy to fly with him to a far off shore forever shining with the golden light of love and dorothy laughed a gentle laugh of pure amusement count sigismond flushed purpler his eyes stood well out of his head he drew himself up with a superb air a little spoiled by a wince as his left boot deftly reminded him that he was wearing it and cried ha you laugh you laugh at sigismond de puy de dome mon dieu you shall learn and with a sudden spring he grabbed at her she jerked aside sprang up and away from him but he was between her and the exit from the dell he crouched with the impressive deliberation of a villain in a melodrama for another spring and elsie screamed tinker tinker count sigismond heard a rustling in the bushes above and looked up to see them parted by an angel child in white ducks bearing a bunch of lilies in his hand who gazed at him with a serious almost pained face and leapt lightly down with a pah imbecile addressed to himself for delaying the count sprang towards dorothy was conscious of a swift white streak and the head of the angel child impelled by wiry muscles and a weight of seventy six pounds smote as a battering ram upon the first and second buttons of his waistcoat he doubled up and sat down hard in one movement then turned on his side and gasped and gasped illustration as a battering ram upon the first and second buttons of his waistcoat come along cried tinker in a most imperative tone a row is a horrid nuisance when there are women in it and he caught his charges either by an arm and bustled them out of the dell and down the road dorothy laughed as she ran never before had she seen vaunting arrogance brought low in so sudden and signal a fashion at last she stopped dabbed away the tears of mirth and said oh tinker i am so much obliged to you it's all very well to laugh now but it might have been horrid it was the simplest thing in the world said tinker then rubbing his head ruefully he added i wish those foreigners would not wear gold buttons on their white waistcoats in the daytime they have no more notion of how to dress than a cat the men haven't they hurried along looking back now and again to see if they were followed they were not for count sigismond was now sitting up in the shady dell staring round it with fishy eyes and wondering dully whether he owed his disaster entirely to an angel child or whether mont pelee had affected the neighbourhood he gasped still as they drew near the town tinker grew thoughtful suddenly he stopped and said seriously now look here both of you we mustn't let my father know about this or he'll certainly thrash that bounding frenchman and that wouldn't be good enough don't you know it would be very good for him said dorothy with some vindictiveness yes but not for my father said tinker very earnestly indeed for all that he looks like a swollen frog le comte de puy de dome is awfully dangerous with the pistol he's hurt two men badly in duels already has he said dorothy quickly and the colour faded in her cheeks then we must indeed say nothing about it swear said tinker raising his right hand we swear said dorothy and elsie in one voice raising their right hands it was a formality which had to be gone through many times when they played at being conspirators their words and action were mechanical that's all right said tinker with a sigh of relief count sigismond returned to his hotel in a very hot fury his outraged pride clamoured for vengeance and he sought for someone on whom to be revenged he was surprised at the end of two days to hear nothing of his discomfiture but his fury lost nothing by growing cool and on the third night he picked a quarrel with sir tancred next morning sir tancred asked dorothy to take the children to nice for a few days since he had heard that there was some fever at one of the smaller hotels he watched over their departure himself and tinker was aware of an indefinable something in his manner which puzzled him it was perhaps that something which gave him a curious unsettled feeling as if they were going on a much longer journey as they left the hotel lord crosland came up from the condamine carrying a square case under his arm it did not escape tinker's observant eye but in the bustle of their removal he gave it but scant attention in the evening dorothy noticed that he was restless and absent minded and asked him what was the matter i don't know he said i have a funny feeling as though something was going to happen and i can't think of anything it's just as if i'd missed something i ought to have noticed it always makes me uncomfortable yet i can't think what it can be she made many suggestions but to no purpose and he went to bed dissatisfied he awoke once or twice in the night a very rare thing with him possibly so close was their kinship his father's disturbed spirit in some obscure and mysterious fashion was striving to warn him or prepare him for calamitous tidings in the early morning he slept soundly and awoke rather later than was his wont and even as he awoke the square case which lord crosland had carried sprang into his mind and he knew it to be a case of pistols in a flash everything was clear to him his father was going to fight count sigismond and had sent him to nice to be out of the way he sprang out of bed and dashed for his watch it was two minutes past seven they would fight at eight he had nearly an hour in three minutes he was dressed and racing down the stairs he met dorothy coming up what's the matter she cried at the sight of his white face my father he's fighting le comte de puy de dome and he's got us out of the way he did not see her turn pale and clutch the banisters he was racing out of the hotel he ran to the coach house wheeled his bicycle into the courtyard mounted and rode down the street he went at a moderate pace through the town but once on the corniche road he drove the machine as hard as he could pedal he was well on his way before his mind cleared enough for him to think what he was doing and then his heart sank he could do nothing he could not interrupt a duel that was the last enormity and if he did interrupt it it would be but for a few minutes it would take place all the same as the sense of his helplessness filled him two or three great tears forced themselves out of his eyes he dashed them away with a most unangelic savageness then conscious only of a devouring desire to be near his father in his perilous hour he drove on the machine as hard as he could the corniche is a good road but all up hill and down dale and he knew how much more time he lost by jumping off and running his bicycle up a hill than he made by letting it rip down the descent as he drew near monaco a kind of hopelessness settled on him he almost wished since he could not stop it that he might find the duel over now and again a dry sob burst from his overloaded bosom it was ten minutes to eight when he came up the slope from the condamine his legs were leaden but they drove on the machine at last he came to the path which leads to the half glade half rocky amphitheatre in which the gentry of the principality and of the rest of the world who chance to be visiting it settle their affairs of honour slipped off his machine and ran down it as fast as his stiff legs would carry him a few yards from the end of it he turned aside into the bushes came to the edge of the glade saw his father and count sigismond facing one another some forty yards away saw a white handkerchief raised in lord crosland's hand and in spite of himself his pent up emotion burst from him in one wild eldritch yell it still rang on the quivering air when the handkerchief fluttered to the ground and the pistols flashed together now to those who enjoy an intimacy with tinker an eldritch yell is neither here nor there piercing as this one was it barely reached sir tancred's consciousness but it smote sharply on count sigismond's tense nerves and deflected the barrel of his pistol just so much as sent the bullet zip past sir tancred's ear as he received sir tancred's bullet in his elbow and started to traverse the glade in a series of violent but ungainly leaps uttering squeal on squeal tinker turned and bolted sobbing gasping and choking in the revulsion from his hopeless dread he seized his bicycle ran it along the road some fifty yards turned in among the bushes flung himself down and sobbed and cried there was confusion on the scene of the duel count sigismond's seconds had to chase him catch him and hold him while the doctor dressed his wound then they fell to a discussion as to whether the eldritch yell had been uttered by the count or by someone in the wood round the glade it had fallen upon very ragged nerves and for the lives of them they could not be sure lord crosland threw no light at all upon the matter though he did his best to help their dispute grow acrimonious sir tancred preserved the discreet silence of a principal in a duel the count sigismond only moaned at last they turned their attention to him and carried him to the top of the path sir tancred and lord crosland started for the town to send up a cab for him when they were out of hearing lord crosland said most likely that yell saved your life old chap i should say that there wasn't a doubt about it but really in the case of a sweep like puy de dome i can't say that i mind a little irregularity besides my conscience is quite clear heaven knows i did my best to keep tinker in the dark and at a distance it can't be done said lord crosland with conviction tinker heard their voices and by a violent effort which did him good hushed his hysteric sobbing after a while he heard the cab rattle up and rattle away twenty minutes later he mounted his machine and passing through the back streets of monte carlo rode slowly back to nice on his way back he washed his face at a spring and when he mounted his machine again he said to himself firmly i'm not ashamed not a bit as he wheeled his bicycle into the coach house of the hotel dorothy ran into it caught him by the arm and cried did they fight is your father hurt he looked at her white strained face and said with a dogged air my father's all right what do you mean about fighting i i've been for a ride on my bicycle then you did stop it cried dorothy and before he could ward her off she had kissed him look here said tinker firmly but gently these things won't bear talking about they won't really chapter twelve tinker borrows a motor car a few days later early in the afternoon sir tancred was leaning on the wall of the gardens of the temple of fortune smoking a cigarette and looking down on the mediterranean in a very thoughtful mood tinker was by his side also looking down on the mediterranean also silent out of respect to his father's mood suddenly sir tancred turned towards him and said abruptly what did you say you paid your governess thirty pounds a year said tinker she dresses well said sir tancred tinker turned his head and eyed his father with a trifle of distrust she does dress well he said gravely and i can't quite make it out sometimes i think that her people must have lost their money and she bought her gowns before that happened sometimes i really think she's only being a governess for fun for fun said sir tancred but i thought her references were all right yes you told me she carried them about with her well she has the nicest kind of face said tinker and his own was out of the common guileless oh her face was her reference was it said sir tancred quickly you can forge references but you can't forge a face said tinker with the air of a philosopher sir tancred laughed gently my good tinker he said i look forward to the day when you enter the diplomatic service the diplomacy of your country will be newer than ever but don't be too sure that a woman can't forge her face there'd be a precious lot of forgery if they could forge faces like dorothy's said tinker with conviction you seem a perfect well of truth to day said sir tancred they were silent a while gazing idly over the sea then tinker said i'm beginning to think that dorothy is rather mysterious don't you know she gets very few letters but lots of cablegrams from america she has lots of money too and she spends it sometimes i have to talk to her seriously about being extravagant you do what does she say oh she laughs that's what makes me think she's only a governess for fun i never knew a girl so ready to laugh though she did cry that morning he spoke musingly half to himself what morning was that said sir tancred quickly it was a few mornings ago said tinker vaguely and he added hastily i think i'll go after her and elsie they've gone down the corniche towards mentone was it the morning i had an affair with m le comte de puy de dome ye e s said tinker with some reluctance and he prepared for trouble hitherto his father had said nothing of that timely but eldritch yell now by his careless admission about the tears of dorothy he had opened the matter and let himself in for a rating but sir tancred was silent musing and tinker returned to his idle consideration of the mediterranean presently he said she would make you a nice little wife sir sir tancred started there are times he said when i feel you would take my breath away if i hadn't very good lungs i thought that that was what you were thinking about said the ingenuous tinker if you add thought reading to your other accomplishments it will be too much said sir tancred with conviction of a sudden there came bustling round the right hand horn of the bay a most disreputable bedraggled looking vessel by her lines a yacht her decks would have been a disgrace to the oldest and most battered tin pot of an ocean tramp her masts had gone there were gaps in her bulwarks and the smoke of her furnaces pouring through a hole in her deck over which her funnel had once reared itself had taken advantage of this rare and golden opportunity to blacken her after part to a very fair semblance of imitation ebony and to transform her crew to an even fairer imitation of negroes dressed in black she is in a mess said tinker of the atlantic's making to judge by its completeness said sir tancred whose yacht is it i don't know said tinker staring at it with all his eyes you ought to said sir tancred with some severity you've been on it it's meyer's so it is said tinker mortified i am stupid not to have recognised it your new clairvoyant faculty must be weakening your power of observation i shouldn't give way to it if i were you tinker wriggled a hundred yards from the jetty the yacht's engines were reversed and the way was scarcely off her when her only remaining boat fell smartly on the water and was rowed quickly to the steps they seem in a hurry said sir tancred for a while they busied themselves in conjectures as to what errand had brought the yacht to monaco sir tancred lighted another cigarette and they watched the crew of the yacht set to work at once to wash the decks some twenty minutes later a little group hurried into the gardens the manager of the hotel des princes a tall bearded grimy man and a stout clean shaven grimy man they came straight to sir tancred and tinker and the bearded man said quickly my name is rainer septimus rainer i've just learnt that my daughter dorothy is governessing your little girl where is she sir tancred bowed and said languidly miss rainer is the governess of my son's adopted sister he is her employer not i here he is tinker stepped forward and bowed septimus rainer stared at him with a bewildered air and said well if this don't beat the dutch then he added feverishly where is she where's my little girl where's dorothy she went with elsie that's her pupil down the corniche towards mentone after dejeuner said tinker take me to her take me to her at once will you she's not safe said rainer quickly not safe come along said sir tancred and his languor fell from him like a mask leaving him active and alert indeed it's like this said rainer as they hurried through the gardens a week ago i got a cable from paris saying that a kidnapping gang were after dorothy i'm a millionaire and the scum are after ransom i cabled to mcneill my paris agent to come right here with half a dozen of the best detectives in france scooped up mr buist of the new york police he nodded towards the short clean shaven grimy man borrowed a yacht and came along myself being in a hurry we had trouble with the atlantic of course but i've done it seven hours quicker than steamer and train have mcneill and the detectives come no they haven't said tinker sure said rainer quite said tinker i've seen no one watching over dorothy and she has gone about outside the town in the woods and down by the sea just as usual she knew of no danger i'm sure perhaps mcneill didn't want to frighten her and just set his men to watch over her from a distance said rainer perhaps mcneill is in it said sir tancred drily i'm glad i came right here said rainer they came out of the gardens and as they passed the hotel des princes tinker said go on down the corniche i'll catch you up and bolted into it he ran upstairs into his father's room and took from a drawer the pocketbook which held their passports ran into his own room and thrust into his hip pocket the revolver he could use so well into other pockets five hundred francs in notes and gold then sure that he had provided against all possible emergencies he ran smiling down the stairs as he came out of the front door his eyes fell on a lonely deserted motor car in a breath he had pitied its loneliness seen its use and jumped into it he set it going and in three minutes caught up his father rainer and the detective sir tancred jumped into the seat beside him rainer and the detective into the back seat whose car is this how did you get it said sir tancred i commandeered it said tinker firmly and i was lucky too it's a good car i suppose there'll be a row about it but we've got to use it said sir tancred oh no there won't said tinker cheerfully when we come back everyone but me can get out i'll take it back and explain things for a mile tinker sent the car along at full speed then he slowed down and pulling up at every opening into the hills or down to the shore sent a long coo ee ringing down it no answer came back at the end of two miles his face was growing graver and graver and its gravity was reflected in the faces of the three men at the end of two miles and a half he stopped the car and said they can't have gone further than this just too late muttered septimus rainer and they looked at one another with questioning eyes well there's no time to be lost said sir tancred mr buist had better hurry back to monte carlo to the hotel des princes in case we've missed them we will go on hard and he can wire to us if they come back to the hotel at ventimiglia that's all very well said the detective with a sudden air of stubbornness but i don't like the look of the business it's a curious thing that miss rainer the daughter of a millionaire should be a governess in your family i don't understand it there is a chance and i'm bound to consider it of your being mixed up with this kidnapping gang what's to prevent you kidnapping mr rainer sir tancred's eyes flashed and he looked as though he could not believe his ears tinker laughed a gentle joyful laugh i mean no offence sir said the detective with some haste at the sight of sir tancred's face but i'm bound to look at it all ways just as you like said sir tancred quietly let mr rainer go back or both of you go back only be quick the millionaire had watched the faces of father and son with very keen eyes while the detective had been speaking off you go buist he broke in i know where i am go man go the detective jumped out of the car and sir tancred said go to m lautrec at the police bureau at monte carlo he's the best man to set things moving tell him to wire as far as genoa there's nothing like being on the safe side and tinker started the car two miles further on they came upon a peasant woman tramping slowly along with a heavy basket on her head tinker stopped the car and sir tancred asked her if she had seen a lady and a little girl walking on the corniche between that spot and monte carlo she said she had not seen a lady and a little girl walking but a mile out of monte carlo she had seen a lady and a little girl in a carriage with two gentlemen and the horses were galloping oh but they did gallop they had nearly run over her the young lady had cried out to her as they passed she had not caught what she said she had thought it a joke it looks very like them we had better follow this carriage what do you think mr rainer said sir tancred of course they may be back at the hotel by now and we may be on a wild goose chase i guess we can afford to be laughed at but we can't afford to lose a chance said the millionaire they passed this woman a mile out of monte carlo and we're four miles and a half out said tinker she doesn't walk above three miles an hour with that basket they're an hour and twenty minutes ahead you're smart sonny said the millionaire right away said sir tancred and he tossed a five franc piece to the woman tinker set the car going and began to try his hardest to get her best speed out of her the millionaire leaned forward and said to sir tancred the scum are hardly up to date to use a carriage instead of a motor car what i don't see is how they are going to get them across the frontier it looks it looks as if the italian police were in it said sir tancred frowning do you mean to tell me that the italian police would connive at kidnapping said the millionaire no but some rascal of a detective who could pull a good many strings might be in it at any rate if they get them across the frontier undrugged the authorities are squared or humbugged what i'm afraid of is that they're making for that rabbit warren genoa if they get them there we may be a fortnight finding them i guess i'll squeal before that said the millionaire yes if i have to put up a million dollars the car had reached a speed at which they could only talk in a shout and it seemed no more than a few minutes before tinker slowed down for mentone and stopped at a gendarme before saying a word sir tancred showed him a twenty franc piece and the gendarme spoke he was even voluble yes he had seen a carriage rather more than an hour before it had galloped through the town it carried fever patients for the hospital at genoa ill of the bubonic plague the police and the custom house officials had been warned by wire from monte carlo and genoa not to delay it there were relays of horses every twenty miles to genoa the wires had said so that was how they crossed the frontier was it what fools these officials are said sir tancred and he gave the gendarme his napoleon and bade him tell his superior officer that the police had been humbugged if they're really bound for genoa we can catch them and to spare bar accidents said tinker cheerfully besides m lautrec will have wired to look out for them and he set the car going oh they're bound for genoa sure enough said sir tancred but they won't enter it in that carriage or much before daybreak still the rascals don't know that you've come mr rainer and that we're already on their track that ought to spoil their game the car ran through mentone and into ventimiglia but as it drew near the custom house sir tancred cried by jove we're going to be delayed the guard's turned out and sure enough a dozen soldiers barred the road tinker stopped the car and a sergeant bade sir tancred and mr rainer come with him to the officer in command tinker gave his father the pocketbook which contained their passports the two of them got out of the car and followed the sergeant into the custom house tinker jumped down and sure that he had plenty of time looked at the machinery and filled up the petrol tank from a gallon tin in the back of the car then he went back to his seat he could hear a murmur of voices from the custom house and it grew louder and louder he caught disjointed scraps of angry talk of a sudden his father's voice rose loud in apparent fury and he cried in italian spies we're nothing of the kind and then in english bolt in a flash the car was moving and half a dozen soldiers sprang forward crying stop stop it's running away screamed tinker in italian and switched it on to full speed it jerked forward and the soldiers ran heavily after it hold it back hold it back screamed tinker and with the unquestioning obedience of the perfectly disciplined man a simple young soldier caught hold of the back of the car and threw all his heart and strength into the effort to stop it only to find himself running fast at sixty yards he was running faster and shouting loudly at eighty yards he stopped shouting let go and fell down tinker looked back and saw him sitting up in the dust and shaking his fist while forty yards beyond him his fellow soldiers danced gesticulating in the middle of the road illustration hold it back screamed tinker chapter thirteen tinker meets his old nurse tinker let the car rip on the while he considered what he should do he was excited determined he accepted readily enough the responsibility which had fallen upon him but he was hardly happy he could see no hope of rescuing dorothy and elsie by himself even if he caught the carriage and since he reckoned that it would take his father two or three hours to turn the riviera upside down and extricate himself and mr rainer from the extremely neat and effective trap into which they had fallen he could look for no help from them till far into the night for a while he suffered from the sense that he had bitten off or rather had had thrust into his mouth more than he could chew then of a sudden he saw that the really important thing the dogging the kidnappers was in his power and he regained his cheerfulness he drove on the car at full speed for ten miles and inquired of a peasant walking beside a cart loaded with bags of grain if he had seen the carriage the peasant had seen it he was vague as to how long ago and how far away but tinker was sure that he had seen it accordingly he drove on the car at full speed again in this way going at full speed and now and again slowing down to inquire he got over a good many miles he was frightened when he went through a town lest the police should try to stop him but it seemed that they had received no such instructions from ventimiglia all the while he was drawing nearer the carriage for all that somewhere or other it had plainly changed horses at last he made up his mind that he would overtake it in the next seven miles and he bucketed the car along for all she was worth at the end of the seven miles he had not overtaken it nor was there any appearance of it on the road before him a level stretch of two miles however he ran on another five miles and there was no sign of it nor had anyone he passed or met seen it plainly he had overshot it he turned the car and came back stopping to examine branch roads for its wheel tracks losing the ground he had made up some seven miles back he came to a road leading to a great gap in the hills a little girl was feeding a few lean sheep at the corner of it no she had seen no carriage she had only been here a little while the road ran up to camporossa tinker considered it and it invited his search it went high into the hills and he saw little towns here and there on their sides he sent the car slowly down it for seventy yards the roadway was hard or stony then came a patch of dust smooth and unmarked by a wheel track any vehicle going along the road must have passed over it and a wave of disappointment submerged tinker's spirit the road had seemed so very much the right one he stopped the car and stared blankly at the patch of dust suddenly his quick eye caught a curious marking on its surface he jumped down and bent over it sure enough the patch had been brushed and smoothed with a bough he hurried the car back to the corner of the road and by entreaties persuasion cajoling a five franc piece and even great concession a kiss he wrung from the little shepherdess a promise that she would wait till dark if need were stop every motor car that came from the direction of the frontier and say the kidnappers have gone up this road he was assured that his father would borrow or hire a motorcar and follow in it then he turned the car for camporossa three hundred yards up the road he came to another patch of dust and saw the wheel tracks of the carriage deep and plain he sent along the car as hard as he dared for as the road grew steeper along the hillside it grew stonier and stonier thanks to its serving like most italian hill roads as a watercourse to carry off the rain from the hills a very slow and painful jolting brought him among the olive groves of camporossa and into that little town he stopped before the little inn and was served with milk and bread and fruit as he ate and drank he was all affability and information to the group of the curious who gathered round the car he was an english boy his family had gone on in front in a carriage and he was following them in the car he learned at once that the carriage had gone on to dolceacqua and was less than an hour ahead he paid for his food and milk and without delay sent the car up the steep hillside he had to nurse and coax it up the steepest parts after another long jolting he reached dolceacqua vexed all the time by the knowledge that the carriage was going as fast as he over such roads the magnificent view of the mediterranean from the rose gardens of dolceacqua afforded him no pleasure at all it made only too clear to him the risk he would run if he recovered dorothy and elsie and had to descend that steep at any pace at dolceacqua he learned that the carriage was little more than half an hour ahead on the road to islabona he was pleased to hear that for all the badness of the road he had gained upon it plainly the horses were tiring another steep climb brought him up to islabona to learn that the carriage had turned to the right along the road to apricale to his surprise and satisfaction he found this road smooth and once more after long crawling sent the car along at full speed it was time to make haste for the sun was setting a mile from apricale he saw a cloud of dust ahead of him and he knew that he had the kidnappers in sight he slowed down for he did not wish to be seen by them then when the dust cloud vanished into the straggling town he hurried on again for if they pushed on through the darkness he would have to follow by the sound of their wheels he came through apricale at a moderate speed then a mile beyond it as he came to the top of a little hill he saw the carriage moving slowly down an avenue to a house on the left some hundred yards from the road he stopped the car with a jerk backed it a little way down the hill and from the brow watched the carriage drive up to the house then the sun set and the swift twilight fell he set about filling up the petrol tank and making sure that the lamp was ready to light then he backed the car into a clump of trees and set out across the fields for the house it was the dark hour after sunset and he found most of the bushes thorny presently he came into a deserted garden overgrown with rank weeds and unclipped shrubs he hoped devoutly that the scorpions and tarantulas would await the passing of the sunset chill in their lairs to all seeming they did for he pushed through the garden without mishap and came to the house it was a four square two storied building with something of the air of a fortress a useful abode in those once brigand ridden hills some old time gentleman's country seat a mat of creepers covered it to its tiled roof the side near him was dark and from the back came the voices of three stablemen about their business he stole round to the front and that too was dark but on the further side two rooms were lighted one on the ground floor one above a chatter of excited voices came from the lower windows and tinker came to within ten yards of it and looked in through the heavy bars three men were dining at the table a freckled redheaded man with the high cheekbones of the scot a dissipated young italian of a most romantic air and a small round vivacious man ineffably french i'm going to marry the girl say what you will the italian cried where would your scheme have been without my aid where would you have found a house like this out of the world secure from search in a country where everyone is as silent as the grave in my interests pardon my dear monteleone said the frenchman i am going to marry the lady without me there would have been no scheme for you to help i made it i rank first i marry the young lady what's all this talk about marrying the girl roared the scotchman in french we agreed on a ransom of a million and a half francs five hundred thousand francs each the lady's beauty has changed all that said the frenchman i am going to marry her no no it's me it's me said the italian have done with this foolish talk roared the scotchman banging the table if either of you marries her the poor young thing will be a widow in a fortnight i know septimus rainer he'll shoot such a son in law at sight shoot me shoot me this american mushroom shoot a monteleone for marrying his daughter cried the italian why the monteleones were crusaders he'll be proud of the alliance very proud very proud he'll be will septimus rainer when he's shot ye jeered the scotchman a movement overhead drew tinker's attention he looked up to see dorothy leaning out of the window above he uttered the short click which served him as a signal when he played the part of chief conspirator she looked straight down at him but did not move or answer and he knew that there was someone an enemy in the room with her the kidnappers still disputed vehemently and he stole up to the wall and began to climb the vine which covered the side of the house he disturbed a number of roosting small birds but dorothy's suitors were putting forward their pretensions to her hand with a clamour which drowned the flutter of wings he climbed up and up and dorothy never stirred and at last he looked under her arm into the room elsie with her elbows on the table was staring miserably at the grim forbidding face of an elderly woman who sat on a chair backed up against the door tinker looked at the woman and could scarcely believe his eyes then he laughed gently slipped over the window sill and said cheerfully hullo selina how are you the grim woman started up with a little cry stared at him ran across the room and began to hug him furiously crying oh master tinker master tinker what a turn you did give me drop it selina drop it said tinker struggling out of her embrace you know how i hate being slobbered over then he dodged dorothy and elsie who advanced upon him with one accord and one purpose of kissing him and cried no no this is no time for foolery but i don't understand said dorothy oh selina's my old nurse what are you doing here selina i never expected you to turn kidnapper at your age nothing of the kind master tinker i'm paid to help save these poor lambs from them popish jesuits and i'm going to do it let's hear about this said tinker sitting down on the table it's my poor husband's cousin mr alexander mcneill he engaged me to come here to act as maid to a young lady he was helping get away from those jesuits who were trying to force her into a convent to get her money said selina you've been humbugged then what you are doing is helping to kidnap my adopted sister elsie and miss dorothy rainer the daughter of an american millionaire said tinker joyfully dorothy started and flushed how did you learn that she said quickly your father's come from america and he and my father are looking for you though where they are there's no saying i left them at ventimiglia arrested as spies said tinker arrested as spies cried dorothy but selina whose face had undergone a slow but violent change broke in so alexander's humbugged me has he he's brought me all the way from paris here by a lie about jesuits having tried to bury this young lady in one of their nasty convents to do his dirty kidnapping work has he i'll kidnap him i'll teach him to play these tricks on me do said tinker with warm approval you let him have it think that you're pitching into me like you used to come along all of you selina's simply tremendous when her back's up selina opened the door and went down the stairs with all the outraged majesty of a boadicea the three of them followed her quietly and at the bottom tinker bade dorothy and elsie unbar the door of the house and himself kept close behind selina she opened the door of the room and at the sight of her the sustained shriek in which the italian and the frenchman were conversing died suddenly down and the three kidnappers stared at her you nasty body snatching scum said selina glowering at them eh what you're daft woman what's the matter said mcneill don't you woman me alexander mcneill said selina daft am i daft to listen to your lies about jesuits and the young lady daft to believe you when you told me not to listen to her for the jesuits had got round her and she didn't know what was good for her but i've found you out i'm going to take the young lady straight back to her father and send the police here for you woman you're mad said mcneill rising with a scared face don't you woman me you low scotchman you ought to be ashamed of yourself mixing yourself up with these foreign rascals you that's had a christian up bringing you do what you're paid to do roared mcneill il faut agir said the frenchman with the true napoleonic grasp of the situation and he bounced in a lithe over confident manner at selina in a flash she had her left hand well gripped in his abundant hair and was clawing his face with her right he screamed and writhed and the struggle gave tinker his chance he slipped the key out of the inside of the door thrust it into the outside as the frenchman tore himself away yelling he cried outside selina strengthened the command by a strong drag on her arm got her outside slammed to the door and locked it almost before the kidnappers had realised that he was there he wrenched the key out of the lock just as dorothy had got the front door open ran down the hall caught elsie's hand and crying come along come along ran down the avenue followed by dorothy and selina as fast as they could pelt three minutes brought them to the car and he bundled his breathless charges into it drove it out of the clump of trees and sent it hard down the road just before apricale he bade them crouch down in the car that they might not be seen and rushed through the ill lighted street at full speed a mile beyond the town he lighted the lamp and drove her at full speed again along the smooth road to islabona beyond islabona he was forced to go very slowly down the jolting descent if he had tried to go at any pace the car on those loose stones might at any moment have taken its own steering in hand and smashed itself against the rocky banks dorothy and elsie took advantage of the slowness to pour into his ears the tale of how the kidnappers had seized them on the corniche a mile outside the town thrust them into the carriage and kept them quiet by threats now and again he hushed them to listen for pursuing horses he had not much fear of pursuit the kidnappers would be some time breaking out of the room in which he had locked them and when they were out they would scour the neighbourhood on foot he had kept well out of sight behind selina and they would hear nothing of the car before they began to pursue when they did pursue it would be on the sure footed hill horses they would come three yards to the car's one at last they reached dolceacqua and pushed steadily and carefully downwards half way between that town and camporossa they came round a bend in the road to see half a mile below them the flaring lamp of a motor car here's my father or the police said tinker with a sigh of relief in five minutes dorothy was kissing her father and tinker was presenting the new found selina to sir tancred with a joyful account of her delinquencies it had taken sir tancred little more than two and a half hours to get free of the italian authorities and as tinker had expected he had hired a motor car and came straight and hard for genoa to be turned aside on to the right track by tinker's shepherdess when they had exchanged stories mr rainer was for going on and taking vengeance on the kidnappers but sir tancred dissuaded him pointing out that there was no need to have every gossip in europe talking about dorothy if the police who were in a bustle from mentone to genoa caught them it must be endured but dorothy had escaped unharmed and the less fuss made about the matter the better mr rainer listened to reason dorothy got into the car with sir tancred and her father and they continued the descent once on the highroad they set out for monte carlo as hard as they dared go at night it was past midnight when they reached the hotel where buist was awaiting them in great anxiety the sight of them set his mind at rest but to this day he is inclined to believe that sir tancred had a hand in the kidnapping of dorothy and that selina was an accomplice to his intimates he speaks of him with great respect as a mastermind of crime they were all very hungry and they supped at great length in very good spirits as they were going upstairs to bed tinker succeeded in keeping dorothy back it's all very well your being the daughter of a millionaire he said with some severity but an employer has his rights i can't lose a governess who suits elsie so well straight off i shall expect a month's notice but i've no intention of resigning that excellent post said dorothy smiling tinker looked at her gravely thinking and then he said gloomily your father will never let you be a governess i suppose you expect me to back you up against him that's just what i do expect said dorothy chapter fourteen tinker takes septimus rainer in hand on awaking next morning dorothy's first thought was how would her father's coming affect her relations with sir tancred and she at once changed it to how would it affect her relations with the whole of the little circle into which a fortunate whim had led her she was an honest soul and now she tried to be as honest with herself as a woman can bring herself to be she did not hide from herself that of late she and sir tancred had been more and more drawn together she even went to the length of admitting that her feeling for him was something stronger than friendship indeed she was full of pity for him she had learned from tinker something of the story of his earlier life and like a good woman she wished she might give him the happiness he had missed she did not know how strongly she longed to give him that happiness much less was she able to distinguish where pity merged into love now she was in a great dread of her father's millions she knew well enough that with many indeed with most men of sir tancred's class they would have been primroses very large primroses on the path of love she feared that if he was the man she thought him and she would not have him any other they would prove barriers on that path hard indeed to surmount she dressed in no very good spirits and came downstairs to find her father awaiting her in the hall ready to stroll out and hear how the world had gone with her sir tancred also awoke with the sense of something unpleasant having happened but at first he could not for the life of him remember what it was then he began to consider the change which would be brought about by the irruption of the millionaire he resented it he found the prospect of tinker's losing dorothy's services exceedingly disagreeable for a while he ascribed that resentment to the fact that she would cease to be the excellent influence with tinker she certainly was and then he grew resentful on his own account it was hard indeed that he should suddenly be deprived of the presence of so charming a creature at his table of so delightful a companion of his evening stroll in the gardens of the casino if it hadn't been for those confounded millions there he checked himself sternly the millions were there and there was no more to be said or thought but his temper was none the better for the constraint after his late hours the night before tinker did not get up as early as usual and he and elsie decided to forego their bathe in the sea but went straight to breakfast in the kitchen of the hotel he found the staff greatly concerned about the trouble which was likely to befall him for borrowing the motor car it seemed that on finding it gone its owner a m cognier had displayed a wrath of the most terrible of course an argus eyed busy body had seen tinker depart in it and m cognier an anglophobe had declared his intention of punishing this insolence of perfidious albion by handing him over to the police tinker heard all their prophecies of evil with his wonted tranquillity but he had no little difficulty in setting their minds at rest m cognier had been impressive the two children had finished their breakfast and were about to set out in search of adventure when selina found them and began to set forth a petition she wished to be allowed to enter tinker's service again she was she said alone in the world once more for her husband having spent all her savings had with determined scotch thriftiness incontinently died and left her to shift for herself she had been making a mean living as an ironer in a parisian laundry when alexander mcneill had sent for her to apricale to help him deliver a young lady from the jesuits and she saw in her curious meeting with tinker at the country seat of the young monteleone the finger of providence pointing the way back to her old situation would he lay the matter before his father and support her petition tinker was somewhat taken aback and said but i'm too old for a nurse oh there are lots of things i could do master tinker there are really said selina you want a housekeeper when you're at the refuge a housekeeper who could get up your linen and sir tancred's as they can't do it at farndon pryze you want someone to look after you when you've got a cold you never did take any care of yourself she was wringing her hands in her earnestness you'd be a sort of valet housekeeper then said tinker pondering the matter yes and i should want very little wages all i want is to be in your service again i never ought to have left it i never had no real peace all the time i was married what with wondering how you were being looked after and whether you was ill or not i always took in the morning post though angus did grumble at the expense all the time i was in paris on purpose to see where you was and every day i looked at the births deaths and marriages first to see if anything had happened to you she stopped and tinker was silent a while thinking then he said do you think you could act as maid to elsie why of course i could master tinker she wants someone to brush her hair most said tinker thoughtfully i don't want a maid and i don't want anyone to brush my hair but you said elsie firmly no one could do it so well oh you'll soon get used to selina's doing it said tinker cheerfully and you'll find it so much more so much more important having a maid of your own you'll feel so grown up don't you know i tell you what we'll go upstairs and selina can have a try at it while i talk to my father elsie shook her head doubtfully but she came tinker left them at the door of elsie's room and went to his father he found him dressing and after bidding him good morning came at once to the matter in hand selina wants to come back to us he said she thinks she could be useful as valet housekeeper and maid to elsie she's awfully keen on it if she wants to come back she most certainly can said sir tancred i owe selina a debt i can never pay and so do you for that matter i don't pretend to know what the functions of a valet housekeeper are but doubtless selina knows her own capabilities best besides as you are losing your governess you will want some woman about elsie but i don't intend to lose my governess cried tinker sir tancred looked at him with unaffected interest am i to understand that you propose to retain the daughter of a millionaire as your adopted sister's governess he said yes said tinker firmly dorothy's a very good governess she suits elsie and she suits me that sounds like a reason said sir tancred but i shall be interested to see if mr rainer listens to it i think said tinker thoughtfully we shan't have much trouble with mr rainer of course if you've made up your mind but millionaires are kittle cattle tinker went to selina and elsie looked carefully into the matter of hair brushing gave selina a few hints on the process and then told her that her request was granted he fled from the room to escape her joyful gratitude and went down into the hall to await the conclusion of the process and elsie's coming of a sudden there descended on him an exceedingly animated french gentleman of forty who cried tell me then a little good for nothing why did you steal my motor car yesterday tinker was suavity itself he protested that he was desolated grieved beyond measure that the necessity of borrowing the motor car had been forced on him but he had borrowed it in the service of a lady and he told briefly the story of the kidnapping the aggrieved frenchman listened to it with a face in which amazement battled with incredulity but fortunately towards the end of it dorothy and her father came into the hotel from walking in the garden of the casino and tinker introduced the frenchman to them at the sight of dorothy's beauty he forgot his righteous wrath forgot that it was an international matter another instance of the cunning insolence of perfidious albion protested his delight that his car should have been of use to her would not listen to septimus rainer's proposal to fit it out with fresh tires declaring that the tires on it worn in her service had become one of his most cherished possessions and in the end turned upon tinker with outstretched arms and cried embrace me i have called you a good for nothing but you are a hero with infinite quickness tinker seized the nearest hand wrung it warmly and ducked out of the way of the embrace then he explained that unless the police caught the kidnappers they desired to let the matter drop for the gossip would be unpleasant to dorothy the frenchman understood and assured them that as far as he was concerned it should be buried in the most secret depths of his bosom with that he took his leave of them and on his heels came two italian detectives to inquire into the kidnapping sir tancred was summoned to the conference and for all that their questioners assumed a good deal of the air of inquisitors with all the horrors of the torture chamber behind them he and tinker saw to it that they went away very little wiser than they came at dejeuner septimus rainer told them that now he was in europe he proposed to stay in europe and enjoy a little of his daughter's society he could carry on all of his business he wanted to by cablegram and letter one thing however he must have and that was clothes for in his haste he had come away with a gripsack and nothing more sir tancred suggested that tinker who knew his nice should take him over there and put him in the hands of the right tailor hatter hosier and bootmaker and septimus rainer accepted the offer gratefully accordingly the two of them caught a train early in the afternoon and went to nice septimus rainer had supposed the getting of clothes to be a simple and tiresome affair of a few minutes you went to a tailor and said make me suits of clothes or to a bootmaker and said make me pairs of boots he was vastly mistaken he found himself embarked upon a serious business he awoke to the seriousness of it in the train when he found tinker who had taken his commission to heart regarding him with a cold calculating air very disquieting he endured it as long as he could then he said cautiously you aren't measuring me for my coffin are you sonny oh no said tinker with a reassuring smile of a seraphic sweetness i was only thinking how you ought to be dressed oh anything will do for me said septimus rainer carelessly i'm afraid not you see i'm responsible said tinker seriously and i was thinking that getting your clothes here in nice i shall have to keep a very sharp eye on them or they'll go dressing you like a french american you know an american who is dressed by a paris tailor and that wouldn't do at all no of course not said septimus rainer quickly but it was not till they came to the tailor's that he realised the full seriousness of the business before them at first he supposed that he was to have his say in the matter but at the end of ten minutes with a half humorous abandonment he put himself entirely in the hands of the conscientious tinker and indeed had he not done so there is no saying that he might not have gone about the world parading a velvet collar on a grey frock coat it was tinker who decided after weighty consideration upon the colour and texture of the stuff of each suit chose the very buttons for it and forced upon the reluctant nicois his ideas of the way each separate garment should be cut septimus rainer was frankly bewildered at the end of half an hour he was used in the way of business to carrying a multiplicity of details in his head but these details it could not carry when he found that tinker had them at his finger ends he was filled with admiration and respect from the tailor's they went to the hatter's and there septimus rainer found himself trying on hats by the score but strangely enough he did not grow weary tinker's absorbed interest in his task was catching to the point that at the hosier's the millionaire found himself discussing the shade of his socks with real enthusiasm when they came out of the last shop tinker said with the deep breath of one relieved of a heavy responsibility there i think you'll look all right as far as a french tailor can do it i ought to after all the trouble you've taken sonny said septimus rainer smiling you have to take trouble about dressing a man a woman is easy enough i got elsie her clothes in about an hour but a man is much more difficult and clothes are so important said tinker gravely i suppose they are over here said septimus rainer i'm glad you don't take them really seriously said tinker approving his tone because you'll soon get into the way of wearing them when you've got them it's very funny but well dressed americans men i mean don't often wear their clothes properly they look as if they felt so awfully well dressed i don't think you will now you've told me about it i'll try not to i think you'll want a good man though to keep you up to the mark you might get slack don't you know no no i can't have a valet and i won't said septimus rainer firmly ah we shall have to see what dorothy says about that said tinker with a smile of doubtful meaning that's playing it rather low down on me isn't it said septimus rainer reproachfully it's it's coercion oh if you have to wear clothes you may as well do it thoroughly you see it's been put into my hands and i must go through with it said tinker apologetically the millionaire gazed at him ruefully and now tinker went on regarding him with another cold calculating air that of a proprietor i think i'll take you to a hair dresser and have your hair and beard dealt with crop away crop away said the millionaire tinker took him to a hair dresser and told the man exactly how he wanted the hair and beard cut he'd make you a french american too if i let him he said to septimus rainer when the hair dresser had done the millionaire looked at himself in the glass with approval and said well i do look spick and span though gritty yes sir you'll look better when you have your clothes said tinker and now i think you must want a drink that is so sonny this is dry work this getting clothes tinker took him to a cafe adorned with an american bar septimus rainer lighted a cigar and refreshed himself with the whiskey sour of his native land tinker ate ices over these agreeable occupations they talked and the millionaire derived considerable entertainment and no little instruction from his young companion's views of life on the mediterranean littoral illustrated from the passing pleasure seekers illustration over these agreeable occupations they talked when they got into the railway carriage on their return he lighted another cigar and lay back in the seat with the content of a man who had done a hard day's work but presently he roused himself and said i've been thinking about those kidnapping scum they were going to ransom dorothy for three hundred thousand dollars you said yes a million and a half francs said tinker well sonny i've been thinking i must pay you fifty thousand dollars over that business you took a big risk holding up a gang like that it wasn't me selina held them up said tinker quickly selina did her share and i shan't forget it but it was your show i think fifty thousand dollars would be fair tinker's face went very grave thank you very much he said slowly but i couldn't take any money for helping dorothy out of a mess when i've taken money for helping people they've been strangers like the kernabies and blumenruth but dorothy is different quite different septimus rainer pulled at his beard and said in a grumbling voice that's all very well sonny but where do i come in you get my little girl out of a tight place a very tight place and you save me three hundred thousand dollars business is business and i ought to pay it is rather awkward for you said tinker looking at him with a puzzled face and knitted brow but i think the thing is that it wasn't business i like dorothy i like her very much she's a friend and there can't be any business between friends don't you know shake sonny said the millionaire holding out his hand i'm glad you and she are friends tinker shook his hand gravely when they came back to the hotel at the sight of her father dorothy cried oh papa what have you been doing you look ten years younger and what a nice shape your head is yes said septimus rainer i pride myself on the shape of my head but it's all your young friend's doing wait till his clothes come said tinker with modest pride i shall look fine in those clothes i tell you fine said septimus rainer and his air was almost fatuous i think he ought to have a valet said tinker you can't learn about clothes all out of your own head either you must have always worn the right clothes or you want someone to teach you of course you must have a valet papa said dorothy i can't i can't have a man messing about me said septimus rainer in a tone of almost pathetic pleading i'm afraid there's no way out of it said tinker firmly i'm sure there isn't if tinker says so he knows all about these things said dorothy you must be brave papa you really must i'll find him one said tinker septimus rainer yielded with a gesture of hopeless resignation chapter fifteen tinker asserts the rights of the employer septimus rainer was very soon admitted to the frankest intimacy of the little circle an american of the best type he had enjoyed the advantage in his childhood of the stern and hardening training of life on a little farm and the supreme advantage of a good mother he had fought his way to fortune with clean hands winning always his battles by sheer superiority of brain never by laxity of principle no man could lay to his charge that he had dealt him a foul blow he had come therefore through that demoralising fight with a clean heart his native shrewdness increased a thousand fold his native simplicity unabated it was this combination of shrewdness and simplicity which had caused him to send dorothy bitter as it had been to part with her to europe to finish her education his gorge had risen at the intolerable snobbishness which is corroding the wealthy sections of american society he had made up his mind that she had a better chance of obtaining the necessary social acquirements while remaining a gentlewoman in europe and had acted with great success on the conviction after a few days' natural restlessness he found himself developing an admirable capacity very rare in millionaires of being for a while idle this agreeable circumstance was the natural effect of the surroundings in which he found himself not so much of the place for at monte carlo pleasure is a somewhat strenuous affair but of the fact that his new friends had a trained power of taking life easily tinker sir tancred and lord crosland would have admitted him to their intimacy for the sake of dorothy but simple souls themselves they recognised in him a kindred simplicity and admitted him to their friendship he possessed to a great degree the american adaptability and it is not surprising that he fell into their way of taking life easily it was only for the time being the millionaire is a good deal of the sindbad and he must bear the burden and go the way of the golden old man of the sea he has made for himself but septimus rainer enjoyed this respite from the tyranny of his millions with the whole hearted pleasure of a child he enjoyed the brightness and glitter of the place he enjoyed the pleasant meals and pleasant talks with pleasant companions he enjoyed a little gambling at the tables and he enjoyed with a childlike zest playing with dorothy and the children displaying latent and unsuspected talents for piracy brigandage and conspiracy which were no less a glory than a surprise to him indeed at times he was very like a young schoolboy let loose after many hours' school tinker was of perpetual interest to him and he listened with greedy ears to the wisdom of the world of that sage on the rare occasions when some matter or other set it flowing from his lips on the other hand he found in him an absorbed listener to the stories of his less involved financial battles and spared no pains to make them clear to him sir tancred interested him little less and he was always deploring the loss the splendid army of millionaires had suffered by his excellent abilities not having been forced to flow in a business channel he was distressed too about the waste of tinker and adjured his father to hand him over to him to be made a millionaire of but sir tancred turned a deaf ear to his petition and said of course if tinker went into business he would become a millionaire and it's a fashionable occupation and i've nothing to say against it but over here with some of us there are still other things besides money not that there will be long and for my part i shall be content if he grows up a gentleman as he will business might spoil that and at any rate i won't chance it and after all my step mother won't live to much more than eighty so that he will have thirty thousand a year before he's forty five that's a hundred and fifty thousand dollars said septimus rainer thoughtfully and he pressed the point no more he was far too shrewd not to perceive the attraction sir tancred and dorothy had for one another and he regarded it with entire content whatever he might have said against sir tancred's manner of life he had a genuine respect for his qualities and he had learned from dorothy something of the causes of his falling into that manner of life he had a strong belief that once married to her he would change he thought it likely that he might even embark on the career of politics which he understood to be in england a quite respectable pursuit he was aware of course that he could easily buy her an english peer or a foreign prince for husband but sir tancred's rank and birth satisfied his simple tastes and he was quite sure that he might ransack the english peerage and the courts of europe without finding her as good a husband he did not perceive that his millions barred sir tancred's path dorothy perceived it only too soon she found the growth of her intimacy with sir tancred checked it did not lessen indeed but it did not increase a shadow had fallen across it and he no longer talked to her in the tone of half affectionate familiarity he had grown to use with her he was more reserved she chafed at it but she was not greatly downcast she only wished that the kidnappers had had the grace to leave her in her part of the penniless governess a few weeks longer she felt that then all the millions in the world would not have barred sir tancred's way indeed she had no reason to be greatly downcast this sudden setting of her out of his reach had inevitably increased her attraction for sir tancred it had deepened his liking to a far stronger feeling he cursed the unkindly fates and told himself that his only course was to fly that the more he saw of her the more painful would that flight be but he could by no means constrain himself to forego the delight of her presence and though he never let a word of his love escape his lips his eyes and the tones of his voice told her of it often enough tinker was not long providing septimus rainer with a carefully chosen english valet whom he found a pleasant unassuming fellow very easy to get on with then the millionaire began to talk of engaging a secretary for his millions were beginning to make themselves troublesome and he begged tinker since he had found him so unembarrassing a valet to keep his eyes about him for a secretary also but tinker said that monte carlo was no place to find secretaries who understood business one morning he saw madame seraphine de belle ile drive up to the hotel she wore a mournful air and he perceived at once that she was no longer clad in a bright scarlet costume but in one of a dull crimson more in keeping with her air of mournfulness she cut him deliberately as she passed into the hotel he was exceedingly angry no human being had ever cut him before and he flushed with mortification he walked down to the gardens pondering the affront and his anger grew then of a sudden it flashed on him that she had found out mr arthur courtnay and that the warning he had given her had had something to do with that discovery she had cut him by way of showing her gratitude in a truly womanly fashion with the smile of an angel indulgent to human frailty he forgave her and thrust the matter out of his mind that night at dinner or rather at dessert lord crosland informed them that he was engaged to claire wigram and when they had done congratulating him he told them that in a few days he would be leaving for england with the wigrams well said sir tancred the season here is coming to an end and at any rate the weather for the last few days has been too hot to do these children any good i think we will move northward too it will be the break up of a very pleasant party said septimus rainer with a sigh and dorothy's face fell why should it break up said lord crosland you'd better all come no i'm not coming to england yet said sir tancred after all this heat it would be too great a risk to face straight away the bitter english summer i thought of moving northward gently to biarritz or i have a fancy for arcachon wednesday would be as good a day as any there was a pause then tinker said thoughtfully wednesday is rather soon sir and turning to dorothy he said do you think that you could pack by wednesday of course it doesn't really matter for you could come on after us but i don't want elsie to lose a day's work septimus rainer sir tancred and lord crosland looked a little taken aback it struck them all three with the same sense of oddness that a small boy should direct the movements of the daughter of a millionaire oh i can easily pack up by wednesday said dorothy as if it were a matter of course that he should direct her movements that's all right said tinker but i don't understand said septimus rainer has dorothy bound herself to do as you tell her well i suppose she has as far as teaching elsie goes and i explained when she took the post that we travelled about a good deal said tinker carelessly but i can't have this said septimus rainer well she can always give me a month's notice and then the engagement ends said tinker he was prepared for the discussion and resolved that his father and dorothy should not be separated as long as he could prevent it do you mean she isn't free for a month from now but but it's absurd said septimus rainer that's what the papers call the rights of the employer said tinker with a singularly sad sweetness oh you wouldn't insist on that right not if you were asked nicely would you said lord crosland oh yes i should said tinker cheerfully you see i'm responsible for elsie and she will never get such a good governess as dorothy again so she must have as much of her as possible thank you it's nice to be appreciated said dorothy smiling at him ah said septimus rainer with the air of one who has found a solution of the problem but dorothy can always forfeit a month's salary in lieu of notice oh i couldn't think of it papa cried dorothy i should lose i should lose five pounds this beats the dutch this is avarice i allow you four thousand dollars a month said septimus rainer ah but this is my own earned money dorothy protested flushing and smiling suddenly there came a twinkle into septimus rainer's eye well he said if you're ground down under the heel of a grasping employer you're ground down and you must go to arcachon but i shall come too of course said tinker you're you're one of the family thank you said septimus rainer i'm told that you english are slow about it but when you make a man at home you do make him at home and i've always wanted to be adopted chapter sixteen tinker disowns his grandmother on the eve of their departure for arcachon tinker and elsie were sitting in the gardens of the temple of fortune taking a well earned rest after a farewell bolt into the salles de jeu in which elsie also had played a gallant and successful part for the somewhat obscure reason that it was the last bolt so strengthening to her character had been companionship with tinker she was receiving with modest pride his congratulations on having penetrated deeper than himself to the innermost shrine the trente et quarante table in fact when they saw coming towards them a large majestic white haired lady a small subdued mouse haired lady and a man of doubtful appearance without causing him to pause in his congratulations tinker's active mind had placed the two women as a wealthy englishwoman and her companion and was hesitating whether to place the man in the class of continental guides or private detectives when he pointed to the two children and said something to the majestic lady that's the little boy is it then you two go and sit on the next seat while i talk to him said the majestic lady in a voice which lost in pleasantness what it gained in loudness and she came to the seat on which tinker and elsie sat while her attendants walked on now to call him a little boy was by no means the quickest way to tinker's heart and he watched her draw near with a cold eye but all the same when she made as if to sit down he rose and raised his hat with a charming smile she sat down and looked him over with a cool consideration which provoked his fastidiousness to no admiration of her breeding then she said are you sir tancred beauleigh's little boy i am hildebrand anne beauleigh said tinker in a faintly corrective tone quite lost on her complacent mind hildebrand anne hildebrand anne she called you hildebrand anne did she the impudence of these minxes said the majestic lady and she sniffed like a lady of the lower middle classes at once tinker knew that she was lady beauleigh and that she was speaking of his mother but his face never changed only the pupils of his eyes contracted a little and he drew a quiet deep breath of satisfaction he had always hoped for an interview with her his father's step mother and he knew that he had the advantage for he was armed with a very fair knowledge of her imparted to him by his father who thought it well to put him on his guard and of him she knew nothing who's this little girl said lady beauleigh surveying elsie with her insolent stare send her away i want to talk to you alone this is my adopted sister elsie you may talk before her it doesn't matter how confidential it is i always tell her everything said tinker in a tone of kindly but exasperating patronage i don't care go away little girl said lady beauleigh and tinker was pleased to see the colour rise in her cheeks he stayed elsie who was rising to go with a wave of his hand and said gently is it important talk yes it is snapped lady beauleigh then i'd rather she stopped my father says you should always have a witness to important talk said tinker and he smiled at her stuff and nonsense i'm your grandmother cried lady beauleigh angrily ah then your name is vane said tinker sweetly vane vane lady beauleigh gasped rather than spoke the hated name it's nothing of the kind it's beauleigh i'm lady beauleigh i'm afraid there must be some mistake you can't be my grandmother on my father's side my father's mother is dead said tinker in a tone which almost seemed to apologise for her error you must be very stupid or very ignorant cried lady beauleigh i'm your grandfather's second wife as you ought to know oh i know now said tinker and his face shone with his sudden enlightenment you keep a bank i keep a bank said lady beauleigh in a dreadful voice oh not a roulette bank or baccarat bank said tinker with well affected hastiness one of the shop kind where they sell money with glass doors my father was a banker if that's what you mean said lady beauleigh but a bank isn't a shop oh i always think it a kind of shop said tinker with the dispassionate air of a professor discussing a problem in the higher mathematics it's as well to lump all these these commercial things together isn't it and he was very pleased with the word commercial no it isn't a bank isn't a shop you stupid little boy cried lady beauleigh hotly well just as you like said tinker with graceful surrender i only call it a shop because it's convenient a boy of your age ought not to think about convenience you ought to have been taught to keep things clear and distinct said lady beauleigh in a heavy didactic voice oh it's quite clear to me really that a bank's a shop but we won't talk about it if you're ashamed of it after all one doesn't talk about trade does one said tinker with a return to his kindly but exasperating patronage ashamed of it i'm not ashamed of it said lady beauleigh in the roar of a wounded lioness no no of course not i only thought you were i made a mistake said tinker quickly with an infuriating show of humouring her i'm proud of it proud of it said lady beauleigh thickly and when you grow up and understand things you'll wish your father had been a banker too i don't think so said tinker and he smiled at her very pleasantly i'm quite satisfied with my father as he is i'd really rather that he was a gentleman a banker is a gentleman cried lady beauleigh yes yes of course said tinker humouring her again he's he's a commercial gentleman lady beauleigh could find no words never in the course of her domineering life had she been raised to such an exaltation of whole souled exasperation she could only glare at the suave disposer of her long cherished long asserted pretensions and she glared with a fury which made elsie who had edged little by little to the extreme edge of the seat rise softly and take up a safer position standing three yards away tinker took advantage of lady beauleigh's helpless speechlessness to say thoughtfully but about your being my grandmother if you're not my father's mother or my mother's mother you can't really be my grandmother you must be my step grandmother i should think tinker went on and his thoughtfulness became a thoughtful earnestness that you must be what people call a connection by marriage not quite one of the family the thoughtfulness cleared from tinker's brow and he said with a pleasant smile but that's got nothing to do with what you came to talk about you said it was important what did you want to say lady beauleigh remembered suddenly that she had come on an errand connected with her promotion of the glory of the beauleighs she swallowed down her fury wiped her face with her handkerchief and said in a hoarse and somewhat shaky voice i came to make you an offer tinker beamed on her you must be tired of this beggarly life going about from pillar to post living in wretched continental hotels with no pocket money tinker raised his eyebrows i know what your father's life is just a mere penniless adventurer's tinker beamed no more and i came to offer to take you to live with me at beauleigh court it's a beautiful big house in the country with woods all around it and hunting and fishing and shooting and tennis courts and fruit gardens and a cricket ground everything that a boy could want and you said tinker in the expressionless tone of one adding an item to a catalogue yes and me to look after you you should have a bicycle and she paused to let the splendour of the gift sink in illustration and she paused to let the splendour of the gift sink in i have a bicycle said tinker well two bicycles and a pony i don't like ponies they're too slow said tinker in a weary voice i always ride a horse well you should have a horse a horse of your own what's the hunting like but there i know it can't be up to much it never is in those southern counties i always hunt in leicestershire i've got used to it you hunt in leicestershire said lady beauleigh with some surprise oh course where does one hunt said tinker echoing her surprise but but where does your horse come from i know your father can't afford to keep horses sometimes he can said tinker and if he has had to sell them a dozen people will always mount us lady beauleigh paused and then she made the last lavish bid and i would allow you a hundred a year pocket money why why you would be a little prince a little prince and learn geography no thank you said tinker startled out of his calm besides he added carelessly i've made five thousand in the last year five thousand what pounds come come said lady beauleigh shaking her head you mustn't tell me lies it isn't a lie tinker never tells lies broke in elsie hotly hold your tongue you impertinent little minx said lady beauleigh sharply who asked you to speak i think you're a horrid said elsie and was checked by tinker's upraised hand and when i died lady beauleigh went on turning again to tinker i should leave you thirty thousand a year think of it thirty thousand a year it all sounds very nice said tinker in a painfully indifferent tone but i'm afraid it wouldn't do wouldn't do why wouldn't it do to live in a beautiful big house in the country and have everything a boy could want why wouldn't it do cried lady beauleigh excited by opposition to a feverish desire to compass the end on which her heart had been set for many months do you really want to know said tinker very gently but with a dangerous gleam in his eyes yes i insist on knowing cried lady beauleigh well said tinker slowly pronouncing every word with a very deliberate distinctness we shouldn't get on you and i i don't know how it is but i never get on with people who keep shops or banks i'm afraid you're not quite well bred stout lady beauleigh sprang to her feet ah well said tinker quietly you treated my father and mother very cruelly you've just said rude things about both of them and you've been rude to elsie the fact is i don't see that i want a step grandmother at all and i can't be expected to want an ill bred one anyway so so i disown you lady beauleigh's face quivered with rage she gathered herself together as if to box tinker's ears thought better of it and hurried away tinker and elsie looked at one another and laughed softly horrid old woman said elsie a dreadful person said tinker as lady beauleigh strode out of the gardens she came full upon sir tancred and dorothy he raised his hat she tried to glare through him and glared at him that's my step mother said sir tancred i wonder what's the matter with her she looks upset upset why she looked furious malignant said dorothy then they saw tinker and elsie coming towards them i see said sir tancred softly oh if she's met my young charges said dorothy and she threw out her hands have you been doing anything to your grandmother tinker cried sir tancred well i disowned her said tinker disowned her yes i had to said tinker with a faint regret she was rude and she was wearing a gown which would have stood up by itself if she had got out of it at monte carlo in april it's impossible he shrugged his shoulders chapter seventeen tinker and the course of true love dorothy sat gazing over that charming gulf charming alike for its scenery and its oysters the gulf of arcachon she gazed on it without seeing it her beautiful face was clouded and her brow was puckered in a wondering perplexity tinker sat on the ground near her his chin on his knees observing her with a sympathetic understanding which would have disquieted her not a little had she not been too busy with her thoughts to notice it they were still and silent for a long while until she sighed then he said with unfeigned sadness i'm beginning to think he never will who never will what said dorothy awaking from her reflections and extremely disconcerted by the exactness with which tinker's remark echoed them my father ask you to marry him said tinker succinctly tinker cried dorothy faintly and she flushed a very fine red it's all very well to say 'tinker' like that he said shaking his head very wisely but it's much better to look at things straight don't you know you often get a little forrarder that way you are a dreadful little boy said dorothy with conviction yes yes i'm not blind said tinker patiently but the point is that my father is ever so much in love with you and he'll never ask you to marry him because you're too rich i'm sure i've given you every chance he added with a sigh you have said dorothy gasping yes i'm always seeing that no one makes a third when you and he are together on moonlit nights and picnics and so on don't you know dorothy laughed in spite of her discomfort at this frank discussion of her secret but this is inveterate match making she said why do you do it oh i think it would be a good thing you both want it badly and you'd get on awfully well together besides you're neither of you as cheerful as you used to be and i don't like it it bothers me it's very good of you to let it said dorothy smiling not at all and elsie and i would have a settled home too it's very funny but sometimes i get tired of living in hotels i'm sure you do said dorothy with sympathy well have you got any idea how it can be worked no cried dorothy shocked and flushing again i haven't i wouldn't have that's silly when it would be such a good thing said tinker with a disapproving air however i suppose i can work it myself i generally have to when i want anything done what are you going to do cried dorothy in great alarm oh i do wish i hadn't said anything or listened to you i don't know what i'm going to do these affairs of the heart are always difficult said tinker with the air of a sage who has observed many generations of unfortunate lovers i won't have you do anything i forbid it cried dorothy you shouldn't order your employer about said tinker with a smile which on any face less angelic would have been a grin besides i'm responsible and i must do what's good for you and after all i shan't give you away don't you know oh do be careful said dorothy plaintively i will said tinker and he rose and sauntered off along the promenade dorothy looked after him with mingled feelings dread of what he might do vexation and a little shame that he should have so easily surprised her secret though indeed she preferred that tinker should have discovered it rather than anyone else in the world then her sure knowledge of his discretion eased her anxiety and the consideration of his able imagination and versatile ingenuity set a new and strong hope springing up in her tinker strolled along to the cafe du printemps and found his father sitting before it on the usual uncomfortable little chair before the usual white topped table he saw that his father's face wore the same expression as dorothy's had worn before he had insisted on coming to her aid then he saw with something of a shock that a glass of absinthe stood on the table things must indeed be in a bad way if his father drank absinthe at half past ten in the morning however he hid his disapproval and sitting down on another uncomfortable chair he said gently what does it mean when a lady is compromised sir it means that some accident or other has given malignant fools a chance of gossipping about her said sir tancred in an unamiable tone and the man has to marry her of course he has snapped sir tancred ah said tinker with supreme thoughtful satisfaction his father looked at him for a good minute with considerable suspicion wondering what new mischief he was hatching but tinker looked like a guileless seraph pondering the innocent joys of the islands of the blessed to a degree which made such a suspicion a very shameful thing indeed partly reassured sir tancred returned to his brooding he was angry with himself because he felt helpless in an impasse on the one hand he could not bring himself to fly from dorothy on the other he could not bring himself to abate his pride and ask her to marry him she was so rich septimus rainer had talked of settling five million dollars on her he looked again at the pondering tinker and his helpless irritation found the natural english vent in grumbling look here he said half querulously half whimsically i told you that if you went on adding to our household i should be travelling about europe with a caravan you began by adopting elsie as a sister and i said nothing then you added miss rainer as her governess and i warned you miss rainer added her father a millionaire and he added a maid a valet two secretaries a courier and a private detective all these people i know them well will marry and i shall be a patriarch travelling with my tribe it must stop tinker sighed we are a large household twelve of us with selina he said thoughtfully but you might make it more compact sir more compact how you might marry dorothy and then you and she could count as one a sudden light of exasperation brightened sir tancred's eyes and he made a grab at tinker's arm his hand closed on empty air tinker was flying like the wind along the promenade tinker roared sir tancred but tinker went round a corner at the moment at which only the t of his name could fairly be expected to have reached him sir tancred ground his teeth and then he laughed tinker made a circuit and came down to the sea where he found elsie playing with two little english girls staying at arcachon with their mother at once she deserted them for him and when he had withdrawn her to a distance he said i've hit on a way of getting them married no have you you are clever she cried with the ungrudging admiration she always accorded him clever it only wants a little common sense said tinker with some disdain i shall be glad so shall i it'll be a weight off my mind don't you know said tinker with a sigh i'm sure it will said the sympathetic elsie it must be awfully nice to be in love she added with conviction now look here said tinker in a terrible voice if i catch you falling in love i'll i'll shake you but but i may be in love ever so much for anything you know said elsie somewhat haughtily you are not said tinker sternly your appetite is all right don't talk any more nonsense but come along we've got to get ready for the picnic at half past eleven the two children went on board the petrel a little steam yacht of a shallow draught adapted to the shoals of the gulf which septimus rainer had hired from a member of the bordeaux yacht club they found dorothy and sir tancred already on board and were told that a cablegram from new york had given her father his secretaries and the telegraph office of arcachon a day's work and prevented him from coming with them tinker had known this fact all the morning but he did not say so his manner to his father showed a serene unconsciousness of any cloud upon their relations the petrel was soon crossing the gulf in an immensely important way at her full speed of eight knots an hour in pursuance of his policy tinker took elsie forward and left dorothy and his father to entertain one another on the quarter deck the two children amused themselves very well talking to alphonse the steersman and adolphe the engineer thick set thick witted men who combined the picturesqueness of organ grinders with the stolidity of agriculturalists nature had plainly intended them for the plough and circumstance had pitched them into seafaring an hour's steering brought them across the gulf they landed and made their dejeuner at a little auberge or rather cabaret affected by fishermen and the folk of the landes off grey mullet fresh from the bay of biscay grilled over a fire of pine cones with a second course of ring doves roasted before it after their coffee tinker suggested that they should cross over to the strip of sand which at that point separates the gulf from the bay and the others fell in with his humour they crossed over and landed in the yacht's dinghy tinker insisted on taking two rugs though both dorothy and his father objected that the sand was quite dry enough to sit on however when they came to the beach of the bay sir tancred spread them out and he and dorothy sat on them the two children wandered away and presently elsie found herself holding tinker's hand and running hard through the pines towards the landing place in answer to tinker's hail alphonse fetched them aboard in the dingey and the honest unsuspecting mariners accepted his instructions to take them for a cruise and come back later for his father and the lady without a murmur but no sooner was the petrel under weigh than he strode to the middle of the quarter deck folded his arms scowled darkly in the direction of his father and dorothy so heedless of their plight and growled in his hoarsest most piratical voice marooned marooned slowly he paced the deck with arms still folded casting the piercing glances of a bird of prey across the waters then of a sudden he roared once more with the true piratical hoarseness all hands on deck to splice the main brace alphonse and adolphe did not understand his nautical english but when elsie came from the cabin with a bottle of cognac and two glasses their slow wide grins showed a perfect comprehension tinker gave them the cognac and took the wheel then he became absorbed in steering and sternly rejected all further consideration of his gift he would have neither hand nor part in hocussing french agriculturalists posing as mariners but for all his absorption in his steering and his care to look past them as they sat in more than fraternal affection on the deck with the bottle between them it was somehow forced on him probably by the noise they made that they proceeded from a gentle cheerfulness through a wild and songful hilarity broken by interludes in which either described to the other with eloquent enthusiasm the charms of the lass who loved him best to a tearful melancholy from which they were rapt away into a sodden and stertorous slumber at the third snore tinker turned to elsie who sat by him looking rather scared by the changing humours of the agricultural mariners and said with a sardonic and ferocious smile the ship is ours at once they divested themselves of the hats of civilisation and tied round their heads the red handkerchiefs proper to their profession then he gave her the wheel and going to the cabin came back with a black flag neatly embroidered in white with a skull and crossbones dorothy's work and sternly bade an imaginary quartermaster run up the jolly roger then as quartermaster he ran up that emblem of his dreadful trade himself became captain once more and with folded arms and corrugated brow surveyed it gloomily then he went down to the engine room put the yacht on half speed and as well as he could stoked the fires for the next three hours the petrel forgot all the innocent traditions of her youth as a pleasure boat and traversed the gulf of arcachon a shameless ravening pirate while captain hildebrand the scourge of the spanish main issued curt sanguinary orders to an imaginary but as blood dyed a gang of villains as ever scuttled an indiaman the jolly roger and three or four blank shots from the little signal gun drove three panic stricken fishing boats from their fishing ground as fast as oars and sails could carry them to spread abroad a legend of piracy in the gulf which would last a generation it was nearly sunset before captain hildebrand returned to the serious consideration of his business as cupid's ally then he set the petrel going dead slow ran her gently on to a sandbank and let fall the anchor which was hanging from her bows this done again a pirate he looked at the recumbent and still stertorous alphonse and adolphe with cold cruel eyes and said it's time these lubbers walked the plank illustration it's time these lubbers walked the plank ay ay sir said elsie cheerfully and then she added in a doubtful voice but won't the poor men get drowned not in four feet of water said captain hildebrand and he set briskly about the preparations for the fell deed with elsie's help he brought a plank to the gangway and then either taking him by an arm they dragged the grunting adolphe slowly down the deck and arranged him on the plank with a capstan bar and many a hearty yo heave ho they levered the plank out over the side till adolphe's weight tilted it up and he soused into the water for a moment he disappeared then he rose spluttering and choking sank again found his footing and stood up roaring like a flabbergasted bull captain hildebrand lay quietly down on the deck and writhed and kicked in spasms of racking mirth but his trusty lieutenant after laughing a while looked grave and said the poor man will take cold i have no sympathy with drunkards said captain hildebrand with cold severity but he rose and going forward by kicking alphonse hard and freely in the ribs roused him from his dream of the lass who loved a sailor and said adolphe has fallen overboard it took some time for the information to penetrate alphonse's skull when it did he was all vivid alertness staggered swiftly aft to the gangway and in rather less than five seconds with no conspicuous agility had precipitated himself into adolphe's arms they rose clinging to one another and both roared like bulls while the shrieking tinker danced lightly round the deck presently he recovered enough to throw them a rope and they climbed on board no difficult feat seeing that the deck was not two feet above their heads before they thought of the yacht they went to the forecastle and changed their wet clothes while the dusk deepened tinker went to the galley and made tea he had brought it to the cabin and he and elsie were making a well earned and hearty meal and discoursing with gusto of their blood dyed career during the afternoon when alphonse very sad and glum came and told them that the yacht was aground and adolphe was getting up full steam to get her off tinker with great readiness said he would come up and help in half an hour he heard the rattle of the propeller and coming on deck said he would go to the bows while alphonse took the wheel and adolphe worked the engines he went right forward and peered into the darkness adolphe set the engines going full speed reversed and tinker cried she's moving he saw the anchor chain slowly tauten then the petrel moved no more the propeller thrashed away but to no purpose and to his great joy he was sure that the anchor held her however he cheered them on to persevere and for nearly half an hour the propeller thrashed away then they gave it up sat down gloomily on the hatch of the engine room and lighted their pipes tinker and elsie went back to the cabin rolled themselves in rugs and were soon enjoying the innocent sleep of childhood it was twelve o'clock when tinker awoke and at once he went on deck and found that alphonse by way of keeping watch had gone comfortably asleep in the bows while adolphe snored from the forecastle he kicked alphonse awake and said don't you think you could get her off if you hauled up the anchor for a minute or two alphonse turned the idea hazily over in his apology for a mind then with a hasty exclamation he ran to the side and saw dimly the taut anchor chain he blundered below lugged adolphe out of his berth and on deck and for five excited minutes they explained to one another that the anchor was embedded in the sandbank and that it held the petrel on it then soberly and slowly they got to work on the capstan and hauled up the anchor a dozen turns of the propeller drew the petrel off the bank and into deep water in three minutes they had her about and steamed off towards the marooned while tinker in the galley was heating water for coffee and making soup in the meanwhile dorothy and sir tancred ignorant of their plight had spent a delightful afternoon exploring with a never tiring interest one another's souls for a long time she chided him gently for his aimless manner of living and he defended himself with a half mocking sadness at about sunset they rose reluctantly sighed with one accord that the pleasant hours were over looked at one another with sudden questioning eyes at the sound of the sighs and looked quickly away they walked slowly on feet reluctant to leave pleasant places through the pines silent save that twice sir tancred sent his voice ringing among the trees in a call to tinker they came to the landing place to find an empty sea and looked at one another blankly the children must have persuaded the men to take them for a cruise said sir tancred but they're late coming back said dorothy for a while their eyes explored the corners and recesses of the gulf within sight but found no petrel then sir tancred said well we must wait and spread a rug for her at the foot of a tree he paced up and down before her keeping an eye over the water and talking to her the dusk deepened and deepened and at last it was quite dark we're in a fix said sir tancred uneasily of course if we stay here they will come for us sooner or later but goodness knows when if we set out to walk to civilisation we shall doubtless in time strike it somewhere but goodness knows where if we went along this strip and turned eastward at the end of it shouldn't we come to the railway said dorothy i don't know that we should we should get into the landes and they're by way of being trackless anyhow it would mean walking for hours and it is less exhausting for you to sit here the petrel must turn up sooner or later remembering her talk with tinker in the morning dorothy believed that it would be later much later but as she could hardly unfold her reasons for the belief she said nothing for a long time they were silent listening to the faint thunder of the bay behind them the lapping of the water at their feet and the stirring of the pines she filled slowly with a sense of their aloofness from the world and a perfect content in being out of it alone with him for his part sir tancred was ill at ease he foresaw that unless the petrel came soon a lot of annoying gossip might spring from their accident and he was distressed on her account on the other hand he too found himself enjoying being alone with her out of the world at last she said softly i feel as though we were on a desolate far away island i wish to goodness we were he cried with a fervour which thrilled her you'd find it very dull she said with a faint uncertain laugh not with you he said quietly she was silent and he took another turn up and down before he said half to himself it would simplify things so we should be equal equal oh not from the personal point of view he said quickly you'd always be worth a hundred of me but on a desolate island money wouldn't count oh money she said with a faint disdain what has money to do with anything he sighed and continued his pacing money is always an obstacle he said presently either there is too little of it and that's an obstacle or there is too much of it and that's an obstacle i don't think papa would agree with you about too much money said dorothy i'm wondering what he will say if we don't turn up before morning said sir tancred gloomily i suppose he'll say that it was an unfortunate accident yes but then i ought to have protected you against unfortunate accidents i'm afraid there'll be a lot of gossip well it wasn't your fault said dorothy carelessly sir tancred grew more and more unhappy his watch told him that it was nearly ten o'clock and there was no sign of the petrel moreover the sense of their aloofness from the world had taken a firmer hold on him and it drew him and dorothy nearer and nearer together the feeling that the world of which her money had grown the symbol would again come between them grew more and more intolerable at last it grew too strong for him and he stopped before her and said in a voice he could not keep firm about that wasted life of mine dorothy do you think you could do anything with it dorothy gasped i might i might try she said in a whisper he stooped down picked her up and kissed her then with a profound sigh of relief and content he sat down beside her drew her to him and leaned back against the tree she was crying softly they were far away from the world and for them time stood still they did not see the approaching lights of the petrel or hear the throb of her screw only the roaring hail of alphonse awoke them from their dream when they came on board the observant tinker saw the flush which came and went in dorothy's cheeks and the new light in his father's eyes he saw her genuine surprise at finding herself so hungry he observed that his father was quite careless about the cause of the petrel's long absence and his angel face was wreathed with the contented smile of the truly meritorious after supper his father went on deck to watch the steering of the yacht elsie fell asleep and dorothy sat lost in a dream is it all right said tinker softly i don't know what you mean you're a horrid scheming little boy said dorothy with shameless ingratitude yes but is it all right said tinker i shan't let you scheme like that when when i'm your mother said dorothy with virtuous severity and she blushed so it is all right said tinker and he chuckled the end
