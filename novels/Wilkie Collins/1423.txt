no thoroughfare the overture day of the month and year november the thirtieth one thousand eight hundred and thirty five london time by the great clock of saint paul's ten at night all the lesser london churches strain their metallic throats some flippantly begin before the heavy bell of the great cathedral some tardily begin three four half a dozen strokes behind it all are in sufficiently near accord to leave a resonance in the air as if the winged father who devours his children had made a sounding sweep with his gigantic scythe in flying over the city what is this clock lower than most of the rest and nearer to the ear that lags so far behind to night as to strike into the vibration alone this is the clock of the hospital for foundling children time was when the foundlings were received without question in a cradle at the gate time is when inquiries are made respecting them and they are taken as by favour from the mothers who relinquish all natural knowledge of them and claim to them for evermore the moon is at the full and the night is fair with light clouds the day has been otherwise than fair for slush and mud thickened with the droppings of heavy fog lie black in the streets the veiled lady who flutters up and down near the postern gate of the hospital for foundling children has need to be well shod to night she flutters to and fro avoiding the stand of hackney coaches and often pausing in the shadow of the western end of the great quadrangle wall with her face turned towards the gate as above her there is the purity of the moonlit sky and below her there are the defilements of the pavement so may she haply be divided in her mind between two vistas of reflection or experience as her footprints crossing and recrossing one another have made a labyrinth in the mire so may her track in life have involved itself in an intricate and unravellable tangle the postern gate of the hospital for foundling children opens and a young woman comes out the lady stands aside observes closely sees that the gate is quietly closed again from within and follows the young woman two or three streets have been traversed in silence before she following close behind the object of her attention stretches out her hand and touches her then the young woman stops and looks round startled you touched me last night and when i turned my head you would not speak why do you follow me like a silent ghost it was not returned the lady in a low voice that i would not speak but that i could not when i tried what do you want of me i have never done you any harm never do i know you no then what can you want of me here are two guineas in this paper take my poor little present and i will tell you into the young woman's face which is honest and comely comes a flush as she replies there is neither grown person nor child in all the large establishment that i belong to who hasn't a good word for sally i am sally could i be so well thought of if i was to be bought i do not mean to buy you i mean only to reward you very slightly sally firmly but not ungently closes and puts back the offering hand if there is anything i can do for you ma'am that i will not do for its own sake you are much mistaken in me if you think that i will do it for money what is it you want you are one of the nurses or attendants at the hospital i saw you leave to night and last night yes i am i am sally there is a pleasant patience in your face which makes me believe that very young children would take readily to you god bless 'em so they do the lady lifts her veil and shows a face no older than the nurse's a face far more refined and capable than hers but wild and worn with sorrow i am the miserable mother of a baby lately received under your care i have a prayer to make to you instinctively respecting the confidence which has drawn aside the veil sally whose ways are all ways of simplicity and spontaneity replaces it and begins to cry you will listen to my prayer the lady urges you will not be deaf to the agonised entreaty of such a broken suppliant as i am o dear dear dear cries sally what shall i say or can say don't talk of prayers prayers are to be put up to the good father of all and not to nurses and such and there i am only to hold my place for half a year longer till another young woman can be trained up to it i am going to be married i shouldn't have been out last night and i shouldn't have been out to night but that my dick he is the young man i am going to be married to lies ill and i help his mother and sister to watch him don't take on so don't take on so o good sally dear sally moans the lady catching at her dress entreatingly as you are hopeful and i am hopeless as a fair way in life is before you which can never never be before me as you can aspire to become a respected wife and as you can aspire to become a proud mother as you are a living loving woman and must die for god's sake hear my distracted petition deary deary deary me cries sally her desperation culminating in the pronoun what am i ever to do and there see how you turn my own words back upon me i tell you i am going to be married on purpose to make it clearer to you that i am going to leave and therefore couldn't help you if i would poor thing and you make it seem to my own self as if i was cruel in going to be married and not helping you it ain't kind now is it kind poor thing sally hear me my dear my entreaty is for no help in the future it applies to what is past it is only to be told in two words there this is worse and worse cries sally supposing that i understand what two words you mean you do understand what are the names they have given my poor baby i ask no more than that i have read of the customs of the place he has been christened in the chapel and registered by some surname in the book he was received last monday evening what have they called him down upon her knees in the foul mud of the by way into which they have strayed an empty street without a thoroughfare giving on the dark gardens of the hospital the lady would drop in her passionate entreaty but that sally prevents her don't don't you make me feel as if i was setting myself up to be good let me look in your pretty face again put your two hands in mine now promise you will never ask me anything more than the two words never never you will never put them to a bad use if i say them never never walter wilding the lady lays her face upon the nurse's breast draws her close in her embrace with both arms murmurs a blessing and the words kiss him for me and is gone day of the month and year the first sunday in october one thousand eight hundred and forty seven london time by the great clock of saint paul's half past one in the afternoon the clock of the hospital for foundling children is well up with the cathedral to day service in the chapel is over and the foundling children are at dinner there are numerous lookers on at the dinner as the custom is there are two or three governors whole families from the congregation smaller groups of both sexes individual stragglers of various degrees the bright autumnal sun strikes freshly into the wards and the heavy framed windows through which it shines and the panelled walls on which it strikes are such windows and such walls as pervade hogarth's pictures the girls' refectory including that of the younger children is the principal attraction neat attendants silently glide about the orderly and silent tables the lookers on move or stop as the fancy takes them comments in whispers on face such a number from such a window are not unfrequent many of the faces are of a character to fix attention some of the visitors from the outside public are accustomed visitors they have established a speaking acquaintance with the occupants of particular seats at the tables and halt at those points to bend down and say a word or two it is no disparagement to their kindness that those points are generally points where personal attractions are the monotony of the long spacious rooms and the double lines of faces is agreeably relieved by these incidents although so slight a veiled lady who has no companion goes among the company it would seem that curiosity and opportunity have never brought her there before she has the air of being a little troubled by the sight and as she goes the length of the tables it is with a hesitating step and an uneasy manner at length she comes to the refectory of the boys they are so much less popular than the girls that it is bare of visitors when she looks in at the doorway but just within the doorway chances to stand inspecting an elderly female attendant some order of matron or housekeeper to whom the lady addresses natural questions as how many boys at what age are they usually put out in life do they often take a fancy to the sea so lower and lower in tone until the lady puts the question which is walter wilding attendant's head shaken against the rules you know which is walter wilding so keenly does the attendant feel the closeness with which the lady's eyes examine her face that she keeps her own eyes fast upon the floor lest by wandering in the right direction they should betray her i know which is walter wilding but it is not my place ma'am to tell names to visitors but you can show me without telling me the lady's hand moves quietly to the attendant's hand pause and silence i am going to pass round the tables says the lady's interlocutor without seeming to address her follow me with your eyes the boy that i stop at and speak to will not matter to you but the boy that i touch will be walter wilding say nothing more to me and move a little away quickly acting on the hint the lady passes on into the room and looks about her after a few moments the attendant in a staid official way walks down outside the line of tables commencing on her left hand she goes the whole length of the line turns and comes back on the inside very slightly glancing in the lady's direction she stops bends forward and speaks the boy whom she addresses lifts his head and replies good humouredly and easily as she listens to what he says she lays her hand upon the shoulder of the next boy on his right that the action may be well noted she keeps her hand on the shoulder while speaking in return and pats it twice or thrice before moving away she completes her tour of the tables touching no one else and passes out by a door at the opposite end of the long room dinner is done and the lady too walks down outside the line of tables commencing on her left hand goes the whole length of the line turns and comes back on the inside other people have strolled in fortunately for her and stand sprinkled about she lifts her veil and stopping at the touched boy asks how old he is i am twelve ma'am he answers with his bright eyes fixed on hers are you well and happy yes ma'am may you take these sweetmeats from my hand if you please to give them to me in stooping low for the purpose the lady touches the boy's face with her forehead and with her hair then lowering her veil again she passes on and passes out without looking back act i the curtain rises in a court yard in the city of london which was no thoroughfare either for vehicles or foot passengers a court yard diverging from a steep a slippery and a winding street connecting tower street with the middlesex shore of the thames stood the place of business of wilding co wine merchants probably as a jocose acknowledgment of the obstructive character of this main approach the point nearest to its base at which one could take the river if so inodorously minded bore the appellation break neck stairs the court yard itself had likewise been descriptively entitled in old time cripple corner years before the year one thousand eight hundred and sixty one people had left off taking boat at break neck stairs and watermen had ceased to ply there the slimy little causeway had dropped into the river by a slow process of suicide and two or three stumps of piles and a rusty iron mooring ring were all that remained of the departed break neck glories sometimes indeed a laden coal barge would bump itself into the place and certain laborious heavers seemingly mud engendered would arise deliver the cargo in the neighbourhood shove off and vanish but at most times the only commerce of break neck stairs arose out of the conveyance of casks and bottles both full and empty both to and from the cellars of wilding co wine merchants even that commerce was but occasional and through three fourths of its rising tides the dirty indecorous drab of a river would come solitarily oozing and lapping at the rusty ring as if it had heard of the doge and the adriatic and wanted to be married to the great conserver of its filthiness the right honourable the lord mayor some two hundred and fifty yards on the right up the opposite hill approaching it from the low ground of break neck stairs was cripple corner there was a pump in cripple corner there was a tree in cripple corner all cripple corner belonged to wilding and co wine merchants their cellars burrowed under it their mansion towered over it it really had been a mansion in the days when merchants inhabited the city and had a ceremonious shelter to the doorway without visible support like the sounding board over an old pulpit it had also a number of long narrow strips of window so disposed in its grave brick front as to render it symmetrically ugly it had also on its roof a cupola with a bell in it when a man at five and twenty can put his hat on and can say 'this hat covers the owner of this property and of the business which is transacted on this property' i consider mr bintrey that without being boastful he may be allowed to be deeply thankful i don't know how it may appear to you but so it appears to me thus mr walter wilding to his man of law in his own counting house taking his hat down from its peg to suit the action to the word and hanging it up again when he had done so not to overstep the modesty of nature an innocent open speaking unused looking man mr walter wilding with a remarkably pink and white complexion and a figure much too bulky for so young a man though of a good stature with crispy curling brown hair and amiable bright blue eyes an extremely communicative man a man with whom loquacity was the irrestrainable outpouring of contentment and gratitude mr bintrey on the other hand a cautious man with twinkling beads of eyes in a large overhanging bald head who inwardly but intensely enjoyed the comicality of openness of speech or hand or heart yes said mr bintrey yes ha ha a decanter two wine glasses and a plate of biscuits stood on the desk you like this forty five year old port wine said mr wilding like it repeated mr bintrey rather sir it's from the best corner of our best forty five year old bin said mr wilding thank you sir said mr bintrey it's most excellent he laughed again as he held up his glass and ogled it at the highly ludicrous idea of giving away such wine and now said wilding with a childish enjoyment in the discussion of affairs i think we have got everything straight mr bintrey everything straight said bintrey a partner secured partner secured said bintrey a housekeeper advertised for housekeeper advertised for said bintrey 'apply personally at cripple corner great tower street from ten to twelve' to morrow by the bye my late dear mother's affairs wound up wound up said bintrey and all charges paid and all charges paid said bintrey with a chuckle probably occasioned by the droll circumstance that they had been paid without a haggle the mention of my late dear mother mr wilding continued his eyes filling with tears and his pocket handkerchief drying them unmans me still mr bintrey you know how i loved her you her lawyer know how she loved me the utmost love of mother and child was cherished between us and we never experienced one moment's division or unhappiness from the time when she took me under her care thirteen years in all thirteen years under my late dear mother's care mr bintrey and eight of them her confidentially acknowledged son you know the story mr bintrey who but you sir mr wilding sobbed and dried his eyes without attempt at concealment during these remarks mr bintrey enjoyed his comical port and said after rolling it in his mouth i know the story my late dear mother mr bintrey pursued the wine merchant had been deeply deceived and had cruelly suffered but on that subject my late dear mother's lips were for ever sealed by whom deceived or under what circumstances heaven only knows my late dear mother never betrayed her betrayer she had made up her mind said mr bintrey again turning his wine on his palate and she could hold her peace an amused twinkle in his eyes pretty plainly added a devilish deal better than you ever will 'honour' said mr wilding sobbing as he quoted from the commandments 'thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long in the land' when i was in the foundling mr bintrey i was at such a loss how to do it that i apprehended my days would be short in the land but i afterwards came to honour my mother deeply profoundly and i honour and revere her memory for seven happy years mr bintrey pursued wilding still with the same innocent catching in his breath and the same unabashed tears did my excellent mother article me to my predecessors in this business pebbleson nephew her affectionate forethought likewise apprenticed me to the vintners' company and made me in time a free vintner and and everything else that the best of mothers could desire when i came of age she bestowed her inherited share in this business upon me it was her money that afterwards bought out pebbleson nephew and painted in wilding and co it was she who left me everything she possessed but the mourning ring you wear and yet mr bintrey with a fresh burst of honest affection she is no more it is little over half a year since she came into the corner to read on that door post with her own eyes wilding and co wine merchants and yet she is no more sad but the common lot mr wilding observed bintrey at some time or other we must all be no more he placed the forty five year old port wine in the universal condition with a relishing sigh so now mr bintrey pursued wilding putting away his pocket handkerchief and smoothing his eyelids with his fingers now that i can no longer show my love and honour for the dear parent to whom my heart was mysteriously turned by nature when she first spoke to me a strange lady i sitting at our sunday dinner table in the foundling i can at least show that i am not ashamed of having been a foundling and that i who never knew a father of my own wish to be a father to all in my employment therefore continued wilding becoming enthusiastic in his loquacity therefore i want a thoroughly good housekeeper to undertake this dwelling house of wilding and co wine merchants cripple corner so that i may restore in it some of the old relations betwixt employer and employed so that i may live in it on the spot where my money is made so that i may daily sit at the head of the table at which the people in my employment eat together and may eat of the same roast and boiled and drink of the same beer so that the people in my employment may lodge under the same roof with me so that we may one and all i beg your pardon mr bintrey but that old singing in my head has suddenly come on and i shall feel obliged if you will lead me to the pump alarmed by the excessive pinkness of his client mr bintrey lost not a moment in leading him forth into the court yard it was easily done for the counting house in which they talked together opened on to it at one side of the dwelling house there the attorney pumped with a will obedient to a sign from the client and the client laved his head and face with both hands and took a hearty drink after these remedies he declared himself much better don't let your good feelings excite you said bintrey as they returned to the counting house and mr wilding dried himself on a jack towel behind an inner door no no i won't he returned looking out of the towel i won't i have not been confused have i not at all perfectly clear where did i leave off mr bintrey well you left off but i wouldn't excite myself if i was you by taking it up again just yet i'll take care i'll take care the singing in my head came on at where mr bintrey at roast and boiled and beer answered the lawyer prompting lodging under the same roof and one and all ah and one and all singing in the head together do you know i really would not let my good feelings excite me if i was you hinted the lawyer again anxiously try some more pump no occasion no occasion all right mr bintrey and one and all forming a kind of family you see mr bintrey i was not used in my childhood to that sort of individual existence which most individuals have led more or less in their childhood after that time i became absorbed in my late dear mother having lost her i find that i am more fit for being one of a body than one by myself one to be that and at the same time to do my duty to those dependent on me and attach them to me has a patriarchal and pleasant air about it i don't know how it may appear to you mr bintrey but so it appears to me it is not i who am all important in the case but you returned bintrey consequently how it may appear to me is of very small importance it appears to me said mr wilding in a glow hopeful useful delightful do you know hinted the lawyer again i really would not ex i am not going to then there's handel there's who asked bintrey handel mozart haydn kent purcell doctor arne greene mendelssohn i know the choruses to those anthems by heart foundling chapel collection why shouldn't we learn them together who learn them together asked the lawyer rather shortly employer and employed ay ay returned bintrey mollified as if he had half expected the answer to be lawyer and client that's another thing not another thing mr bintrey the same thing a part of the bond among us we will form a choir in some quiet church near the corner here and having sung together of a sunday with a relish we will come home and take an early dinner together with a relish the object that i have at heart now is to get this system well in action without delay so that my new partner may find it founded when he enters on his partnership all good be with it exclaimed bintrey rising may it prosper is joey ladle to take a share in handel mozart haydn kent purcell doctor arne greene and mendelssohn i hope so i wish them all well out of it returned bintrey with much heartiness good bye sir they shook hands and parted then first knocking with his knuckles for leave entered to mr wilding from a door of communication between his private counting house and that in which his clerks sat the head cellarman of the cellars of wilding and co wine merchants and erst head cellarman of the cellars of pebbleson nephew the joey ladle in question a slow and ponderous man of the drayman order of human architecture dressed in a corrugated suit and bibbed apron apparently a composite of door mat and rhinoceros hide respecting this same boarding and lodging young master wilding said he yes joey speaking for myself young master wilding and i never did speak and i never do speak for no one else i don't want no boarding nor yet no lodging but if you wish to board me and to lodge me take me i can peck as well as most men where i peck ain't so high a object with me as what i peck nor even so high a object with me as how much i peck is all to live in the house young master wilding the two other cellarmen the three porters the two 'prentices and the odd men yes i hope we shall all be an united family joey ah said joey i hope they may be they rather say we joey joey ladle shook his held don't look to me to make we on it young master wilding not at my time of life and under the circumstances which has formed my disposition i have said to pebbleson nephew many a time when they have said to me 'put a livelier face upon it joey' i have said to them 'gentlemen it is all wery well for you that has been accustomed to take your wine into your systems by the conwivial channel of your throttles to put a lively face upon it but' i says 'i have been accustomed to take my wine in at the pores of the skin and took that way it acts different it acts depressing it's one thing gentlemen' i says to pebbleson nephew 'to charge your glasses in a dining room with a hip hurrah and a jolly companions every one and it's another thing to be charged yourself through the pores in a low dark cellar and a mouldy atmosphere it makes all the difference betwixt bubbles and wapours' i tells pebbleson nephew and so it do i've been a cellarman my life through with my mind fully given to the business what's the consequence i'm as muddled a man as lives you won't find a muddleder man than me nor yet you won't find my equal in molloncolly sing of filling the bumper fair every drop you sprinkle o'er the brow of care smooths away a wrinkle yes p'raps so but try filling yourself through the pores underground when you don't want to it i am sorry to hear this joey i had even thought that you might join a singing class in the house me sir no no young master wilding you won't catch joey ladle muddling the armony a pecking machine sir is all that i am capable of proving myself out of my cellars but that you're welcome to if you think it is worth your while to keep such a thing on your premises i do joey say no more sir the business's word is my law and you're a going to take young master george vendale partner into the old business i am joey more changes you see but don't change the name of the firm again don't do it young master wilding it was bad luck enough to make it yourself and co better by far have left it pebbleson nephew that good luck always stuck to you should never change luck when it's good sir at all events i have no intention of changing the name of the house again joey glad to hear it and wish you good day young master wilding but you had better by half muttered joey ladle inaudibly as he closed the door and shook his head have let the name alone from the first you had better by half have followed the luck instead of crossing it enter the housekeeper the wine merchant sat in his dining room next morning to receive the personal applicants for the vacant post in his establishment it was an old fashioned wainscoted room the panels ornamented with festoons of flowers carved in wood with an oaken floor a well worn turkey carpet and dark mahogany furniture all of which had seen service and polish under pebbleson nephew the great sideboard had assisted at many business dinners given by pebbleson nephew to their connection on the principle of throwing sprats overboard to catch whales and pebbleson nephew's comprehensive three sided plate warmer made to fit the whole front of the large fireplace kept watch beneath it over a sarcophagus shaped cellaret that had in its time held many a dozen of pebbleson nephew's wine but the little rubicund old bachelor with a pigtail whose portrait was over the sideboard and who could easily be identified as decidedly pebbleson and decidedly not nephew had retired into another sarcophagus and the plate warmer had grown as cold as he so the golden and black griffins that supported the candelabra with black balls in their mouths at the end of gilded chains looked as if in their old age they had lost all heart for playing at ball and were dolefully exhibiting their chains in the missionary line of inquiry whether they had not earned emancipation by this time and were not griffins and brothers such a columbus of a morning was the summer morning that it discovered cripple corner the light and warmth pierced in at the open windows and irradiated the picture of a lady hanging over the chimney piece the only other decoration of the walls my mother at five and twenty said mr wilding to himself as his eyes enthusiastically followed the light to the portrait's face i hang up here in order that visitors may admire my mother in the bloom of her youth and beauty my mother at fifty i hang in the seclusion of my own chamber as a remembrance sacred to me o it's you jarvis these latter words he addressed to a clerk who had tapped at the door and now looked in yes sir i merely wished to mention that it's gone ten sir and that there are several females in the counting house dear me said the wine merchant deepening in the pink of his complexion and whitening in the white are there several so many as several i had better begin before there are more i'll see them one by one jarvis in the order of their arrival hastily entrenching himself in his easy chair at the table behind a great inkstand having first placed a chair on the other side of the table opposite his own seat mr wilding entered on his task with considerable trepidation he ran the gauntlet that must be run on any such occasion there were the usual species of profoundly unsympathetic women and the usual species of much too sympathetic women there were buccaneering widows who came to seize him and who griped umbrellas under their arms as if each umbrella were he and each griper had got him there were towering maiden ladies who had seen better days and who came armed with clerical testimonials to their theology as if he were saint peter with his keys there were gentle maiden ladies who came to marry him there were professional housekeepers like non commissioned officers who put him through his domestic exercise instead of submitting themselves to catechism there were languid invalids to whom salary was not so much an object as the comforts of a private hospital there were sensitive creatures who burst into tears on being addressed and had to be restored with glasses of cold water there were some respondents who came two together a highly promising one and a wholly unpromising one of whom the promising one answered all questions charmingly until it would at last appear that she was not a candidate at all but only the friend of the unpromising one who had glowered in absolute silence and apparent injury at last when the good wine merchant's simple heart was failing him there entered an applicant quite different from all the rest a woman perhaps fifty but looking younger with a face remarkable for placid cheerfulness and a manner no less remarkable for its quiet expression of equability of temper nothing in her dress could have been changed to her advantage nothing in the noiseless self possession of her manner could have been changed to her advantage nothing could have been in better unison with both than her voice when she answered the question what name shall i have the pleasure of noting down with the words my name is sarah goldstraw mrs goldstraw my husband has been dead many years and we had no family half a dozen questions had scarcely extracted as much to the purpose from any one else the voice dwelt so agreeably on mr wilding's ear as he made his note that he was rather long about it when he looked up again mrs goldstraw's glance had naturally gone round the room and now returned to him from the chimney piece its expression was one of frank readiness to be questioned and to answer straight you will excuse my asking you a few questions said the modest wine merchant o surely sir or i should have no business here have you filled the station of housekeeper before only once i have lived with the same widow lady for twelve years ever since i lost my husband she was an invalid and is lately dead which is the occasion of my now wearing black i do not doubt that she has left you the best credentials said mr wilding i hope i may say the very best i thought it would save trouble sir if i wrote down the name and address of her representatives and brought it with me laying a card on the table you singularly remind me mrs goldstraw said wilding taking the card beside him of a manner and tone of voice that i was once acquainted with not of an individual i feel sure of that though i cannot recall what it is i have in my mind but of a general bearing i ought to add it was a kind and pleasant one she smiled as she rejoined at least i am very glad of that sir yes said the wine merchant thoughtfully repeating his last phrase with a momentary glance at his future housekeeper it was a kind and pleasant one but that is the most i can make of it memory is sometimes like a half forgotten dream i don't know how it may appear to you mrs goldstraw but so it appears to me probably it appeared to mrs goldstraw in a similar light for she quietly assented to the proposition mr wilding then offered to put himself at once in communication with the gentlemen named upon the card a firm of proctors in doctors' commons to this mrs goldstraw thankfully assented doctors' commons not being far off mr wilding suggested the feasibility of mrs goldstraw's looking in again say in three hours' time mrs goldstraw readily undertook to do so in fine the result of mr wilding's inquiries being eminently satisfactory mrs goldstraw was that afternoon engaged on her own perfectly fair terms to come to morrow and set up her rest as housekeeper in cripple corner the housekeeper speaks on the next day mrs goldstraw arrived to enter on her domestic duties having settled herself in her own room without troubling the servants and without wasting time the new housekeeper announced herself as waiting to be favoured with any instructions which her master might wish to give her the wine merchant received mrs goldstraw in the dining room in which he had seen her on the previous day and the usual preliminary civilities having passed on either side the two sat down to take counsel together on the affairs of the house about the meals sir said mrs goldstraw have i a large or a small number to provide for if i can carry out a certain old fashioned plan of mine replied mr wilding you will have a large number to provide for i am a lonely single man mrs goldstraw and i hope to live with all the persons in my employment as if they were members of my family until that time comes you will only have me and the new partner whom i expect immediately to provide for what my partner's habits may be i cannot yet say but i may describe myself as a man of regular hours with an invariable appetite that you may depend upon to an ounce about breakfast sir asked mrs goldstraw is there anything particular she hesitated and left the sentence unfinished her eyes turned slowly away from her master and looked towards the chimney piece if she had been a less excellent and experienced housekeeper mr wilding might have fancied that her attention was beginning to wander at the very outset of the interview eight o'clock is my breakfast hour he resumed it is one of my virtues to be never tired of broiled bacon and it is one of my vices to be habitually suspicious of the freshness of eggs mrs goldstraw looked back at him still a little divided between her master's chimney piece and her master i take tea mr wilding went on and i am perhaps rather nervous and fidgety about drinking it within a certain time after it is made if my tea stands too long he hesitated on his side and left the sentence unfinished if he had not been engaged in discussing a subject of such paramount interest to himself as his breakfast mrs goldstraw might have fancied that his attention was beginning to wander at the very outset of the interview if your tea stands too long sir said the housekeeper politely taking up her master's lost thread if my tea stands too long repeated the wine merchant mechanically his mind getting farther and farther away from his breakfast and his eyes fixing themselves more and more inquiringly on his housekeeper's face if my tea dear dear me mrs goldstraw what is the manner and tone of voice that you remind me of it strikes me even more strongly to day than it did when i saw you yesterday what can it be what can it be repeated mrs goldstraw she said the words evidently thinking while she spoke them of something else the wine merchant still looking at her inquiringly observed that her eyes wandered towards the chimney piece once more they fixed on the portrait of his mother which hung there and looked at it with that slight contraction of the brow which accompanies a scarcely conscious effort of memory mr wilding remarked my late dear mother when she was five and twenty mrs goldstraw thanked him with a movement of the head for being at the pains to explain the picture and said with a cleared brow that it was the portrait of a very beautiful lady mr wilding falling back into his former perplexity tried once more to recover that lost recollection associated so closely and yet so undiscoverably with his new housekeeper's voice and manner excuse my asking you a question which has nothing to do with me or my breakfast he said may i inquire if you have ever occupied any other situation than the situation of housekeeper o yes sir i began life as one of the nurses at the foundling why that's it cried the wine merchant pushing back his chair by heaven their manner is the manner you remind me of in an astonished look at him mrs goldstraw changed colour checked herself turned her eyes upon the ground and sat still and silent what is the matter asked mr wilding do i understand that you were in the foundling sir certainly i am not ashamed to own it under the name you now bear under the name of walter wilding and the lady mrs goldstraw stopped short with a look at the portrait which was now unmistakably a look of alarm you mean my mother interrupted mr wilding your mother repeated the housekeeper a little constrainedly removed you from the foundling at what age sir at between eleven and twelve years old it's quite a romantic adventure mrs goldstraw he told the story of the lady having spoken to him while he sat at dinner with the other boys in the foundling and of all that had followed in his innocently communicative way my poor mother could never have discovered me he added if she had not met with one of the matrons who pitied her the matron consented to touch the boy whose name was 'walter wilding' as she went round the dinner tables and so my mother discovered me again after having parted from me as an infant at the foundling doors at those words mrs goldstraw's hand resting on the table dropped helplessly into her lap she sat looking at her new master with a face that had turned deadly pale and with eyes that expressed an unutterable dismay what does this mean asked the wine merchant stop he cried is there something else in the past time which i ought to associate with you i remember my mother telling me of another person at the foundling to whose kindness she owed a debt of gratitude when she first parted with me as an infant one of the nurses informed her of the name that had been given to me in the institution you were that nurse god forgive me sir i was that nurse god forgive you we had better get back sir if i may make so bold as to say so to my duties in the house said mrs goldstraw your breakfast hour is eight do you lunch or dine in the middle of the day the excessive pinkness which mr bintrey had noticed in his client's face began to appear there once more mr wilding put his hand to his head and mastered some momentary confusion in that quarter before he spoke again mrs goldstraw he said you are concealing something from me the housekeeper obstinately repeated please to favour me sir by saying whether you lunch or dine in the middle of the day i don't know what i do in the middle of the day i can't enter into my household affairs mrs goldstraw till i know why you regret an act of kindness to my mother which she always spoke of gratefully to the end of her life you are not doing me a service by your silence you are agitating me you are alarming me you are bringing on the singing in my head his hand went up to his head again and the pink in his face deepened by a shade or two it's hard sir on just entering your service said the housekeeper to say what may cost me the loss of your good will please to remember end how it may that i only speak because you have insisted on my speaking and because i see that i am alarming you by my silence when i told the poor lady whose portrait you have got there the name by which her infant was christened in the foundling i allowed myself to forget my duty and dreadful consequences i am afraid have followed from it i'll tell you the truth as plainly as i can a few months from the time when i had informed the lady of her baby's name there came to our institution in the country another lady a stranger whose object was to adopt one of our children she brought the needful permission with her and after looking at a great many of the children without being able to make up her mind she took a sudden fancy to one of the babies a boy under my care try pray try to compose yourself sir it's no use disguising it any longer the child the stranger took away was the child of that lady whose portrait hangs there mr wilding started to his feet impossible he cried out vehemently what are you talking about what absurd story are you telling me now there's her portrait haven't i told you so already the portrait of my mother when that unhappy lady removed you from the foundling in after years said mrs goldstraw gently she was the victim and you were the victim sir of a dreadful mistake he dropped back into his chair the room goes round with me he said my head my head the housekeeper rose in alarm and opened the windows before she could get to the door to call for help a sudden burst of tears relieved the oppression which had at first almost appeared to threaten his life he signed entreatingly to mrs goldstraw not to leave him she waited until the paroxysm of weeping had worn itself out he raised his head as he recovered himself and looked at her with the angry unreasoning suspicion of a weak man mistake he said wildly repeating her last word how do i know you are not mistaken yourself there is no hope that i am mistaken sir i will tell you why when you are better fit to hear it now now the tone in which he spoke warned mrs goldstraw that it would be cruel kindness to let him comfort himself a moment longer with the vain hope that she might be wrong a few words more would end it and those few words she determined to speak i have told you she said that the child of the lady whose portrait hangs there was adopted in its infancy and taken away by a stranger i am as certain of what i say as that i am now sitting here obliged to distress you sir sorely against my will please to carry your mind on now to about three months after that time i was then at the foundling in london waiting to take some children to our institution in the country there was a question that day about naming an infant a boy who had just been received we generally named them out of the directory on this occasion one of the gentlemen who managed the hospital happened to be looking over the register he noticed that the name of the baby who had been adopted 'walter wilding' was scratched out for the reason of course that the child had been removed for good from our care 'here's a name to let' he said 'give it to the new foundling who has been received to day' the name was given and the child was christened you sir were that child the wine merchant's head dropped on his breast i was that child he said to himself trying helplessly to fix the idea in his mind i was that child not very long after you had been received into the institution sir pursued mrs goldstraw i left my situation there to be married if you will remember that and if you can give your mind to it you will see for yourself how the mistake happened between eleven and twelve years passed before the lady whom you have believed to be your mother returned to the foundling to find her son and to remove him to her own home the lady only knew that her infant had been called 'walter wilding' the matron who took pity on her could but point out the only 'walter wilding' known in the institution i who might have set the matter right was far away from the foundling and all that belonged to it there was nothing there was really nothing that could prevent this terrible mistake from taking place i feel for you i do indeed sir you must think and with reason that it was in an evil hour that i came here innocently enough i'm sure to apply for your housekeeper's place i feel as if i was to blame i feel as if i ought to have had more self command if i had only been able to keep my face from showing you what that portrait and what your own words put into my mind you need never to your dying day have known what you know now mr wilding looked up suddenly the inbred honesty of the man rose in protest against the housekeeper's last words his mind seemed to steady itself for the moment under the shock that had fallen on it do you mean to say that you would have concealed this from me if you could he exclaimed i hope i should always tell the truth sir if i was asked said mrs goldstraw and i know it is better for me that i should not have a secret of this sort weighing on my mind but is it better for you what use can it serve now what use why good lord if your story is true should i have told it sir as i am now situated if it had not been true i beg your pardon said the wine merchant you must make allowance for me this dreadful discovery is something i can't realise even yet we loved each other so dearly i felt so fondly that i was her son she died mrs goldstraw in my arms she died blessing me as only a mother could have blessed me and now after all these years to be told she was not my mother o me o me i don't know what i am saying he cried as the impulse of self control under which he had spoken a moment since flickered and died out it was not this dreadful grief it was something else that i had it in my mind to speak of yes yes you surprised me you wounded me just now you talked as if you would have hidden this from me if you could don't talk in that way again it would have been a crime to have hidden it you mean well i know i don't want to distress you you are a kind hearted woman but you don't remember what my position is she left me all that i possess in the firm persuasion that i was her son i am not her son i have taken the place i have innocently got the inheritance of another man he must be found how do i know he is not at this moment in misery without bread to eat he must be found my only hope of bearing up against the shock that has fallen on me is the hope of doing something which she would have approved you must know more mrs goldstraw than you have told me yet who was the stranger who adopted the child you must have heard the lady's name i never heard it sir i have never seen her or heard of her since did she say nothing when she took the child away search your memory she must have said something only one thing sir that i can remember it was a miserably bad season that year and many of the children were suffering from it when she took the baby away the lady said to me laughing 'don't be alarmed about his health he will be brought up in a better climate than this i am going to take him to switzerland' to switzerland what part of switzerland she didn't say sir only that faint clue said mr wilding and a quarter of a century has passed since the child was taken away what am i to do i hope you won't take offence at my freedom sir said mrs goldstraw but why should you distress yourself about what is to be done he may not be alive now for anything you know and if he is alive it's not likely he can be in any distress the lady who adopted him was a bred and born lady it was easy to see that and she must have satisfied them at the foundling that she could provide for the child or they would never have let her take him away if i was in your place sir please to excuse my saying so i should comfort myself with remembering that i had loved that poor lady whose portrait you have got there truly loved her as my mother and that she had truly loved me as her son all she gave to you she gave for the sake of that love it never altered while she lived and it won't alter i'm sure as long as you live how can you have a better right sir to keep what you have got than that mr wilding's immovable honesty saw the fallacy in his housekeeper's point of view at a glance you don't understand me he said it's because i loved her that i feel it a duty a sacred duty to do justice to her son if he is a living man i must find him for my own sake as well as for his i shall break down under this dreadful trial unless i employ myself actively instantly employ myself in doing what my conscience tells me ought to be done i must speak to my lawyer i must set my lawyer at work before i sleep to night he approached a tube in the wall of the room and called down through it to the office below leave me for a little mrs goldstraw he resumed i shall be more composed i shall be better able to speak to you later in the day we shall get on well i hope we shall get on well together in spite of what has happened it isn't your fault i know it isn't your fault there there shake hands and and do the best you can in the house i can't talk about it now the door opened as mrs goldstraw advanced towards it and mr jarvis appeared send for mr bintrey said the wine merchant say i want to see him directly the clerk unconsciously suspended the execution of the order by announcing mr vendale and showing in the new partner in the firm of wilding and co pray excuse me for one moment george vendale said wilding i have a word to say to jarvis send for mr bintrey he repeated send at once mr jarvis laid a letter on the table before he left the room from our correspondents at neuchatel i think sir the letter has got the swiss postmark new characters on the scene the words the swiss postmark following so soon upon the housekeeper's reference to switzerland wrought mr wilding's agitation to such a remarkable height that his new partner could not decently make a pretence of letting it pass unnoticed wilding he asked hurriedly and yet stopping short and glancing around as if for some visible cause of his state of mind what is the matter my good george vendale returned the wine merchant giving his hand with an appealing look rather as if he wanted help to get over some obstacle than as if he gave it in welcome or salutation my good george vendale so much is the matter that i shall never be myself again it is impossible that i can ever be myself again for in fact i am not myself the new partner a brown cheeked handsome fellow of about his own age with a quick determined eye and an impulsive manner retorted with natural astonishment not yourself not what i supposed myself to be said wilding what in the name of wonder did you suppose yourself to be that you are not was the rejoinder delivered with a cheerful frankness inviting confidence from a more reticent man i may ask without impertinence now that we are partners there again cried wilding leaning back in his chair with a lost look at the other partners i had no right to come into this business it was never meant for me my mother never meant it should be mine i mean his mother meant it should be his if i mean anything or if i am anybody come come urged his partner after a moment's pause and taking possession of him with that calm confidence which inspires a strong nature when it honestly desires to aid a weak one whatever has gone wrong has gone wrong through no fault of yours i am very sure i was not in this counting house with you under the old regime for three years to doubt you wilding we were not younger men than we are together for that let me begin our partnership by being a serviceable partner and setting right whatever is wrong has that letter anything to do with it hah said wilding with his hand to his temple there again my head i was forgetting the coincidence the swiss postmark at a second glance i see that the letter is unopened so it is not very likely to have much to do with the matter said vendale with comforting composure is it for you or for us for us said wilding suppose i open it and read it aloud to get it out of our way thank you thank you the letter is only from our champagne making friends the house at neuchatel 'dear sir we are in receipt of yours of the th ult informing us that you have taken your mr vendale into partnership whereon we beg you to receive the assurance of our felicitations permit us to embrace the occasion of specially commanding to you m jules obenreizer' impossible wilding looked up in quick apprehension and cried eh impossible sort of name returned his partner slightly obenreizer ' of specially commanding to you m jules obenreizer of soho square london north side henceforth fully accredited as our agent and who has already had the honour of making the acquaintance of your mr vendale in his said m obenreizer's native country switzerland' to be sure pooh pooh what have i been thinking of i remember now 'when travelling with his niece' with his vendale had so slurred the last word that wilding had not heard it when travelling with his niece obenreizer's niece said vendale in a somewhat superfluously lucid manner niece of obenreizer i met them in my first swiss tour travelled a little with them and lost them for two years met them again my swiss tour before last and have lost them ever since obenreizer niece of obenreizer to be sure possible sort of name after all 'm obenreizer is in possession of our absolute confidence and we do not doubt you will esteem his merits' duly signed by the house 'defresnier et cie' very well i undertake to see m obenreizer presently and clear him out of the way that clears the swiss postmark out of the way so now my dear wilding tell me what i can clear out of your way and i'll find a way to clear it more than ready and grateful to be thus taken charge of the honest wine merchant wrung his partner's hand and beginning his tale by pathetically declaring himself an impostor told it it was on this matter no doubt that you were sending for bintrey when i came in said his partner after reflecting it was he has experience and a shrewd head i shall be anxious to know his opinion it is bold and hazardous in me to give you mine before i know his but i am not good at holding back plainly then i do not see these circumstances as you see them i do not see your position as you see it as to your being an impostor my dear wilding that is simply absurd because no man can be that without being a consenting party to an imposition clearly you never were so as to your enrichment by the lady who believed you to be her son and whom you were forced to believe on her showing to be your mother consider whether that did not arise out of the personal relations between you you gradually became much attached to her she gradually became much attached to you it was on you personally you as i see the case that she conferred these worldly advantages it was from her personally her that you took them she supposed me objected wilding shaking his head to have a natural claim upon her which i had not i must admit that replied his partner to be true but if she had made the discovery that you have made six months before she died do you think it would have cancelled the years you were together and the tenderness that each of you had conceived for the other each on increasing knowledge of the other what i think said wilding simply but stoutly holding to the bare fact can no more change the truth than it can bring down the sky the truth is that i stand possessed of what was meant for another man he may be dead said vendale he may be alive said wilding and if he is alive have i not innocently i grant you innocently robbed him of enough have i not robbed him of all the happy time that i enjoyed in his stead have i not robbed him of the exquisite delight that filled my soul when that dear lady stretching his hand towards the picture told me she was my mother have i not robbed him of all the care she lavished on me have i not even robbed him of all the devotion and duty that i so proudly gave to her therefore it is that i ask myself george vendale and i ask you where is he what has become of him who can tell i must try to find out who can tell i must institute inquiries i must never desist from prosecuting inquiries i will live upon the interest of my share i ought to say his share in this business and will lay up the rest for him when i find him i may perhaps throw myself upon his generosity but i will yield up all to him i will i swear as i loved and honoured her said wilding reverently kissing his hand towards the picture and then covering his eyes with it as i loved and honoured her and have a world of reasons to be grateful to her and so broke down again his partner rose from the chair he had occupied and stood beside him with a hand softly laid upon his shoulder walter i knew you before to day to be an upright man with a pure conscience and a fine heart it is very fortunate for me that i have the privilege to travel on in life so near to so trustworthy a man i am thankful for it use me as your right hand and rely upon me to the death don't think the worse of me if i protest to you that my uppermost feeling at present is a confused you may call it an unreasonable one i feel far more pity for the lady and for you because you did not stand in your supposed relations than i can feel for the unknown man if he ever became a man because he was unconsciously displaced you have done well in sending for mr bintrey what i think will be a part of his advice i know is the whole of mine do not move a step in this serious matter precipitately the secret must be kept among us with great strictness for to part with it lightly would be to invite fraudulent claims to encourage a host of knaves to let loose a flood of perjury and plotting i have no more to say now walter than to remind you that you sold me a share in your business expressly to save yourself from more work than your present health is fit for and that i bought it expressly to do work and mean to do it with these words and a parting grip of his partner's shoulder that gave them the best emphasis they could have had george vendale betook himself presently to the counting house and presently afterwards to the address of m jules obenreizer as he turned into soho square and directed his steps towards its north side a deepened colour shot across his sun browned face which wilding if he had been a better observer or had been less occupied with his own trouble might have noticed when his partner read aloud a certain passage in their swiss correspondent's letter which he had not read so distinctly as the rest a curious colony of mountaineers has long been enclosed within that small flat london district of soho swiss watchmakers swiss silver chasers swiss jewellers swiss importers of swiss musical boxes and swiss toys of various kinds draw close together there swiss professors of music painting and languages swiss artificers in steady work swiss couriers and other swiss servants chronically out of place industrious swiss laundresses and clear starchers mysteriously existing swiss of both sexes swiss creditable and swiss discreditable swiss to be trusted by all means and swiss to be trusted by no means these diverse swiss particles are attracted to a centre in the district of soho shabby swiss eating houses coffee houses and lodging houses swiss drinks and dishes swiss service for sundays and swiss schools for week days are all to be found there even the native born english taverns drive a sort of broken english trade announcing in their windows swiss whets and drams and sheltering in their bars swiss skirmishes of love and animosity on most nights in the year when the new partner in wilding and co rang the bell of a door bearing the blunt inscription obenreizer on a brass plate the inner door of a substantial house whose ground story was devoted to the sale of swiss clocks he passed at once into domestic switzerland a white tiled stove for winter time filled the fireplace of the room into which he was shown the room's bare floor was laid together in a neat pattern of several ordinary woods the room had a prevalent air of surface bareness and much scrubbing and the little square of flowery carpet by the sofa and the velvet chimney board with its capacious clock and vases of artificial flowers contended with that tone as if in bringing out the whole effect a parisian had adapted a dairy to domestic purposes mimic water was dropping off a mill wheel under the clock the visitor had not stood before it following it with his eyes a minute when m obenreizer at his elbow startled him by saying in very good english very slightly clipped how do you do so glad i beg your pardon i didn't hear you come in not at all sit please releasing his visitor's two arms which he had lightly pinioned at the elbows by way of embrace m obenreizer also sat remarking with a smile you are well so glad and touching his elbows again i don't know said vendale after exchange of salutations whether you may yet have heard of me from your house at neuchatel ah yes in connection with wilding and co ah surely is it not odd that i should come to you in london here as one of the firm of wilding and co to pay the firm's respects not at all what did i always observe when we were on the mountains we call them vast but the world is so little so little is the world that one cannot keep away from persons there are so few persons in the world that they continually cross and re cross so very little is the world that one cannot get rid of a person not touching his elbows again with an ingratiatory smile that one would desire to get rid of you i hope not m obenreizer please call me in your country mr i call myself so for i love your country if i could be english but i am born and you though descended from so fine a family you have had the condescension to come into trade stop though wines is it trade in england or profession not fine art mr obenreizer returned vendale somewhat out of countenance i was but a silly young fellow just of age when i first had the pleasure of travelling with you and when you and i and mademoiselle your niece who is well thank you who is well shared some slight glacier dangers together if with a boy's vanity i rather vaunted my family i hope i did so as a kind of introduction of myself it was very weak and in very bad taste but perhaps you know our english proverb 'live and learn' you make too much of it returned the swiss and what the devil after all yours was a fine family george vendale's laugh betrayed a little vexation as he rejoined well i was strongly attached to my parents and when we first travelled together mr obenreizer i was in the first flush of coming into what my father and mother left me so i hope it may have been after all more youthful openness of speech and heart than boastfulness all openness of speech and heart no boastfulness cried obenreizer you tax yourself too heavily you tax yourself my faith as if you was your government taxing you besides it commenced with me i remember that evening in the boat upon the lake floating among the reflections of the mountains and valleys the crags and pine woods which were my earliest remembrance i drew a word picture of my sordid childhood of our poor hut by the waterfall which my mother showed to travellers of the cow shed where i slept with the cow of my idiot half brother always sitting at the door or limping down the pass to beg of my half sister always spinning and resting her enormous goitre on a great stone of my being a famished naked little wretch of two or three years when they were men and women with hard hands to beat me i the only child of my father's second marriage if it even was a marriage what more natural than for you to compare notes with me and say 'we are as one by age at that same time i sat upon my mother's lap in my father's carriage rolling through the rich english streets all luxury surrounding me all squalid poverty kept far from me such is my earliest remembrance as opposed to yours' mr obenreizer was a black haired young man of a dark complexion through whose swarthy skin no red glow ever shone when colour would have come into another cheek a hardly discernible beat would come into his as if the machinery for bringing up the ardent blood were there but the machinery were dry he was robustly made well proportioned and had handsome features many would have perceived that some surface change in him would have set them more at their ease with him without being able to define what change if his lips could have been made much thicker and his neck much thinner they would have found their want supplied but the great obenreizer peculiarity was that a certain nameless film would come over his eyes apparently by the action of his own will which would impenetrably veil not only from those tellers of tales but from his face at large every expression save one of attention it by no means followed that his attention should be wholly given to the person with whom he spoke or even wholly bestowed on present sounds and objects rather it was a comprehensive watchfulness of everything he had in his own mind and everything that he knew to be or suspected to be in the minds of other men at this stage of the conversation mr obenreizer's film came over him the object of my present visit said vendale is i need hardly say to assure you of the friendliness of wilding and co and of the goodness of your credit with us and of our desire to be of service to you we hope shortly to offer you our hospitality things are not quite in train with us yet for my partner mr wilding is reorganising the domestic part of our establishment and is interrupted by some private affairs you don't know mr wilding i believe mr obenreizer did not you must come together soon he will be glad to have made your acquaintance and i think i may predict that you will be glad to have made his you have not been long established in london i suppose mr obenreizer it is only now that i have undertaken this agency mademoiselle your niece is not married not married george vendale glanced about him as if for any tokens of her she has been in london she is in london when and where might i have the honour of recalling myself to her remembrance mr obenreizer discarding his film and touching his visitor's elbows as before said lightly come up stairs fluttered enough by the suddenness with which the interview he had sought was coming upon him after all george vendale followed up stairs in a room over the chamber he had just quitted a room also swiss appointed a young lady sat near one of three windows working at an embroidery frame and an older lady sat with her face turned close to another white tiled stove though it was summer and the stove was not lighted cleaning gloves the young lady wore an unusual quantity of fair bright hair very prettily braided about a rather rounder white forehead than the average english type and so her face might have been a shade or say a light rounder than the average english face and her figure slightly rounder than the figure of the average english girl at nineteen a remarkable indication of freedom and grace of limb in her quiet attitude and a wonderful purity and freshness of colour in her dimpled face and bright gray eyes seemed fraught with mountain air switzerland too though the general fashion of her dress was english peeped out of the fanciful bodice she wore and lurked in the curious clocked red stocking and in its little silver buckled shoe as to the elder lady sitting with her feet apart upon the lower brass ledge of the stove supporting a lap full of gloves while she cleaned one stretched on her left hand she was a true swiss impersonation of another kind from the breadth of her cushion like back and the ponderosity of her respectable legs if the word be admissible to the black velvet band tied tightly round her throat for the repression of a rising tendency to goitre or higher still to her great copper coloured gold ear rings or higher still to her head dress of black gauze stretched on wire miss marguerite said obenreizer to the young lady do you recollect this gentleman i think she answered rising from her seat surprised and a little confused it is mr vendale i think it is said obenreizer dryly permit me mr vendale madame dor the elder lady by the stove with the glove stretched on her left hand like a glover's sign half got up half looked over her broad shoulder and wholly plumped down again and rubbed away madame dor said obenreizer smiling is so kind as to keep me free from stain or tear madame dor humours my weakness for being always neat and devotes her time to removing every one of my specks and spots madame dor with the stretched glove in the air and her eyes closely scrutinizing its palm discovered a tough spot in mr obenreizer at that instant and rubbed hard at him george vendale took his seat by the embroidery frame having first taken the fair right hand that his entrance had checked and glanced at the gold cross that dipped into the bodice with something of the devotion of a pilgrim who had reached his shrine at last obenreizer stood in the middle of the room with his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets and became filmy he was saying down stairs miss obenreizer observed vendale that the world is so small a place that people cannot escape one another i have found it much too large for me since i saw you last have you travelled so far then she inquired not so far for i have only gone back to switzerland each year but i could have wished and indeed i have wished very often that the little world did not afford such opportunities for long escapes as it does if it had been less i might have found my follow travellers sooner you know the pretty marguerite coloured and very slightly glanced in the direction of madame dor you find us at length mr vendale perhaps you may lose us again i trust not the curious coincidence that has enabled me to find you encourages me to hope not what is that coincidence sir if you please a dainty little native touch in this turn of speech and in its tone made it perfectly captivating thought george vendale when again he noticed an instantaneous glance towards madame dor a caution seemed to be conveyed in it rapid flash though it was so he quietly took heed of madame dor from that time forth it is that i happen to have become a partner in a house of business in london to which mr obenreizer happens this very day to be expressly recommended and that too by another house of business in switzerland in which as it turns out we both have a commercial interest he has not told you ah cried obenreizer striking in filmless no i had not told miss marguerite the world is so small and so monotonous that a surprise is worth having in such a little jog trot place it is as he tells you miss marguerite he of so fine a family and so proudly bred has condescended to trade to trade like us poor peasants who have risen from ditches a cloud crept over the fair brow and she cast down her eyes why it is good for trade pursued obenreizer enthusiastically it ennobles trade it is the misfortune of trade it is its vulgarity that any low people for example we poor peasants may take to it and climb by it see you my dear vendale he spoke with great energy the father of miss marguerite my eldest half brother more than two times your age or mine if living now wandered without shoes almost without rags from that wretched pass wandered wandered got to be fed with the mules and dogs at an inn in the main valley far away got to be boy there got to be ostler got to be waiter got to be cook got to be landlord as landlord he took me could he take the idiot beggar his brother or the spinning monstrosity his sister to put as pupil to the famous watchmaker his neighbour and friend his wife dies when miss marguerite is born what is his will and what are his words to me when he dies she being between girl and woman 'all for marguerite except so much by the year for you you are young but i make her your ward for you were of the obscurest and the poorest peasantry and so was i and so was her mother we were abject peasants all and you will remember it' the thing is equally true of most of my countrymen now in trade in this your london quarter of soho peasants once low born drudging swiss peasants then how good and great for trade here from having been warm he became playfully jubilant and touched the young wine merchant's elbows again with his light embrace to be exalted by gentlemen i do not think so said marguerite with a flushed cheek and a look away from the visitor that was almost defiant i think it is as much exalted by us peasants fie fie miss marguerite said obenreizer you speak in proud england i speak in proud earnest she answered quietly resuming her work and i am not english but a swiss peasant's daughter there was a dismissal of the subject in her words which vendale could not contend against he only said in an earnest manner i most heartily agree with you miss obenreizer and i have already said so as mr obenreizer will bear witness which he by no means did in this house now vendale's eyes were quick eyes and sharply watching madame dor by times noted something in the broad back view of that lady there was considerable pantomimic expression in her glove cleaning it had been very softly done when he spoke with marguerite or it had altogether stopped like the action of a listener when obenreizer's peasant speech came to an end she rubbed most vigorously as if applauding it and once or twice as the glove which she always held before her a little above her face turned in the air or as this finger went down or that went up he even fancied that it made some telegraphic communication to obenreizer whose back was certainly never turned upon it though he did not seem at all to heed it vendale observed too that in marguerite's dismissal of the subject twice forced upon him to his misrepresentation there was an indignant treatment of her guardian which she tried to cheek as though she would have flamed out against him but for the influence of fear he also observed though this was not much that he never advanced within the distance of her at which he first placed himself as though there were limits fixed between them neither had he ever spoken of her without the prefix miss though whenever he uttered it it was with the faintest trace of an air of mockery and now it occurred to vendale for the first time that something curious in the man which he had never before been able to define was definable as a certain subtle essence of mockery that eluded touch or analysis he felt convinced that marguerite was in some sort a prisoner as to her freewill though she held her own against those two combined by the force of her character which was nevertheless inadequate to her release to feel convinced of this was not to feel less disposed to love her than he had always been in a word he was desperately in love with her and thoroughly determined to pursue the opportunity which had opened at last for the present he merely touched upon the pleasure that wilding and co would soon have in entreating miss obenreizer to honour their establishment with her presence a curious old place though a bachelor house withal and so did not protract his visit beyond such a visit's ordinary length going down stairs conducted by his host he found the obenreizer counting house at the back of the entrance hall and several shabby men in outlandish garments hanging about whom obenreizer put aside that he might pass with a few words in patois countrymen he explained as he attended vendale to the door poor compatriots grateful and attached like dogs good bye to meet again so glad two more light touches on his elbows dismissed him into the street sweet marguerite at her frame and madame dor's broad back at her telegraph floated before him to cripple corner on his arrival there wilding was closeted with bintrey the cellar doors happening to be open vendale lighted a candle in a cleft stick and went down for a cellarous stroll graceful marguerite floated before him faithfully but madame dor's broad back remained outside the vaults were very spacious and very old there had been a stone crypt down there when bygones were not bygones some said part of a monkish refectory some said of a chapel some said of a pagan temple it was all one now let who would make what he liked of a crumbled pillar and a broken arch or so old time had made what he liked of it and was quite indifferent to contradiction the close air the musty smell and the thunderous rumbling in the streets above as being out of the routine of ordinary life went well enough with the picture of pretty marguerite holding her own against those two so vendale went on until at a turning in the vaults he saw a light like the light he carried o you are here are you joey oughtn't it rather to go 'o you're here are you master george' for it's my business to be here but it ain't yourn don't grumble joey o i don't grumble returned the cellarman if anything grumbles it's what i've took in through the pores it ain't me have a care as something in you don't begin a grumbling master george stop here long enough for the wapours to work and they'll be at it his present occupation consisted of poking his head into the bins making measurements and mental calculations and entering them in a rhinoceros hide looking note book like a piece of himself they'll be at it he resumed laying the wooden rod that he measured with across two casks entering his last calculation and straightening his back trust 'em and so you've regularly come into the business master george regularly i hope you don't object joey i don't bless you but wapours objects that you're too young you're both on you too young we shall got over that objection day by day joey ay master george but i shall day by day get over the objection that i'm too old and so i shan't be capable of seeing much improvement in you the retort so tickled joey ladle that he grunted forth a laugh and delivered it again grunting forth another laugh after the second edition of improvement in you but what's no laughing matter master george he resumed straightening his back once more is that young master wilding has gone and changed the luck mark my words he has changed the luck and he'll find it out i ain't been down here all my life for nothing i know by what i notices down here when it's a going to rain when it's a going to hold up when it's a going to blow when it's a going to be calm i know by what i notices down here when the luck's changed quite as well has this growth on the roof anything to do with your divination asked vendale holding his light towards a gloomy ragged growth of dark fungus pendent from the arches with a very disagreeable and repellent effect we are famous for this growth in this vault aren't we we are master george replied joey ladle moving a step or two away and if you'll be advised by me you'll let it alone taking up the rod just now laid across the two casks and faintly moving the languid fungus with it vendale asked ay indeed why so why not so much because it rises from the casks of wine and may leave you to judge what sort of stuff a cellarman takes into himself when he walks in the same all the days of his life nor yet so much because at a stage of its growth it's maggots and you'll fetch 'em down upon you returned joey ladle still keeping away as for another reason master george what other reason i wouldn't keep on touchin' it if i was you sir i'll tell you if you'll come out of the place first take a look at its colour master george i am doing so done sir now come out of the place he moved away with his light and vendale followed with his when vendale came up with him and they were going back together vendale eyeing him as they walked through the arches said well joey the colour is it like clotted blood master george like enough perhaps more than enough i think muttered joey ladle shaking his head solemnly well say it is like say it is exactly like what then master george they do say who how should i know who rejoined the cellarman apparently much exasperated by the unreasonable nature of the question them them as says pretty well everything you know how should i know who they are if you don't true go on they do say that the man that gets by any accident a piece of that dark growth right upon his breast will for sure and certain die by murder as vendale laughingly stopped to meet the cellarman's eyes which he had fastened on his light while dreamily saying those words he suddenly became conscious of being struck upon his own breast by a heavy hand instantly following with his eyes the action of the hand that struck him which was his companion's he saw that it had beaten off his breast a web or clot of the fungus even then floating to the ground for a moment he turned upon the cellarman almost as scared a look as the cellarman turned upon him but in another moment they had reached the daylight at the foot of the cellar steps and before he cheerfully sprang up them he blew out his candle and the superstition together exit wilding on the morning of the next day wilding went out alone after leaving a message with his clerk if mr vendale should ask for me he said or if mr bintrey should call tell them i am gone to the foundling all that his partner had said to him all that his lawyer following on the same side could urge had left him persisting unshaken in his own point of view to find the lost man whose place he had usurped was now the paramount interest of his life and to inquire at the foundling was plainly to take the first step in the direction of discovery to the foundling accordingly the wine merchant now went the once familiar aspect of the building was altered to him as the look of the portrait over the chimney piece was altered to him his one dearest association with the place which had sheltered his childhood had been broken away from it for ever a strange reluctance possessed him when he stated his business at the door his heart ached as he sat alone in the waiting room while the treasurer of the institution was being sent for to see him when the interview began it was only by a painful effort that he could compose himself sufficiently to mention the nature of his errand the treasurer listened with a face which promised all needful attention and promised nothing more we are obliged to be cautious he said when it came to his turn to speak about all inquiries which are made by strangers you can hardly consider me a stranger answered wilding simply i was one of your poor lost children here in the bygone time the treasurer politely rejoined that this circumstance inspired him with a special interest in his visitor but he pressed nevertheless for that visitor's motive in making his inquiry without further preface wilding told him his motive suppressing nothing the treasurer rose and led the way into the room in which the registers of the institution were kept all the information which our books can give is heartily at your service he said after the time that has elapsed i am afraid it is the only information we have to offer you the books were consulted and the entry was found expressed as follows d march adopted and removed from the foundling hospital a male infant named walter wilding name and condition of the person adopting the child mrs jane ann miller widow address lime tree lodge groombridge wells references the reverend john harker groombridge wells and messrs giles jeremie and giles bankers lombard street is that all asked the wine merchant had you no after communication with mrs miller none or some reference to it must have appeared in this book may i take a copy of the entry certainly you are a little agitated let me make a copy for you my only chance i suppose said wilding looking sadly at the copy is to inquire at mrs miller's residence and to try if her references can help me that is the only chance i see at present answered the treasurer i heartily wish i could have been of some further assistance to you with those farewell words to comfort him wilding set forth on the journey of investigation which began from the foundling doors the first stage to make for was plainly the house of business of the bankers in lombard street two of the partners in the firm were inaccessible to chance visitors when he asked for them the third after raising certain inevitable difficulties consented to let a clerk examine the ledger marked with the initial letter m the account of mrs miller widow of groombridge wells was found two long lines in faded ink were drawn across it and at the bottom of the page there appeared this note account closed september th so the first stage of the journey was reached and so it ended in no thoroughfare after sending a note to cripple corner to inform his partner that his absence might be prolonged for some hours wilding took his place in the train and started for the second stage on the journey mrs miller's residence at groombridge wells mothers and children travelled with him mothers and children met each other at the station mothers and children were in the shops when he entered them to inquire for lime tree lodge everywhere the nearest and dearest of human relations showed itself happily in the happy light of day everywhere he was reminded of the treasured delusion from which he had been awakened so cruelly of the lost memory which had passed from him like a reflection from a glass inquiring here inquiring there he could hear of no such place as lime tree lodge passing a house agent's office he went in wearily and put the question for the last time the house agent pointed across the street to a dreary mansion of many windows which might have been a manufactory but which was an hotel that's where lime tree lodge stood sir said the man ten years ago the second stage reached and no thoroughfare again but one chance was left the clerical reference mr harker still remained to be found customers coming in at the moment to occupy the house agent's attention wilding went down the street and entering a bookseller's shop asked if he could be informed of the reverend john harker's present address the bookseller looked unaffectedly shocked and astonished and made no answer wilding repeated his question the bookseller took up from his counter a prim little volume in a binding of sober gray he handed it to his visitor open at the title page wilding read the martyrdom of the reverend john harker in new zealand related by a former member of his flock wilding put the book down on the counter i beg your pardon he said thinking a little perhaps of his own present martyrdom while he spoke the silent bookseller acknowledged the apology by a bow wilding went out third and last stage and no thoroughfare for the third and last time there was nothing more to be done there was absolutely no choice but to go back to london defeated at all points from time to time on the return journey the wine merchant looked at his copy of the entry in the foundling register there is one among the many forms of despair perhaps the most pitiable of all which persists in disguising itself as hope wilding checked himself in the act of throwing the useless morsel of paper out of the carriage window it may lead to something yet he thought while i live i won't part with it when i die my executors shall find it sealed up with my will now the mention of his will set the good wine merchant on a new track of thought without diverting his mind from its engrossing subject he must make his will immediately the application of the phrase no thoroughfare to the case had originated with mr bintrey in their first long conference following the discovery that sagacious personage had a hundred times repeated with an obstructive shake of the head no thoroughfare sir no thoroughfare my belief is that there is no way out of this at this time of day and my advice is make yourself comfortable where you are in the course of the protracted consultation a magnum of the forty five year old port wine had been produced for the wetting of mr bintrey's legal whistle but the more clearly he saw his way through the wine the more emphatically he did not see his way through the case repeating as often as he set his glass down empty mr wilding no thoroughfare rest and be thankful it is certain that the honest wine merchant's anxiety to make a will originated in profound conscientiousness though it is possible and quite consistent with his rectitude that he may unconsciously have derived some feeling of relief from the prospect of delegating his own difficulty to two other men who were to come after him be that as it may he pursued his new track of thought with great ardour and lost no time in begging george vendale and mr bintrey to meet him in cripple corner and share his confidence being all three assembled with closed doors said mr bintrey addressing the new partner on the occasion i wish to observe before our friend and my client entrusts us with his further views that i have endorsed what i understand from him to have been your advice mr vendale and what would be the advice of every sensible man i have told him that he positively must keep his secret i have spoken with mrs goldstraw both in his presence and in his absence and if anybody is to be trusted which is a very large if i think she is to be trusted to that extent i have pointed out to our friend and my client that to set on foot random inquiries would not only be to raise the devil in the likeness of all the swindlers in the kingdom but would also be to waste the estate now you see mr vendale our friend and my client does not desire to waste the estate but on the contrary desires to husband it for what he considers but i can't say i do the rightful owner if such rightful owner should ever be found i am very much mistaken if he ever will be but never mind that mr wilding and i are at least agreed that the estate is not to be wasted now i have yielded to mr wilding's desire to keep an advertisement at intervals flowing through the newspapers cautiously inviting any person who may know anything about that adopted infant taken from the foundling hospital to come to my office and i have pledged myself that such advertisement shall regularly appear i have gathered from our friend and my client that i meet you here to day to take his instructions not to give him advice i am prepared to receive his instructions and to respect his wishes but you will please observe that this does not imply my approval of either as a matter of professional opinion thus mr bintrey talking quite is much at wilding as to vendale and yet in spite of his care for his client he was so amused by his client's quixotic conduct as to eye him from time to time with twinkling eyes in the light of a highly comical curiosity nothing observed wilding can be clearer i only wish my head were as clear as yours mr bintrey if you feel that singing in it coming on hinted the lawyer with an alarmed glance put it off i mean the interview not at all i thank you said wilding what was i going to don't excite yourself mr wilding urged the lawyer no i wasn't going to said the wine merchant mr bintrey and george vendale would you have any hesitation or objection to become my joint trustees and executors or can you at once consent i consent replied george vendale readily i consent said bintrey not so readily thank you both mr bintrey my instructions for my last will and testament are short and plain perhaps you will now have the goodness to take them down i leave the whole of my real and personal estate without any exception or reservation whatsoever to you two my joint trustees and executors in trust to pay over the whole to the true walter wilding if he shall be found and identified within two years after the day of my death failing that in trust to you two to pay over the whole as a benefaction and legacy to the foundling hospital those are all your instructions are they mr wilding demanded bintrey after a blank silence during which nobody had looked at anybody the whole and as to those instructions you have absolutely made up your mind mr wilding absolutely decidedly finally it only remains said the lawyer with one shrug of his shoulders to get them into technical and binding form and to execute and attest now does that press is there any hurry about it you are not going to die yet sir mr bintrey answered wilding gravely when i am going to die is within other knowledge than yours or mine i shall be glad to have this matter off my mind if you please we are lawyer and client again rejoined bintrey who for the nonce had become almost sympathetic if this day week here at the same hour will suit mr vendale and yourself i will enter in my diary that i attend you accordingly the appointment was made and in due sequence kept the will was formally signed sealed delivered and witnessed and was carried off by mr bintrey for safe storage among the papers of his clients ranged in their respective iron boxes with their respective owners' names outside on iron tiers in his consulting room as if that legal sanctuary were a condensed family vault of clients with more heart than he had lately had for former subjects of interest wilding then set about completing his patriarchal establishment being much assisted not only by mrs goldstraw but by vendale too who perhaps had in his mind the giving of an obenreizer dinner as soon as possible anyhow the establishment being reported in sound working order the obenreizers guardian and ward were asked to dinner and madame dor was included in the invitation if vendale had been over head and ears in love before a phrase not to be taken as implying the faintest doubt about it this dinner plunged him down in love ten thousand fathoms deep yet for the life of him he could not get one word alone with charming marguerite so surely as a blessed moment seemed to come obenreizer in his filmy state would stand at vendale's elbow or the broad back of madame dor would appear before his eyes that speechless matron was never seen in a front view from the moment of her arrival to that of her departure except at dinner and from the instant of her retirement to the drawing room after a hearty participation in that meal she turned her face to the wall again yet through four or five delightful though distracting hours marguerite was to be seen marguerite was to be heard marguerite was to be occasionally touched when they made the round of the old dark cellars vendale led her by the hand when she sang to him in the lighted room at night vendale standing by her held her relinquished gloves and would have bartered against them every drop of the forty five year old though it had been forty five times forty five years old and its nett price forty five times forty five pounds per dozen and still when she was gone and a great gap of an extinguisher was clapped on cripple corner he tormented himself by wondering did she think that he admired her did she think that he adored her did she suspect that she had won him heart and soul did she care to think at all about it and so did she and didn't she up and down the gamut and above the line and below the line dear dear poor restless heart of humanity to think that the men who were mummies thousands of years ago did the same and ever found the secret how to be quiet after it what do you think george wilding asked him next day of mr obenreizer i won't ask you what you think of miss obenreizer i don't know said vendale and i never did know what to think of him he is well informed and clever said wilding certainly clever a good musician he had played very well and sung very well overnight unquestionably a good musician and talks well yes said george vendale ruminating and talks well do you know wilding it oddly occurs to me as i think about him that he doesn't keep silence well how do you mean he is not obtrusively talkative no and i don't mean that but when he is silent you can hardly help vaguely though perhaps most unjustly mistrusting him take people whom you know and like take any one you know and like soon done my good fellow said wilding i take you i didn't bargain for that or foresee it returned vendale laughing however take me reflect for a moment is your approving knowledge of my interesting face mainly founded however various the momentary expressions it may include on my face when i am silent i think it is said wilding i think so too now you see when obenreizer speaks in other words when he is allowed to explain himself away he comes out right enough but when he has not the opportunity of explaining himself away he comes out rather wrong therefore it is that i say he does not keep silence well and passing hastily in review such faces as i know and don't trust i am inclined to think now i give my mind to it that none of them keep silence well this proposition in physiognomy being new to wilding he was at first slow to admit it until asking himself the question whether mrs goldstraw kept silence well and remembering that her face in repose decidedly invited trustfulness he was as glad as men usually are to believe what they desire to believe but as he was very slow to regain his spirits or his health his partner as another means of setting him up and perhaps also with contingent obenreizer views reminded him of those musical schemes of his in connection with his family and how a singing class was to be formed in the house and a choir in a neighbouring church the class was established speedily and two or three of the people having already some musical knowledge and singing tolerably the choir soon followed the latter was led and chiefly taught by wilding himself who had hopes of converting his dependents into so many foundlings in respect of their capacity to sing sacred choruses now the obenreizers being skilled musicians it was easily brought to pass that they should be asked to join these musical unions guardian and ward consenting or guardian consenting for both it was necessarily brought to pass that vendale's life became a life of absolute thraldom and enchantment for in the mouldy christopher wren church on sundays with its dearly beloved brethren assembled and met together five and twenty strong was not that her voice that shot like light into the darkest places thrilling the walls and pillars as though they were pieces of his heart what time too madame dor in a corner of the high pew turning her back upon everybody and everything could not fail to be ritualistically right at some moment of the service like the man whom the doctors recommended to get drunk once a month and who that he might not overlook it got drunk every day but even those seraphic sundays were surpassed by the wednesday concerts established for the patriarchal family at those concerts she would sit down to the piano and sing them in her own tongue songs of her own land songs calling from the mountain tops to vendale rise above the grovelling level country come far away from the crowd pursue me as i mount higher higher higher melting into the azure distance rise to my supremest height of all and love me here then would the pretty bodice the clocked stocking and the silver buckled shoe be like the broad forehead and the bright eyes fraught with the spring of a very chamois until the strain was over not even over vendale himself did these songs of hers cast a more potent spell than over joey ladle in his different way steadily refusing to muddle the harmony by taking any share in it and evincing the supremest contempt for scales and such like rudiments of music which indeed seldom captivate mere listeners joey did at first give up the whole business for a bad job and the whole of the performers for a set of howling dervishes but descrying traces of unmuddled harmony in a part song one day he gave his two under cellarmen faint hopes of getting on towards something in course of time an anthem of handel's led to further encouragement from him though he objected that that great musician must have been down in some of them foreign cellars pretty much for to go and say the same thing so many times over which took it in how you might he considered a certain sign of your having took it in somehow on a third occasion the public appearance of mr jarvis with a flute and of an odd man with a violin and the performance of a duet by the two did so astonish him that solely of his own impulse and motion he became inspired with the words ann koar repeatedly pronouncing them as if calling in a familiar manner for some lady who had distinguished herself in the orchestra but this was his final testimony to the merits of his mates for the instrumental duet being performed at the first wednesday concert and being presently followed by the voice of marguerite obenreizer he sat with his mouth wide open entranced until she had finished when rising in his place with much solemnity and prefacing what he was about to say with a bow that specially included mr wilding in it he delivered himself of the gratifying sentiment arter that ye may all on ye get to bed and ever afterwards declined to render homage in any other words to the musical powers of the family thus began a separate personal acquaintance between marguerite obenreizer and joey ladle she laughed so heartily at his compliment and yet was so abashed by it that joey made bold to say to her after the concert was over he hoped he wasn't so muddled in his head as to have took a liberty she made him a gracious reply and joey ducked in return you'll change the luck time about miss said joey ducking again it's such as you in the place that can bring round the luck of the place can i round the luck she answered in her pretty english and with a pretty wonder i fear i do not understand i am so stupid young master wilding miss joey explained confidentially though not much to her enlightenment changed the luck afore he took in young master george so i say and so they'll find lord only come into the place and sing over the luck a few times miss and it won't be able to help itself with this and with a whole brood of ducks joey backed out of the presence but joey being a privileged person and even an involuntary conquest being pleasant to youth and beauty marguerite merrily looked out for him next time where is my mr joey please she asked vendale so joey was produced and shaken hands with and that became an institution another institution arose in this wise joey was a little hard of hearing he himself said it was wapours and perhaps it might have been but whatever the cause of the effect there the effect was upon him on this first occasion he had been seen to sidle along the wall with his left hand to his left ear until he had sidled himself into a seat pretty near the singer in which place and position he had remained until addressing to his friends the amateurs the compliment before mentioned it was observed on the following wednesday that joey's action as a pecking machine was impaired at dinner and it was rumoured about the table that this was explainable by his high strung expectations of miss obenreizer's singing and his fears of not getting a place where he could hear every note and syllable the rumour reaching wilding's ears he in his good nature called joey to the front at night before marguerite began thus the institution came into being that on succeeding nights marguerite running her hands over the keys before singing always said to vendale where is my mr joey please and that vendale always brought him forth and stationed him near by that he should then when all eyes were upon him express in his face the utmost contempt for the exertions of his friends and confidence in marguerite alone whom he would stand contemplating not unlike the rhinocerous out of the spelling book tamed and on his hind legs was a part of the institution also that when he remained after the singing in his most ecstatic state some bold spirit from the back should say what do you think of it joey and he should be goaded to reply as having that instant conceived the retort arter that ye may all on ye get to bed these were other parts of the institution but the simple pleasures and small jests of cripple corner were not destined to have a long life underlying them from the first was a serious matter which every member of the patriarchal family knew of but which by tacit agreement all forbore to speak of mr wilding's health was in a bad way he might have overcome the shock he had sustained in the one great affection of his life or he might have overcome his consciousness of being in the enjoyment of another man's property but the two together were too much for him a man haunted by twin ghosts he became deeply depressed the inseparable spectres sat at the board with him ate from his platter drank from his cup and stood by his bedside at night when he recalled his supposed mother's love he felt as though he had stolen it when he rallied a little under the respect and attachment of his dependants he felt as though he were even fraudulent in making them happy for that should have been the unknown man's duty and gratification gradually under the pressure of his brooding mind his body stooped his step lost its elasticity his eyes were seldom lifted from the ground he knew he could not help the deplorable mistake that had been made but he knew he could not mend it for the days and weeks went by and no one claimed his name or his possessions and now there began to creep over him a cloudy consciousness of often recurring confusion in his head he would unaccountably lose sometimes whole hours sometimes a whole day and night once his remembrance stopped as he sat at the head of the dinner table and was blank until daybreak another time it stopped as he was beating time to their singing and went on again when he and his partner were walking in the court yard by the light of the moon half the night later he asked vendale always full of consideration work and help how this was vendale only replied you have not been quite well that's all he looked for explanation into the faces of his people but they would put it off with glad to see you looking so much better sir or hope you're doing nicely now sir in which was no information at all at length when the partnership was but five months old walter wilding took to his bed and his housekeeper became his nurse lying here perhaps you will not mind my calling you sally mrs goldstraw said the poor wine merchant it sounds more natural to me sir than any other name and i like it better thank you sally i think sally i must of late have been subject to fits is that so sally don't mind telling me now it has happened sir ah that is the explanation he quietly remarked mr obenreizer sally talks of the world being so small that it is not strange how often the same people come together and come together at various places and in various stages of life but it does seem strange sally that i should as i may say come round to the foundling to die he extended his hand to her and she gently took it you are not going to die dear mr wilding so mr bintrey said but i think he was wrong the old child feeling is coming back upon me sally the old hush and rest as i used to fall asleep after an interval he said in a placid voice please kiss me nurse and it was evident believed himself to be lying in the old dormitory as she had been used to bend over the fatherless and motherless children sally bent over the fatherless and motherless man and put her lips to his forehead murmuring god bless you god bless you he replied in the same tone after another interval he opened his eyes in his own character and said don't move me sally because of what i am going to say i lie quite easily i think my time is come i don't know how it may appear to you sally but insensibility fell upon him for a few minutes he emerged from it once more i don't know how it may appear to you sally but so it appears to me when he had thus conscientiously finished his favourite sentence his time came and he died act ii vendale makes love the summer and the autumn passed christmas and the new year were at hand as executors honestly bent on performing their duty towards the dead vendale and bintrey had held more than one anxious consultation on the subject of wilding's will the lawyer had declared from the first that it was simply impossible to take any useful action in the matter at all the only obvious inquiries to make in relation to the lost man had been made already by wilding himself with this result that time and death together had not left a trace of him discoverable to advertise for the claimant to the property it would be necessary to mention particulars a course of proceeding which would invite half the impostors in england to present themselves in the character of the true walter wilding if we find a chance of tracing the lost man we will take it if we don't let us meet for another consultation on the first anniversary of wilding's death so bintrey advised and so with the most earnest desire to fulfil his dead friend's wishes vendale was fain to let the matter rest for the present turning from his interest in the past to his interest in the future vendale still found himself confronting a doubtful prospect months on months had passed since his first visit to soho square and through all that time the one language in which he had told marguerite that he loved her was the language of the eyes assisted at convenient opportunities by the language of the hand what was the obstacle in his way the one immovable obstacle which had been in his way from the first no matter how fairly the opportunities looked vendale's efforts to speak with marguerite alone ended invariably in one and the same result under the most accidental circumstances in the most innocent manner possible obenreizer was always in the way with the last days of the old year came an unexpected chance of spending an evening with marguerite which vendale resolved should be a chance of speaking privately to her as well a cordial note from obenreizer invited him on new year's day to a little family dinner in soho square we shall be only four the note said we shall be only two vendale determined before the evening is out new year's day among the english is associated with the giving and receiving of dinners and with nothing more new year's day among the foreigners is the grand opportunity of the year for the giving and receiving of presents it is occasionally possible to acclimatise a foreign custom in this instance vendale felt no hesitation about making the attempt his one difficulty was to decide what his new year's gift to marguerite should be the defensive pride of the peasant's daughter morbidly sensitive to the inequality between her social position and his would be secretly roused against him if he ventured on a rich offering a gift which a poor man's purse might purchase was the one gift that could be trusted to find its way to her heart for the giver's sake stoutly resisting temptation in the form of diamonds and rubies vendale bought a brooch of the filagree work of genoa the simplest and most unpretending ornament that he could find in the jeweller's shop he slipped his gift into marguerite's hand as she held it out to welcome him on the day of the dinner this is your first new year's day in england he said will you let me help to make it like a new year's day at home she thanked him a little constrainedly as she looked at the jeweller's box uncertain what it might contain opening the box and discovering the studiously simple form under which vendale's little keepsake offered itself to her she penetrated his motive on the spot her face turned on him brightly with a look which said i own you have pleased and flattered me never had she been so charming in vendale's eyes as she was at that moment her winter dress a petticoat of dark silk with a bodice of black velvet rising to her neck and enclosing it softly in a little circle of swansdown heightened by all the force of contrast the dazzling fairness of her hair and her complexion it was only when she turned aside from him to the glass and taking out the brooch that she wore put his new year's gift in its place that vendale's attention wandered far enough away from her to discover the presence of other persons in the room he now became conscious that the hands of obenreizer were affectionately in possession of his elbows he now heard the voice of obenreizer thanking him for his attention to marguerite with the faintest possible ring of mockery in its tone such a simple present dear sir and showing such nice tact he now discovered for the first time that there was one other guest and but one besides himself whom obenreizer presented as a compatriot and friend the friend's face was mouldy and the friend's figure was fat his age was suggestive of the autumnal period of human life in the course of the evening he developed two extraordinary capacities one was a capacity for silence the other was a capacity for emptying bottles madame dor was not in the room neither was there any visible place reserved for her when they sat down to table obenreizer explained that it was the good dor's simple habit to dine always in the middle of the day she would make her excuses later in the evening vendale wondered whether the good dor had on this occasion varied her domestic employment from cleaning obenreizer's gloves to cooking obenreizer's dinner this at least was certain the dishes served were one and all as achievements in cookery high above the reach of the rude elementary art of england the dinner was unobtrusively perfect as for the wine the eyes of the speechless friend rolled over it as in solemn ecstasy sometimes he said good when a bottle came in full and sometimes he said ah when a bottle went out empty and there his contributions to the gaiety of the evening ended silence is occasionally infectious oppressed by private anxieties of their own marguerite and vendale appeared to feel the influence of the speechless friend the whole responsibility of keeping the talk going rested on obenreizer's shoulders and manfully did obenreizer sustain it he opened his heart in the character of an enlightened foreigner and sang the praises of england when other topics ran dry he returned to this inexhaustible source and always set the stream running again as copiously as ever obenreizer would have given an arm an eye or a leg to have been born an englishman out of england there was no such institution as a home no such thing as a fireside no such object as a beautiful woman his dear miss marguerite would excuse him if he accounted for her attractions on the theory that english blood must have mixed at some former time with their obscure and unknown ancestry survey this english nation and behold a tall clean plump and solid people look at their cities what magnificence in their public buildings what admirable order and propriety in their streets admire their laws combining the eternal principle of justice with the other eternal principle of pounds shillings and pence and applying the product to all civil injuries from an injury to a man's honour to an injury to a man's nose you have ruined my daughter pounds shillings and pence you have knocked me down with a blow in my face pounds shillings and pence where was the material prosperity of such a country as that to stop obenreizer projecting himself into the future failed to see the end of it obenreizer's enthusiasm entreated permission to exhale itself english fashion in a toast here is our modest little dinner over here is our frugal dessert on the table and here is the admirer of england conforming to national customs and making a speech a toast to your white cliffs of albion mr vendale to your national virtues your charming climate and your fascinating women to your hearths to your homes to your habeas corpus and to all your other institutions in one word to england heep heep heep hooray obenreizer's voice had barely chanted the last note of the english cheer the speechless friend had barely drained the last drop out of his glass when the festive proceedings were interrupted by a modest tap at the door a woman servant came in and approached her master with a little note in her hand obenreizer opened the note with a frown and after reading it with an expression of genuine annoyance passed it on to his compatriot and friend vendale's spirits rose as he watched these proceedings had he found an ally in the annoying little note was the long looked for chance actually coming at last i am afraid there is no help for it said obenreizer addressing his fellow countryman i am afraid we must go the speechless friend handed back the letter shrugged his heavy shoulders and poured himself out a last glass of wine his fat fingers lingered fondly round the neck of the bottle they pressed it with a little amatory squeeze at parting his globular eyes looked dimly as through an intervening haze at vendale and marguerite his heavy articulation laboured and brought forth a whole sentence at a birth i think he said i should have liked a little more wine his breath failed him after that effort he gasped and walked to the door obenreizer addressed himself to vendale with an appearance of the deepest distress i am so shocked so confused so distressed he began a misfortune has happened to one of my compatriots he is alone he is ignorant of your language i and my good friend here have no choice but to go and help him what can i say in my excuse how can i describe my affliction at depriving myself in this way of the honour of your company he paused evidently expecting to see vendale take up his hat and retire discerning his opportunity at last vendale determined to do nothing of the kind he met obenreizer dexterously with obenreizer's own weapons pray don't distress yourself he said i'll wait here with the greatest pleasure till you come back marguerite blushed deeply and turned away to her embroidery frame in a corner by the window the film showed itself in obenreizer's eyes and the smile came something sourly to obenreizer's lips to have told vendale that there was no reasonable prospect of his coming back in good time would have been to risk offending a man whose favourable opinion was of solid commercial importance to him accepting his defeat with the best possible grace he declared himself to be equally honoured and delighted by vendale's proposal so frank so friendly so english he bustled about apparently looking for something he wanted disappeared for a moment through the folding doors communicating with the next room came back with his hat and coat and protesting that he would return at the earliest possible moment embraced vendale's elbows and vanished from the scene in company with the speechless friend vendale turned to the corner by the window in which marguerite had placed herself with her work there as if she had dropped from the ceiling or come up through the floor there in the old attitude with her face to the stove sat an obstacle that had not been foreseen in the person of madame dor she half got up half looked over her broad shoulder at vendale and plumped down again was she at work yes cleaning obenreizer's gloves as before no darning obenreizer's stockings the case was now desperate two serious considerations presented themselves to vendale was it possible to put madame dor into the stove the stove wouldn't hold her was it possible to treat madame dor not as a living woman but as an article of furniture could the mind be brought to contemplate this respectable matron purely in the light of a chest of drawers with a black gauze held dress accidentally left on the top of it yes the mind could be brought to do that with a comparatively trifling effort vendale's mind did it as he took his place on the old fashioned window seat close by marguerite and her embroidery a slight movement appeared in the chest of drawers but no remark issued from it let it be remembered that solid furniture is not easy to move and that it has this advantage in consequence there is no fear of upsetting it unusually silent and unusually constrained with the bright colour fast fading from her face with a feverish energy possessing her fingers the pretty marguerite bent over her embroidery and worked as if her life depended on it hardly less agitated himself vendale felt the importance of leading her very gently to the avowal which he was eager to make to the other sweeter avowal still which he was longing to hear a woman's love is never to be taken by storm it yields insensibly to a system of gradual approach it ventures by the roundabout way and listens to the low voice vendale led her memory back to their past meetings when they were travelling together in switzerland they revived the impressions they recalled the events of the happy bygone time little by little marguerite's constraint vanished she smiled she was interested she looked at vendale she grew idle with her needle she made false stitches in her work their voices sank lower and lower their faces bent nearer and nearer to each other as they spoke and madame dor madame dor behaved like an angel she never looked round she never said a word she went on with obenreizer's stockings pulling each stocking up tight over her left arm and holding that arm aloft from time to time to catch the light on her work there were moments delicate and indescribable moments when madame dor appeared to be sitting upside down and contemplating one of her own respectable legs elevated in the air as the minutes wore on these elevations followed each other at longer and longer intervals now and again the black gauze head dress nodded dropped forward recovered itself a little heap of stockings slid softly from madame dor's lap and remained unnoticed on the floor a prodigious ball of worsted followed the stockings and rolled lazily under the table the black gauze head dress nodded dropped forward recovered itself nodded again dropped forward again and recovered itself no more a composite sound partly as of the purring of an immense cat partly as of the planing of a soft board rose over the hushed voices of the lovers and hummed at regular intervals through the room nature and madame dor had combined together in vendale's interests the best of women was asleep marguerite rose to stop not the snoring let us say the audible repose of madame dor vendale laid his hand on her arm and pressed her back gently into her chair don't disturb her he whispered i have been waiting to tell you a secret let me tell it now marguerite resumed her seat she tried to resume her needle it was useless her eyes failed her her hand failed her she could find nothing we have been talking said vendale of the happy time when we first met and first travelled together i have a confession to make i have been concealing something when we spoke of my first visit to switzerland i told you of all the impressions i had brought back with me to england except one can you guess what that one is her eyes looked stedfastly at the embroidery and her face turned a little away from him signs of disturbance began to appear in her neat velvet bodice round the region of the brooch she made no reply vendale pressed the question without mercy can you guess what the one swiss impression is which i have not told you yet her face turned back towards him and a faint smile trembled on her lips an impression of the mountains perhaps she said slyly no a much more precious impression than that of the lakes no the lakes have not grown dearer and dearer in remembrance to me every day the lakes are not associated with my happiness in the present and my hopes in the future marguerite all that makes life worth having hangs for me on a word from your lips marguerite i love you her head drooped as he took her hand he drew her to him and looked at her the tears escaped from her downcast eyes and fell slowly over her cheeks o mr vendale she said sadly it would have been kinder to have kept your secret have you forgotten the distance between us it can never never be there can be but one distance between us marguerite a distance of your making my love my darling there is no higher rank in goodness there is no higher rank in beauty than yours come whisper the one little word which tells me you will be my wife she sighed bitterly think of your family she murmured and think of mine vendale drew her a little nearer to him if you dwell on such an obstacle as that he said i shall think but one thought i shall think i have offended you she started and looked up o no she exclaimed innocently the instant the words passed her lips she saw the construction that might be placed on them her confession had escaped her in spite of herself a lovely flush of colour overspread her face she made a momentary effort to disengage herself from her lover's embrace she looked up at him entreatingly she tried to speak the words died on her lips in the kiss that vendale pressed on them let me go mr vendale she said faintly call me george she laid her head on his bosom all her heart went out to him at last george she whispered say you love me her arms twined themselves gently round his neck her lips timidly touching his cheek murmured the delicious words i love you in the moment of silence that followed the sound of the opening and closing of the house door came clear to them through the wintry stillness of the street marguerite started to her feet let me go she said he has come back she hurried from the room and touched madame dor's shoulder in passing madame dor woke up with a loud snort looked first over one shoulder and then over the other peered down into her lap and discovered neither stockings worsted nor darning needle in it at the same moment footsteps became audible ascending the stairs mon dieu said madame dor addressing herself to the stove and trembling violently vendale picked up the stockings and the ball and huddled them all back in a heap over her shoulder mon dieu said madame dor for the second time as the avalanche of worsted poured into her capacious lap the door opened and obenreizer came in his first glance round the room showed him that marguerite was absent what he exclaimed my niece is away my niece is not here to entertain you in my absence this is unpardonable i shall bring her back instantly vendale stopped him i beg you will not disturb miss obenreizer he said you have returned i see without your friend my friend remains and consoles our afflicted compatriot a heart rending scene mr vendale the household gods at the pawnbroker's the family immersed in tears we all embraced in silence my admirable friend alone possessed his composure he sent out on the spot for a bottle of wine can i say a word to you in private mr obenreizer assuredly he turned to madame dor my good creature you are sinking for want of repose mr vendale will excuse you madame dor rose and set forth sideways on her journey from the stove to bed she dropped a stocking vendale picked it up for her and opened one of the folding doors she advanced a step and dropped three more stockings vendale stooping to recover them as before obenreizer interfered with profuse apologies and with a warning look at madame dor madame dor acknowledged the look by dropping the whole of the stockings in a heap and then shuffling away panic stricken from the scene of disaster obenreizer swept up the complete collection fiercely in both hands go he cried giving his prodigious handful a preparatory swing in the air madame dor said mon dieu and vanished into the next room pursued by a shower of stockings what must you think mr vendale said obenreizer closing the door of this deplorable intrusion of domestic details for myself i blush at it we are beginning the new year as badly as possible everything has gone wrong to night be seated pray and say what may i offer you shall we pay our best respects to another of your noble english institutions it is my study to be what you call jolly i propose a grog vendale declined the grog with all needful respect for that noble institution i wish to speak to you on a subject in which i am deeply interested he said you must have observed mr obenreizer that i have from the first felt no ordinary admiration for your charming niece you are very good in my niece's name i thank you perhaps you may have noticed latterly that my admiration for miss obenreizer has grown into a tenderer and deeper feeling shall we say friendship mr vendale say love and we shall be nearer to the truth obenreizer started out of his chair the faintly discernible beat which was his nearest approach to a change of colour showed itself suddenly in his cheeks you are miss obenreizer's guardian pursued vendale i ask you to confer upon me the greatest of all favours i ask you to give me her hand in marriage obenreizer dropped back into his chair mr vendale he said you petrify me i will wait rejoined vendale until you have recovered yourself one word before i recover myself you have said nothing about this to my niece i have opened my whole heart to your niece and i have reason to hope what interposed obenreizer you have made a proposal to my niece without first asking for my authority to pay your addresses to her he struck his hand on the table and lost his hold over himself for the first time in vendale's experience of him sir he exclaimed indignantly what sort of conduct is this as a man of honour speaking to a man of honour how can you justify it i can only justify it as one of our english institutions said vendale quietly you admire our english institutions i can't honestly tell you mr obenreizer that i regret what i have done i can only assure you that i have not acted in the matter with any intentional disrespect towards yourself this said may i ask you to tell me plainly what objection you see to favouring my suit i see this immense objection answered obenreizer that my niece and you are not on a social equality together my niece is the daughter of a poor peasant and you are the son of a gentleman you do us an honour he added lowering himself again gradually to his customary polite level which deserves and has our most grateful acknowledgments but the inequality is too glaring the sacrifice is too great you english are a proud people mr vendale i have observed enough of this country to see that such a marriage as you propose would be a scandal here not a hand would be held out to your peasant wife and all your best friends would desert you one moment said vendale interposing on his side i may claim without any great arrogance to know more of my country people in general and of my own friends in particular than you do in the estimation of everybody whose opinion is worth having my wife herself would be the one sufficient justification of my marriage if i did not feel certain observe i say certain that i am offering her a position which she can accept without so much as the shadow of a humiliation i would never cost me what it might have asked her to be my wife is there any other obstacle that you see have you any personal objection to me obenreizer spread out both his hands in courteous protest personal objection he exclaimed dear sir the bare question is painful to me we are both men of business pursued vendale and you naturally expect me to satisfy you that i have the means of supporting a wife i can explain my pecuniary position in two words i inherit from my parents a fortune of twenty thousand pounds in half of that sum i have only a life interest to which if i die leaving a widow my widow succeeds if i die leaving children the money itself is divided among them as they come of age the other half of my fortune is at my own disposal and is invested in the wine business i see my way to greatly improving that business as it stands at present i cannot state my return from my capital embarked at more than twelve hundred a year add the yearly value of my life interest and the total reaches a present annual income of fifteen hundred pounds i have the fairest prospect of soon making it more in the meantime do you object to me on pecuniary grounds driven back to his last entrenchment obenreizer rose and took a turn backwards and forwards in the room for the moment he was plainly at a loss what to say or do next before i answer that last question he said after a little close consideration with himself i beg leave to revert for a moment to miss marguerite you said something just now which seemed to imply that she returns the sentiment with which you are pleased to regard her i have the inestimable happiness said vendale of knowing that she loves me obenreizer stood silent for a moment with the film over his eyes and the faintly perceptible beat becoming visible again in his cheeks if you will excuse me for a few minutes he said with ceremonious politeness i should like to have the opportunity of speaking to my niece with those words he bowed and quitted the room left by himself vendale's thoughts as a necessary result of the interview thus far turned instinctively to the consideration of obenreizer's motives he had put obstacles in the way of the courtship he was now putting obstacles in the way of the marriage a marriage offering advantages which even his ingenuity could not dispute on the face of it his conduct was incomprehensible what did it mean seeking under the surface for the answer to that question and remembering that obenreizer was a man of about his own age also that marguerite was strictly speaking his half niece only vendale asked himself with a lover's ready jealousy whether he had a rival to fear as well as a guardian to conciliate the thought just crossed his mind and no more the sense of marguerite's kiss still lingering on his cheek reminded him gently that even the jealousy of a moment was now a treason to her on reflection it seemed most likely that a personal motive of another kind might suggest the true explanation of obenreizer's conduct marguerite's grace and beauty were precious ornaments in that little household they gave it a special social attraction and a special social importance they armed obenreizer with a certain influence in reserve which he could always depend upon to make his house attractive and which he might always bring more or less to bear on the forwarding of his own private ends was he the sort of man to resign such advantages as were here implied without obtaining the fullest possible compensation for the loss a connection by marriage with vendale offered him solid advantages beyond all doubt but there were hundreds of men in london with far greater power and far wider influence than vendale possessed was it possible that this man's ambition secretly looked higher than the highest prospects that could be offered to him by the alliance now proposed for his niece as the question passed through vendale's mind the man himself reappeared to answer it or not to answer it as the event might prove a marked change was visible in obenreizer when he resumed his place his manner was less assured and there were plain traces about his mouth of recent agitation which had not been successfully composed had he said something referring either to vendale or to himself which had raised marguerite's spirit and which had placed him for the first time face to face with a resolute assertion of his niece's will it might or might not be this only was certain he looked like a man who had met with a repulse i have spoken to my niece he began i find mr vendale that even your influence has not entirely blinded her to the social objections to your proposal may i ask returned vendale if that is the only result of your interview with miss obenreizer a momentary flash leapt out through the obenreizer film you are master of the situation he answered in a tone of sardonic submission if you insist on my admitting it i do admit it in those words my niece's will and mine used to be one mr vendale you have come between us and her will is now yours in my country we know when we are beaten and we submit with our best grace i submit with my best grace on certain conditions let us revert to the statement of your pecuniary position i have an objection to you my dear sir a most amazing a most audacious objection from a man in my position to a man in yours what is it you have honoured me by making a proposal for my niece's hand for the present with best thanks and respects i beg to decline it why because you are not rich enough the objection as the speaker had foreseen took vendale completely by surprise for the moment he was speechless your income is fifteen hundred a year pursued obenreizer in my miserable country i should fall on my knees before your income and say 'what a princely fortune' in wealthy england i sit as i am and say 'a modest independence dear sir nothing more enough perhaps for a wife in your own rank of life who has no social prejudices to conquer not more than half enough for a wife who is a meanly born foreigner and who has all your social prejudices against her' sir if my niece is ever to marry you she will have what you call uphill work of it in taking her place at starting yes yes this is not your view but it remains immovably remains my view for all that for my niece's sake i claim that this uphill work shall be made as smooth as possible whatever material advantages she can have to help her ought in common justice to be hers now tell me mr vendale on your fifteen hundred a year can your wife have a house in a fashionable quarter a footman to open her door a butler to wait at her table and a carriage and horses to drive about in i see the answer in your face your face says no very good tell me one more thing and i have done take the mass of your educated accomplished and lovely country women is it or is it not the fact that a lady who has a house in a fashionable quarter a footman to open her door a butler to wait at her table and a carriage and horses to drive about in is a lady who has gained four steps in female estimation at starting yes or no come to the point said vendale you view this question as a question of terms what are your terms the lowest terms dear sir on which you can provide your wife with those four steps at starting double your present income the most rigid economy cannot do it in england on less you said just now that you expected greatly to increase the value of your business to work and increase it i am a good devil after all on the day when you satisfy me by plain proofs that your income has risen to three thousand a year ask me for my niece's hand and it is yours may i inquire if you have mentioned this arrangement to miss obenreizer certainly she has a last little morsel of regard still left for me mr vendale which is not yours yet and she accepts my terms in other words she submits to be guided by her guardian's regard for her welfare and by her guardian's superior knowledge of the world he threw himself back in his chair in firm reliance on his position and in full possession of his excellent temper any open assertion of his own interests in the situation in which vendale was now placed seemed to be for the present at least hopeless he found himself literally left with no ground to stand on whether obenreizer's objections were the genuine product of obenreizer's own view of the case or whether he was simply delaying the marriage in the hope of ultimately breaking it off altogether in either of these events any present resistance on vendale's part would be equally useless there was no help for it but to yield making the best terms that he could on his own side i protest against the conditions you impose on me he began naturally said obenreizer i dare say i should protest myself in your place say however pursued vendale that i accept your terms in that case i must be permitted to make two stipulations on my part in the first place i shall expect to be allowed to see your niece aha to see my niece and to make her in as great a hurry to be married as you are yourself suppose i say no you would see her perhaps without my permission decidedly how delightfully frank how exquisitely english you shall see her mr vendale on certain days which we will appoint together what next your objection to my income proceeded vendale has taken me completely by surprise i wish to be assured against any repetition of that surprise your present views of my qualification for marriage require me to have an income of three thousand a year can i be certain in the future as your experience of england enlarges that your estimate will rise no higher in plain english said obenreizer you doubt my word do you purpose to take my word for it when i inform you that i have doubled my income asked vendale if my memory does not deceive me you stipulated a minute since for plain proofs well played mr vendale you combine the foreign quickness with the english solidity accept my best congratulations accept also my written guarantee he rose seated himself at a writing desk at a side table wrote a few lines and presented them to vendale with a low bow the engagement was perfectly explicit and was signed and dated with scrupulous care are you satisfied with your guarantee i am satisfied charmed to hear it i am sure we have had our little skirmish we have really been wonderfully clever on both sides for the present our affairs are settled i bear no malice you bear no malice come mr vendale a good english shake hands vendale gave his hand a little bewildered by obenreizer's sudden transitions from one humour to another when may i expect to see miss obenreizer again he asked as he rose to go honour me with a visit to morrow said obenreizer and we will settle it then do have a grog before you go no well well we will reserve the grog till you have your three thousand a year and are ready to be married aha when will that be i made an estimate some months since of the capacities of my business said vendale if that estimate is correct i shall double my present income and be married added obenreizer and be married repeated vendale within a year from this time good night vendale makes mischief when vendale entered his office the next morning the dull commercial routine at cripple corner met him with a new face marguerite had an interest in it now the whole machinery which wilding's death had set in motion to realise the value of the business the balancing of ledgers the estimating of debts the taking of stock and the rest of it was now transformed into machinery which indicated the chances for and against a speedy marriage after looking over results as presented by his accountant and checking additions and subtractions as rendered by the clerks vendale turned his attention to the stock taking department next and sent a message to the cellars desiring to see the report the cellarman's appearance the moment he put his head in at the door of his master's private room suggested that something very extraordinary must have happened that morning there was an approach to alacrity in joey ladle's movements there was something which actually simulated cheerfulness in joey ladle's face what's the matter asked vendale anything wrong i should wish to mention one thing answered joey young mr vendale i have never set myself up for a prophet who ever said you did no prophet as far as i've heard i tell of that profession proceeded joey ever lived principally underground no prophet whatever else he might take in at the pores ever took in wine from morning to night for a number of years together when i said to young master wilding respecting his changing the name of the firm that one of these days he might find he'd changed the luck of the firm did i put myself forward as a prophet no i didn't has what i said to him come true yes it has in the time of pebbleson nephew young mr vendale no such thing was ever known as a mistake made in a consignment delivered at these doors there's a mistake been made now please to remark that it happened before miss margaret came here for which reason it don't go against what i've said respecting miss margaret singing round the luck read that sir concluded joey pointing attention to a special passage in the report with a forefinger which appeared to be in process of taking in through the pores nothing more remarkable than dirt it's foreign to my nature to crow over the house i serve but i feel it a kind of solemn duty to ask you to read that vendale read as follows note respecting the swiss champagne an irregularity has been discovered in the last consignment received from the firm of defresnier and co vendale stopped and referred to a memorandum book by his side that was in mr wilding's time he said the vintage was a particularly good one and he took the whole of it the swiss champagne has done very well hasn't it i don't say it's done badly answered the cellarman it may have got sick in our customers' bins or it may have bust in our customers' hands but i don't say it's done badly with us vendale resumed the reading of the note we find the number of the cases to be quite correct by the books but six of them which present a slight difference from the rest in the brand have been opened and have been found to contain a red wine instead of champagne the similarity in the brands we suppose caused a mistake to be made in sending the consignment from neuchatel the error has not been found to extend beyond six cases is that all exclaimed vendale tossing the note away from him joey ladle's eye followed the flying morsel of paper drearily i'm glad to see you take it easy sir he said whatever happens it will be always a comfort to you to remember that you took it easy at first sometimes one mistake leads to another a man drops a bit of orange peel on the pavement by mistake and another man treads on it by mistake and there's a job at the hospital and a party crippled for life i'm glad you take it easy sir in pebbleson nephew's time we shouldn't have taken it easy till we had seen the end of it without desiring to crow over the house young mr vendale i wish you well through it no offence sir said the cellarman opening the door to go out and looking in again ominously before he shut it i'm muddled and molloncolly i grant you but i'm an old servant of pebbleson nephew and i wish you well through them six cases of red wine left by himself vendale laughed and took up his pen i may as well send a line to defresnier and company he thought before i forget it he wrote at once in these terms dear sirs we are taking stock and a trifling mistake has been discovered in the last consignment of champagne sent by your house to ours six of the cases contain red wine which we hereby return to you the matter can easily be set right either by your sending us six cases of the champagne if they can be produced or if not by your crediting us with the value of six cases on the amount last paid five hundred pounds by our firm to yours your faithful servants wilding and co this letter despatched to the post the subject dropped at once out of vendale's mind he had other and far more interesting matters to think of later in the day he paid the visit to obenreizer which had been agreed on between them certain evenings in the week were set apart which he was privileged to spend with marguerite always however in the presence of a third person on this stipulation obenreizer politely but positively insisted the one concession he made was to give vendale his choice of who the third person should be confiding in past experience his choice fell unhesitatingly upon the excellent woman who mended obenreizer's stockings on hearing of the responsibility entrusted to her madame dor's intellectual nature burst suddenly into a new stage of development she waited till obenreizer's eye was off her and then she looked at vendale and dimly winked the time passed the happy evenings with marguerite came and went it was the tenth morning since vendale had written to the swiss firm when the answer appeared on his desk with the other letters of the day dear sirs we beg to offer our excuses for the little mistake which has happened at the same time we regret to add that the statement of our error with which you have favoured us has led to a very unexpected discovery the affair is a most serious one for you and for us the particulars are as follows having no more champagne of the vintage last sent to you we made arrangements to credit your firm to the value of six cases as suggested by yourself on taking this step certain forms observed in our mode of doing business necessitated a reference to our bankers' book as well as to our ledger the result is a moral certainty that no such remittance as you mention can have reached our house and a literal certainty that no such remittance has been paid to our account at the bank it is needless at this stage of the proceedings to trouble you with details the money has unquestionably been stolen in the course of its transit from you to us certain peculiarities which we observe relating to the manner in which the fraud has been perpetrated lead us to conclude that the thief may have calculated on being able to pay the missing sum to our bankers before an inevitable discovery followed the annual striking of our balance this would not have happened in the usual course for another three months during that period but for your letter we might have remained perfectly unconscious of the robbery that has been committed we mention this last circumstance as it may help to show you that we have to do in this case with no ordinary thief thus far we have not even a suspicion of who that thief is but we believe you will assist us in making some advance towards discovery by examining the receipt forged of course which has no doubt purported to come to you from our house be pleased to look and see whether it is a receipt entirely in manuscript or whether it is a numbered and printed form which merely requires the filling in of the amount the settlement of this apparently trivial question is we assure you a matter of vital importance anxiously awaiting your reply we remain with high esteem and consideration defresnier cie vendale had the letter on his desk and waited a moment to steady his mind under the shock that had fallen on it at the time of all others when it was most important to him to increase the value of his business that business was threatened with a loss of five hundred pounds he thought of marguerite as he took the key from his pocket and opened the iron chamber in the wall in which the books and papers of the firm were kept he was still in the chamber searching for the forged receipt when he was startled by a voice speaking close behind him a thousand pardons said the voice i am afraid i disturb you he turned and found himself face to face with marguerite's guardian i have called pursued obenreizer to know if i can be of any use business of my own takes me away for some days to manchester and liverpool can i combine any business of yours with it i am entirely at your disposal in the character of commercial traveller for the firm of wilding and co excuse me for one moment said vendale i will speak to you directly he turned round again and continued his search among the papers you come at a time when friendly offers are more than usually precious to me he resumed i have had very bad news this morning from neuchatel bad news exclaimed obenreizer from defresnier and company yes a remittance we sent to them has been stolen i am threatened with a loss of five hundred pounds what's that turning sharply and looking into the room for the second time vendale discovered his envelope case overthrown on the floor and obenreizer on his knees picking up the contents all my awkwardness said obenreizer this dreadful news of yours startled me i stepped back he became too deeply interested in collecting the scattered envelopes to finish the sentence don't trouble yourself said vendale the clerk will pick the things up this dreadful news repeated obenreizer persisting in collecting the envelopes this dreadful news if you will read the letter said vendale you will find i have exaggerated nothing there it is open on my desk he resumed his search and in a moment more discovered the forged receipt it was on the numbered and printed form described by the swiss firm vendale made a memorandum of the number and the date having replaced the receipt and locked up the iron chamber he had leisure to notice obenreizer reading the letter in the recess of a window at the far end of the room come to the fire said vendale you look perished with the cold out there i will ring for some more coals obenreizer rose and came slowly back to the desk marguerite will be as sorry to hear of this as i am he said kindly what do you mean to do i am in the hands of defresnier and company answered vendale in my total ignorance of the circumstances i can only do what they recommend the receipt which i have just found turns out to be the numbered and printed form they seem to attach some special importance to its discovery you have had experience when you were in the swiss house of their way of doing business can you guess what object they have in view obenreizer offered a suggestion suppose i examine the receipt he said are you ill asked vendale startled by the change in his face which now showed itself plainly for the first time pray go to the fire you seem to be shivering i hope you are not going to be ill not i said obenreizer perhaps i have caught cold your english climate might have spared an admirer of your english institutions let me look at the receipt vendale opened the iron chamber obenreizer took a chair and drew it close to the fire he held both hands over the flames let me look at the receipt he repeated eagerly as vendale reappeared with the paper in his hand at the same moment a porter entered the room with a fresh supply of coals vendale told him to make a good fire the man obeyed the order with a disastrous alacrity as he stepped forward and raised the scuttle his foot caught in a fold of the rug and he discharged his entire cargo of coals into the grate the result was an instant smothering of the flame and the production of a stream of yellow smoke without a visible morsel of fire to account for it imbecile whispered obenreizer to himself with a look at the man which the man remembered for many a long day afterwards will you come into the clerks' room asked vendale they have a stove there no no no matter vendale handed him the receipt obenreizer's interest in examining it appeared to have been quenched as suddenly and as effectually as the fire itself he just glanced over the document and said no i don't understand it i am sorry to be of no use i will write to neuchatel by to night's post said vendale putting away the receipt for the second time we must wait and see what comes of it by to night's post repeated obenreizer let me see you will get the answer in eight or nine days' time i shall be back before that if i can be of any service as commercial traveller perhaps you will let me know between this and then you will send me written instructions my best thanks i shall be most anxious for your answer from neuchatel who knows it may be a mistake my dear friend after all courage courage courage he had entered the room with no appearance of being pressed for time he now snatched up his hat and took his leave with the air of a man who had not another moment to lose left by himself vendale took a turn thoughtfully in the room his previous impression of obenreizer was shaken by what he had heard and seen at the interview which had just taken place he was disposed for the first time to doubt whether in this case he had not been a little hasty and hard in his judgment on another man obenreizer's surprise and regret on hearing the news from neuchatel bore the plainest marks of being honestly felt not politely assumed for the occasion with troubles of his own to encounter suffering to all appearance from the first insidious attack of a serious illness he had looked and spoken like a man who really deplored the disaster that had fallen on his friend hitherto vendale had tried vainly to alter his first opinion of marguerite's guardian for marguerite's sake all the generous instincts in his nature now combined together and shook the evidence which had seemed unanswerable up to this time who knows he thought i may have read that man's face wrongly after all the time passed the happy evenings with marguerite came and went it was again the tenth morning since vendale had written to the swiss firm and again the answer appeared on his desk with the other letters of the day dear sir my senior partner m defresnier has been called away by urgent business to milan in his absence and with his full concurrence and authority i now write to you again on the subject of the missing five hundred pounds your discovery that the forged receipt is executed upon one of our numbered and printed forms has caused inexpressible surprise and distress to my partner and to myself at the time when your remittance was stolen but three keys were in existence opening the strong box in which our receipt forms are invariably kept my partner had one key i had the other the third was in the possession of a gentleman who at that period occupied a position of trust in our house we should as soon have thought of suspecting one of ourselves as of suspecting this person suspicion now points at him nevertheless i cannot prevail on myself to inform you who the person is so long as there is the shadow of a chance that he may come innocently out of the inquiry which must now be instituted forgive my silence the motive of it is good the form our investigation must now take is simple enough the handwriting of your receipt must be compared by competent persons whom we have at our disposal with certain specimens of handwriting in our possession i cannot send you the specimens for business reasons which when you hear them you are sure to approve i must beg you to send me the receipt to neuchatel and in making this request i must accompany it by a word of necessary warning if the person at whom suspicion now points really proves to be the person who has committed this forger and theft i have reason to fear that circumstances may have already put him on his guard the only evidence against him is the evidence in your hands and he will move heaven and earth to obtain and destroy it i strongly urge you not to trust the receipt to the post send it to me without loss of time by a private hand and choose nobody for your messenger but a person long established in your own employment accustomed to travelling capable of speaking french a man of courage a man of honesty and above all things a man who can be trusted to let no stranger scrape acquaintance with him on the route tell no one absolutely no one but your messenger of the turn this matter has now taken the safe transit of the receipt may depend on your interpreting literally the advice which i give you at the end of this letter i have only to add that every possible saving of time is now of the last importance more than one of our receipt forms is missing and it is impossible to say what new frauds may not be committed if we fail to lay our hands on the thief your faithful servant rolland signing for defresnier and cie who was the suspected man in vendale's position it seemed useless to inquire who was to be sent to neuchatel with the receipt men of courage and men of honesty were to be had at cripple corner for the asking but where was the man who was accustomed to foreign travelling who could speak the french language and who could be really relied on to let no stranger scrape acquaintance with him on his route there was but one man at hand who combined all those requisites in his own person and that man was vendale himself it was a sacrifice to leave his business it was a greater sacrifice to leave marguerite but a matter of five hundred pounds was involved in the pending inquiry and a literal interpretation of m rolland's advice was insisted on in terms which there was no trifling with the more vendale thought of it the more plainly the necessity faced him and said go as he locked up the letter with the receipt the association of ideas reminded him of obenreizer a guess at the identity of the suspected man looked more possible now obenreizer might know the thought had barely passed through his mind when the door opened and obenreizer entered the room they told me at soho square you were expected back last night said vendale greeting him have you done well in the country are you better a thousand thanks obenreizer had done admirably well obenreizer was infinitely better and now what news any letter from neuchatel a very strange letter answered vendale the matter has taken a new turn and the letter insists without excepting anybody on my keeping our next proceedings a profound secret without excepting anybody repeated obenreizer as he said the words he walked away again thoughtfully to the window at the other end of the room looked out for a moment and suddenly came back to vendale surely they must have forgotten he resumed or they would have excepted me it is monsieur rolland who writes said vendale and as you say he must certainly have forgotten that view of the matter quite escaped me i was just wishing i had you to consult when you came into the room and here i am tried by a formal prohibition which cannot possibly have been intended to include you how very annoying obenreizer's filmy eyes fixed on vendale attentively perhaps it is more than annoying he said i came this morning not only to hear the news but to offer myself as messenger negotiator what you will would you believe it i have letters which oblige me to go to switzerland immediately messages documents anything i could have taken them all to defresnier and rolland for you you are the very man i wanted returned vendale i had decided most unwillingly on going to neuchatel myself not five minutes since because i could find no one here capable of taking my place let me look at the letter again he opened the strong room to get at the letter obenreizer after first glancing round him to make sure that they were alone followed a step or two and waited measuring vendale with his eye vendale was the tallest man and unmistakably the strongest man also of the two obenreizer turned away and warmed himself at the fire meanwhile vendale read the last paragraph in the letter for the third time there was the plain warning there was the closing sentence which insisted on a literal interpretation of it the hand which was leading vendale in the dark led him on that condition only a large sum was at stake a terrible suspicion remained to be verified if he acted on his own responsibility and if anything happened to defeat the object in view who would be blamed as a man of business vendale had but one course to follow he locked the letter up again it is most annoying he said to obenreizer it is a piece of forgetfulness on monsieur rolland's part which puts me to serious inconvenience and places me in an absurdly false position towards you what am i to do i am acting in a very serious matter and acting entirely in the dark i have no choice but to be guided not by the spirit but by the letter of my instructions you understand me i am sure you know if i had not been fettered in this way how gladly i should have accepted your services say no more returned obenreizer in your place i should have done the same my good friend i take no offence i thank you for your compliment we shall be travelling companions at any rate added obenreizer you go as i go at once at once i must speak to marguerite first of course surely surely speak to her this evening come and pick me up on the way to the station we go together by the mail train to night by the mail train to night it was later than vendale had anticipated when he drove up to the house in soho square business difficulties occasioned by his sudden departure had presented themselves by dozens a cruelly large share of the time which he had hoped to devote to marguerite had been claimed by duties at his office which it was impossible to neglect to his surprise and delight she was alone in the drawing room when he entered it we have only a few minutes george she said but madame dor has been good to me and we can have those few minutes alone she threw her arms round his neck and whispered eagerly have you done anything to offend mr obenreizer i exclaimed vendale in amazement hush she said i want to whisper it you know the little photograph i have got of you this afternoon it happened to be on the chimney piece he took it up and looked at it and i saw his face in the glass i know you have offended him he is merciless he is revengeful he is as secret as the grave don't go with him george don't go with him my own love returned vendale you are letting your fancy frighten you obenreizer and i were never better friends than we are at this moment before a word more could be said the sudden movement of some ponderous body shook the floor of the next room the shock was followed by the appearance of madame dor obenreizer exclaimed this excellent person in a whisper and plumped down instantly in her regular place by the stove obenreizer came in with a courier's big strapped over his shoulder are you ready he asked addressing vendale can i take anything for you you have no travelling bag i have got one here is the compartment for papers open at your service thank you said vendale i have only one paper of importance with me and that paper i am bound to take charge of myself here it is he added touching the breast pocket of his coat and here it must remain till we get to neuchatel as he said those words marguerite's hand caught his and pressed it significantly she was looking towards obenreizer before vendale could look in his turn obenreizer had wheeled round and was taking leave of madame dor adieu my charming niece he said turning to marguerite next en route my friend for neuchatel he tapped vendale lightly over the breast pocket of his coat and led the way to the door vendale's last look was for marguerite marguerite's last words to him were don't go act iii in the valley it was about the middle of the month of february when vendale and obenreizer set forth on their expedition the winter being a hard one the time was bad for travellers so bad was it that these two travellers coming to strasbourg found its great inns almost empty and even the few people they did encounter in that city who had started from england or from paris on business journeys towards the interior of switzerland were turning back many of the railroads in switzerland that tourists pass easily enough now were almost or quite impracticable then some were not begun more were not completed on such as were open there were still large gaps of old road where communication in the winter season was often stopped on others there were weak points where the new work was not safe either under conditions of severe frost or of rapid thaw the running of trains on this last class was not to be counted on in the worst time of the year was contingent upon weather or was wholly abandoned through the months considered the most dangerous at strasbourg there were more travellers' stories afloat respecting the difficulties of the way further on than there were travellers to relate them many of these tales were as wild as usual but the more modestly marvellous did derive some colour from the circumstance that people were indisputably turning back however as the road to basle was open vendale's resolution to push on was in no wise disturbed obenreizer's resolution was necessarily vendale's seeing that he stood at bay thus desperately he must be ruined or must destroy the evidence that vendale carried about him even if he destroyed vendale with it the state of mind of each of these two fellow travellers towards the other was this obenreizer encircled by impending ruin through vendale's quickness of action and seeing the circle narrowed every hour by vendale's energy hated him with the animosity of a fierce cunning lower animal he had always had instinctive movements in his breast against him perhaps because of that old sore of gentleman and peasant perhaps because of the openness of his nature perhaps because of his better looks perhaps because of his success with marguerite perhaps on all those grounds the two last not the least and now he saw in him besides the hunter who was tracking him down vendale on the other hand always contending generously against his first vague mistrust now felt bound to contend against it more than ever reminding himself he is marguerite's guardian we are on perfectly friendly terms he is my companion of his own proposal and can have no interested motive in sharing this undesirable journey to which pleas in behalf of obenreizer chance added one consideration more when they came to basle after a journey of more than twice the average duration they had had a late dinner and were alone in an inn room there overhanging the rhine at that place rapid and deep swollen and loud vendale lounged upon a couch and obenreizer walked to and fro now stopping at the window looking at the crooked reflection of the town lights in the dark water and peradventure thinking if i could fling him into it now resuming his walk with his eyes upon the floor where shall i rob him if i can where shall i murder him if i must so as he paced the room ran the river ran the river ran the river the burden seemed to him at last to be growing so plain that he stopped thinking it as well to suggest another burden to his companion the rhine sounds to night he said with a smile like the old waterfall at home that waterfall which my mother showed to travellers i told you of it once the sound of it changed with the weather as does the sound of all falling waters and flowing waters when i was pupil of the watchmaker i remembered it as sometimes saying to me for whole days 'who are you my little wretch who are you my little wretch' i remembered it as saying other times when its sound was hollow and storm was coming up the pass 'boom boom boom beat him beat him beat him' like my mother enraged if she was my mother if she was said vendale gradually changing his attitude to a sitting one if she was why do you say 'if' what do i know replied the other negligently throwing up his hands and letting them fall as they would what would you have i am so obscurely born that how can i say i was very young and all the rest of the family were men and women and my so called parents were old anything is possible of a case like that did you ever doubt i told you once i doubt the marriage of those two he replied throwing up his hands again as if he were throwing the unprofitable subject away but here i am in creation i come of no fine family what does it matter at least you are swiss said vendale after following him with his eyes to and fro how do i know he retorted abruptly and stopping to look back over his shoulder i say to you at least you are english how do you know by what i have been told from infancy ah i know of myself that way and added vendale pursuing the thought that he could not drive back by my earliest recollections i also i know of myself that way if that way satisfies does it not satisfy you it must there is nothing like 'it must' in this little world it must two short words those but stronger than long proof or reasoning you and poor wilding were born in the same year you were nearly of an age said vendale again thoughtfully looking after him as he resumed his pacing up and down yes very nearly could obenreizer be the missing man in the unknown associations of things was there a subtler meaning than he himself thought in that theory so often on his lips about the smallness of the world had the swiss letter presenting him followed so close on mrs goldstraw's revelation concerning the infant who had been taken away to switzerland because he was that infant grown a man in a world where so many depths lie unsounded it might be the chances or the laws call them either that had wrought out the revival of vendale's own acquaintance with obenreizer and had ripened it into intimacy and had brought them here together this present winter night were hardly less curious while read by such a light they were seen to cohere towards the furtherance of a continuous and an intelligible purpose vendale's awakened thoughts ran high while his eyes musingly followed obenreizer pacing up and down the room the river ever running to the tune where shall i rob him if i can where shall i murder him if i must the secret of his dead friend was in no hazard from vendale's lips but just as his friend had died of its weight so did he in his lighter succession feel the burden of the trust and the obligation to follow any clue however obscure he rapidly asked himself would he like this man to be the real wilding no argue down his mistrust as he might he was unwilling to put such a substitute in the place of his late guileless outspoken childlike partner he rapidly asked himself would he like this man to be rich no he had more power than enough over marguerite as it was and wealth might invest him with more would he like this man to be marguerite's guardian and yet proved to stand in no degree of relationship towards her however disconnected and distant no but these were not considerations to come between him and fidelity to the dead let him see to it that they passed him with no other notice than the knowledge that they had passed him and left him bent on the discharge of a solemn duty and he did see to it so soon that he followed his companion with ungrudging eyes while he still paced the room that companion whom he supposed to be moodily reflecting on his own birth and not on another man's least of all what man's violent death the road in advance from basle to neuchatel was better than had been represented the latest weather had done it good drivers both of horses and mules had come in that evening after dark and had reported nothing more difficult to be overcome than trials of patience harness wheels axles and whipcord a bargain was soon struck for a carriage and horses to take them on in the morning and to start before daylight do you lock your door at night when travelling asked obenreizer standing warming his hands by the wood fire in vendale's chamber before going to his own not i i sleep too soundly you are so sound a sleeper he retorted with an admiring look what a blessing anything but a blessing to the rest of the house rejoined vendale if i had to be knocked up in the morning from the outside of my bedroom door i too said obenreizer leave open my room but let me advise you as a swiss who knows always when you travel in my country put your papers and of course your money under your pillow always the same place you are not complimentary to your countrymen laughed vendale my countrymen said obenreizer with that light touch of his friend's elbows by way of good night and benediction i suppose are like the majority of men and the majority of men will take what they can get adieu at four in the morning adieu at four left to himself vendale raked the logs together sprinkled over them the white wood ashes lying on the hearth and sat down to compose his thoughts but they still ran high on their latest theme and the running of the river tended to agitate rather than to quiet them as he sat thinking what little disposition he had had to sleep departed he felt it hopeless to lie down yet and sat dressed by the fire marguerite wilding obenreizer the business he was then upon and a thousand hopes and doubts that had nothing to do with it occupied his mind at once everything seemed to have power over him but slumber the departed disposition to sleep kept far away he had sat for a long time thinking on the hearth when his candle burned down and its light went out it was of little moment there was light enough in the fire he changed his attitude and leaning his arm on the chair back and his chin upon that hand sat thinking still but he sat between the fire and the bed and as the fire flickered in the play of air from the fast flowing river his enlarged shadow fluttered on the white wall by the bedside his attitude gave it an air half of mourning and half of bending over the bed imploring his eyes were observant of it when he became troubled by the disagreeable fancy that it was like wilding's shadow and not his own a slight change of place would cause it to disappear he made the change and the apparition of his disturbed fancy vanished he now sat in the shade of a little nook beside the fire and the door of the room was before him it had a long cumbrous iron latch he saw the latch slowly and softly rise the door opened a very little and came to again as though only the air had moved it but he saw that the latch was out of the hasp the door opened again very slowly until it opened wide enough to admit some one it afterwards remained still for a while as though cautiously held open on the other side the figure of a man then entered with its face turned towards the bed and stood quiet just within the door until it said in a low half whisper at the same time taking one stop forward vendale what now he answered springing from his seat who is it it was obenreizer and he uttered a cry of surprise as vendale came upon him from that unexpected direction not in bed he said catching him by both shoulders with an instinctive tendency to a struggle then something is wrong what do you mean said vendale releasing himself first tell me you are not ill ill no i have had a bad dream about you how is it that i see you up and dressed my good fellow i may as well ask you how it is that i see you up and undressed i have told you why i have had a bad dream about you i tried to rest after it but it was impossible i could not make up my mind to stay where i was without knowing you were safe and yet i could not make up my mind to come in here i have been minutes hesitating at the door it is so easy to laugh at a dream that you have not dreamed where is your candle burnt out i have a whole one in my room shall i fetch it do so his room was very near and he was absent for but a few seconds coming back with the candle in his hand he kneeled down on the hearth and lighted it as he blew with his breath a charred billet into flame for the purpose vendale looking down at him saw that his lips were white and not easy of control yes said obenreizer setting the lighted candle on the table it was a bad dream only look at me his feet were bare his red flannel shirt was thrown back at the throat and its sleeves were rolled above the elbows his only other garment a pair of under pantaloons or drawers reaching to the ankles fitted him close and tight a certain lithe and savage appearance was on his figure and his eyes were very bright if there had been a wrestle with a robber as i dreamed said obenreizer you see i was stripped for it and armed too said vendale glancing at his girdle a traveller's dagger that i always carry on the road he answered carelessly half drawing it from its sheath with his left hand and putting it back again do you carry no such thing nothing of the kind no pistols said obenreizer glancing at the table and from it to the untouched pillow nothing of the sort you englishmen are so confident you wish to sleep i have wished to sleep this long time but i can't do it i neither after the bad dream my fire has gone the way of your candle may i come and sit by yours two o'clock it will so soon be four that it is not worth the trouble to go to bed again i shall not take the trouble to go to bed at all now said vendale sit here and keep me company and welcome going back to his room to arrange his dress obenreizer soon returned in a loose cloak and slippers and they sat down on opposite sides of the hearth in the interval vendale had replenished the fire from the wood basket in his room and obenreizer had put upon the table a flask and cup from his common cabaret brandy i am afraid he said pouring out bought upon the road and not like yours from cripple corner but yours is exhausted so much the worse a cold night a cold time of night a cold country and a cold house this may be better than nothing try it vendale took the cup and did so how do you find it it has a coarse after flavour said vendale giving back the cup with a slight shudder and i don't like it you are right said obenreizer tasting and smacking his lips it has a coarse after flavour and i don't like it booh it burns though he had flung what remained in the cup upon the fire each of them leaned an elbow on the table reclined his head upon his hand and sat looking at the flaring logs obenreizer remained watchful and still but vendale after certain nervous twitches and starts in one of which he rose to his feet and looked wildly about him fell into the strangest confusion of dreams he carried his papers in a leather case or pocket book in an inner breast pocket of his buttoned travelling coat and whatever he dreamed of in the lethargy that got possession of him something importunate in those papers called him out of that dream though he could not wake from it he was berated on the steppes of russia some shadowy person gave that name to the place with marguerite and yet the sensation of a hand at his breast softly feeling the outline of the packet book as he lay asleep before the fire was present to him he was ship wrecked in an open boat at sea and having lost his clothes had no other covering than an old sail and yet a creeping hand tracing outside all the other pockets of the dress he actually wore for papers and finding none answer its touch warned him to rouse himself he was in the ancient vault at cripple corner to which was transferred the very bed substantial and present in that very room at basle and wilding not dead as he had supposed and yet he did not wonder much shook him and whispered look at that man don't you see he has risen and is turning the pillow why should he turn the pillow if not to seek those papers that are in your breast awake and yet he slept and wandered off into other dreams watchful and still with his elbow on the table and his head upon that hand his companion at length said vendale we are called past four then opening his eyes he saw turned sideways on him the filmy face of obenreizer you have been in a heavy sleep he said the fatigue of constant travelling and the cold i am broad awake now cried vendale springing up but with an unsteady footing haven't you slept at all i may have dozed but i seem to have been patiently looking at the fire whether or no we must wash and breakfast and turn out past four vendale past four it was said in a tone to rouse him for already he was half asleep again in his preparation for the day too and at his breakfast he was often virtually asleep while in mechanical action it was not until the cold dark day was closing in that he had any distincter impressions of the ride than jingling bells bitter weather slipping horses frowning hill sides bleak woods and a stoppage at some wayside house of entertainment where they had passed through a cow house to reach the travellers' room above he had been conscious of little more except of obenreizer sitting thoughtful at his side all day and eyeing him much but when he shook off his stupor obenreizer was not at his side the carriage was stopping to bait at another wayside house and a line of long narrow carts laden with casks of wine and drawn by horses with a quantity of blue collar and head gear were baiting too these came from the direction in which the travellers were going and obenreizer not thoughtful now but cheerful and alert was talking with the foremost driver as vendale stretched his limbs circulated his blood and cleared off the lees of his lethargy with a sharp run to and fro in the bracing air the line of carts moved on the drivers all saluting obenreizer as they passed him who are those asked vendale they are our carriers defresnier and company's replied obenreizer those are our casks of wine he was singing to himself and lighting a cigar i have been drearily dull company to day said vendale i don't know what has been the matter with me you had no sleep last night and a kind of brain congestion frequently comes at first of such cold said obenreizer i have seen it often after all we shall have our journey for nothing it seems how for nothing the house is at milan you know we are a wine house at neuchatel and a silk house at milan well silk happening to press of a sudden more than wine defresnier was summoned to milan rolland the other partner has been taken ill since his departure and the doctors will allow him to see no one a letter awaits you at neuchatel to tell you so i have it from our chief carrier whom you saw me talking with he was surprised to see me and said he had that word for you if he met you what do you do go back go on said vendale on on yes across the alps and down to milan obenreizer stopped in his smoking to look at vendale and then smoked heavily looked up the road looked down the road looked down at the stones in the road at his feet i have a very serious matter in charge said vendale more of these missing forms may be turned to as bad account or worse i am urged to lose no time in helping the house to take the thief and nothing shall turn me back no cried obenreizer taking out his cigar to smile and giving his hand to his fellow traveller then nothing shall turn me back ho driver despatch quick there let us push on they travelled through the night there had been snow and there was a partial thaw and they mostly travelled at a foot pace and always with many stoppages to breathe the splashed and floundering horses after an hour's broad daylight they drew rein at the inn door at neuchatel having been some eight and twenty hours in conquering some eighty english miles when they had hurriedly refreshed and changed they went together to the house of business of defresnier and company there they found the letter which the wine carrier had described enclosing the tests and comparisons of handwriting essential to the discovery of the forger vendale's determination to press forward without resting being already taken the only question to delay them was by what pass could they cross the alps respecting the state of the two passes of the st gotthard and the simplon the guides and mule drivers differed greatly and both passes were still far enough off to prevent the travellers from having the benefit of any recent experience of either besides which they well knew that a fall of snow might altogether change the described conditions in a single hour even if they were correctly stated but on the whole the simplon appearing to be the hopefuller route vendale decided to take it obenreizer bore little or no part in the discussion and scarcely spoke to geneva to lausanne along the level margin of the lake to vevay so into the winding valley between the spurs of the mountains and into the valley of the rhone the sound of the carriage wheels as they rattled on through the day through the night became as the wheels of a great clock recording the hours no change of weather varied the journey after it had hardened into a sullen frost in a sombre yellow sky they saw the alpine ranges and they saw enough of snow on nearer and much lower hill tops and hill sides to sully by contrast the purity of lake torrent and waterfall and make the villages look discoloured and dirty but no snow fell nor was there any snow drift on the road the stalking along the valley of more or less of white mist changing on their hair and dress into icicles was the only variety between them and the gloomy sky and still by day and still by night the wheels and still they rolled in the hearing of one of them to the burden altered from the burden of the rhine the time is gone for robbing him alive and i must murder him they came at length to the poor little town of brieg at the foot of the simplon they came there after dark but yet could see how dwarfed men's works and men became with the immense mountains towering over them here they must lie for the night and here was warmth of fire and lamp and dinner and wine and after conference resounding with guides and drivers no human creature had come across the pass for four days the snow above the snow line was too soft for wheeled carriage and not hard enough for sledge there was snow in the sky there had been snow in the sky for days past and the marvel was that it had not fallen and the certainty was that it must fall no vehicle could cross the journey might be tried on mules or it might be tried on foot but the best guides must be paid danger price in either case and that too whether they succeeded in taking the two travellers across or turned for safety and brought them back in this discussion obenreizer bore no part whatever he sat silently smoking by the fire until the room was cleared and vendale referred to him bah i am weary of these poor devils and their trade he said in reply always the same story it is the story of their trade to day as it was the story of their trade when i was a ragged boy what do you and i want we want a knapsack each and a mountain staff each we want no guide we should guide him he would not guide us we leave our portmanteaus here and we cross together we have been on the mountains together before now and i am mountain born and i know this pass pass rather high road by heart we will leave these poor devils in pity to trade with others but they must not delay us to make a pretence of earning money which is all they mean vendale glad to be quit of the dispute and to cut the knot active adventurous bent on getting forward and therefore very susceptible to the last hint readily assented within two hours they had purchased what they wanted for the expedition had packed their knapsacks and lay down to sleep at break of day they found half the town collected in the narrow street to see them depart the people talked together in groups the guides and drivers whispered apart and looked up at the sky no one wished them a good journey as they began the ascent a gleam of sun shone from the otherwise unaltered sky and for a moment turned the tin spires of the town to silver a good omen said vendale though it died out while he spoke perhaps our example will open the pass on this side no we shall not be followed returned obenreizer looking up at the sky and back at the valley we shall be alone up yonder on the mountain the road was fair enough for stout walkers and the air grew lighter and easier to breathe as the two ascended but the settled gloom remained as it had remained for days back nature seemed to have come to a pause the sense of hearing no less than the sense of sight was troubled by having to wait so long for the change whatever it might be that impended the silence was as palpable and heavy as the lowering clouds or rather cloud for there seemed to be but one in all the sky and that one covering the whole of it although the light was thus dismally shrouded the prospect was not obscured down in the valley of the rhone behind them the stream could be traced through all its many windings oppressively sombre and solemn in its one leaden hue a colourless waste far and high above them glaciers and suspended avalanches overhung the spots where they must pass by and by deep and dark below them on their right were awful precipice and roaring torrent tremendous mountains arose in every vista the gigantic landscape uncheered by a touch of changing light or a solitary ray of sun was yet terribly distinct in its ferocity the hearts of two lonely men might shrink a little if they had to win their way for miles and hours among a legion of silent and motionless men mere men like themselves all looking at them with fixed and frowning front but how much more when the legion is of nature's mightiest works and the frown may turn to fury in an instant as they ascended the road became gradually more rugged and difficult but the spirits of vendale rose as they mounted higher leaving so much more of the road behind them conquered obenreizer spoke little and held on with a determined purpose both in respect of agility and endurance were well qualified for the expedition whatever the born mountaineer read in the weather tokens that was illegible to the other he kept to himself shall we get across to day asked vendale no replied the other you see how much deeper the snow lies here than it lay half a league lower the higher we mount the deeper the snow will lie walking is half wading even now and the days are so short if we get as high as the fifth refuge and lie to night at the hospice we shall do well is there no danger of the weather rising in the night asked vendale anxiously and snowing us up there is danger enough about us said obenreizer with a cautious glance onward and upward to render silence our best policy you have heard of the bridge of the ganther i have crossed it once in the summer yes in the travelling season yes but it is another thing at this season with a sneer as though he were out of temper this is not a time of year or a state of things on an alpine pass that you gentlemen holiday travellers know much about you are my guide said vendale good humouredly i trust to you i am your guide said obenreizer and i will guide you to your journey's end there is the bridge before us they had made a turn into a desolate and dismal ravine where the snow lay deep below them deep above them deep on every side while speaking obenreizer stood pointing at the bridge and observing vendale's face with a very singular expression on his own if i as guide had sent you over there in advance and encouraged you to give a shout or two you might have brought down upon yourself tons and tons and tons of snow that would not only have struck you dead but buried you deep at a blow no doubt said vendale no doubt but that is not what i have to do as guide so pass silently or going as we go our indiscretion might else crush and bury me let us get on there was a great accumulation of snow on the bridge and such enormous accumulations of snow overhung them from protecting masses of rock that they might have been making their way through a stormy sky of white clouds using his staff skilfully sounding as he went and looking upward with bent shoulders as it were to resist the mere idea of a fall from above obenreizer softly led vendale closely followed they were yet in the midst of their dangerous way when there came a mighty rush followed by a sound as of thunder obenreizer clapped his hand on vendale's mouth and pointed to the track behind them its aspect had been wholly changed in a moment an avalanche had swept over it and plunged into the torrent at the bottom of the gulf below their appearance at the solitary inn not far beyond this terrible bridge elicited many expressions of astonishment from the people shut up in the house we stay but to rest said obenreizer shaking the snow from his dress at the fire this gentleman has very pressing occasion to get across tell them vendale assuredly i have very pressing occasion i must cross you hear all of you my friend has very pressing occasion to get across and we want no advice and no help i am as good a guide my fellow countrymen as any of you now give us to eat and drink in exactly the same way and in nearly the same words when it was coming on dark and they had struggled through the greatly increased difficulties of the road and had at last reached their destination for the night obenreizer said to the astonished people of the hospice gathering about them at the fire while they were yet in the act of getting their wet shoes off and shaking the snow from their clothes it is well to understand one another friends all this gentleman has said vendale readily taking him up with a smile very pressing occasion to get across must cross you hear has very pressing occasion to get across must cross we want no advice and no help i am mountain born and act as guide do not worry us by talking about it but let us have supper and wine and bed all through the intense cold of the night the same awful stillness again at sunrise no sunny tinge to gild or redden the snow the same interminable waste of deathly white the same immovable air the same monotonous gloom in the sky travellers a friendly voice called to them from the door after they were afoot knapsack on back and staff in hand as yesterday recollect there are five places of shelter near together on the dangerous road before you and there is the wooden cross and there is the next hospice do not stray from the track if the tourmente comes on take shelter instantly the trade of these poor devils said obenreizer to his friend with a contemptuous backward wave of his hand towards the voice how they stick to their trade you englishmen say we swiss are mercenary truly it does look like it they had divided between the two knapsacks such refreshments as they had been able to obtain that morning and as they deemed it prudent to take obenreizer carried the wine as his share of the burden vendale the bread and meat and cheese and the flask of brandy they had for some time laboured upward and onward through the snow which was now above their knees in the track and of unknown depth elsewhere and they were still labouring upward and onward through the most frightful part of that tremendous desolation when snow begin to fall at first but a few flakes descended slowly and steadily after a little while the fall grew much denser and suddenly it began without apparent cause to whirl itself into spiral shapes instantly ensuing upon this last change an icy blast came roaring at them and every sound and force imprisoned until now was let loose one of the dismal galleries through which the road is carried at that perilous point a cave eked out by arches of great strength was near at hand they struggled into it and the storm raged wildly the noise of the wind the noise of the water the thundering down of displaced masses of rock and snow the awful voices with which not only that gorge but every gorge in the whole monstrous range seemed to be suddenly endowed the darkness as of night the violent revolving of the snow which beat and broke it into spray and blinded them the madness of everything around insatiate for destruction the rapid substitution of furious violence for unnatural calm and hosts of appalling sounds for silence these were things on the edge of a deep abyss to chill the blood though the fierce wind made actually solid by ice and snow had failed to chill it obenreizer walking to and fro in the gallery without ceasing signed to vendale to help him unbuckle his knapsack they could see each other but could not have heard each other speak vendale complying obenreizer produced his bottle of wine and poured some out motioning vendale to take that for warmth's sake and not brandy vendale again complying obenreizer seemed to drink after him and the two walked backwards and forwards side by side both well knowing that to rest or sleep would be to die the snow came driving heavily into the gallery by the upper end at which they would pass out of it if they ever passed out for greater dangers lay on the road behind them than before the snow soon began to choke the arch an hour more and it lay so high as to block out half the returning daylight but it froze hard now as it fell and could be clambered through or over the violence of the mountain storm was gradually yielding to steady snowfall the wind still raged at intervals but not incessantly and when it paused the snow fell in heavy flakes they might have been two hours in their frightful prison when obenreizer now crunching into the mound now creeping over it with his head bowed down and his body touching the top of the arch made his way out vendale followed close upon him but followed without clear motive or calculation for the lethargy of basle was creeping over him again and mastering his senses how far he had followed out of the gallery or with what obstacles he had since contended he knew not he became roused to the knowledge that obenreizer had set upon him and that they were struggling desperately in the snow he became roused to the remembrance of what his assailant carried in a girdle he felt for it drew it struck at him struggled again struck at him again cast him off and stood face to face with him i promised to guide you to your journey's end said obenreizer and i have kept my promise the journey of your life ends here nothing can prolong it you are sleeping as you stand you are a villain what have you done to me you are a fool i have drugged you you are doubly a fool for i drugged you once before upon the journey to try you you are trebly a fool for i am the thief and forger and in a few moments i shall take those proofs against the thief and forger from your insensible body the entrapped man tried to throw off the lethargy but its fatal hold upon him was so sure that even while he heard those words he stupidly wondered which of them had been wounded and whose blood it was that he saw sprinkled on the snow what have i done to you he asked heavily and thickly that you should be so base a murderer done to me you would have destroyed me but that you have come to your journey's end your cursed activity interposed between me and the time i had counted on in which i might have replaced the money done to me you have come in my way not once not twice but again and again and again did i try to shake you off in the beginning or no you were not to be shaken off therefore you die here vendale tried to think coherently tried to speak coherently tried to pick up the iron shod staff he had let fall failing to touch it tried to stagger on without its aid all in vain all in vain he stumbled and fell heavily forward on the brink of the deep chasm stupefied dozing unable to stand upon his feet a veil before his eyes his sense of hearing deadened he made such a vigorous rally that supporting himself on his hands he saw his enemy standing calmly over him and heard him speak you call me murderer said obenreizer with a grim laugh the name matters very little but at least i have set my life against yours for i am surrounded by dangers and may never make my way out of this place the tourmente is rising again the snow is on the whirl i must have the papers now every moment has my life in it stop cried vendale in a terrible voice staggering up with a last flash of fire breaking out of him and clutching the thievish hands at his breast in both of his stop stand away from me god bless my marguerite happily she will never know how i died stand off from me and let me look at your murderous face let it remind me of something left to say the sight of him fighting so hard for his senses and the doubt whether he might not for the instant be possessed by the strength of a dozen men kept his opponent still wildly glaring at him vendale faltered out the broken words it shall not be the trust of the dead betrayed by me reputed parents misinherited fortune see to it as his head dropped on his breast and he stumbled on the brink of the chasm as before the thievish hands went once more quick and busy to his breast he made a convulsive attempt to cry no desperately rolled himself over into the gulf and sank away from his enemy's touch like a phantom in a dreadful dream the mountain storm raged again and passed again the awful mountain voices died away the moon rose and the soft and silent snow fell two men and two large dogs came out at the door of the hospice the men looked carefully around them and up at the sky the dogs rolled in the snow and took it into their mouths and cast it up with their paws one of the men said to the other we may venture now we may find them in one of the five refuges each fastened on his back a basket each took in his hand a strong spiked pole each girded under his arms a looped end of a stout rope so that they were tied together suddenly the dogs desisted from their gambols in the snow stood looking down the ascent put their noses up put their noses down became greatly excited and broke into a deep loud bay together the two men looked in the faces of the two dogs the two dogs looked with at least equal intelligence in the faces of the two men au secours then help to the rescue cried the two men the two dogs with a glad deep generous bark bounded away two more mad ones said the men stricken motionless and looking away in the moonlight is it possible in such weather and one of them a woman each of the dogs had the corner of a woman's dress in its mouth and drew her along she fondled their heads as she came up and she came up through the snow with an accustomed tread not so the large man with her who was spent and winded dear guides dear friends of travellers i am of your country we seek two gentlemen crossing the pass who should have reached the hospice this evening they have reached it ma'amselle thank heaven o thank heaven but unhappily they have gone on again we are setting forth to seek them even now we had to wait until the tourmente passed it has been fearful up here dear guides dear friends of travellers let me go with you let me go with you for the love of god one of those gentlemen is to be my husband i love him o so dearly o so dearly you see i am not faint you see i am not tired i am born a peasant girl i will show you that i know well how to fasten myself to your ropes i will do it with my own hands i will swear to be brave and good but let me go with you let me go with you if any mischance should have befallen him my love would find him when nothing else could on my knees dear friends of travellers by the love your dear mothers had for your fathers the good rough fellows were moved after all they murmured to one another she speaks but the truth she knows the ways of the mountains see how marvellously she has come here but as to monsieur there ma'amselle dear mr joey said marguerite addressing him in his own tongue you will remain at the house and wait for me will you not if i know'd which o' you two recommended it growled joey ladle eyeing the two men with great indignation i'd fight you for sixpence and give you half a crown towards your expenses no miss i'll stick by you as long as there's any sticking left in me and i'll die for you when i can't do better the state of the moon rendering it highly important that no time should be lost and the dogs showing signs of great uneasiness the two men quickly took their resolution the rope that yoked them together was exchanged for a longer one the party were secured marguerite second and the cellarman last and they set out for the refuges the actual distance of those places was nothing the whole five and the next hospice to boot being within two miles but the ghastly way was whitened out and sheeted over they made no miss in reaching the gallery where the two had taken shelter the second storm of wind and snow had so wildly swept over it since that their tracks were gone but the dogs went to and fro with their noses down and were confident the party stopping however at the further arch where the second storm had been especially furious and where the drift was deep the dogs became troubled and went about and about in quest of a lost purpose the great abyss being known to lie on the right they wandered too much to the left and had to regain the way with infinite labour through a deep field of snow the leader of the line had stopped it and was taking note of the landmarks when one of the dogs fell to tearing up the snow a little before them advancing and stooping to look at it thinking that some one might be overwhelmed there they saw that it was stained and that the stain was red the other dog was now seen to look over the brink of the gulf with his fore legs straightened out lest he should fall into it and to tremble in every limb then the dog who had found the stained snow joined him and then they ran to and fro distressed and whining finally they both stopped on the brink together and setting up their heads howled dolefully there is some one lying below said marguerite i think so said the foremost man stand well inward the two last and let us look over the last man kindled two torches from his basket and handed them forward the leader taking one and marguerite the other they looked down now shading the torches now moving them to the right or left now raising them now depressing them as moonlight far below contended with black shadows a piercing cry from marguerite broke a long silence my god on a projecting point where a wall of ice stretches forward over the torrent i see a human form where ma'amselle where see there on the shelf of ice below the dogs the leader with a sickened aspect drew inward and they were all silent but they were not all inactive for marguerite with swift and skilful fingers had detached both herself and him from the rope in a few seconds show me the baskets these two are the only ropes the only ropes here ma'amselle but at the hospice if he is alive i know it is my lover he will be dead before you can return dear guides blessed friends of travellers look at me watch my hands if they falter or go wrong make me your prisoner by force if they are steady and go right help me to save him she girded herself with a cord under the breast and arms she formed it into a kind of jacket she drew it into knots she laid its end side by side with the end of the other cord she twisted and twined the two together she knotted them together she set her foot upon the knots she strained them she held them for the two men to strain at she is inspired they said to one another by the almighty's mercy she exclaimed you both know that i am by far the lightest here give me the brandy and the wine and lower me down to him then go for assistance and a stronger rope you see that when it is lowered to me look at this about me now i can make it fast and safe to his body alive or dead i will bring him up or die with him i love him passionately can i say more they turned to her companion but he was lying senseless on the snow lower me down to him she said taking two little kegs they had brought and hanging them about her or i will dash myself to pieces i am a peasant and i know no giddiness or fear and this is nothing to me and i passionately love him lower me down ma'amselle ma'amselle he must be dying or dead dying or dead my husband's head shall lie upon my breast or i will dash myself to pieces they yielded overborne with such precautions as their skill and the circumstances admitted they let her slip from the summit guiding herself down the precipitous icy wall with her hand and they lowered down and lowered down and lowered down until the cry came up enough is it really he and is he dead they called down looking over the cry came up he is insensible but his heart beats it beats against mine how does he lie the cry came up upon a ledge of ice it has thawed beneath him and it will thaw beneath me hasten if we die i am content one of the two men hurried off with the dogs at such topmost speed as he could make the other set up the lighted torches in the snow and applied himself to recovering the englishman much snow chafing and some brandy got him on his legs but delirious and quite unconscious where he was the watch remained upon the brink and his cry went down continually courage they will soon be here how goes it and the cry came up his heart still beats against mine i warm him in my arms i have cast off the rope for the ice melts under us and the rope would separate me from him but i am not afraid the moon went down behind the mountain tops and all the abyss lay in darkness the cry went down how goes it the cry came up we are sinking lower but his heart still beats against mine at length the eager barking of the dogs and a flare of light upon the snow proclaimed that help was coming on twenty or thirty men lamps torches litters ropes blankets wood to kindle a great fire restoratives and stimulants came in fast the dogs ran from one man to another and from this thing to that and ran to the edge of the abyss dumbly entreating speed speed speed the cry went down thanks to god all is ready how goes it the cry came up we are sinking still and we are deadly cold his heart no longer beats against mine let no one come down to add to our weight lower the rope only the fire was kindled high a great glare of torches lighted the sides of the precipice lamps were lowered a strong rope was lowered she could be seen passing it round him and making it secure the cry came up into a deathly silence raise softly they could see her diminished figure shrink as he was swung into the air they gave no shout when some of them laid him on a litter and others lowered another strong rope the cry again came up into a deathly silence raise softly but when they caught her at the brink then they shouted then they wept then they gave thanks to heaven then they kissed her feet then they kissed her dress then the dogs caressed her licked her icy hands and with their honest faces warmed her frozen bosom she broke from them all and sank over him on his litter with both her loving hands upon the heart that stood still act iv the clock lock the pleasant scene was neuchatel the pleasant month was april the pleasant place was a notary's office the pleasant person in it was the notary a rosy hearty handsome old man chief notary of neuchatel known far and wide in the canton as maitre voigt professionally and personally the notary was a popular citizen his innumerable kindnesses and his innumerable oddities had for years made him one of the recognised public characters of the pleasant swiss town his long brown frock coat and his black skull cap were among the institutions of the place and he carried a snuff box which in point of size was popularly believed to be without a parallel in europe there was another person in the notary's office not so pleasant as the notary this was obenreizer an oddly pastoral kind of office it was and one that would never have answered in england it stood in a neat back yard fenced off from a pretty flower garden goats browsed in the doorway and a cow was within half a dozen feet of keeping company with the clerk maitre voigt's room was a bright and varnished little room with panelled walls like a toy chamber according to the seasons of the year roses sunflowers hollyhocks peeped in at the windows maitre voigt's bees hummed through the office all the summer in at this window and out at that taking it frequently in their day's work as if honey were to be made from maitre voigt's sweet disposition a large musical box on the chimney piece often trilled away at the overture to fra diavolo or a selection from william tell with a chirruping liveliness that had to be stopped by force on the entrance of a client and irrepressibly broke out again the moment his back was turned courage courage my good fellow said maitre voigt patting obenreizer on the knee in a fatherly and comforting way you will begin a new life to morrow morning in my office here obenreizer dressed in mourning and subdued in manner lifted his hand with a white handkerchief in it to the region of his heart the gratitude is here he said but the words to express it are not here ta ta ta don't talk to me about gratitude said maitre voigt i hate to see a man oppressed i see you oppressed and i hold out my hand to you by instinct besides i am not too old yet to remember my young days your father sent me my first client it was on a question of half an acre of vineyard that seldom bore any grapes do i owe nothing to your father's son i owe him a debt of friendly obligation and i pay it to you that's rather neatly expressed i think added maitre voigt in high good humour with himself permit me to reward my own merit with a pinch of snuff obenreizer dropped his eyes to the ground as though he were not even worthy to see the notary take snuff do me one last favour sir he said when he raised his eyes do not act on impulse thus far you have only a general knowledge of my position hear the case for and against me in its details before you take me into your office let my claim on your benevolence be recognised by your sound reason as well as by your excellent heart in that case i may hold up my head against the bitterest of my enemies and build myself a new reputation on the ruins of the character i have lost as you will said maitre voigt you speak well my son you will be a fine lawyer one of these days the details are not many pursued obenreizer my troubles begin with the accidental death of my late travelling companion my lost dear friend mr vendale mr vendale repeated the notary just so i have heard and read of the name several times within these two months the name of the unfortunate english gentleman who was killed on the simplon when you got that scar upon your cheek and neck from my own knife said obenreizer touching what must have been an ugly gash at the time of its infliction from your own knife assented the notary and in trying to save him good good good that was very good vendale yes i have several times lately thought it droll that i should once have had a client of that name but the world sir returned obenreizer is so small nevertheless he made a mental note that the notary had once had a client of that name as i was saying sir the death of that dear travelling comrade begins my troubles what follows i save myself i go down to milan i am received with coldness by defresnier and company shortly afterwards i am discharged by defresnier and company why they give no reason why i ask do they assail my honour no answer i ask what is the imputation against me no answer i ask where are their proofs against me no answer i ask what am i to think the reply is 'm obenreizer is free to think what he will what m obenreizer thinks is of no importance to defresnier and company' and that is all perfectly that is all asserted the notary taking a large pinch of snuff but is that enough sir that is not enough said maitre voigt the house of defresnier are my fellow townsmen much respected much esteemed but the house of defresnier must not silently destroy a man's character you can rebut assertion but how can you rebut silence your sense of justice my dear patron answered obenreizer states in a word the cruelty of the case does it stop there no for what follows upon that true my poor boy said the notary with a comforting nod or two your ward rebels upon that rebels is too soft a word retorted obenreizer my ward revolts from me with horror my ward defies me my ward withdraws herself from my authority and takes shelter madame dor with her in the house of that english lawyer mr bintrey who replies to your summons to her to submit herself to my authority that she will not do so and who afterwards writes said the notary moving his large snuff box to look among the papers underneath it for the letter that he is coming to confer with me indeed replied obenreizer rather checked well sir have i no legal rights assuredly my poor boy returned the notary all but felons have their legal rights and who calls me felon said obenreizer fiercely no one be calm under your wrongs if the house of defresnier would call you felon indeed we should know how to deal with them while saying these words he had handed bintrey's very short letter to obenreizer who now read it and gave it back in saying observed obenreizer with recovered composure that he is coming to confer with you this english lawyer means that he is coming to deny my authority over my ward you think so i am sure of it i know him he is obstinate and contentious you will tell me my dear sir whether my authority is unassailable until my ward is of age absolutely unassailable i will enforce it i will make her submit herself to it for said obenreizer changing his angry tone to one of grateful submission i owe it to you sir to you who have so confidingly taken an injured man under your protection and into your employment make your mind easy said maitre voigt no more of this now and no thanks be here to morrow morning before the other clerk comes between seven and eight you will find me in this room and i will myself initiate you in your work go away go away i have letters to write i won't hear a word more dismissed with this generous abruptness and satisfied with the favourable impression he had left on the old man's mind obenreizer was at leisure to revert to the mental note he had made that maitre voigt once had a client whose name was vendale i ought to know england well enough by this time so his meditations ran as he sat on a bench in the yard and it is not a name i ever encountered there except he looked involuntarily over his shoulder as his name is the world so small that i cannot get away from him even now when he is dead he confessed at the last that he had betrayed the trust of the dead and misinherited a fortune and i was to see to it and i was to stand off that my face might remind him of it why my face unless it concerned me i am sure of his words for they have been in my ears ever since can there be anything bearing on them in the keeping of this old idiot anything to repair my fortunes and blacken his memory he dwelt upon my earliest remembrances that night at basle why unless he had a purpose in it maitre voigt's two largest he goats were butting at him to butt him out of the place as if for that disrespectful mention of their master so he got up and left the place but he walked alone for a long time on the border of the lake with his head drooped in deep thought between seven and eight next morning he presented himself again at the office he found the notary ready for him at work on some papers which had come in on the previous evening in a few clear words maitre voigt explained the routine of the office and the duties obenreizer would be expected to perform it still wanted five minutes to eight when the preliminary instructions were declared to be complete i will show you over the house and the offices said maitre voigt but i must put away these papers first they come from the municipal authorities and they must be taken special care of obenreizer saw his chance here of finding out the repository in which his employer's private papers were kept can't i save you the trouble sir he asked can't i put those documents away under your directions maitre voigt laughed softly to himself closed the portfolio in which the papers had been sent to him handed it to obenreizer suppose you try he said all my papers of importance are kept yonder he pointed to a heavy oaken door thickly studded with nails at the lower end of the room approaching the door with the portfolio obenreizer discovered to his astonishment that there were no means whatever of opening it from the outside there was no handle no bolt no key and climax of passive obstruction no keyhole there is a second door to this room said obenreizer appealing to the notary no said maitre voigt guess again there is a window nothing of the sort the window has been bricked up the only way in is the way by that door do you give it up cried maitre voigt in high triumph listen my good fellow and tell me if you hear nothing inside obenreizer listened for a moment and started back from the door i know he exclaimed i heard of this when i was apprenticed here at the watchmaker's perrin brothers have finished their famous clock lock at last and you have got it bravo said maitre voigt the clock lock it is there my son there you have one more of what the good people of this town call 'daddy voigt's follies' with all my heart let those laugh who win no thief can steal my keys no burglar can pick my lock no power on earth short of a battering ram or a barrel of gunpowder can move that door till my little sentinel inside my worthy friend who goes 'tick tick' as i tell him says 'open' the big door obeys the little tick tick and the little tick tick obeys me that cried daddy voigt snapping his fingers for all the thieves in christendom may i see it in action asked obenreizer pardon my curiosity dear sir you know that i was once a tolerable worker in the clock trade certainly you shall see it in action said maitre voigt what is the time now one minute to eight watch and in one minute you will see the door open of itself in one minute smoothly and slowly and silently as if invisible hands had set it free the heavy door opened inward and disclosed a dark chamber beyond on three sides shelves filled the walls from floor to ceiling arranged on the shelves were rows upon rows of boxes made in the pretty inlaid woodwork of switzerland and bearing inscribed on their fronts for the most part in fanciful coloured letters the names of the notary's clients maitre voigt lighted a taper and led the way into the room you shall see the clock he said proudly i possess the greatest curiosity in europe it is only a privileged few whose eyes can look at it i give the privilege to your good father's son you shall be one of the favoured few who enter the room with me see here it is on the right hand wall at the side of the door an ordinary clock exclaimed obenreizer no not an ordinary clock it has only one hand aha said maitre voigt not an ordinary clock my friend no no that one hand goes round the dial as i put it so it regulates the hour at which the door shall open see the hand points to eight at eight the door opened as you saw for yourself does it open more than once in the four and twenty hours asked obenreizer more than once repeated the notary with great scorn you don't know my good friend tick tick he will open the door as often as i ask him all he wants is his directions and he gets them here look below the dial here is a half circle of steel let into the wall and here is a hand called the regulator that travels round it just as my hand chooses notice if you please that there are figures to guide me on the half circle of steel figure i means open once in the four and twenty hours figure ii means open twice and so on to the end i set the regulator every morning after i have read my letters and when i know what my day's work is to be would you like to see me set it now what is to day wednesday good this is the day of our rifle club there is little business to do i grant a half holiday no work here to day after three o'clock let us first put away this portfolio of municipal papers there no need to trouble tick tick to open the door until eight to morrow good i leave the dial hand at eight i put back the regulator to i i close the door and closed the door remains past all opening by anybody till to morrow morning at eight obenreizer's quickness instantly saw the means by which he might make the clock lock betray its master's confidence and place its master's papers at his disposal stop sir he cried at the moment when the notary was closing the door don't i see something moving among the boxes on the floor there maitre voigt turned his back for a moment to look in that moment obenreizer's ready hand put the regulator on from the figure i to the figure ii unless the notary looked again at the half circle of steel the door would open at eight that evening as well as at eight next morning and nobody but obenreizer would know it there is nothing said maitre voigt your troubles have shaken your nerves my son some shadow thrown by my taper or some poor little beetle who lives among the old lawyer's secrets running away from the light hark i hear your fellow clerk in the office to work to work and build to day the first step that leads to your new fortunes he good humouredly pushed obenreizer out before him extinguished the taper with a last fond glance at his clock which passed harmlessly over the regulator beneath and closed the oaken door at three the office was shut up the notary and everybody in the notary's employment with one exception went to see the rifle shooting obenreizer had pleaded that he was not in spirits for a public festival nobody knew what had become of him it was believed that he had slipped away for a solitary walk the house and offices had been closed but a few minutes when the door of a shining wardrobe in the notary's shining room opened and obenreizer stopped out he walked to a window unclosed the shutters satisfied himself that he could escape unseen by way of the garden turned back into the room and took his place in the notary's easy chair he was locked up in the house and there were five hours to wait before eight o'clock came he wore his way through the five hours sometimes reading the books and newspapers that lay on the table sometimes thinking sometimes walking to and fro sunset came on he closed the window shutters before he kindled a light the candle lighted and the time drawing nearer and nearer he sat watch in hand with his eyes on the oaken door at eight smoothly and softly and silently the door opened one after another he read the names on the outer rows of boxes no such name as vendale he removed the outer row and looked at the row behind these were older boxes and shabbier boxes the four first that he examined were inscribed with french and german names the fifth bore a name which was almost illegible he brought it out into the room and examined it closely there covered thickly with time stains and dust was the name vendale the key hung to the box by a string he unlocked the box took out four loose papers that were in it spread them open on the table and began to read them he had not so occupied a minute when his face fell from its expression of eagerness and avidity to one of haggard astonishment and disappointment but after a little consideration he copied the papers he then replaced the papers replaced the box closed the door extinguished the candle and stole away as his murderous and thievish footfall passed out of the garden the steps of the notary and some one accompanying him stopped at the front door of the house the lamps were lighted in the little street and the notary had his door key in his hand pray do not pass my house mr bintrey he said do me the honour to come in it is one of our town half holidays our tir but my people will be back directly it is droll that you should ask your way to the hotel of me let us eat and drink before you go there thank you not to night said bintrey shall i come to you at ten to morrow i shall be enchanted sir to take so early an opportunity of redressing the wrongs of my injured client returned the good notary yes retorted bintrey your injured client is all very well but a word in your ear he whispered to the notary and walked off when the notary's housekeeper came home she found him standing at his door motionless with the key still in his hand and the door unopened obenreizer's victory the scene shifts again to the foot of the simplon on the swiss side in one of the dreary rooms of the dreary little inn at brieg mr bintrey and maitre voigt sat together at a professional council of two mr bintrey was searching in his despatch box maitre voigt was looking towards a closed door painted brown to imitate mahogany and communicating with an inner room isn't it time he was here asked the notary shifting his position and glancing at a second door at the other end of the room painted yellow to imitate deal he is here answered bintrey after listening for a moment the yellow door was opened by a waiter and obenreizer walked in after greeting maitre voigt with a cordiality which appeared to cause the notary no little embarrassment obenreizer bowed with grave and distant politeness to bintrey for what reason have i been brought from neuchatel to the foot of the mountain he inquired taking the seat which the english lawyer had indicated to him you shall be quite satisfied on that head before our interview is over returned bintrey for the present permit me to suggest proceeding at once to business there has been a correspondence mr obenreizer between you and your niece i am here to represent your niece in other words you a lawyer are here to represent an infraction of the law admirably put said bintrey if all the people i have to deal with were only like you what an easy profession mine would be i am here to represent an infraction of the law that is your point of view i am here to make a compromise between you and your niece that is my point of view there must be two parties to a compromise rejoined obenreizer i decline in this case to be one of them the law gives me authority to control my niece's actions until she comes of age she is not yet of age and i claim my authority at this point maitre attempted to speak bintrey silenced him with a compassionate indulgence of tone and manner as if he was silencing a favourite child no my worthy friend not a word don't excite yourself unnecessarily leave it to me he turned and addressed himself again to obenreizer i can think of nothing comparable to you mr obenreizer but granite and even that wears out in course of time in the interests of peace and quietness for the sake of your own dignity relax a little if you will only delegate your authority to another person whom i know of that person may be trusted never to lose sight of your niece night or day you are wasting your time and mine returned obenreizer if my niece is not rendered up to my authority within one week from this day i invoke the law if you resist the law i take her by force he rose to his feet as he said the last word maitre voigt looked round again towards the brown door which led into the inner room have some pity on the poor girl pleaded bintrey remember how lately she lost her lover by a dreadful death will nothing move you nothing bintrey in his turn rose to his feet and looked at maitre voigt maitre voigt's hand resting on the table began to tremble maitre voigt's eyes remained fixed as if by irresistible fascination on the brown door obenreizer suspiciously observing him looked that way too there is somebody listening in there he exclaimed with a sharp backward glance at bintrey there are two people listening answered bintrey who are they you shall see with this answer he raised his voice and spoke the next words the two common words which are on everybody's lips at every hour of the day come in the brown door opened supported on marguerite's arm his sun burnt colour gone his right arm bandaged and clung over his breast vendale stood before the murderer a man risen from the dead in the moment of silence that followed the singing of a caged bird in the court yard outside was the one sound stirring in the room maitre voigt touched bintrey and pointed to obenreizer look at him said the notary in a whisper the shock had paralysed every movement in the villain's body but the movement of the blood his face was like the face of a corpse the one vestige of colour left in it was a livid purple streak which marked the course of the scar where his victim had wounded him on the cheek and neck speechless breathless motionless alike in eye and limb it seemed as if at the sight of vendale the death to which he had doomed vendale had struck him where he stood somebody ought to speak to him said maitre voigt shall i even at that moment bintrey persisted in silencing the notary and in keeping the lead in the proceedings to himself checking maitre voigt by a gesture he dismissed marguerite and vendale in these words the object of your appearance here is answered he said if you will withdraw for the present it may help mr obenreizer to recover himself it did help him as the two passed through the door and closed it behind them he drew a deep breath of relief he looked round him for the chair from which he had risen and dropped into it give him time pleaded maitre voigt no said bintrey i don't know what use he may make of it if i do he turned once more to obenreizer and went on i owe it to myself he said i don't admit mind that i owe it to you to account for my appearance in these proceedings and to state what has been done under my advice and on my sole responsibility can you listen to me i can listen to you recall the time when you started for switzerland with mr vendale bintrey begin you had not left england four and twenty hours before your niece committed an act of imprudence which not even your penetration could foresee she followed her promised husband on his journey without asking anybody's advice or permission and without any better companion to protect her than a cellarman in mr vendale's employment why did she follow me on the journey and how came the cellarman to be the person who accompanied her she followed you on the journey answered bintrey because she suspected there had been some serious collision between you and mr vendale which had been kept secret from her and because she rightly believed you to be capable of serving your interests or of satisfying your enmity at the price of a crime as for the cellarman he was one among the other people in mr vendale's establishment to whom she had applied the moment your back was turned to know if anything had happened between their master and you the cellarman alone had something to tell her a senseless superstition and a common accident which had happened to his master in his master's cellar had connected mr vendale in this man's mind with the idea of danger by murder your niece surprised him into a confession which aggravated tenfold the terrors that possessed her aroused to a sense of the mischief he had done the man of his own accord made the one atonement in his power 'if my master is in danger miss' he said 'it's my duty to follow him too and it's more than my duty to take care of you' the two set forth together and for once a superstition has had its use it decided your niece on taking the journey and it led the way to saving a man's life do you understand me so far i understand you so far my first knowledge of the crime that you had committed pursued bintrey came to me in the form of a letter from your niece all you need know is that her love and her courage recovered the body of your victim and aided the after efforts which brought him back to life while he lay helpless at brieg under her care she wrote to me to come out to him before starting i informed madame dor that i knew miss obenreizer to be safe and knew where she was madame dor informed me in return that a letter had come for your niece which she knew to be in your handwriting i took possession of it and arranged for the forwarding of any other letters which might follow arrived at brieg i found mr vendale out of danger and at once devoted myself to hastening the day of reckoning with you defresnier and company turned you off on suspicion acting on information privately supplied by me having stripped you of your false character the next thing to do was to strip you of your authority over your niece to reach this end i not only had no scruple in digging the pitfall under your feet in the dark i felt a certain professional pleasure in fighting you with your own weapons by my advice the truth has been carefully concealed from you up to this day by my advice the trap into which you have walked was set for you you know why now as well as i do in this place there was but one certain way of shaking the devilish self control which has hitherto made you a formidable man that way has been tried and look at me as you may that way has succeeded the last thing that remains to be done concluded bintrey producing two little slips of manuscript from his despatch box is to set your niece free you have attempted murder and you have committed forgery and theft we have the evidence ready against you in both cases if you are convicted as a felon you know as well as i do what becomes of your authority over your niece personally i should have preferred taking that way out of it but considerations are pressed on me which i am not able to resist and this interview must end as i have told you already in a compromise sign those lines resigning all authority over miss obenreizer and pledging yourself never to be seen in england or in switzerland again and i will sign an indemnity which secures you against further proceedings on our part obenreizer took the pen in silence and signed his niece's release on receiving the indemnity in return he rose but made no movement to leave the room he stood looking at maitre voigt with a strange smile gathering at his lips and a strange light flashing in his filmy eyes what are you waiting for asked bintrey obenreizer pointed to the brown door call them back he answered i have something to say in their presence before i go say it in my presence retorted bintrey i decline to call them back obenreizer turned to maitre voigt do you remember telling me that you once had an english client named vendale he asked well answered the notary and what of that maitre voigt your clock lock has betrayed you what do you mean i have read the letters and certificates in your client's box i have taken copies of them i have got the copies here is there or is there not a reason for calling them back for a moment the notary looked to and fro between obenreizer and bintrey in helpless astonishment recovering himself he drew his brother lawyer aside and hurriedly spoke a few words close at his ear the face of bintrey after first faithfully reflecting the astonishment on the face of maitre voigt suddenly altered its expression he sprang with the activity of a young man to the door of the inner room entered it remained inside for a minute and returned followed by marguerite and vendale now mr obenreizer said bintrey the last move in the game is yours play it before i resign my position as that young lady's guardian said obenreizer i have a secret to reveal in which she is interested in making my disclosure i am not claiming her attention for a narrative which she or any other person present is expected to take on trust i am possessed of written proofs copies of originals the authenticity of which maitre voigt himself can attest bear that in mind and permit me to refer you at starting to a date long past the month of february in the year one thousand eight hundred and thirty six mark the date mr vendale said bintrey my first proof said obenreizer taking a paper from his pocket book copy of a letter written by an english lady married to her sister a widow the name of the person writing the letter i shall keep suppressed until i have done the name of the person to whom the letter is written i am willing to reveal it is addressed to 'mrs jane anne miller of groombridge wells england' vendale started and opened his lips to speak bintrey instantly stopped him as he had stopped maitre voigt no said the pertinacious lawyer leave it to me obenreizer went on it is needless to trouble you with the first half of the letter he said i can give the substance of it in two words the writer's position at the time is this she has been long living in switzerland with her husband obliged to live there for the sake of her husband's health they are about to move to a new residence on the lake of neuchatel in a week and they will be ready to receive mrs miller as visitor in a fortnight from that time this said the writer next enters into an important domestic detail she has been childless for years she and her husband have now no hope of children they are lonely they want an interest in life they have decided on adopting a child here the important part of the letter begins and here therefore i read it to you word for word he folded back the first page of the letter and read as follows will you help us my dear sister to realise our new project as english people we wish to adopt an english child this may be done i believe at the foundling my husband's lawyers in london will tell you how i leave the choice to you with only these conditions attached to it that the child is to be an infant under a year old and is to be a boy will you pardon the trouble i am giving you for my sake and will you bring our adopted child to us with your own children when you come to neuchatel i must add a word as to my husband's wishes in this matter he is resolved to spare the child whom we make our own any future mortification and loss of self respect which might be caused by a discovery of his true origin he will bear my husband's name and he will be brought up in the belief that he is really our son his inheritance of what we have to leave will be secured to him not only according to the laws of england in such cases but according to the laws of switzerland also for we have lived so long in this country that there is a doubt whether we may not be considered as i domiciled in switzerland the one precaution left to take is to prevent any after discovery at the foundling now our name is a very uncommon one and if we appear on the register of the institution as the persons adopting the child there is just a chance that something might result from it your name my dear is the name of thousands of other people and if you will consent to appear on the register there need be no fear of any discoveries in that quarter we are moving by the doctor's orders to a part of switzerland in which our circumstances are quite unknown and you as i understand are about to engage a new nurse for the journey when you come to see us under these circumstances the child may appear as my child brought back to me under my sister's care the only servant we take with us from our old home is my own maid who can be safely trusted as for the lawyers in england and in switzerland it is their profession to keep secrets and we may feel quite easy in that direction so there you have our harmless little conspiracy write by return of post my love and tell me you will join it do you still conceal the name of the writer of that letter asked vendale i keep the name of the writer till the last answered obenreizer and i proceed to my second proof a mere slip of paper this time as you see memorandum given to the swiss lawyer who drew the documents referred to in the letter i have just read expressed as follows 'adopted from the foundling hospital of england d march a male infant called in the institution walter wilding person appearing on the register as adopting the child mrs jane anne miller widow acting in this matter for her married sister domiciled in switzerland' patience resumed obenreizer as vendale breaking loose from bintrey started to his feet i shall not keep the name concealed much longer two more little slips of paper and i have done third proof certificate of doctor ganz still living in practice at neuchatel dated july the doctor certifies you shall read it for yourselves directly first that he attended the adopted child in its infant maladies second that three months before the date of the certificate the gentleman adopting the child as his son died third that on the date of the certificate his widow and her maid taking the adopted child with them left neuchatel on their return to england one more link now added to this and my chain of evidence is complete the maid remained with her mistress till her mistress's death only a few years since the maid can swear to the identity of the adopted infant from his childhood to his youth from his youth to his manhood as he is now there is her address in england and there mr vendale is the fourth and final proof why do you address yourself to me said vendale as obenreizer threw the written address on the table obenreizer turned on him in a sudden frenzy of triumph because you are the man if my niece marries you she marries a bastard brought up by public charity if my niece marries you she marries an impostor without name or lineage disguised in the character of a gentleman of rank and family bravo cried bintrey admirably put mr obenreizer it only wants one word more to complete it she marries thanks entirely to your exertions a man who inherits a handsome fortune and a man whose origin will make him prouder than ever of his peasant wife george vendale as brother executors let us congratulate each other our dear dead friend's last wish on earth is accomplished we have found the lost walter wilding as mr obenreizer said just now you are the man the words passed by vendale unheeded for the moment he was conscious of but one sensation he heard but one voice marguerite's hand was clasping his marguerite's voice was whispering to him i never loved you george as i love you now the curtain falls may day there is merry making in cripple corner the chimneys smoke the patriarchal dining hall is hung with garlands and mrs goldstraw the respected housekeeper is very busy for on this bright morning the young master of cripple corner is married to its young mistress far away to wit in the little town of brieg in switzerland lying at the foot of the simplon pass where she saved his life the bells ring gaily in the little town of brieg and flags are stretched across the street and rifle shots are heard and sounding music from brass instruments streamer decorated casks of wine have been rolled out under a gay awning in the public way before the inn and there will be free feasting and revelry what with bells and banners draperies hanging from windows explosion of gunpowder and reverberation of brass music the little town of brieg is all in a flutter like the hearts of its simple people it was a stormy night last night and the mountains are covered with snow but the sun is bright to day the sweet air is fresh the tin spires of the little town of brieg are burnished silver and the alps are ranges of far off white cloud in a deep blue sky the primitive people of the little town of brieg have built a greenwood arch across the street under which the newly married pair shall pass in triumph from the church it is inscribed on that side honour and love to marguerite vendale for the people are proud of her to enthusiasm this greeting of the bride under her new name is affectionately meant as a surprise and therefore the arrangement has been made that she unconscious why shall be taken to the church by a tortuous back way a scheme not difficult to carry into execution in the crooked little town of brieg so all things are in readiness and they are to go and come on foot assembled in the inn's best chamber festively adorned are the bride and bridegroom the neuchatel notary the london lawyer madame dor and a certain large mysterious englishman popularly known as monsieur zhoe ladelle and behold madame dor arrayed in a spotless pair of gloves of her own with no hand in the air but both hands clasped round the neck of the bride to embrace whom madame dor has turned her broad back on the company consistent to the last forgive me my beautiful pleads madame dor for that i ever was his she cat she cat madame dor engaged to sit watching my so charming mouse are the explanatory words of madame dor delivered with a penitential sob why you were our best friend george dearest tell madame dor was she not our best friend undoubtedly darling what should we have done without her you are both so generous cries madame dor accepting consolation and immediately relapsing but i commenced as a she cat ah but like the cat in the fairy story good madame dor says vendale saluting her cheek you were a true woman and being a true woman the sympathy of your heart was with true love i don't wish to deprive madame dor of her share in the embraces that are going on mr bintrey puts in watch in hand and i don't presume to offer any objection to your having got yourselves mixed together in the corner there like the three graces i merely remark that i think it's time we were moving what are your sentiments on that subject mr ladle clear sir replies joey with a gracious grin i'm clearer altogether sir for having lived so many weeks upon the surface i never was half so long upon the surface afore and it's done me a power of good at cripple corner i was too much below it atop of the simpleton i was a deal too high above it i've found the medium here sir and if ever i take it in convivial in all the rest of my days i mean to do it this day to the toast of 'bless 'em both' i too says bintrey and now monsieur voigt let you and me be two men of marseilles and allons marchons arm in arm they go down to the door where others are waiting for them and they go quietly to the church and the happy marriage takes place while the ceremony is yet in progress the notary is called out when it is finished he has returned is standing behind vendale and touches him on the shoulder go to the side door one moment monsieur vendale alone leave madame to me at the side door of the church are the same two men from the hospice they are snow stained and travel worn they wish him joy and then each lays his broad hand upon vendale's breast and one says in a low voice while the other steadfastly regards him it is here monsieur your litter the very same my litter is here why hush for the sake of madame your companion of that day what of him the man looks at his comrade and his comrade takes him up each keeps his hand laid earnestly on vendale's breast he had been living at the first refuge monsieur for some days the weather was now good now bad yes he arrived at our hospice the day before yesterday and having refreshed himself with sleep on the floor before the fire wrapped in his cloak was resolute to go on before dark to the next hospice he had a great fear of that part of the way and thought it would be worse to morrow yes he went on alone he had passed the gallery when an avalanche like that which fell behind you near the bridge of the ganther killed him we dug him out suffocated and broken all to pieces but monsieur as to madame we have brought him here on the litter to be buried we must ascend the street outside madame must not see it would be an accursed thing to bring the litter through the arch across the street until madame has passed through as you descend we who accompany the litter will set it down on the stones of the street the second to the right and will stand before it but do not let madame turn her head towards the street the second to the right there is no time to lose madame will be alarmed by your absence adieu vendale returns to his bride and draws her hand through his unmaimed arm a pretty procession awaits them at the main door of the church they take their station in it and descend the street amidst the ringing of the bells the firing of the guns the waving of the flags the playing of the music the shouts the smiles and tears of the excited town heads are uncovered as she passes hands are kissed to her all the people bless her heaven's benediction on the dear girl see where she goes in her youth and beauty she who so nobly saved his life near the corner of the street the second to the right he speaks to her and calls her attention to the windows on the opposite side the corner well passed he says do not look round my darling for a reason that i have and turns his head then looking back along the street he sees the litter and its bearers passing up alone under the arch as he and she and their marriage train go down towards the shining valley
