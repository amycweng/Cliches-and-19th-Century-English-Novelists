heart and science a story of the present time by wilkie collins to sarony of new york artist photographer and good friend i preface to readers in general you are the children of old mother england on both sides of the atlantic you form the majority of buyers and borrowers of novels and you judge of works of fiction by certain inbred preferences which but slightly influence the other great public of readers on the continent of europe the two qualities in fiction which hold the highest rank in your estimation are character and humour incident and dramatic situation only occupy the second place in your favour a novel that tells no story or that blunders perpetually in trying to tell a story a novel so entirely devoid of all sense of the dramatic side of human life that not even a theatrical thief can find anything in it to steal will nevertheless be a work that wins and keeps your admiration if it has humour which dwells on your memory and characters which enlarge the circle of your friends i have myself always tried to combine the different merits of a good novel in one and the same work and i have never succeeded in keeping an equal balance in the present story you will find the scales inclining on the whole in favour of character and humour this has not happened accidentally advancing years and health that stands sadly in need of improvement warn me if i am to vary my way of work that i may have little time to lose without waiting for future opportunities i have kept your standard of merit more constantly before my mind in writing this book than on some former occasions still persisting in telling you a story still refusing to get up in the pulpit and preach or to invade the platform and lecture or to take you by the buttonhole in confidence and make fun of my art it has been my chief effort to draw the characters with a vigour and breadth of treatment derived from the nearest and truest view that i could get of the one model nature whether i shall at once succeed in adding to the circle of your friends in the world of fiction or whether you will hurry through the narrative and only discover on a later reading that it is the characters which have interested you in the story remains to be seen either way your sympathy will find me grateful for either way my motive has been to please you during its periodical publication correspondents noting certain passages in heart and science inquired how i came to think of writing this book the question may be readily answered in better words than mine my book has been written in harmony with opinions which have an indisputable claim to respect let them speak for themselves shakespeare's opinion it was always yet the trick of our english nation if they have a good thing to make it too common king henry iv part ii walter scott's opinion i am no great believer in the extreme degree of improvement to be derived from the advancement of science for every study of that nature tends when pushed to a certain extent to harden the heart letter to miss edgeworth faraday's opinion the education of the judgment has for its first and its last step humility lecture on mental education at the royal institution having given my reasons for writing the book let me conclude by telling you what i have kept out of the book it encourages me to think that we have many sympathies in common and among them that most of us have taken to our hearts domestic pets writing under this conviction i have not forgotten my responsibility towards you and towards my art in pleading the cause of the harmless and affectionate beings of god's creation from first to last you are purposely left in ignorance of the hideous secrets of vivisection the outside of the laboratory is a necessary object in my landscape but i never once open the door and invite you to look in i trace in one of my characters the result of the habitual practice of cruelty no matter under what pretence in fatally deteriorating the nature of man and i leave the picture to speak for itself my own personal feeling has throughout been held in check thankfully accepting the assistance rendered to me by miss frances power cobbe by mrs h m gordon and by surgeon general gordon cb i have borne in mind as they have borne in mind the value of temperate advocacy to a good cause with this your servant withdraws and leaves you to the story ii to readers in particular if you are numbered among those good friends of ours who are especially capable of understanding us and sympathising with us be pleased to accept the expression of our gratitude and to pass over the lines that follow but if you open our books with a mind soured by distrust if you habitually anticipate inexcusable ignorance where the course of the story happens to turn on matters of fact it is you sir or madam whom i now want not to dispute with you far from it i own with sorrow that your severity does occasionally encounter us on assailable ground but there are exceptions even to the stiffest rules some of us are not guilty of wilful carelessness some of us apply to competent authority when we write on subjects beyond the range of our own experience having thus far ventured to speak for my colleagues you will conclude that i am paving the way for speaking next of myself as our cousins in the united states say that is so in the following pages there are allusions to medical practice at the bedside leading in due course to physiological questions which connect themselves with the main interest of the novel in traversing this delicate ground you have not been forgotten before the manuscript went to the printer it was submitted for correction to an eminent london surgeon whose experience extends over a period of forty years again a supposed discovery in connection with brain disease which occupies a place of importance is not as you may suspect the fantastic product of the author's imagination finding his materials everywhere he has even contrived to make use of professor ferrier writing on the localisation of cerebral disease and closing a confession of the present result of post mortem examination of brains in these words we cannot even be sure whether many of the changes discovered are the cause or the result of the disease or whether the two are the conjoint results of a common cause plenty of elbow room here for the spirit of discovery on becoming acquainted with mrs gallilee you will find her talking and you will sometimes even find the author talking of scientific subjects in general you will naturally conclude that it is all gross caricature no it is all promiscuous reading let me spare you a long list of books consulted and of newspapers and magazines mutilated for cuttings and appeal to examples once more and for the last time when mrs gallilee wonders whether carmina has ever heard of the diathermancy of ebonite she is thinking of proceedings at a conversazione in honour of professor helmholtz reported in the times of april at which radiant energy was indeed converted into sonorous vibrations again when she contemplates taking part in a discussion on matter she has been slily looking into chambers's encyclopaedia and has there discovered the interesting conditions on which she can dispense with the idea of atoms briefly not a word of my own invention occurs when mrs gallilee turns the learned side of her character to your worships' view i have now only to add that the story has been subjected to careful revision and i hope to consequent improvement in its present form of publication past experience has shown me that you have a sharp eye for slips of the pen and that you thoroughly enjoy convicting a novelist by post of having made a mistake whatever pains i may have taken to disappoint you it is quite likely that we may be again indebted to each other on this occasion so to our infinite relief on either side we part friends after all w c london april chapter i the weary old nineteenth century had advanced into the last twenty years of its life towards two o'clock in the afternoon ovid vere of the royal college of surgeons stood at the window of his consulting room in london looking out at the summer sunshine and the quiet dusty street he had received a warning familiar to the busy men of our time the warning from overwrought nature which counsels rest after excessive work with a prosperous career before him he had been compelled at only thirty one years of age to ask a colleague to take charge of his practice and to give the brain which he had cruelly wearied a rest of some months to come on the next day he had arranged to embark for the mediterranean in a friend's yacht an active man devoted heart and soul to his profession is not a man who can learn the happy knack of being idle at a moment's notice ovid found the mere act of looking out of window and wondering what he should do next more than he had patience to endure he turned to his study table if he had possessed a wife to look after him he would have been reminded that he and his study table had nothing in common under present circumstances being deprived of conjugal superintendence he broke though his own rules his restless hand unlocked a drawer and took out a manuscript work on medicine of his own writing surely he thought i may finish a chapter before i go to sea to morrow his head steady enough while he was only looking out of window began to swim before he had got to the bottom of a page the last sentences of the unfinished chapter alluded to a matter of fact which he had not yet verified in emergencies of any sort he was a patient man and a man of resource the necessary verification could be accomplished by a visit to the college of surgeons situated in the great square called lincoln's inn fields here was a motive for a walk with an occupation at the end of it which only involved a question to a curator and an examination of a specimen he locked up his manuscript and set forth for lincoln's inn fields chapter ii when two friends happen to meet in the street do they ever look back along the procession of small circumstances which has led them both from the starting point of their own houses to the same spot at the same time not one man in ten thousand has probably ever thought of making such a fantastic inquiry as this and consequently not one man in ten thousand living in the midst of reality has discovered that he is also living in the midst of romance from the moment when the young surgeon closed the door of his house he was walking blindfold on his way to a patient in the future who was personally still a stranger to him he never reached the college of surgeons he never embarked on his friend's yacht what were the obstacles which turned him aside from the course that he had in view nothing but a series of trivial circumstances occurring in the experience of a man who goes out for a walk he had only reached the next street when the first of the circumstances presented itself in the shape of a friend's carriage which drew up at his side a bright benevolent face encircled by bushy white whiskers looked out of the window and a hearty voice asked him if he had completed his arrangements for a long holiday having replied to this ovid had a question to put on his side how is our patient sir richard out of danger and what do the other doctors say now sir richard laughed they say it's my luck not convinced yet not in the least who has ever succeeded in convincing fools let's try another subject is your mother reconciled to your new plans i can hardly tell you my mother is in a state of indescribable agitation her brother's will has been found in italy and his daughter may arrive in england at a moment's notice unmarried sir richard asked slyly i don't know any money ovid smiled not cheerfully do you think my poor mother would be in a state of indescribable agitation if there was not money sir richard was one of those obsolete elderly persons who quote shakespeare ah well he said your mother is like kent in king lear she's too old to learn is she as fond as ever of lace and as keen as ever after a bargain he handed a card out of the carriage window i have just seen an old patient of mine he resumed in whom i feel a friendly interest she is retiring from business by my advice and she asks me of all the people in the world to help her in getting rid of some wonderful 'remnants' at 'an alarming sacrifice' my kind regards to your mother and there's a chance for her one last word ovid don't be in too great a hurry to return to work you have plenty of spare time before you look at my wise dog here on the front seat and learn from him to be idle and happy the great physician had another companion besides his dog a friend bound his way had accepted a seat in the carriage who is that handsome young man the friend asked as they drove away he is the only son of a relative of mine dead many years since sir richard replied don't forget that you have seen him may i ask why he has not yet reached the prime of life and he is on the way already far on the way to be one of the foremost men of his time with a private fortune he has worked as few surgeons work who have their bread to get by their profession the money comes from his late father his mother has married again the second husband is a lazy harmless old fellow named gallilee possessed of one small attraction fifty thousand pounds grubbed up in trade there are two little daughters by the second marriage with such a stepfather as i have described and between ourselves with a mother who has rather more than her fair share of the jealous envious and money loving propensities of humanity my friend ovid is not diverted by family influences from the close pursuit of his profession you will tell me he may marry well if he gets a good wife she will be a circumstance in his favour but so far as i know he is not that sort of man cooler a deal cooler with women than i am though i am old enough to be his father let us get back to his professional prospects you heard him ask me about a patient yes very good death was knocking hard at that patient's door when i called ovid into consultation with myself and with two other doctors who differed with me it was one of the very rare cases in which the old practice of bleeding was to my mind the only treatment to pursue i never told him that this was the point in dispute between me and the other men and they said nothing on their side at my express request he took his time to examine and think and he saw the chance of saving the patient by venturing on the use of the lancet as plainly as i did with my forty years' experience to teach me a young man with that capacity for discovering the remote cause of disease and with that superiority to the trammels of routine in applying the treatment has no common medical career before him his holiday will set his health right in next to no time i see nothing in his way at present not even a woman but said sir richard with the explanatory wink of one eye peculiar like quotation from shakespeare to persons of the obsolete old time we know better than to forecast the weather if a petticoat influence appears on the horizon one prediction however i do risk if his mother buys any of that lace i know who will get the best of the bargain the conditions under which the old doctor was willing to assume the character of a prophet never occurred ovid remembered that he was going away on a long voyage and ovid was a good son he bought some of the lace as a present to his mother at parting and most assuredly he got the worst of the bargain his shortest way back to the straight course from which he had deviated in making his purchase led him into a by street near the flower and fruit market of covent garden here he met with the second in number of the circumstances which attended his walk he found himself encountered by an intolerably filthy smell the market was not out of the direct way to lincoln's inn fields he fled from the smell to the flowery and fruity perfumes of covent garden and completed the disinfecting process by means of a basket of strawberries why did a poor ragged little girl carrying a big baby look with such longing eyes at the delicious fruit that as a kind hearted man he had no alternative but to make her a present of the strawberries why did two dirty boyfriends of hers appear immediately afterwards with news of punch in a neighbouring street and lead the little girl away with them why did these two new circumstances inspire him with a fear that the boys might take the strawberries away from the poor child burdened as she was with a baby almost as big as herself when we suffer from overwrought nerves we are easily disturbed by small misgivings the idle man of wearied mind followed the friends of the street drama to see what happened forgetful of the college of surgeons and finding a new fund of amusement in himself arrived in the neighbouring street he discovered that the punch performance had come to an end like some other dramatic performances of higher pretensions for want of a paying audience he waited at a certain distance watching the children his doubts had done them an injustice the boys only said give us a taste and the liberal little girl rewarded their good conduct an equitable and friendly division of the strawberries was made in a quiet corner where always excepting the case of a miser or a millionaire is the man to be found who could have returned to the pursuit of his own affairs under these circumstances without encouraging the practice of the social virtues by a present of a few pennies ovid was not that man putting back in his breast pocket the bag in which he was accustomed to carry small coins for small charities his hand touched something which felt like the envelope of a letter he took it out looked at it with an expression of annoyance and surprise and once more turned aside from the direct way to lincoln's inn fields the envelope contained his last prescription having occasion to consult the pharmacopoeia he had written it at home and had promised to send it to the patient immediately in the absorbing interest of making his preparations for leaving england it had remained forgotten in his pocket for nearly two days the one means of setting this unlucky error right without further delay was to deliver his prescription himself and to break through his own rules for the second time by attending to a case of illness purely as an act of atonement the patient lived in a house nearly opposite to the british museum in this northward direction he now set his face he made his apologies and gave his advice and getting out again into the street tried once more to shape his course for the college of surgeons passing the walled garden of the british museum he looked towards it and paused what had stopped him this time nothing but a tree fluttering its bright leaves in the faint summer air a marked change showed itself in his face the moment before he had been passing in review the curious little interruptions which had attended his walk and had wondered humorously what would happen next two women meeting him and seeing a smile on his lips had said to each other there goes a happy man if they had encountered him now they might have reversed their opinion they would have seen a man thinking of something once dear to him in the far and unforgotten past he crossed over the road to the side street which faced the garden his head drooped he moved mechanically arrived in the street he lifted his eyes and stood within nearer view of it looking at the tree hundreds of miles away from london under another tree of that gentle family this man so cold to women in after life had made child love in the days of his boyhood to a sweet little cousin long since numbered with the dead the present time with its interests and anxieties passed away like the passing of a dream little by little as the minutes followed each other his sore heart felt a calming influence breathed mysteriously from the fluttering leaves still forgetful of the outward world he wandered slowly up the street living in the old scenes thinking not unhappily now the old thoughts where in all london could he have found a solitude more congenial to a dreamer in daylight the broad district stretching northward and eastward from the british museum is like the quiet quarter of a country town set in the midst of the roaring activities of the largest city in the world here you can cross the road without putting limb or life in peril here when you are idle you can saunter and look about safe from collision with merciless straight walkers whose time is money and whose destiny is business here you may meet undisturbed cats on the pavement in the full glare of noontide and may watch through the railings of the squares children at play on grass that almost glows with the lustre of the sussex downs this haven of rest is alike out of the way of fashion and business and is yet within easy reach of the one and the other ovid paused in a vast and silent square if his little cousin had lived he might perhaps have seen his children at play in some such secluded place as this the birds were singing blithely in the trees a tradesman's boy delivering fish to the cook and two girls watering flowers at a window were the only living creatures near him as he roused himself and looked around where was the college where were the curator and the specimen those questions brought with them no feeling of anxiety or surprise he turned in a half awakened way without a wish or a purpose turned and listlessly looked back two foot passengers dressed in mourning garments were rapidly approaching him one of them as they came nearer proved to be an aged woman the other was a girl he drew aside to let them pass they looked at him with the lukewarm curiosity of strangers as they went by the girl's eyes and his met only the glance of an instant and its influence held him for life she went swiftly on as little impressed by the chance meeting as the old woman at her side without stopping to think without being capable of thought ovid followed them never before had he done what he was doing now he was literally out of himself he saw them ahead of him and he saw nothing else towards the middle of the square they turned aside into a street on the left a concert hall was in the street with doors open for an afternoon performance they entered the hall still out of himself ovid followed them chapter iii a room of magnificent size furnished with every conventional luxury that money can buy lavishly provided with newspapers and books of reference lighted by tall windows in the day time and by gorgeous chandeliers at night may be nevertheless one of the dreariest places of rest and shelter that can be found on the civilised earth such places exist by hundreds in those hotels of monstrous proportions and pretensions which now engulf the traveller who ends his journey on the pier or the platform it may be that we feel ourselves to be strangers among strangers it may be that there is something innately repellent in splendid carpets and curtains chairs and tables which have no social associations to recommend them it may be that the mind loses its elasticity under the inevitable restraint on friendly communication which expresses itself in lowered tones and instinctive distrust of our next neighbour but this alone is certain life in the public drawing room of a great hotel is life with all its healthiest emanations perishing in an exhausted receiver on the same day and nearly at the same hour when ovid had left his house two women sat in a corner of the public room in one of the largest of the railway hotels latterly built in london without observing it themselves they were objects of curiosity to their fellow travellers they spoke to each other in a foreign language they were dressed in deep mourning with an absence of fashion and a simplicity of material which attracted the notice of every other woman in the room one of them wore a black veil over her gray hair her hands were brown and knotty at the joints her eyes looked unnaturally bright for her age innumerable wrinkles crossed and re crossed her skinny face and her aquiline nose as one of the ladies present took occasion to remark was so disastrously like the nose of the great duke of wellington as to be an offensive feature in the face of a woman the lady's companion being a man took a more merciful view she can't help being ugly he whispered but see how she looks at the girl with her a good old creature i say if ever there was one yet the lady eyed him as only a jealous woman can eye her husband and whispered back of course you're in love with that slip of a girl she was a slip of a girl and not even a tall slip at seventeen years of age it was doubtful whether she would ever grow to a better height but a girl who is too thin and not even so tall as the venus de' medici may still be possessed of personal attractions it was not altogether a matter of certainty in this case that the attractions were sufficiently remarkable to excite general admiration the fine colour and the plump healthy cheeks the broad smile and the regular teeth the well developed mouth and the promising bosom which form altogether the average type of beauty found in the purely bred english maiden were not among the noticeable charms of the small creature in gloomy black shrinking into a corner of the big room she had very little colour of any sort to boast of her hair was of so light a brown that it just escaped being flaxen but it had the negative merit of not being forced down to her eyebrows and twisted into the hideous curly wig which exhibits a liberal equality of ugliness on the heads of women in the present day there was a delicacy of finish in her features in the nose and the lips especially a sensitive changefulness in the expression of her eyes too dark in themselves to be quite in harmony with her light hair and a subtle yet simple witchery in her rare smile which atoned in some degree at least for want of complexion in the face and of flesh in the figure men might dispute her claims to beauty but no one could deny that she was in the common phrase an interesting person grace and refinement a quickness of apprehension and a vivacity of movement suggestive of some foreign origin a childish readiness of wonder in the presence of new objects and perhaps under happier circumstances a childish playfulness with persons whom she loved were all characteristic attractions of the modest stranger who was in the charge of the ugly old woman and who was palpably the object of that wrinkled duenna's devoted love a travelling writing case stood open on a table near them in an interval of silence the girl looked at it reluctantly they had been talking of family affairs and had spoken in italian so as to keep their domestic secrets from the ears of the strangers about them the old woman was the first to resume the conversation my carmina you really ought to write that letter she said the illustrious mrs gallilee is waiting to hear of our arrival in london carmina took up the pen and put it down again with a sigh we only arrived last night she pleaded dear old teresa let us have one day in london by ourselves teresa received this proposal with undisguised amazement and alarm jesu maria a day in london and your aunt waiting for you all the time she is your second mother my dear by appointment and her house is your new home and you propose to stop a whole day at an hotel instead of going home impossible write my carmina write see here is the address on a card 'fairfield gardens' what a pretty place it must be to live in with such a name as that and a sweet lady no doubt come come but carmina still resisted i have never even seen my aunt she said it is dreadful to pass my life with a stranger remember i was only a child when you came to us after my mother's death it is hardly six months yet since i lost my father i have no one but you and when i go to this new home you will leave me i only ask for one more day to be together before we part the poor old duenna drew back out of sight in the shadow of a curtain and began to cry carmina took her hand under cover of a tablecloth carmina knew how to console her we will go and see sights she whispered and when dinner time comes you shall have a glass of the porto porto wine teresa looked round out of the shadow as easily comforted as a child sights she exclaimed and dried her tears porto porto wine she repeated and smacked her withered lips at the relishing words ah my child you have not forgotten the consolations i told you of when i lived in london in my young days to think of you with an english father and never in london till now i used to go to museums and concerts sometimes when my english mistress was pleased with me that gracious lady often gave me a glass of the fine strong purple wine the holy virgin grant that aunt gallilee may be as kind a woman such a head of hair as the other one she cannot hope to have it was a joy to dress it do you think i wouldn't stay here in england with you if i could what is to become of my old man in italy with his cursed asthma and nobody to nurse him oh but those were dull years in london the black endless streets the dreadful sundays the hundreds of thousands of people always in a hurry always with grim faces set on business business business i was glad to go back and be married in italy and here i am in london again after god knows how many years no matter we will enjoy ourselves to day and when we go to madam gallilee's to morrow we will tell a little lie and say we only arrived on the evening that has not yet come the duenna's sense of humour was so tickled by this prospective view of the little lie that she leaned back in her chair and laughed carmina's rare smile showed itself faintly the terrible first interview with the unknown aunt still oppressed her she took up a newspaper in despair oh my old dear she said let us get out of this dreadful room and be reminded of italy teresa lifted her ugly hands in bewilderment reminded of italy in london is there no italian music in london carmina asked suggestively the duenna's bright eyes answered this in their own language she snatched up the nearest newspaper it was then the height of the london concert season morning performances of music were announced in rows reading the advertised programmes carmina found them in one remarkable respect all alike they would have led an ignorant stranger to wonder whether any such persons as italian composers french composers and english composers had ever existed the music offered to the english public was music of exclusively german and for the most part modern german origin carmina held the opinion in common with mozart and rossini as well as other people that music without melody is not music at all she laid aside the newspaper the plan of going to a concert being thus abandoned the idea occurred to them of seeing pictures teresa in search of information tried her luck at a great table in the middle of the room on which useful books were liberally displayed she returned with a catalogue of the royal academy exhibition which someone had left on the table and with the most universally well informed book on a small scale that has ever enlightened humanity modestly described on the title page as an almanac carmina opened the catalogue at the first page and discovered a list of royal academicians were all these gentlemen celebrated painters out of nearly forty names three only had made themselves generally known beyond the limits of england she turned to the last page the works of art on show numbered more than fifteen hundred teresa looking over her shoulder made the same discovery our heads will ache and our feet will ache she remarked before we get out of that place carmina laid aside the catalogue teresa opened the almanac at hazard and hit on the page devoted to amusements her next discovery led her to the section inscribed museums she scored an approving mark at that place with her thumbnail and read the list in fluent broken english the british museum teresa's memory of that magnificent building recalled it vividly in one respect she shook her head more headache and footache there bethnal green indian museum college of surgeons practical geology south kensington patent museum all unknown to teresa the saints preserve us what headaches and footaches in all these if they are as big as that other one she went on with the list and astonished everybody in the room by suddenly clapping her hands sir john soane's museum lincoln's inn fields ah but i remember that a nice little easy museum in a private house and all sorts of pretty things to see my dear love trust your old teresa come to soane in ten minutes more they were dressed and on the steps of the hotel the bright sunlight the pleasant air invited them to walk on the same afternoon when ovid had set forth on foot for lincoln's inn fields carmina and teresa set forth on foot for lincoln's inn fields trivial obstacles had kept the man away from the college would trivial obstacles keep the women away from the museum they crossed the strand and entered a street which led out of it towards the north teresa's pride in her memory forbidding her thus far to ask their way their talk dwelling at first on italy and on the memory of carmina's italian mother reverted to the formidable subject of mrs gallilee teresa's hopeful view of the future turned to the cousins and drew the picture of two charming little girls eagerly waiting to give their innocent hearts to their young relative from italy are there only two she said surely you told me there was a boy besides the girls carmina set her right my cousin ovid is a great doctor she continued with an air of importance poor papa used to say that our family would have reason to be proud of him does he live at home asked simple teresa oh dear no he has a grand house of his own hundreds of sick people go there to be cured and give hundreds of golden guineas hundreds of golden guineas gained by only curing sick people represented to teresa's mind something in the nature of a miracle she solemnly raised her eyes to heaven what a cousin to have is he young is he handsome is he married instead of answering these questions carmina looked over her shoulder is this poor creature following us she asked they had now turned to the right and had entered a busy street leading directly to covent garden the creature who was undoubtedly following them was one of the starved and vagabond dogs of london every now and then the sympathies of their race lead these inveterate wanderers to attach themselves for the time to some human companion whom their mysterious insight chooses from the crowd teresa with the hard feeling towards animals which is one of the serious defects of the italian character cried ah the mangy beast and lifted her umbrella the dog starred back waited a moment and followed them again as they went on carmina's gentle heart gave its pity to this lost and hungry fellow creature i must buy that poor dog something to eat she said and stopped suddenly as the idea struck her the dog accustomed to kicks and curses was ignorant of kindness following close behind her when she checked herself he darted away in terror into the road a cab was driven by rapidly at the same moment the wheel passed over the dog's neck and there was an end as a man remarked looking on of the troubles of a cur this common accident struck the girl's sensitive nature with horror helpless and speechless she trembled piteously the nearest open door was the door of a music seller's shop teresa led her in and asked for a chair and a glass of water the proprietor feeling the interest in carmina which she seldom failed to inspire among strangers went the length of offering her a glass of wine preferring water she soon recovered herself sufficiently to be able to leave her chair may i change my mind about going to the museum she said to her companion after what has happened i hardly feel equal to looking at curiosities teresa's ready sympathy tried to find some acceptable alternative music would be better wouldn't it she suggested the so called italian opera was open that night and the printed announcement of the performance was in the shop they both looked at it fortune was still against them a german opera appeared on the bill carmina turned to the music seller in despair is there no music sir but german music to be heard in london she asked the hospitable shopkeeper produced a concert programmed for that afternoon the modest enterprise of an obscure piano forte teacher who could only venture to address pupils patrons and friends what did he promise among other things music from lucia music from norma music from ernani teresa made another approving mark with her thumb nail and carmina purchased tickets the music seller hurried to the door to stop the first empty cab that might pass carmina showed a deplorable ignorance of the law of chances she shrank from the bare idea of getting into a cab we may run over some other poor creature she said if it isn't a dog it may be a child next time teresa and the music seller suggested a more reasonable view as gravely as they could carmina humbly submitted to the claims of common sense without yielding for all that i know i'm wrong she confessed don't spoil my pleasure i can't do it the strange parallel was now complete bound for the same destination carmina and ovid had failed to reach it alike and carmina had stopped to look at the garden of the british museum before she overtook ovid in the quiet square chapter iv if on entering the hall ovid had noticed the placards he would have found himself confronted by a coincidence the person who gave the concert was also the person who taught music to his half sisters not many days since he had himself assisted the enterprise by taking a ticket at his mother's request seeing nothing remembering nothing hurried by the fear of losing sight of the two strangers if there was a large audience he impatiently paid for another ticket at the doors the room was little more than half full and so insufficiently ventilated that the atmosphere was oppressive even under those circumstances he easily discovered the two central chairs in the midway row of seats which she and her companion had chosen there was a vacant chair among many others at one extremity of the row in front of them he took that place to look at her without being discovered there so far was the beginning and the end of his utmost desire the performances had already begun so long as her attention was directed to the singers and players on the platform he could feast his eyes on her with impunity in an unoccupied interval she looked at the audience and discovered him had he offended her if appearances were to be trusted he had produced no impression of any sort she quietly looked away towards the other side of the room the mere turning of her head was misinterpreted by ovid as an implied rebuke he moved to the row of seats behind her she was now nearer to him than she had been yet he was again content and more than content the next performance was a solo on the piano a round of applause welcomed the player ovid looked at the platform for the first time in the bowing man with a prematurely bald head and a servile smile he recognized mrs gallilee's music master the inevitable inference followed his mother might be in the room after careful examination of the scanty audience he failed to discover her thus far she would certainly arrive nevertheless my money's worth for my money was a leading principle in mrs gallilee's life he sighed as he looked towards the door of entrance not for long had he revelled in the luxury of a new happiness he had openly avowed his dislike of concerts when his mother had made him take a ticket for this concert with her quickness of apprehension what might she not suspect if she found him among the audience come what might of it he still kept his place he still feasted his eyes on the slim figure of the young girl on the gentle yet spirited carriage of her head but the pleasure was no longer pleasure without alloy his mother had got between them now the solo on the piano came to an end in the interval that followed he turned once more towards the entrance just as he was looking away again he heard mrs gallilee's loud voice she was administering a maternal caution to one of the children behave better here than you behaved in the carriage or i shall take you away if she found him in his present place if she put her own clever construction on what she saw her opinion would assuredly express itself in some way she was one of those women who can insult another woman and safely disguise it by an inquiring look for the girl's sake ovid instantly moved away from her to the seats at the back of the hall mrs gallilee made a striking entrance dressed to perfection powdered and painted to perfection leading her daughters and followed by her governess the usher courteously indicated places near the platform mrs galilee astonished him by a little lecture on acoustics delivered with the sweetest condescension her christian humility smiled and call the usher sir sound sir is most perfectly heard towards the centre of the auditorium she led the way towards the centre vacant places invited her to the row of seats occupied by carmina and teresa she the unknown aunt seated herself next to the unknown niece they looked at each other perhaps it was the heat of the room perhaps she had not perfectly recovered the nervous shock of seeing the dog killed carmina's head sank on good teresa's shoulder she had fainted chapter v may i ask for a cup of tea miss minerva delighted i'm sure mr le frank and was mrs gallilee pleased with the concert charmed mr le frank shook his head i am afraid there was a drawback he suggested you forget the lady who fainted so alarming to the audience so disagreeable to the artists take care mr le frank these new houses are flimsily built they might hear you upstairs the fainting lady is upstairs all the elements of a romance are upstairs is your tea to your liking in this playfully provocative manner miss minerva the governess trifled with the curiosity of mr le frank the music master as the proverbial cat trifles with the terror of the captive mouse the man of the bald head and the servile smile showed a polite interest in the coming disclosure he opened his deeply sunk eyes and lazily lifted his delicate eyebrows he had called at mrs gallilee's house after the concert to get a little tea with a large infusion of praise in the schoolroom a striking personal contrast confronted him in the face of the lady who was dispensing the hospitalities of the table mr le frank's plump cheeks were in colour of the obtrusively florid sort the relics of yellow hair still adhering to the sides of his head looked as silkily frail as spun glass his noble beard made amends for his untimely baldness the glossy glory of it exhaled delicious perfumes the keenest eyes might have tried in vain to discover a hair that was out of place miss minerva's eager sallow face so lean and so hard and so long looked by contrast as if it wanted some sort of discreet covering thrown over some part of it her coarse black hair projected like a penthouse over her bushy black eyebrows and her keen black eyes oh dear me as they said in the servants' hall she would never be married so yellow and so learned so ugly and so poor and yet if mystery is interesting this was an interesting woman the people about her felt an uneasy perception of something secret ominously secret in the nature of the governess which defied detection if inquisitive science vowed to medical research could dissect firmness of will working at its steadiest repressive action then the mystery of miss minerva's inner nature might possibly have been revealed as it was nothing more remarkable exposed itself to view than an irritable temper serving perhaps as safety valve to an underlying explosive force which with strong enough temptation and sufficient opportunity might yet break out gently mr le frank the tea is hot you may burn your mouth how am i to tell you what has happened miss minerva dropped the playfully provocative tone with infinite tact exactly at the right moment just imagine she resumed a scene on the stage occurring in private life the lady who fainted at your concert turns out to be no less a person that mrs gallilee's niece the general folly which reads a prospectus and blindly speculates in shares is matched by the equally diffused stupidity which is incapable of discovering that there can be any possible relation between fiction and truth say it's in a novel and you are a fool if you believe it say it's in a newspaper and you are a fool if you doubt it mr le frank following the general example followed it on this occasion a little too unreservedly he avowed his doubts of the circumstance just related although it was on the authority of a lady a circumstance occurring in real life far from being offended miss minerva cordially sympathized with him it is too theatrical to be believed she admitted but this fainting young person is positively the interesting stranger we have been expecting from italy you know mrs gallilee hers was the first smelling bottle produced hers was the presence of mind which suggested a horizontal position 'help the heart' she said 'don't impede it' the whole theory of fainting fits in six words in another moment proceeded the governess making a theatrical point without suspecting it in another moment mrs gallilee herself stood in need of the smelling bottle mr le frank was not a true believer even yet you don't mean she fainted he said miss minerva held up the indicative forefinger with which she emphasized instruction when her pupils required rousing mrs gallilee's strength of mind as i was about to say if you had listened to me resisted the shock what the effort must have cost her you will presently understand our interesting young lady was accompanied by a hideous old foreign woman who completely lost her head she smacked her hands distractedly she called on the saints without producing the slightest effect but she mixed up a name remarkable even in italy with the rest of the delirium and that was serious put yourself in mrs gallilee's place i couldn't do it said mr le frank with humility miss minerva passed over this reply without notice perhaps she was not a believer in the humility of musicians the young lady's christian name she proceeded is carmina put the accent if you please on the first syllable the moment mrs gallilee heard the name it struck her like a blow she enlightened the old woman and asserted herself as miss carmina's aunt in an instant 'i am mrs gallilee' that was all she said the result miss minerva paused and pointed to the ceiling the result is up there our charming guest was on the sofa and the hideous old nurse was fanning her when i had the honour of seeing them just now no mr le frank i haven't done yet there is a last act in this drama of private life still to relate a medical gentleman was present at the concert who offered his services in reviving miss carmina the same gentleman is now in attendance on the interesting patient can you guess who he is mr le frank had sold a ticket for his concert to the medical adviser of the family one mr null a cautious guess in this direction seemed to offer the likeliest chance of success he is a patron of music the pianist began he hates music the governess interposed i mean mr null mr le frank persisted i mean miss minerva paused like the cat with the mouse again i mean mr ovid vere what form the music master's astonishment might have assumed may be matter for speculation it was never destined to become matter of fact at the moment when miss minerva overwhelmed him with the climax of her story a little rosy elderly gentleman with a round face a sweet smile and a curly gray head walked into the room accompanied by two girls persons of small importance only mr gallilee and his daughters how d'ye do mr le frank i hope you got plenty of money by the concert i gave away my own two tickets you will excuse me i'm sure music i can't think why always sends me to sleep here are your two pupils miss minerva safe and sound it struck me we were rather in the way when that sweet young creature was brought home sadly in want of quiet poor thing not in want of us mrs gallilee and ovid so clever and attentive were just the right people in the right place so i put on my hat i'm always available mr le frank i have the great advantage of never having anything to do and i said to the girls 'let's have a walk' we had no particular place to go to that's another advantage of mine so we drifted about i didn't mean it but somehow or other we stopped at a pastry cook's shop what was the name of the pastry cook so far mr gallilee proceeded speaking in the oddest self contradictory voice if such a description is permissible a voice at once high in pitch and mild in tone in short as mr le frank once professionally remarked a soft falsetto when the good gentleman paused to make his little effort of memory his eldest daughter aged twelve and always ready to distinguish herself saw her opportunity and took the rest of the narrative into her own hands miss maria named after her mother was one of the successful new products of the age we live in the conventionally charming child who has never been smacked possessed of the large round eyes that we see in pictures and the sweet manners and perfect principles that we read of in books she called everybody dear she knew to a nicety how much oxygen she wanted in the composition of her native air and alas poor wretch she had never wetted her shoes or dirtied her face since the day when she was born dear miss minerva said maria the pastry cook's name was timbal we have had ices his mind being now set at rest on the subject of the pastry cook mr gallilee turned to his youngest daughter aged ten and one of the unsuccessful products of the age we live in this was a curiously slow quaint self contained child the image of her father with an occasional reflection of his smile incurably stupid or incurably perverse the friends of the family were not quite sure which whether she might have been over crammed with useless knowledge was not a question in connection with the subject which occurred to anybody rouse yourself zo said mr gallilee what did we have besides ices zoe known to her father by vulgar abbreviation as zo took mr gallilee's stumpy red hand and held hard by it as if that was the one way in which a dull child could rouse herself with a prospect of success i've had so many of them she said i don't know ask maria maria responded with the sweetest readiness dear zoe you are so slow cheesecakes mr gallilee patted zoe's head as encouragingly as if she had discovered the right answer by herself that's right ices and cheese cakes he said we tried cream ice and then we tried water ice the children miss minerva preferred the cream ice and do you know i'm of their opinion there's something in a cream ice what do you think yourself of cream ices mr le frank it was one among the many weaknesses of mr gallilee's character to be incapable of opening his lips without sooner or later taking somebody into his confidence in the merest trifles he instinctively invited sympathy and agreement from any person within his reach from a total stranger quite as readily as from an intimate friend mr le frank representing the present court of social appeal attempted to deliver judgment on the question of ices and was interrupted without ceremony by miss minerva she too had been waiting her opportunity to speak and she now took it not amiably with all possible respect mr gallilee i venture to entreat that you will be a little more thoughtful where the children are concerned i beg your pardon mr le frank for interrupting you but it is really a little too hard on me i am held responsible for the health of these girls i am blamed over and over again when it is not my fault for irregularities in their diet and there they are at this moment chilled with ices and cloyed with cakes what will mrs gallilee say don't tell her mr gallilee suggested the girls will be thirsty for the rest of the evening miss minerva persisted the girls will have no appetite for the last meal before bedtime and their mother will ask me what it means my good creature cried mr gallilee don't be afraid of the girls' appetites take off their hats and give them something nice for supper they inherit my stomach miss minerva and they'll 'tuck in' as we used to say at school did they say so in your time mr le frank mrs gallilee's governess and vulgar expressions were anomalies never to be reconciled under any circumstances miss minerva took off the hats in stern silence even papa might have seen the contempt in her face if she had not managed to hide it in this way by means of the girls in the silence that ensued mr le frank had his chance of speaking and showed himself to be a gentleman with a happily balanced character a musician with an eye to business using gratitude to mr gallilee as a means of persuasion he gently pushed the interests of a friend who was giving a concert next week we poor artists have our faults my dear sir but we are all earnest in helping each other my friend sang for nothing at my concert don't suppose for a moment that he expects it of me but i am going to play for nothing at his concert may i appeal to your kind patronage to take two tickets the reply ended appropriately in musical sound a golden tinkling in mr le frank's pocket having paid his tribute to art and artists mr gallilee looked furtively at miss minerva on the wise principle of letting well alone he perceived that the happy time had arrived for leaving the room how was he to make his exit he prided himself on his readiness of resource in difficulties of this sort and he was equal to the occasion as usual he said he would go to his club we really have a capital smoking room at that club he said i do like a good cigar and what do you think mr le frank isn't a pint of champagne nice drinking this hot weather just cooled with ice i don't know whether you feel the weather miss minerva as i do and poured fizzing into a silver mug lord how delicious good bye girls give me a kiss before i go maria led the way as became the elder she not only gave the kiss but threw an appropriate sentiment into the bargain i do love you dear papa said this perfect daughter with a look in miss minerva's direction which might have been a malicious look in any eyes but maria's mr gallilee turned to his youngest child well zo what do you say zo took her father's hand once more and rubbed her head against it like a cat this new method of expressing filial affection seemed to interest mr gallilee does your head itch my dear he asked the idea was new to zo she brightened and looked at her father with a sly smile why do you do it miss minerva asked sharply zo clouded over again and answered i don't know mr gallilee rewarded her with a kiss and went away to champagne and the club mr le frank left the schoolroom next he paid the governess the compliment of reverting to her narrative of events at the concert i am greatly struck he said by what you told me about mr ovid vere we may perhaps have misjudged him in thinking that he doesn't like music his coming to my concert suggests a more cheering view do you think there would be any impropriety in my calling to thank him perhaps it would be better if i wrote and enclosed two tickets for my friend's concert to tell you the truth i've pledged myself to dispose of a certain number of tickets my friend is so much in request it's expecting too much to ask him to sing for nothing i think i'll write good evening left alone with her pupils miss minerva looked at her watch prepare your lessons for to morrow she said the girls produced their books maria's library of knowledge was in perfect order the pages over which zo pondered in endless perplexity were crumpled by weary fingers and stained by frequent tears oh fatal knowledge mercifully forbidden to the first two of our race who shall count the crimes and stupidities committed in your name miss minerva leaned back in her easy chair her mind was occupied by the mysterious question of ovid's presence at the concert she raised her keenly penetrating eyes to the ceiling and listened for sounds from above i wonder she thought to herself what they are doing upstairs chapter vi mrs gallilee was as complete a mistress of the practice of domestic virtue as of the theory of acoustics and fainting fits at dressing with taste and ordering dinners with invention at heading her table gracefully and making her guests comfortable at managing refractory servants and detecting dishonest tradespeople she was the equal of the least intellectual woman that ever lived her preparations for the reception of her niece were finished in advance without an oversight in the smallest detail carmina's inviting bedroom in blue opened into carmina's irresistible sitting room in brown the ventilation was arranged the light and shade were disposed the flowers were attractively placed under mrs gallilee's infallible superintendence before carmina had recovered her senses she was provided with a second mother who played the part to perfection the four persons now assembled in the pretty sitting room upstairs were in a position of insupportable embarrassment towards each other finding her son at a concert after he had told her that he hated music mrs gallilee had first discovered him hurrying to the assistance of a young lady in a swoon with all the anxiety and alarm which he might have shown in the case of a near and dear friend and yet when this stranger was revealed as a relation he had displayed an amazement equal to her own what explanation could reconcile such contradictions as these as for carmina her conduct complicated the mystery what was she doing at a concert when she ought to have been on her way to her aunt's house why if she must faint when the hot room had not overpowered anyone else had she failed to recover in the usual way there she lay on the sofa alternately flushing and turning pale when she was spoken to ill at ease in the most comfortable house in london timid and confused under the care of her best friends making all allowance for a sensitive temperament could a long journey from italy and a childish fright at seeing a dog run over account for such a state of things as this annoyed and perplexed but yet far too prudent to commit herself ignorantly to inquiries which might lead to future embarrassment mrs gallilee tried suggestive small talk as a means of enlightenment the wrinkled duenna sitting miserably on satin supported by frail gilt legs seemed to take her tone of feeling from her young mistress exactly as she took her orders mrs gallilee spoke to her in english and spoke to her in italian and could make nothing of the experiment in either case the wild old creature seemed to be afraid to look at her ovid himself proved to be just as difficult to fathom in another way he certainly answered when his mother spoke to him but always briefly and in the same absent tone he asked no questions and offered no explanations the sense of embarrassment on his side had produced unaccountable changes he showed the needful attention to carmina with a silent gentleness which presented him in a new character his customary manner with ailing persons women as well as men was rather abrupt his quick perception hurried him into taking the words out of their mouths too pleasantly to give offence when they were describing their symptoms there he sat now contemplating his pale little cousin with a patient attention wonderful to see listening to the commonplace words which dropped at intervals from her lips as if in his state of health and with the doubtful prospect which it implied there were no serious interests to occupy his mind mrs gallilee could endure it no longer if she had not deliberately starved her imagination and emptied her heart of any tenderness of feeling which it might once have possessed her son's odd behaviour would have interested instead of perplexing her as it was her scientific education left her as completely in the dark where questions of sentiment were concerned as if her experience of humanity in its relation to love had been experience in the cannibal islands she decided on leaving her niece to repose and on taking her son away with her in your present state of health ovid she began carmina must not accept your professional advice something in those words stung ovid's temper my professional advice he repeated you talk as if she was seriously ill carmina's sweet smile stopped him there we don't know what may happen she said playfully god forbid that should happen he spoke so fervently that the women all looked at him in surprise mrs gallilee turned to her niece and proceeded quietly with what she had to say ovid is so sadly overworked my dear that i actually rejoice in his giving up practice and going away from us to morrow we will leave you for the present with your old friend pray ring if you want anything she kissed her hand to carmina and beckoning to her son advanced towards the door teresa looked at her and suddenly looked away again mrs gallilee stopped on her way out at a chiffonier and altered the arrangement of some of the china on it the duenna followed on tiptoe folded her thumb and two middle fingers into the palm of her hand and stretching out the forefinger and the little finger touched mrs gallilee on the back so softly that she was unaware of it the evil eye teresa whispered to herself in italian as she stole back to her place ovid lingered near his cousin neither of them had seen what teresa had done he rose reluctantly to go feeling his little attentions gratefully carmina checked him with innocent familiarity as he left his chair i must thank you she said simply it seems hard indeed that you who cure others should suffer from illness yourself teresa watching them with interest came a little nearer she could now examine ovid's face with close and jealous scrutiny mrs gallilee reminded her son that she was waiting for him he had some last words yet to say the duenna drew back from the sofa still looking at ovid she muttered to herself holy teresa my patroness show me that man's soul in his face at last ovid took his leave i shall call and see how you are to morrow he said before i go he nodded kindly to teresa instead of being satisfied with that act of courtesy she wanted something more may i shake hands she asked mrs gallilee was a liberal in politics never had her principles been tried as they were tried when she heard those words teresa wrung ovid's hand with tremulous energy still intent on reading his character in his face he asked her smiling what she saw to interest her a good man i hope she answered sternly carmina and ovid were amused teresa rebuked them as if they had been children laugh at some fitter time she said not now descending the stairs mrs gallilee and ovid met the footman mr mool is in the library ma'am the man said have you anything to do ovid for the next half hour his mother asked do you wish me to see mr mool if it's law business i am afraid i shall not be of much use the lawyer is here by appointment with a copy of your late uncle's will mrs gallilee answered you may have some interest in it i think you ought to hear it read ovid showed no inclination to adopt this proposal he asked an idle question i heard of their finding the will are there any romantic circumstances mrs gallilee surveyed her son with an expression of good humoured contempt what a boy you are in some things have you been reading a novel lately my dear when the people in italy made up their minds at last to have the furniture in your uncle's room taken to pieces they found the will it had slipped behind a drawer in a rotten old cabinet full of useless papers nothing romantic thank god and nothing as mr mool's letter tells me that can lead to misunderstandings or disputes ovid's indifference was not to be conquered he left it to his mother to send him word if he had a legacy i am not as much interested in it as you are he explained plenty of money left to you of course he was evidently thinking all the time of something else mrs gallilee stopped in the hall with an air of downright alarm your mind is in a dreadful state she said have you really forgotten what i told you only yesterday the will appoints me carmina's guardian he had plainly forgotten it he started when his mother recalled the circumstance curious he said to himself that i was not reminded of it when i saw carmina's rooms prepared for her his mother anxiously looking at him observed that his face brightened when he spoke of carmina he suddenly changed his mind make allowances for an overworked man he said you are quite right i ought to hear the will read i am at your service even mrs gallilee now drew the right inference at last she made no remark something seemed to move feebly under her powder and paint soft emotion trying to find its way to the surface impossible as they entered the library together miss minerva returned to the schoolroom she had lingered on the upper landing and had heard the conversation between mother and son chapter vii the library at fairfield gardens possessed two special attractions besides the books it opened into a large conservatory and it was adorned by an admirable portrait of mrs gallilee painted by her brother waiting the appearance of the fair original mr mool looked at the portrait and then mentally reviewed the history of mrs gallilee's family what he did next no person acquainted with the habits of lawyers will be weak enough to believe mr mool blushed is this the language of exaggeration describing a human anomaly on the roll of attorneys the fact shall be left to answer the question mr mool had made a mistake in his choice of a profession the result of the mistake was a shy lawyer attended by such circumstances as these the history of the family assumes for the moment a certain importance it is connected with a blushing attorney it will explain what happened on the reading of the will and it is sure beforehand of a favourable reception for it is all about money old robert graywell began life as the son of a small farmer he was generally considered to be rather an eccentric man but prospered nevertheless as a merchant in the city of london when he retired from business he possessed a house and estate in the country and a handsome fortune safely invested in the funds his children were three in number his son robert and his daughters maria and susan the death of his wife to whom he was devotedly attached was the first serious calamity of his life he retired to his estate a soured and broken man loving husbands are not always as a necessary consequence tender fathers old robert's daughters afforded him no consolation on their mother's death their anxiety about their mourning dresses so disgusted him that he kept out of their way no extraordinary interest was connected with their prospects in life they would be married and there would be an end of them as for the son he had long since placed himself beyond the narrow range of his father's sympathies in the first place his refusal to qualify himself for a mercantile career had made it necessary to dispose of the business to strangers in the second place young robert graywell proved without any hereditary influence and in the face of the strongest discouragement to be a born painter one of the greatest artists of that day saw the boy's first efforts and pronounced judgment in these plain words what a pity he has not got his bread to earn by his brush on the death of old robert his daughters found themselves to use their own expression reduced to a trumpery legacy of ten thousand pounds each their brother inherited the estate and the bulk of the property not because his father cared about founding a family but because the boy had always been his mother's favourite the first of the three children to marry was the eldest sister maria considered herself fortunate in captivating mr vere a man of old family with a high sense of what he owed to his name he had a sufficient income and he wanted no more his wife's dowry was settled on herself when he died he left her a life interest in his property amounting to six hundred a year this added to the annual proceeds of her own little fortune made an income of one thousand pounds the remainder of mr vere's property was left to his only surviving child ovid with a thousand a year for herself and with two thousand a year for her son on his coming of age the widowed maria might possibly have been satisfied but for the extraordinary presumption of her younger sister susan ranking second in age ranked second also in beauty and yet in the race for a husband susan won the prize soon after her sister's marriage she made a conquest of a scotch nobleman possessed of a palace in london and a palace in scotland and a rent roll of forty thousand pounds maria to use her own expression never recovered it from the horrid day when susan became lady northlake maria became a serious woman all her earthly interests centred now in the cultivation of her intellect she started on that glorious career which associated her with the march of science in only a year afterwards as an example of the progress which a resolute woman can make she was familiar with zoophyte fossils and had succeeded in dissecting the nervous system of a bee was there no counter attraction in her married life very little mr vere felt no sympathy with his wife's scientific pursuits on her husband's death did she find no consolation in her son let her speak for herself my son fills my heart but the school the university and the hospital have all in turn taken his education out of my hands my mind must be filled as well as my heart she seized her exquisite instruments and returned to the nervous system of the bee in course of time mr john gallilee drifting about as he said of himself drifted across the path of science the widowed mrs vere as exhibited in public was still a fine woman mr gallilee admired that style and mr gallilee had fifty thousand pounds only a little more to my lord and my lady than one year's income but invested at four percent it added an annual two thousand pounds to mrs vere's annual one thousand result three thousand a year encumbered with mr gallilee on reflection mrs vere accepted the encumbrance and reaped her reward susan was no longer distinguished as the sister who had her dresses made in paris and mrs gallilee was not now subjected to the indignity of getting a lift in lady northlake's carriage what was the history of robert during this interval of time in two words robert disgraced himself taking possession of his country house the new squire was invited to contribute towards the expense of a pack of hounds kept by subscription in the neighbourhood and was advised to make acquaintance with his fellow sportsmen by giving a hunt breakfast he answered very politely but the fact was not to be concealed the new man refused to encourage hunting he thought that noble amusement stupid and cruel for the same reason he refused to preserve game a last mistake was left to make and he made it after returning the rector's visit he failed to appear at church no person with the smallest knowledge of the english character as exhibited in an english county will fail to foresee that robert's residence on his estate was destined to come sooner or later to an untimely end when he had finished his sketches of the picturesque aspects of his landed property he disappeared the estate was not entailed old robert who had insisted on the minutest formalities and details in providing for his dearly loved wife was impenetrably careless about the future of his children my fortune has no value now in my eyes he said to judicious friends let them run through it all if they please it would do them a deal of good if they were obliged to earn their own living like better people than themselves left free to take his own way robert sold the estate merely to get rid of it with no expensive tastes except the taste for buying pictures he became a richer man than ever when their brother next communicated with them lady northlake and mrs gallilee heard of him as a voluntary exile in italy he was building a studio and a gallery he was contemplating a series of pictures and he was a happy man for the first time in his life another interval passed and the sisters heard of robert again having already outraged the sense of propriety among his english neighbours he now degraded himself in the estimation of his family by marrying a model the letter announcing this event declared with perfect truth that he had chosen a virtuous woman for his wife she sat to artists as any lady might sit to any artist for the head only her parents gained a bare subsistence by farming their own little morsel of land they were honest people and what did brother robert care for rank his own grandfather had been a farmer lady northlake and mrs gallilee felt it due to themselves to hold a consultation on the subject of their sister in law was it desirable in their own social interests to cast robert off from that moment susan previously advised by her kind hearted husband leaned to the side of mercy robert's letter informed them that he proposed to live and die in italy if he held to this resolution his marriage would surely be an endurable misfortune to his relatives in london suppose we write to him susan concluded and say we are surprised but we have no doubt he knows best we offer our congratulations to mrs robert and our sincere wishes for his happiness to lady northlake's astonishment mrs gallilee adopted this indulgent point of view without a word of protest she had her reasons but they were not producible to a relative whose husband had forty thousand a year robert had paid her debts an income of three thousand pounds even in these days represents a handsome competence provided you don't owe a duty to society in mrs gallilee's position an income of three thousand pounds represented genteel poverty she was getting into debt again and she was meditating future designs on her brother's purse a charming letter to robert was the result it ended with do send me a photograph of your lovely wife when the poor model died not many years afterwards leaving one little daughter mrs gallilee implored her brother to return to england come dearest robert and find consolation and a home under the roof of your affectionate maria but robert remained in italy and was buried in italy at the date of his death he had three times paid his elder sister's debts on every occasion when he helped her in this liberal way she proved her gratitude by anticipating a larger and a larger and a larger legacy if she outlived him knowing as the family lawyer what sums of money mrs gallilee had extracted from her brother mr mool also knew that the advances thus made had been considered as representing the legacy to which she might otherwise have had some sisterly claim it was his duty to have warned her of this when she questioned him generally on the subject of the will and he had said nothing about it acting under a most unbecoming motive in plain words the motive of fear from the self reproachful feeling that now disturbed him had risen that wonderful blush which made its appearance on mr mool's countenance he was actually ashamed of himself after all is it too much to have suggested that he was a human anomaly on the roll of attorneys chapter viii mrs gallilee made her appearance in the library and mr mool's pulse accelerated its beat mrs gallilee's son followed her into the room and mr mool's pulse steadied itself again by special arrangement with the lawyer ovid had been always kept in ignorance of his mother's affairs no matter how angry she might be in the course of the next few minutes she could hardly express her indignation in the presence of her son joyous anticipation has the happiest effect on female beauty mrs gallilee looked remarkably well that day having rather a round and full face she wore her hair coloured from youthful nature in a fringe across her forehead balanced on either side by clusters of charming little curls her mourning for robert was worthy of its parisian origin it showed to perfect advantage the bloom of her complexion and the whiteness of her neck also worthy of their parisian origin she looked like a portrait of the period of charles the second endowed with life and how do you do mr mool have you been looking at my ferns the ferns were grouped at the entrance leading from the library to the conservatory they had certainly not escaped the notice of the lawyer who possessed a hot house of his own and who was an enthusiast in botany it now occurred to him if he innocently provoked embarrassing results that ferns might be turned to useful and harmless account as a means of introducing a change of subject even when she hasn't spoken a word thought mr mool consulting his recollections i have felt her eyes go through me like a knife spare us the technicalities please mrs gallilee continued pointing to the documents on the table i want to be exactly acquainted with the duties i owe to carmina and by the way i naturally feel some interest in knowing whether lady northlake has any place in the will mrs gallilee never said my sister never spoke in the family circle of susan the inexhaustible sense of injury aroused by that magnificent marriage asserted itself in keeping her sister at the full distance implied by never forgetting her title the first legacy mentioned in the will said mr mool is a legacy to lady northlake mrs gallilee's face turned as hard as iron one hundred pounds mr mool continued to buy a mourning ring' mrs gallilee's eyes became eloquent in an instant and said as if in words thank heaven so like your uncle's unpretending good sense she remarked to her son any other legacy to lady northlake would have been simply absurd yes mr mool perhaps my name follows mr mool cast a side look at the ferns he afterwards described his sensations as reminding him of previous experience in a dentist's chair at the awful moment when the operator says let me look and has his devilish instrument hidden in his hand the situation to use the language of the stage was indeed critical enough already ovid added to the horror of it by making a feeble joke what will you take for your chance mother before bad became worse mr mool summoned the energy of despair he wisely read the exact words of the will this time 'and i give and bequeath to my sister mrs maria gallilee one hundred pounds' ovid's astonishment could only express itself in action he started to his feet mr mool went on reading 'free of legacy duty to buy a mourning ring ' impossible ovid broke out mr mool finished the sentence 'and my sister will understand the motive which animates me in making this bequest' he laid the will on the table and ventured to look up at the same time ovid turned to his mother struck by the words which had been just read and eager to inquire what their meaning might be happily for themselves the two men never knew what the preservation of their tranquillity owed to that one moment of delay if they had looked at mrs gallilee when she was first aware of her position in the will they might have seen the incarnate devil self revealed in a human face they might have read in her eyes and on her lips a warning hardly less fearful than the unearthly writing on the wall which told the eastern monarch of his coming death see this woman and know what i can do with her when she has repelled her guardian angel and her soul is left to me but the revelation showed itself and vanished her face was composed again when her son and her lawyer looked at it her voice was under control her inbred capacity for deceit was ready for action all those formidable qualities in her nature which a gentler and wiser training than hers had been might have held in check by development of preservative influences that lay inert were now driven back to their lurking place leaving only the faintest traces of their momentary appearance on the surface her breathing seemed to be oppressed her eyelids drooped heavily and that was all is the room too hot for you ovid asked it was a harmless question but any question annoyed her at that moment nonsense she exclaimed irritably the atmosphere of the conservatory is rich in reviving smells mr mool remarked do i detect among the delightful perfumes which reach us the fragrant root stock of the american fern if i am wrong mrs gallilee may i send you some of the sweet smelling maidenhair from my own little hot house he smiled persuasively the ferns were already justifying his confidence in their peace making virtues turned discreetly to account those terrible eyes rested on him mercifully not even a covert allusion to his silence in the matter of the legacy escaped her did the lawyer's artlessly abrupt attempt to change the subject warn her to be on her guard in any case she thanked him with the readiest courtesy for his kind offer might she trouble him in the meantime to let her see the will she read attentively the concluding words of the clause in which her name appeared my sister will understand the motive which animates me in making this bequest and then handed back the will to mr mool before ovid could ask for it she was ready with a plausible explanation when your uncle became a husband and a father she said those claims on him were paramount he knew that a token of remembrance the smaller the better was all i could accept if i happened to outlive him please go on mr mool in one respect ovid resembled his late uncle they both belonged to that high minded order of men who are slow to suspect and therefore easy to deceive ovid tenderly took his mother's hand i ought to have known it he said without obliging you to tell me mrs gallilee did not blush mr mool did go on mrs gallilee repeated mr mool looked at ovid the next name mr vere is yours does my uncle remember me as he has remembered my mother asked ovid yes sir and let me tell you a very pretty compliment is attached to the bequest 'it is needless' your late uncle says 'to leave any more important proof of remembrance to my nephew his father has already provided for him and with his rare abilities he will make a second fortune by the exercise of his profession' most gratifying mrs gallilee is it nor the next clause provides for the good old housekeeper teresa and for her husband if he survives her in the following terms mrs gallilee was becoming impatient to hear more of herself we may i think pass over that she suggested and get to the part of it which relates to carmina and me don't think i am impatient i am only desirous the growling of a dog in the conservatory interrupted her that tiresome creature she said sharply i shall be obliged to get rid of him mr mool volunteered to drive the dog out of the conservatory mrs gallilee as irritable as ever stopped him at the door don't mr mool that dog's temper is not to be trusted he shows it with miss minerva my governess growls just in that way whenever he sees her i dare say he smells you there now he barks you are only making him worse come back being at the door gentle mr mool tried the ferns as peace makers once more he gathered a leaf and returned to his place in a state of meek admiration the flowering fern he said softly a really fine specimen mrs gallilee of the osmunda regalis what a world of beauty in this bipinnate frond one hardly knows where the stalk ends and the leaf begins the dog a bright little terrier came trotting into the library he saluted the company briskly with his tail not excepting mr mool no growl or approach to a growl now escaped him the manner in which he laid himself down at mrs gallilee's feet completely refuted her aspersion on his temper ovid suggested that he might have been provoked by a cat in the conservatory meanwhile mr mool turned over a page of the will and arrived at the clauses relating to carmina and her guardian it may not be amiss he began to mention in the first place that the fortune left to miss carmina amounts in round numbers to one hundred and thirty thousand pounds the trustees skip the trustees said mrs gallilee mr mool skipped in the matter of the guardian he said there is a preliminary clause in the event of your death or refusal to act appointing lady northlake skip lady northlake said mrs gallilee mr mool skipped you are appointed miss carmina's guardian until she comes of age he resumed if she marries in that interval he paused to turn over a page not only mrs gallilee but ovid also now listened with the deepest interest if she marries in that interval with her guardian's approval suppose i don't approve of her choice mrs gallilee interposed ovid looked at his mother and quickly looked away again the restless little terrier caught his eye and jumped up to be patted ovid was too pre occupied to notice this modest advance the dog's eyes and ears expressed reproachful surprise his friend ovid had treated him rudely for the first time in his life if the young lady contracts a matrimonial engagement of which you disapprove mr mool answered you are instructed by the testator to assert your reasons in the presence of well i may describe it as a family council composed of mr gallilee and of lord and lady northlake excessively foolish of robert mrs gallilee remarked and what mr mool is this meddling council of three to do a majority of the council mrs gallilee is to decide the question absolutely if the decision confirms your view and if miss carmina still persists in her resolution notwithstanding am i to give way mrs gallilee asked not until your niece comes of age ma'am then she decides for herself and inherits the fortune only an income from part of it if her marriage is disapproved by her guardian and her relatives and what becomes of the rest the whole of it said mr mool will be invested by the trustees and will be divided equally on her death among her children suppose she leaves no children that case is provided for ma'am by the last clause i will only say now that you are interested in the result mrs gallilee turned swiftly and sternly to her son when i am dead and gone she said i look to you to defend my memory to defend your memory ovid repeated wondering what she could possibly mean if i do become interested in the disposal of robert's fortune which god forbid can't you foresee what will happen his mother inquired bitterly lady northlake will say 'maria intrigued for this' mr mool looked doubtfully at the ferns no his vegetable allies were not strong enough to check any further outpouring of such family feeling as this nothing was to be trusted in the present emergency but the superior authority of the will pardon me he said there are some further instructions mrs gallilee which as i venture to think exhibit your late brother's well known liberality of feeling in a very interesting light they relate to the provision made for his daughter while she is residing under your roof miss carmina is to have the services of the best masters in finishing her education certainly cried mrs gallilee with the utmost fervour and the use of a carriage to herself whenever she may require it no mr mool two carriages in such a climate as this one open and one closed and to defray these and other expenses the trustees are authorized to place at your disposal one thousand a year too much too much mr mool might have agreed with her if he had nor known that robert graywell had thought of his sister's interests in making this excessive provision for expenses incurred on his daughter's account perhaps her dresses and her pocket money are included mrs gallilee resumed mr mool smiled and shook his head mr graywell's generosity has no limits he said where his daughter is concerned miss carmina is to have five hundred a year for pocket money and dresses mrs gallilee appealed to the sympathies of her son isn't it touching she said dear carmina my own people in paris shall make her dresses well mr mool allow me to read the exact language of the will next mr mool answered 'if her sweet disposition leads her into exceeding her allowance in the pursuit of her own little charities my trustees are hereby authorized at their own discretion to increase the amount within the limit of another five hundred pounds annually' it sounds presumptuous perhaps on my part said mr mool venturing on a modest confession of enthusiasm but one can't help thinking what a good father what a good child mrs gallilee had another appropriate remark ready on her lips when the unlucky dog interrupted her once more he made a sudden rush into the conservatory barking with all his might a crashing noise followed the dog's outbreak which sounded like the fall of a flower pot ovid hurried into the conservatory with the dog ahead of him tearing down the steps which led into the back garden the pot lay broken on the tiled floor struck by the beauty of the flower that grew in it he stooped to set it up again if instead of doing this he had advanced at once to the second door he would have seen a lady hastening into the house and though her back view only was presented he could hardly have failed to recognize miss minerva as it was when he reached the door the garden was empty he looked up at the house and saw carmina at the open window of her bedroom the sad expression on that sweet young face grieved him was she thinking of her happy past life or of the doubtful future among strangers in a strange country she noticed ovid and her eyes brightened his customary coldness with women melted instantly he kissed his hand to her she returned the salute so familiar to her in italy with her gentle smile and looked back into the room teresa showed herself at the window always following her impulses without troubling herself to think first the duenna followed them now we are dull up here she called out come back to us mr ovid the words had hardly been spoken before they both turned from the window teresa pointed significantly into the room they disappeared ovid went back to the library anybody listening mr mool inquired i have not discovered anybody but i doubt if a stray cat could have upset that heavy flower pot he looked round him as he made the reply where is my mother he asked mrs gallilee had gone upstairs eager to tell carmina of the handsome allowance made to her by her father having answered in these terms mr mool began to fold up the will and suddenly stopped very inconsiderate on my part he said i forgot mr ovid that you haven't heard the end of it let me give you a brief abstract you know perhaps that miss carmina is a catholic very natural her poor mother's religion well sir her good father forgets nothing all attempts at proselytizing are strictly forbidden ovid smiled his mother's religious convictions began and ended with the inorganic matter of the earth the last clause mr mool proceeded seemed to agitate mrs gallilee quite painfully i reminded her that her brother had no near relations living but lady northlake and herself as to leaving money to my lady in my lord's princely position pardon me ovid interposed what is there to agitate my mother in this mr mool made his apologies for not getting sooner to the point with the readiest good will professional habit mr ovid he explained we are apt to be wordy paid in fact at so much a folio for so many words and we like to clear the ground first your late uncle ends his will by providing for the disposal of his fortune in two possible events as follows miss carmina may die unmarried or miss carmina being married may die without offspring seeing the importance of the last clause now ovid stopped him again do i remember the amount of the fortune correctly he asked was it a hundred and thirty thousand pounds yes and what becomes of all that money if carmina never marries or if she leaves no children in either of those cases sir the whole of the money goes to mrs gallilee and her daughters' chapter ix time had advanced to midnight after the reading of the will and ovid was at home the silence of the quiet street in which he lived was only disturbed by the occasional rolling of carriage wheels and by dance music from the house of one of his neighbours who was giving a ball he sat at his writing table thinking honest self examination had laid out the state of his mind before him like a map and had shown him in its true proportions the new interest that filled his life of that interest he was now the willing slave if he had not known his mother to be with her he would have gone back to carmina when the lawyer left the house as it was he had sent a message upstairs inviting himself to dinner solely for the purpose of seeing carmina again and he had been bitterly disappointed when he heard that mr and mrs gallilee were engaged and that his cousin would take tea in her room he had eaten something at this club without caring what it was he had gone to the opera afterwards merely because his recollections of a favourite singing lady of that season vaguely reminded him of carmina and there he was at midnight on his return from the music eager for the next opportunity of seeing his cousin a few hours hence when he had arranged to say good bye at the family breakfast table to feel this change in him as vividly as he felt it could lead to but one conclusion in the mind of a man who was incapable of purposely deceiving himself he was as certain as ever of the importance of rest and change in the broken state of his health and yet in the face of that conviction his contemplated sea voyage had already become one of the vanished illusions of his life his friend had arranged to travel with him that morning from london to the port at which the yacht was waiting for them they were hardly intimate enough to trust each other unreservedly with secrets the customary apology for breaking an engagement was the alternative that remained with the paper on his desk and with the words on his mind he was yet in such a strange state of indecision that he hesitated to write the letter his morbidly sensitive nerves were sadly shaken even the familiar record of the half hour by the hall clock startled him the stroke of the bell was succeeded by a mild and mournful sound outside the door the mewing of a cat he rose without any appearance of surprise and opened the door with grace and dignity entered a small black female cat exhibiting by way of variety of colour a melancholy triangular patch of white over the lower part of her face and four brilliantly clean white paws ovid went back to his desk as soon as he was in his chair again the cat jumped on his shoulder and sat there purring in his ear this was the place she occupied whenever her master was writing alone passing one day through a suburban neighbourhood on his round of visits the young surgeon had been attracted by a crowd in a by street he had rescued his present companion from starvation in a locked up house the barbarous inhabitants of which had gone away for a holiday and had forgotten the cat when ovid took the poor creature home with him in his carriage popular feeling decided that the unknown gentleman was a rum 'un from that moment this fortunate little member of a brutally slandered race attached herself to her new friend and to that friend only if ovid had owned the truth he must have acknowledged that her company was a relief to him in the present state of his mind when a man's flagging purpose is in want of a stimulant the most trifling change in the circumstances of the moment often applies the animating influence even such a small interruption as the appearance of his cat rendered this service to ovid to use the common and expressive phrase it had shaken him up he wrote the letter and his patient companion killed the time by washing her face his mind being so far relieved he went to bed the cat following him upstairs to her bed in a corner of the room clothes are unwholesome superfluities not contemplated in the system of nature when we are exhausted there is no such thing as true repose for us until we are freed from our dress men subjected to any excessive exertion fighting rowing walking working must strip their bodies as completely as possible or they are nor equal to the call on them ovid's knowledge of his own temperament told him that sleep was not to be hoped for that night but the way to bed was the way to rest notwithstanding by getting rid of his clothes with the sunrise he rose and went out he took his letter with him and dropped it into the box in his friend's door the sooner he committed himself to the new course that he had taken the more certain he might feel of not renewing the miserable and useless indecision of the past night thank god that's done he said to himself as he heard the letter fall into the box and left the house after walking in the park until he was weary he sat down by the ornamental lake and watched the waterfowl enjoying their happy lives wherever he went whatever he did carmina was always with him he had seen thousands of girls whose personal attractions were far more remarkable and some few among them whose manner was perhaps equally winning what was the charm in the little half foreign cousin that had seized on him in an instant and that seemed to fasten its subtle hold more and more irresistibly with every minute of his life he was content to feel the charm without caring to fathom it the lovely morning light took him in imagination to her bedside he saw here sleeping peacefully in her new room would the time come when she might dream of him he looked at his watch it was seven o'clock the breakfast hour at fairfield gardens had been fixed for eight to give him time to catch the morning train half an hour might be occupied in walking back to his own house add ten minutes to make some change in his dress and he might set forth for his next meeting with carmina no uneasy anticipation of what the family circle might think of his sudden change of plan troubled his mind a very different question occupied him for the first time in his life he wondered what dress a woman would wear at breakfast time he opened his house door with his own key an elderly person in a coarse black gown was seated on the bench in the hall she rose and advanced towards him in speechless astonishment he confronted carmina's faithful companion teresa if you please i want to speak to you she said in her best english ovid took her into his consulting room she wasted no time in apologies or explanations don't speak she broke out carmina has had a bad night i shall be at the house in half an hour ovid eagerly assured her the duenna shook her forefinger impatiently she doesn't want a doctor she wants a friend when i am gone what is her life here a new life among new people don't speak she's frightened and miserable so young so shy so easily startled and i must leave her i must i must my old man is failing fast he may die without a creature to comfort him if i don't go back i could tear my hair when i think of it don't speak it's my business to speak ha i know what i know young doctor you're in love with carmina i've read you like a book you're quick to see sudden to feel like one of my people be one of my people help me she dragged a chair close to ovid and laid her hand suddenly and heavily on his arm it's not my fault mind i have said nothing to disturb her no i've made the best of it i've lied to her what do i care i would lie like judas iscariot himself to spare carmina a moment's pain it's such a new life for her try to see it for yourself such a new life you and i shook hands yesterday do it again are you surprised to see me i asked your mother's servants where you lived and here i am with the cruel teeth of anxiety gnawing me alive when i think of the time to come oh my lamb my angel she's alone oh my god only seventeen years old and alone in the world no father no mother and soon oh too soon too soon not even teresa what are you looking at what is there so wonderful in the tears of a stupid old fool drops of hot water ha ha if they fall on your fine carpet here they won't hurt it you're a good fellow you're a dear fellow hush i know the evil eye when i see it no more of that a secret in your ear i've said a word for you to carmina already give her time she's not cold young and innocent that's all love will come i know what i know love will come she laughed and in the very act of laughing changed again fright looked wildly at ovid out of her staring eyes some terrifying remembrance had suddenly occurred to her she sprang to her feet you said you were going away she cried you said it when you left us yesterday it can't be it shan't be you're not going to leave carmina too ovid's first impulse was to tell the whole truth he resisted the impulse to own that carmina was the cause of his abandonment of the sea voyage before she was even sure of the impression she had produced on him would be to place himself in a position from which his self respect recoiled my plans are changed was all he said to teresa make your mind easy i'm not going away the strange old creature snapped her fingers joyously good bye i want no more of you with those cool and candid words of farewell she advanced to the door stopped suddenly to think and came back only a moment had passed and she was as sternly in earnest again as ever may i call you by your name she asked certainly listen ovid i may not see you again before i go back to my husband this is my last word never forget it even carmina may have enemies what could she be thinking of enemies in my mother's house ovid exclaimed what can you possibly mean teresa returned to the door and only answered him when she had opened it to go the evil eye never lies she said wait and you will see chapter x mrs gallilee was on her way to the breakfast room when her son entered the house they met in the hall is your packing done she asked he was in no humour to wait and make his confession at that moment not yet was his only reply mrs gallilee led the way into the room ovid's luggage is not ready yet she announced i believe he will lose his train they were all at the breakfast table the children and the governess included carmina's worn face telling its tale of a wakeful night brightened again as it had brightened at the bedroom window when she saw ovid she took his hand frankly and made light of her weary looks no my cousin she said playfully i mean to be worthier of my pretty bed to night i am not going to be your patient yet mr gallilee with this mouth full at the moment offered good advice eat and drink as i do my dear he said to carmina and you will sleep as i do off i go when the light's out flat on my back as mrs gallilee will tell you and wake me if you can till it's time to get up have some buttered eggs ovid they're good ain't they zo zo looked up from her plate and agreed with her father in one emphatic word jolly miss minerva queen of governesses instantly did her duty zoe how often must i tell you not to talk slang do you ever hear your sister say 'jolly' that highly cultivated child maria strong in conscious virtue added her authority in support of the protest no young lady who respects herself zoe will ever talk slang mr gallilee was unworthy of such a daughter he muttered under his breath oh bother zo held out her plate for more mr gallilee was delighted my child all over he exclaimed we are both of us good feeders zo will grow up a fine woman he appealed to his stepson to agree with him that's your medical opinion ovid isn't it carmina's pretty smile passed like rippling light over her eyes and her lips in her brief experience of england mr gallilee was the one exhilarating element in family life mrs gallilee's mind still dwelt on her son's luggage and on the rigorous punctuality of railway arrangements what is your servant about she said to ovid it's his business to see that you are ready in time it was useless to allow the false impression that prevailed to continue any longer ovid set them all right in the plainest and fewest words my servant is not to blame he said i have written an apology to my friend i am not going away for the moment this astounding announcement was received in silent dismay excepting the youngest member of the company after her father ovid was the one other person in the world who held a place in zo's odd little heart her sentiments were now expressed without hesitation and without reserve she put down her spoon and she cried hooray another exhibition of vulgarity but even miss minerva was too completely preoccupied by the revelation which had burst on the family to administer the necessary reproof her eager eyes were riveted on ovid as for mr gallilee he held his bread and butter suspended in mid air and stared open mouthed at his stepson in helpless consternation mrs gallilee always set the right example mrs gallilee was the first to demand an explanation what does this extraordinary proceeding mean she asked ovid was impenetrable to the tone in which that question was put he had looked at his cousin when he declared his change of plan and he was looking at her still whatever the feeling of the moment might be carmina's sensitive face expressed it vividly who could mistake the faintly rising colour in her cheeks the sweet quickening of light in her eyes when she met ovid's look still hardly capable of estimating the influence that she exercised over him her sense of the interest taken in her by ovid was the proud sense that makes girls innocently bold whatever the others might think of his broken engagement her artless eyes said plainly my feeling is happy surprise mrs gallilee summoned her son to attend her in no friendly voice she too had looked at carmina and had registered the result of her observation privately are we to hear your reasons she inquired ovid had made the one discovery in the world on which his whole heart was set he was so happy that he kept his mother out of his secret with a masterly composure worthy of herself i don't think a sea voyage is the right thing for me he answered rather a sudden change of opinion mrs gallilee remarked ovid coolly agreed with her it was rather sudden he said the governess still looked at him wondering whether he would provoke an outbreak after a little pause mrs gallilee accepted her son's short answer with a sudden submission which had a meaning of its own she offered ovid another cup of tea and more remarkable yet she turned to her eldest daughter and deliberately changed the subject what are your lessons my dear to day she asked with bland maternal interest by this time bewildered mr gallilee had finished his bread and butter ovid knows best my dear he said cheerfully to his wife mrs gallilee's sudden recovery of her temper did not include her husband if a look could have annihilated that worthy man his corporal presence must have vanished into air when he had delivered himself of his opinion as it was he only helped zo to another spoonful of jam when ovid first thought of that voyage he went on i said suppose he's sick a dreadful sensation isn't it miss minerva first you seem to sink into your shoes and then it all comes up eh you're not sick at sea i congratulate you i most sincerely congratulate you my dear ovid come and dine with me to night at the club he looked doubtfully at his wife as he made that proposal got the headache my dear i'll take you out with pleasure for a walk what's the matter with her miss minerva oh i see hush maria's going to say grace amen amen they all rose from the table mr gallilee was the first to open the door the smoking room at fairfield gardens was over the kitchen he preferred enjoying his cigar in the garden of the square he looked at carmina and ovid as if he wanted one of them to accompany him they were both at the aviary admiring the birds and absorbed in their own talk mr gallilee resigned himself to his fate appealing on his way out to somebody to agree with him as usual well he said with a little sigh a cigar keeps one company miss minerva absorbed in her own thoughts passed near him on her way to the school room with her pupils you would find it so yourself miss minerva that is to say if you smoked which of course you don't be a good girl zo attend to your lessons zo's perversity in the matter of lessons put its own crooked construction on this excellent advice she answered in a whisper give us a holiday the passing aspirations of idle minds being subject to the law of chances are sometimes fulfilled and so exhibit poor human wishes in a consolatory light thanks to the conversation between carmina and ovid zo got her holiday after all mrs gallilee still as amiable as ever had joined her son and her niece at the aviary ovid said to his mother carmina is fond of birds i have been telling her she may see all the races of birds assembled in the zoological gardens it's a perfect day why shouldn't we go the stupidest woman living would have understood what this proposal really meant mrs gallilee sanctioned it as composedly as if ovid and carmina had been brother and sister i wish i could go with you she said but my household affairs fill my morning and there is a lecture this afternoon which i cannot possibly lose i don't know carmina whether you are interested in these things we are to have the apparatus which illustrates the conversion of radiant energy into sonorous vibrations have you ever heard my dear of the diathermancy of ebonite not in your way perhaps carmina looked as unintelligent as zo herself mrs gallilee's science seemed to frighten her the diathermancy of ebonite by some incomprehensible process drove her bewildered mind back on her old companion i want to give teresa a little pleasure before we part she said timidly may she go with us of course cried mrs gallilee and now i think of it why shouldn't the children have a little pleasure too i will give them a holiday don't be alarmed ovid miss minerva will look after them in the meantime carmina tell your good old friend to get ready carmina hastened away and so helped mrs gallilee to the immediate object which she had in view a private interview with her son ovid anticipated a searching inquiry into the motives which had led him to give up the sea voyage his mother was far too clever a woman to waste her time in that way her first words told him that his motive was as plainly revealed to her as the sunlight shining in at the window that's a charming girl she said when carmina closed the door behind her modest and natural quite the sort of girl ovid to attract a clever man like you ovid was completely taken by surprise and owned it by his silence mrs gallilee went on in a tone of innocent maternal pleasantry you know you began young she said your first love was that poor little wizen girl of lady northlake's who died child's play you will tell me and nothing more but my dear i am afraid i shall require some persuasion before i quite sympathize with this new what shall i call it infatuation is too hard a word and 'fancy' means nothing we will leave it a blank marriages of cousins are debatable marriages to say the least of them and protestant fathers and papist mothers do occasionally involve difficulties with children not that i say no far from it but if this is to go on i do hesitate something in his mother's tone grated on ovid's sensibilities i don't at all follow you he said rather sharply you are looking a little too far into the future then we will return to the present mrs gallilee replied still with the readiest submission to the humour of her son on recent occasions she had expressed the opinion that ovid would do wisely at his age and with his professional prospects to wait a few years before he thought of marrying having said enough in praise of her niece to satisfy him for the time being without appearing to be meanly influenced in modifying her opinion by the question of money her next object was to induce him to leave england immediately for the recovery of his health with ovid absent and with carmina under her sole superintendence mrs gallilee could see her way to her own private ends really she resumed you ought to think seriously of change of air and scene you know you would not allow a patient in your present state of health to trifle with himself as your are trifling now if you don't like the sea try the continent get away somewhere my dear for your own sake it was only possible to answer this in one way ovid owned that his mother was right and asked for time to think to his infinite relief he was interrupted by a knock at the door miss minerva entered the room not in a very amiable temper judging by appearances i am afraid i disturb you she began ovid seized the opportunity of retreat he had some letters to write he hurried away to the library is there any mistake the governess asked when she and mrs gallilee were alone in what respect miss minerva i met your niece ma'am on the stairs she says you wish the children to have a holiday yes to go with my son and miss carmina to the zoological gardens miss carmina said i was to go too miss carmina was perfectly right the governess fixed her searching eyes on mrs gallilee you really wish me to go with them she said i do i know why in the course of their experience mrs gallilee and miss minerva had once quarrelled fiercely and mrs gallilee had got the worst of it she learnt her lesson for the future she knew how to deal with her governess when one said i know why the other only answered do you let's have it out plainly ma'am miss minerva proceeded i am not to let mr ovid she laid a bitterly strong emphasis on the name and flushed angrily i am not to let mr ovid and miss carmina be alone together you are a good guesser mrs gallilee remarked quietly no said miss minerva more quietly still i have only seen what you have seen did i tell you what i have seen quite needless ma'am your son is in love with his cousin when am i to be ready the bland mistress mentioned the hour the rude governess left the room mrs gallilee looked at the closing door with a curious smile she had already suspected miss minerva of being crossed in love the suspicion was now confirmed and the man was discovered soured by a hopeless passion she said to herself and the object is my son chapter xi on entering the zoological gardens ovid turned at once to the right leading carmina to the aviaries so that she might begin by seeing the birds miss minerva with maria in dutiful attendance followed them teresa kept at a little distance behind and zo took her own erratic course now attaching herself to one member of the little party and now to another when they reached the aviaries the order of march became confused differences in the birds made their appeal to differences in the taste of the visitors insatiably eager for useful information that prize pupil maria held her governess captive at one cage while zo darted away towards another out of reach of discipline and good teresa volunteered to bring her back for a minute ovid and his cousin were left alone he might have taken a lover's advantage even of that small opportunity but carmina had something to say to him and carmina spoke first has miss minerva been your mother's governess for a long time she inquired for some years ovid replied will you let me put a question on my side why do you ask carmina hesitated and answered in a whisper she looks ill tempered she is ill tempered ovid confessed i suspect he added with a smile you don't like miss minerva carmina attempted no denial her excuse was a woman's excuse all over she doesn't like me how do you know i have been looking at her does she beat the children my dear carmina do you think she would be my mother's governess if she treated the children in that way besides miss minerva is too well bred a woman to degrade herself by acts of violence family misfortunes have very materially lowered her position in the world he was reminded as he said those words of the time when miss minerva had entered on her present employment and when she had been the object of some little curiosity on his own part mrs gallilee's answer when he once asked why she kept such an irritable woman in the house had been entirely satisfactory so far as she herself was concerned miss minerva is remarkably well informed and i get her cheap exactly like his mother but it left miss minerva's motives involved in utter obscurity why had this highly cultivated woman accepted an inadequate reward for her services for years together why to take the event of that morning as another example after plainly showing her temper to her employer had she been so ready to submit to a suddenly decreed holiday which disarranged her whole course of lessons for the week little did ovid think that the one reconciling influence which adjusted these contradictions and set at rest every doubt that grew out of them was to be found in himself even the humiliation of watching him in his mother's interest and of witnessing his devotion to another woman was a sacrifice which miss minerva could endure for the one inestimable privilege of being in ovid's company before carmina could ask any more questions a shrill voice at its highest pitch of excitement called her away zo had just discovered the most amusing bird in the gardens the low comedian of the feathered race otherwise known as the piping crow carmina hurried to the cage as if she had been a child herself seeing ovid left alone the governess seized her chance of speaking to him the first words that passed her lips told their own story while carmina had been studying miss minerva miss minerva had been studying carmina already the same instinctive sense of rivalry had associated on a common ground of feeling the two most dissimilar women that ever breathed the breath of life does your cousin know much about birds miss minerva began the opinion which declares that vanity is a failing peculiar to the sex is a slander on women all the world over there are more vain men in it than vain women if ovid had not been one of the exceptions to a general rule among men or even if his experience of the natures of women had been a little less limited he too might have discovered miss minerva's secret even her capacity for self control failed at the moment when she took carmina's place those keen black eyes so hard and cold when they looked at anyone else flamed with an all devouring sense of possession when they first rested on ovid he's mine for one golden moment he's mine they spoke and suddenly the every day blind was drawn down again there was nobody present but a well bred woman talking with delicately implied deference to a distinguished man so far we have not spoken of the birds ovid innocently answered and yet you seemed to be both looking at them she at once covered this unwary outbreak of jealousy under an impervious surface of compliment miss carmina is not perhaps exactly pretty but she is a singularly interesting girl ovid cordially too cordially agreed miss minerva had presented her better self to him under a most agreeable aspect she tried struggled fought with herself to preserve appearances the demon in her got possession again of her tongue do you find the young lady intelligent she inquired certainly only one word spoken perhaps a little sharply the miserable woman shrank under it an idle question on my part she said with the pathetic humility that tries to be cheerful and another warning mr vere never to judge by appearances she looked at him and returned to the children ovid's eyes followed her compassionately poor wretch he thought what an infernal temper and how hard she tries to control it he joined carmina with a new delight in being near her again zo was still in ecstasies over the piping crow oh the jolly little chap look how he cocks his head he mocks me when i whistle buy him cried zo tugging at ovid's coat tails in the excitement that possessed her buy him and let me take him home with me some visitors within hearing began to laugh miss minerva opened her lips maria opened her lips to the astonishment of both of them the coming rebuke proved to be needless a sudden transformation to silence and docility had made a new creature of zo before they could speak and ovid had unconsciously worked the miracle for the first time in the child's experience he had suffered his coat tails to be pulled without immediately attending to her who was he looking at it was only too easy to see that carmina had got him all to herself the jealous little heart swelled in zo's bosom in silent perplexity she kept watch on the friend who had never disappointed her before little by little her slow intelligence began to realise the discovery of something in his face which made him look handsomer than ever and which she had never seen in it yet they all left the aviaries and turned to the railed paddocks in which the larger birds were assembled and still zo followed so quietly so silently that her elder sister threatened with a rival in good behaviour looked at her in undisguised alarm incited by maria who felt the necessity of vindicating her character miss minerva began a dissertation on cranes suggested by the birds with the brittle looking legs hopping up to her in expectation of something to eat ovid was absorbed in attending to his cousin he had provided himself with some bread and was helping carmina to feed the birds but one person noticed zo now that her strange lapse into good behaviour had lost the charm of novelty old teresa watched her there was something plainly troubling the child in secret she had a mind to know what it might be zo approached ovid again determined to understand the change in him if perseverance could do it he was talking so confidentially to carmina that he almost whispered in her ear zo eyed him without daring to touch his coat tails again miss minerva tried hard to go on composedly with the dissertation on cranes flocks of these birds maria pass periodically over the southern and central countries of europe her breath failed her as she looked at ovid she could say no more zo stopped those maddening confidences zo in desperate want of information tugged boldly at carmina's skirts this time the young girl turned round directly what is it dear with big tears of indignation rising in her eyes zo pointed to ovid i say she whispered is he going to buy the piping crow for you to zo's discomfiture they both smiled she dried her eyes with her fists and waited doggedly for an answer carmina set the child's mind at ease very prettily and kindly and ovid added the pacifying influence of a familiar pat on her cheek noticed at last and satisfied that the bird was not to be bought for anybody zo's sense of injury was appeased her jealousy melted away as the next result after a pause produced as her next words implied by an effort of memory she suddenly took carmina into her confidence don't tell she began i saw another man look like ovid when dear carmina asked meaning at what past date when his face was close to yours zo answered meaning under what recent circumstances ovid hearing this reply knew his small sister well enough to foresee embarrassing results if he allowed the conversation to proceed he took carmina's arm and led her a little farther on miss minerva obstinately followed them with maria in attendance still imperfectly enlightened on the migration of cranes zo looked round in search of another audience teresa had been listening she was present waiting for events being herself what stupid people call an oddity her sympathies were attracted by this quaint child in teresa's opinion seeing the animals was very inferior as an amusement to exploring zo's mind she produced a cake of chocolate from a travelling bag which she carried with her everywhere the cake was sweet it was flavoured with vanilla and it was offered to zo unembittered by advice not to be greedy and make herself ill staring hard at teresa she took an experimental bite the wily duenna chose that propitious moment to present herself in the capacity of a new audience who was that other man you saw who looked like mr ovid she asked speaking in the tone of serious equality which is always flattering to the self esteem of children in intercourse with elders zo was so proud of having her own talk reported by a grown up stranger that she even forgot the chocolate i wanted to say more than that she announced would you like to hear the end of it and this admirable foreign person answered i should very much like zo hesitated to follow out its own little train of thought in words was no easy task to the immature mind which miss minerva had so mercilessly overworked led by old dame nature first of governesses zo found her way out of the labyrinth by means of questions do you know joseph she began teresa had heard the footman called by his name she knew who joseph was do you know matilda zo proceeded teresa had heard the housemaid called by her name she knew who matilda was and better still she helped her little friend by a timely guess at what was coming presented under the form of a reminder you saw mr ovid's face close to carmina's face she suggested zo nodded furiously the end of it was coming already and before that teresa went on you saw joseph's face close to matilda's face i saw joseph kiss matilda zo burst out with a scream of triumph why doesn't ovid kiss carmina a deep bass voice behind them answered gravely because the governess is in the way and a big bamboo walking stick pointed over their heads at miss minerva zo instantly recognised the stick and took it into her own hands teresa turned and found herself in the presence of a remarkable man chapter xii in the first place the stranger was almost tall enough to be shown as a giant he towered to a stature of six feet six inches english measure if his immense bones had been properly covered with flesh he might have presented the rare combination of fine proportions with great height he was so miserably it might almost be said so hideously thin that his enemies spoke of him as the living skeleton his massive forehead his great gloomy gray eyes his protuberant cheek bones overhung a fleshless lower face naked of beard whiskers and moustache his complexion added to the startling effect which his personal appearance produced on strangers it was of the true gipsy brown and being darker in tone than his eyes added remarkably to the weird look the dismal thoughtful scrutiny which it was his habit to fix on persons talking with him no matter whether they were worthy of attention or not his straight black hair hung as gracelessly on either side of his hollow face as the hair of an american indian his great dusky hands never covered by gloves in the summer time showed amber coloured nails on bluntly pointed fingers turned up at the tips those tips felt like satin when they touched you when he wished to be careful he could handle the frailest objects with the most exquisite delicacy his dress was of the recklessly loose and easy kind his long frock coat descended below his knees his flowing trousers were veritable bags his lean and wrinkled throat turned about in a widely opened shirt collar unconfined by any sort of neck tie he had a theory that a head dress should be solid enough to resist a chance blow a fall from a horse or the dropping of a loose brick from a house under repair his hard black hat broad and curly at the brim might have graced the head of a bishop if it had not been secularised by a queer resemblance to the bell shaped hat worn by dandies in the early years of the present century in one word he was both in himself and in his dress the sort of man whom no stranger is careless enough to pass without turning round for a second look teresa eyeing him with reluctant curiosity drew back a step and privately reviled him in the secrecy of her own language as an ugly beast even his name startled people by the outlandish sound of it those enemies who called him the living skeleton said it revealed his gipsy origin in medical and scientific circles he was well and widely known as doctor benjulia zo ran away with his bamboo stick after a passing look of gloomy indifference at the duenna he called to the child to come back she obeyed him in an oddly indirect way as if she had been returning against her will at the same time she looked up in his face with an absence of shyness which showed like the snatching away of his stick that she was familiarly acquainted with him and accustomed to take liberties and yet there was an expression of uneasy expectation in her round attentive eyes do you want it back again she asked offering the stick of course i do what would your mother say to me if you tumbled over my big bamboo and dashed out your brains on this hard gravel walk have you been to see mama zo asked i have not been to see mama but i know what she would say to me if you dashed out your brains for all that what would she say she would say doctor benjulia your name ought to be herod' who was herod herod was a royal jew who killed little girls when they took away his walking stick come here child shall i tickle you i knew you'd say that zo answered when men in general thoroughly enjoy the pleasure of talking nonsense to children they can no more help smiling than they can help breathing the doctor was an extraordinary exception to this rule his grim face never relaxed not even when zo reminded him that one of his favourite recreations was tickling her she obeyed however with the curious appearance of reluctant submission showing itself once more he put two of his soft big finger tips on her spine just below the back of her neck and pressed on the place zo started and wriggled under his touch he observed her with as serious an interest as if he had been conducting a medical experiment that's how you make our dog kick with his leg said zo recalling her experience of the doctor in the society of the dog how do you do it i touch the cervical plexus doctor benjulia answered as gravely as ever this attempt at mystifying the child failed completely zo considered the unknown tongue in which he had answered her as being equivalent to lessons she declined to notice the cervical plexus and returned to the little terrier at home do you think the dog likes it she asked never mind the dog do you like it i don't know doctor benjulia turned to teresa his gloomy gray eyes rested on her as they might have rested on any inanimate object near him on the railing that imprisoned the birds or on the pipes that kept the monkey house warm i have been playing the fool ma'am with this child he said and i fear i have detained you i beg your pardon he pulled off his episcopal hat and walked grimly on without taking any further notice of zo teresa made her best courtesy in return the magnificent civility of the ugly giant daunted while it flattered her the manners of a prince she said and the complexion of a gipsy is he a nobleman zo answered he's a doctor as if that was something much better do you like him teresa inquired next zo answered the duenna as she had answered the doctor i don't know in the meantime ovid and his cousin had not been unobservant of what was passing at a little distance from them benjulia's great height and his evident familiarity with the child stirred carmina's curiosity ovid seemed to be disinclined to talk of him miss minerva made herself useful with the readiest politeness she mentioned his odd name and described him as one of mrs gallilee's old friends of late years she proceeded he is said to have discontinued medical practice and devoted himself to chemical experiments nobody seems to know much about him he has built a house in a desolate field in some lost suburban neighbourhood that nobody can discover in plain english dr benjulia is a mystery hearing this carmina appealed again to ovid when i am asked riddles she said i am never easy till the answer is guessed for me and when i hear of mysteries i am dying to have them revealed you are a doctor yourself do tell me something more ovid might have evaded her entreaties by means of an excuse but her eyes were irresistible they looked him into submission in an instant doctor benjulia is what we call a specialist he said i mean that he only professes to treat certain diseases brains and nerves are benjulia's diseases without quite discontinuing his medical practice he limits himself to serious cases when other doctors are puzzled you know and want him to help them with this exception he has certainly sacrificed his professional interests to his mania for experiments in chemistry what those experiments are nobody knows but himself he keeps the key of his laboratory about him by day and by night when the place wants cleaning he does the cleaning with his own hands carmina listened with great interest has nobody peeped in at the windows she asked there are no windows only a skylight in the roof can't somebody get up on the roof and look in through the skylight ovid laughed one of his men servants is said to have tried that experiment he replied and what did the servant see a large white blind drawn under the skylight and hiding the whole room from view somehow the doctor discovered him and the man was instantly dismissed of course there are reports which explain the mystery of the doctor and his laboratory one report says that he is trying to find a way of turning common metals into gold another declares that he is inventing some explosive compound so horribly destructive that it will put an end to war all i can tell you is that his mind when i happen to meet him seems to be as completely absorbed as ever in brains and nerves but what they can have to do with chemical experiments secretly pursued in a lonely field is a riddle to which i have thus far found no answer is he married carmina inquired the question seemed to amuse ovid if doctor benjulia had a wife you think we might get at his secrets there is no such chance for us he manages his domestic affairs for himself hasn't he even got a housekeeper not even a housekeeper while he was making that reply he saw the doctor slowly advancing towards them excuse me for one minute he resumed i will just speak to him and come back to you carmina turned to miss minerva in surprise ovid seems to have some reason for keeping the tall man away from us she said does he dislike doctor benjulia but for restraining motives the governess might have gratified her hatred of carmina by a sharp reply she had her reasons not only after what she had overheard in the conservatory but after what she had seen in the gardens for winning carmina's confidence and exercising over her the influence of a trusted friend miss minerva made instant use of her first opportunity i can tell you what i have noticed myself she said confidentially when mrs gallilee gives parties i am allowed to be present to see the famous professors of science on one of these occasions they were talking of instinct and reason your cousin mr ovid vere said it was no easy matter to decide where instinct ended and reason began in his own experience he had sometimes found people of feeble minds who judged by instinct arrive at sounder conclusions than their superiors in intelligence who judged by reason the talk took another turn and soon after doctor benjulia joined the guests i don't know whether you have observed that mr gallilee is very fond of his stepson oh yes carmina had noticed that i like mr gallilee she said warmly he is such a nice kind hearted natural old man miss minerva concealed a sneer under a smile fond of mr gallilee what simplicity well she resumed the doctor paid his respects to the master of the house and then he shook hands with mr ovid and then the scientific gentlemen all got round him and had learned talk mr gallilee came up to his stepson looking a little discomposed he spoke in a whisper you know his way 'ovid do you like doctor benjulia don't mention it i hate him' strong language for mr gallilee wasn't it mr ovid said 'why do you hate him' and poor mr gallilee answered like a child 'because i do' some ladies came in and the old gentleman left us to speak to them i ventured to say to mr ovid 'is that instinct or reason' he took it quite seriously 'instinct' he said 'and it troubles me' i leave you miss carmina to draw your own conclusion they both looked up ovid and the doctor were walking slowly away from them and were just passing teresa and the child at the same moment one of the keepers of the animals approached benjulia after they had talked together for a while the man withdrew zo who had heard it all and had understood a part of it ran up to carmina charged with news there's a sick monkey in the gardens in a room all by himself the child cried and i say look there she pointed excitedly to benjulia and ovid walking on again slowly in the direction of the aviaries there's the big doctor who tickles me he says he'll see the poor monkey as soon as he's done with ovid and what do you think he said besides he said perhaps he'd take the monkey home with him i wonder what's the matter with the poor creature carmina asked after what mr ovid has told us i think i know miss minerva answered doctor benjulia wouldn't be interested in the monkey unless it had a disease of the brain chapter xiii ovid had promised to return to carmina in a minute the minutes passed and still doctor benjulia held him in talk now that he was no longer seeking amusement in his own dreary way by mystifying zo the lines seemed to harden in the doctor's fleshless face a scrupulously polite man he was always cold in his politeness he waited to have his hand shaken and waited to be spoken to and yet on this occasion he had something to say when ovid opened the conversation he changed the subject directly benjulia what brings you to the zoological gardens one of the monkeys has got brain disease and they fancy i might like to see the beast before they kill him have you been thinking lately of that patient we lost not at the moment remembering the patient ovid made no immediate reply the doctor seemed to distrust his silence you don't mean to say you have forgotten the case he resumed we called it hysteria not knowing what else it was i don't forgive the girl for slipping through our fingers i hate to be beaten by death in that way have you made up your mind what to do on the next occasion perhaps you think you could have saved her life if you had been sent for now no indeed i am just as ignorant give ignorance time benjulia interposed and ignorance will become knowledge if a man is in earnest the proper treatment might occur to you to morrow he held to his idea with such obstinacy that ovid set him right rather impatiently the proper treatment has as much chance of occurring to the greatest ass in the profession he answered as it has of occurring to me i can put my mind to no good medical use my work has been too much for me i am obliged to give up practice and rest for a time not even a formal expression of sympathy escaped doctor benjulia having been a distrustful friend so far he became an inquisitive friend now you're going away of course he said where to on the continent not to italy if you really want to recover your health what is the objection to italy the doctor put his great hand solemnly on his young friend's shoulder the medical schools in that country are recovering their past reputation he said they are becoming active centres of physiological inquiry you will be dragged into it to a dead certainty they're sure to try what they can strike out by collision with a man like you what will become of that overworked mind of yours when a lot of professors are searching it without mercy have you ever been to canada no have you i have been everywhere canada is just the place for you in this summer season bracing air and steady going doctors who leave the fools in europe to pry into the secrets of nature thousands of miles of land if you like riding thousands of miles of water if you like sailing pack up and go to canada what did all this mean was he afraid that his colleague might stumble on some discovery which he was in search of himself and did the discovery relate to his own special subject of brains and nerves ovid made an attempt to understand him tell me something about yourself benjulia he said are you returning to your regular professional work benjulia struck his bamboo stick emphatically on the gravel walk never unless i know more than i know now this surely meant that he was as much devoted to his chemical experiments as ever in that case how could ovid who knew nothing of chemical experiments be an obstacle in the doctor's way baffled thus far he made another attempt at inducing benjulia to explain himself when is the world to hear of your discoveries he asked the doctor's massive forehead gathered ominously into a frown damn the world that was his only reply ovid was not disposed to allow himself to be kept in the dark in this way i suppose you are going on with your experiments he said the gloom of benjulia's grave eyes deepened they stared with a stern fixedness into vacancy his great head bent slowly over his broad breast the whole man seemed to be shut up in himself i go on a way of my own he growled let nobody cross it after that reply to persist in making inquiries would only have ended in needlessly provoking an irritable man ovid looked back towards carmina i must return to my friends he said the doctor lifted his head like a man awakened have i been rude he asked don't talk to me about my experiments that's my raw place and you hit me on it what did you say just now friends who are your friends he rubbed his hand savagely over his forehead it was a way he had of clearing his mind i know he went on i saw your friends just now who's the young lady his most intimate companions had never heard him laugh they had sometimes seen his thin lipped mouth widen drearily into a smile it widened now whoever she is he proceeded zo wonders why you don't kiss her this specimen of benjulia's attempts at pleasantry was not exactly to ovid's taste he shifted the topic to his little sister you were always fond of zo he said benjulia looked thoroughly puzzled fondness for anybody was to all appearance one of the few subjects on which he had not qualified himself to offer an opinion he gave his head another savage rub and returned to the subject of the young lady who is she he asked again my cousin ovid replied as shortly as possible your cousin a girl of lady northlake's no my late uncle's daughter benjulia suddenly came to a standstill what he cried has that misbegotten child grown up to be a woman' ovid started words of angry protest were on his lips when he perceived teresa and zo on one side of him and the keeper of the monkeys on the other benjulia dismissed the man with the favourable answer which zo had already reported they walked on again ovid was at liberty to speak do you know what you said of my cousin just now he began his tone seemed to surprise the doctor what did i say he asked you used a very offensive word you called carmina a 'misbegotten child' are you repeating some vile slander on the memory of her mother benjulia came to another standstill slander he repeated and said no more ovid's anger broke out yes he replied or a lie if you like told of a woman as high above reproach as your mother or mine you are hot the doctor remarked and walked on again when i was in italy he paused to calculate when i was at rome fifteen years ago your cousin was a wretched little rickety child i said to robert graywell 'don't get too fond of that girl she'll never live to grow up' he said something about taking her away to the mountain air i didn't think myself the mountain air would be of any use it seems i was wrong well it's a surprise to me to find her he waited and calculated again to find her grown up to be seventeen years old to ovid's ears there was an inhuman indifference in his tone as he said this which it was impossible not to resent by looks if not in words benjulia noticed the impression that he had produced without in the least understanding it your nervous system's in a nasty state he remarked you had better take care of yourself i'll go and look at the monkey his face was like the face of the impenetrable sphinx his deep bass voice droned placidly ovid's anger had passed by him like the passing of the summer air good bye he said and take care of those nasty nerves i tell you again they mean mischief not altogether willingly ovid made his apologies if i have misunderstood you i beg your pardon at the same time i don't think i am to blame why did you mislead me by using that detestable word wasn't it the right word the right word when you only wanted to speak of a poor sickly child considering that you took your degree at oxford you could expect nothing better from the disadvantages of my education said the doctor finishing the sentence with the grave composure that distinguished him when i said 'misbegotten' perhaps i ought to have said 'half begotten' thank you for reminding me i'll look at the dictionary when i get home ovid's mind was not set at ease yet there's one other thing he persisted that seems unaccountable he started and seized benjulia by the arm stop he cried with a sudden outburst of alarm well asked the doctor stopping directly what is it nothing said ovid recoiling from a stain on the gravel walk caused by the remains of an unlucky beetle crushed under his friend's heavy foot you trod on the beetle before i could stop you benjulia's astonishment at finding an adult male human being not in a lunatic asylum anxious to spare the life of a beetle literally struck him speechless his medical instincts came to his assistance you had better leave london at once he suggested get into pure air and be out of doors all day long he turned over the remains of the beetle with the end of his stick the common beetle he said i haven't damaged a specimen ovid returned to the subject which had suffered interruption through his abortive little act of mercy you knew my uncle in italy it seems strange benjulia that i should never have heard of it before yes i knew your uncle and he added with especial emphasis i knew his wife well well i can't say i felt any particular interest in either of them nothing happened afterwards to put me in mind of the acquaintance till you told me who the young lady was just now surely my mother must have reminded you not that i can remember women in her position don't much fancy talking of a relative who has married he stopped to choose his next words i don't want to be rude suppose we say married beneath him reflection told ovid that this was true even in conversation with himself before the arrival in england of robert's will his mother rarely mentioned her brother and still more rarely his family there was another reason for mrs gallilee's silence known only to herself robert was in the secret of her debts and robert had laid her under heavy pecuniary obligations the very sound of his name was revolting to his amiable sister it reminded her of that humiliating sense known in society as a sense of gratitude carmina was still waiting and there was nothing further to be gained by returning to the subject of her mother with such a man as benjulia ovid held out his hand to say good bye taking the offered hand readily enough the doctor repeated his odd question i haven't been rude have i with an unpleasant appearance of going through a form purely for form's sake ovid's natural generosity of feeling urged him to meet the advance strangely as it had been made with a friendly reception i am afraid it is i who have been rude he said will you go back with me and be introduced to carmina benjulia made his acknowledgments in his own remarkable way no thank you he said quietly i'd rather see the monkey chapter xiv in the meantime zo had become the innocent cause of a difference of opinion between two no less dissimilar personages than maria and the duenna having her mind full of the sick monkey the child felt a natural curiosity to see the other monkeys who were well amiable miss minerva consulted her young friend from italy before she complied with zo's wishes would miss carmina like to visit the monkey house ovid's cousin remembering ovid's promise looked towards the end of the walk he was not returning to her he was not even in sight carmina resigned herself to circumstances with a little air of pique which was duly registered in miss minerva's memory arriving at the monkey house teresa appeared in a new character she surprised her companions by showing an interest in natural history are they all monkeys in that big place she asked i don't know much about foreign beasts how do they like it i wonder this comprehensive inquiry was addressed to the governess as the most learned person present miss minerva referred to her elder pupil with an encouraging smile maria will inform you she said her studies in natural history have made her well acquainted with the habits of monkeys thus authorised to exhibit her learning even the discreet maria actually blushed with pleasure it was that young lady's most highly prized reward to display her knowledge in imitation of her governess's method of instruction for the benefit of unfortunate persons of the lower rank whose education had been imperfectly carried out the tone of amiable patronage with which she now imparted useful information to a woman old enough to be her grandmother would have made the hands of the bygone generation burn to box her ears the monkeys are kept in large and airy cages maria began and the temperature is regulated with the utmost care i shall be happy to point out to you the difference between the monkey and the ape you are not perhaps aware that the members of the latter family are called 'simiadae' and are without tails and cheek pouches listening so far in dumb amazement teresa checked the flow of information at tails and cheek pouches what gibberish is this child talking to me she asked i want to know how the monkeys amuse themselves in that large house maria's perfect training condescended to enlighten even this state of mind they have ropes to swing on she answered sweetly and visitors feed them through the wires of the cage branches of trees are also placed for their diversion reminding many of them no doubt of the vast tropical forests in which as we learn from travellers they pass in flocks from tree to tree teresa held up her hand as a signal to stop a little of you my young lady goes a long way she said consider how much i can hold before you cram me at this rate maria was bewildered but nor daunted yet pardon me she pleaded i fear i don't quite understand you then there are two of us puzzled the duenna remarked i don't understand you i shan't go into that house a christian can't be expected to care about beasts but right is right all the world over because a monkey is a nasty creature as i have heard not even good to eat when he's dead that's no reason for taking him out of his own country and putting him into a cage if we are to see creatures in prison let's see creatures who have deserved it men and women rogues and sluts the monkeys haven't deserved it go in i'll wait for you at the door setting her bitterest emphasis on this protest which expressed inveterate hostility to maria using compassion for caged animals as the readiest means at hand teresa seated herself in triumph on the nearest bench a young person possessed of no more than ordinary knowledge might have left the old woman to enjoy the privilege of saying the last word miss minerva's pupil exuding information as it were at every pore in her skin had been rudely dried up at a moment's notice even earthly perfection has its weak places within reach maria lost her temper you will allow me to remind you she said that intelligent curiosity leads us to study the habits of animals that are new to us we place them in a cage teresa lost her temper you're an animal that's new to me cried the irate duenna i never in all my life met with such a child before if you please madam governess put this girl into a cage my intelligent curiosity wants to study a monkey that's new to me it was fortunate for teresa that she was carmina's favourite and friend and as such a person to be carefully handled miss minerva stopped the growing quarrel with the readiest discretion and good feeling she patted teresa on the shoulder and looked at carmina with a pleasant smile worthy old creature how full of humour she is the energy of the people miss carmina i often remark the quaint force with which they express their ideas no not a word of apology i beg and pray maria my dear take your sister's hand and we will follow she put her arm in carmina's arm with the happiest mixture of familiarity and respect and she nodded to carmina's old companion with the cordiality of a good humoured friend teresa was not further irritated by being kept waiting for any length of time in a few minutes carmina joined her on the bench tired of the beasts already my pretty one worse than tired driven away by the smell dear old teresa why did you speak so roughly to miss minerva and maria because i hate them because i hate the family was your poor father demented in his last moments when he trusted you among these detestable people carmina listened in astonishment you said just the contrary of the family she exclaimed only yesterday teresa hung her head in confusion her well meant attempt to reconcile carmina to the new life on which she had entered was now revealed as a sham thanks to her own outbreak of temper the one honest alternative left was to own the truth and put carmina on her guard without alarming her if possible i'll never tell a lie again as long as i live teresa declared you see i didn't like to discourage you after all i dare say i'm more wrong than right in my opinion but it is my opinion for all that i hate those women mistress and governess both alike there now it's out are you angry with me i am never angry with you my old friend i am only a little vexed don't say you hate people after only knowing them for a day or two i am sure miss minerva has been very kind to me as well as to you i feel ashamed of myself already for having begun by disliking her teresa took her young mistress's hand and patted it compassionately poor innocent if you only had my experience to help you there are good ones and bad ones among all creatures i say to you the gallilees are bad ones even their music master i saw him this morning looks like a rogue you will tell me the poor old gentleman is harmless surely i shall not contradict that i shall only ask what is the use of a man who is as weak as water oh i like him but i distinguish i also like zo but what is a child especially when that beastly governess has muddled her unfortunate little head with learning no my angel there's but one person among these people who comforts me when i think of the day that will part us ha do i see a little colour coming into your cheeks you sly girl you know who it is there is what i call a man if i was as young as you are and as pretty as you are a warning gesture from carmina closed teresa's lips ovid was rapidly approaching them he looked a little annoyed and he made his apologies without mentioning the doctor's name his cousin was interested enough in him already to ask herself what this meant did he really dislike benjulia and had there been some disagreement between them was the tall doctor so very interesting she ventured to inquire not in the least he answered as if the subject was disagreeable to him and yet he returned to it by the by did you ever hear benjulia's name mentioned at home in italy never did he know my father and mother he says so oh do introduce me to him we must wait a little he prefers being introduced to the monkey to day where are miss minerva and the children teresa replied she pointed to the monkey house and then drew ovid aside take her to see some more birds and trust me to keep the governess out of your way whispered the good creature make love hot love to her doctor in a minute more the cousins were out of sight how are you to make love to a young girl after an acquaintance of a day or two the question would have been easily answered by some men it thoroughly puzzled ovid i am so glad to get back to you he said honestly opening his mind to her were you half as glad when you saw me return he knew nothing of the devious and serpentine paths by which love finds the way to its ends it had not occurred to him to approach her with those secret tones and stolen looks which speak for themselves she answered with the straightforward directness of which he had set the example i hope you don't think me insensible to your kindness she said i am more pleased and more proud than i can tell you proud ovid repeated not immediately understanding her why not she asked my poor father used to say you would be an honour to the family ought i not to be proud when i find such a man taking so much notice of me she looked up at him shyly at that moment he would have resigned all his prospects of celebrity for the privilege of kissing her he made another attempt to bring her in spirit a little nearer to him carmina do you remember where you first saw me how can you ask it was in the concert room when i saw you there i remembered passing you in the large square it seems a strange coincidence that you should have gone to the very concert that teresa and i went to by accident ovid ran the risk and made his confession it was no coincidence he said after our meeting in the square i followed you to the concert this bold avowal would have confused a less innocent girl it only took carmina by surprise what made you follow us she asked us did she suppose he had followed the old woman ovid lost no time in setting her right i didn't even see teresa he said i followed you she was silent what did her silence mean was she confused or was she still at a loss to understand him that morbid sensitiveness which was one of the most serious signs of his failing health was by this time sufficiently irritated to hurry him into extremities did you ever hear he asked of such a thing as love at first sight she started surprise confusion doubt succeeded each other in rapid changes on her mobile and delicate face still silent she roused her courage and looked at him if he had returned the look he would have told the story of his first love without another word to help him but his shattered nerves unmanned him at the moment of all others when it was his interest to be bold the fear that he might have allowed himself to speak too freely a weakness which would never have misled him in his days of health and strength kept his eyes on the ground she looked away again with a quick flush of shame when such a man as ovid spoke of love at first sight what an instance of her own vanity it was to have thought that his mind was dwelling on her he had kindly lowered himself to the level of a girl's intelligence and had been trying to interest her by talking the language of romance she was so dissatisfied with herself that she made a movement to turn back he was too bitterly disappointed on his side to attempt to prolong the interview a deadly sense of weakness was beginning to overpower him it was the inevitable result of his utter want of care for himself after a sleepless night he had taken a long walk before breakfast and to these demands on his failing reserves of strength he had now added the fatigue of dawdling about a garden physically and mentally he had no energy left i didn't mean it he said to carmina sadly i am afraid i have offended you oh how little you know me she cried if you think that this time their eyes met the truth dawned on her and he saw it he took her hand the clammy coldness of his grasp startled her do you still wonder why i followed you he asked the words were so faintly uttered that she could barely hear them heavy drops of perspiration stood on his forehead his face faded to a gray and ghastly whiteness he staggered and tried desperately to catch at the branch of a tree near them she threw her arms round him with all her little strength she tried to hold him up her utmost effort only availed to drag him to the grass plot by their side and to soften his fall even as the cry for help passed her lips she saw help coming a tall man was approaching her not running even when he saw what had happened only stalking with long strides he was followed by one of the keepers of the gardens doctor benjulia had his sick monkey to take care of he kept the creature sheltered under his long frock coat don't do that if you please was all the doctor said as carmina tried to lift ovid's head from the grass he spoke with his customary composure and laid his hand on the heart of the fainting man as coolly as if it had been the heart of a stranger which of you two can run the fastest he asked looking backwards and forwards between carmina and the keeper i want some brandy the refreshment room was within sight before the keeper quite understood what was required of him carmina was speeding over the grass like atalanta herself benjulia looked after her with his usual grave attention that wench can run he said to himself and turned once more to ovid in his state of health he's been fool enough to over exert himself so he disposed of the case in his own mind having done that he remembered the monkey deposited for the time being on the grass too cold for him he remarked with more appearance of interest than he had shown yet here keeper pick up the monkey till i'm ready to take him again the man hesitated he might bite me sir pick him up the doctor reiterated he can't bite anybody after what i've done to him the monkey was indeed in a state of stupor the keeper obeyed his instructions looking half stupefied himself he seemed to be even more afraid of the doctor than of the monkey do you think i'm the devil benjulia asked with dismal irony the man looked as if he would say yes if he dared carmina came running back with the brandy the doctor smelt it first and then took notice of her out of breath he said why don't you give him the brandy she answered impatiently strong lungs benjulia proceeded sitting down cross legged by ovid and administering the stimulant without hurrying himself some girls would not have been able to speak after such a run as you have had i didn't think much of you or your lungs when you were a baby is he coming to himself carmina asked do you know what a pump is benjulia rejoined very well a pump sometimes gets out of order give the carpenter time and he'll put it right again he let his mighty hand drop on ovid's breast this pump is out of order and i'm the carpenter give me time and i'll set it right again you're not a bit like your mother watching eagerly for the slightest signs of recovery in ovid's face carmina detected a faint return of colour she was so relieved that she was able to listen to the doctor's oddly discursive talk and even to join in it some of our friends used to think i was like my father she answered did they said benjulia and shut his thin lipped mouth as if he was determined to drop the subject for ever ovid stirred feebly and half opened his eyes benjulia got up you don't want me any longer he said now mr keeper give me back the monkey he dismissed the man and tucked the monkey under one arm as if it had been a bundle there are your friends he resumed pointing to the end of the walk good day carmina stopped him too anxious to stand on ceremony she laid her hand on his arm he shook it off not angrily just brushing it away as he might have brushed away the ash of his cigar or a splash of mud in the street what does this fainting fit mean she asked timidly is ovid going to be ill seriously ill unless you do the right thing with him and do it at once he walked away she followed him humbly and yet resolutely tell me if you please she said what we are to do he looked back over his shoulder send him away she returned and knelt down by ovid still slowly reviving with a fond and gentle hand she wiped the moisture from his forehead just as we were beginning to understand each other she said to herself with a sad little sigh chapter xv two days passed in spite of the warnings that he had received ovid remained in london the indisputable authority of benjulia had no more effect on him than the unanswerable arguments of mrs gallilee recent circumstances as his mother expressed it had strengthened his infatuated resistance to reason the dreaded necessity for teresa's departure had been hastened by a telegram from italy ovid felt for carmina's distress with sympathies which made her dearer to him than ever on the second morning after the visit to the zoological gardens her fortitude had been severely tried she had found the telegram under her pillow enclosed in a farewell letter teresa had gone my carmina i have kissed you and cried over you and i am writing good bye as well as my poor eyes will let me oh my heart's darling i cannot be cruel enough to wake you and see you suffer forgive me for going away with only this dumb farewell i am so fond of you that is my only excuse while he still lives my helpless old man has his claim on me write by every post and trust me to write back and remember what i said when i spoke of ovid love the good man who loves you and try to make the best of the others they cannot surely be cruel to the poor angel who depends on their kindness oh how hard life is the paper was blotted and the rest was illegible the miserable day of teresa's departure was passed by carmina in the solitude of her room gently and firmly she refused to see anyone this strange conduct added to mrs gallilee's anxieties already absorbed in considering ovid's obstinacy and the means of overcoming it she was now confronted by a resolute side in the character of her niece which took her by surprise there might be difficulties to come in managing carmina which she had not foreseen meanwhile she was left to act on her own unaided discretion in the serious matter of her son's failing health benjulia had refused to help her he was too closely occupied in his laboratory to pay or receive visits i have already given my advice the doctor wrote send him away when he has had a month's change let me see his letters and then if i have anything more to say i will tell you what i think of your son left in this position mrs gallilee's hard self denial yielded to the one sound conclusion that lay before her the only influence that could be now used over ovid with the smallest chance of success was the influence of carmina three days after teresa's departure she invited her niece to take tea in her own boudoir carmina found her reading a charming book she said as she laid it down on a most interesting subject geographical botany the author divides the earth into twenty five botanical regions but i forget you are not like maria you don't care about these things i am so ignorant carmina pleaded perhaps i may know better when i get older a book on the table attracted her by its beautiful binding she took it up mrs gallilee looked at her with compassionate good humour science again my dear she said facetiously inviting you in a pretty dress you have taken up the 'curiosities of coprolites' that book is one of my distinctions a presentation copy from the author what are coprolites carmina asked trying to inform herself on the subject of her aunt's distinctions still good humoured but with an effort that began to appear mrs gallilee lowered herself to the level of her niece coprolites she explained are the fossilised indigestions of extinct reptiles the great philosopher who has written that book has discovered scales bones teeth and shells the undigested food of those interesting saurians what a man what a field for investigation tell me about your own reading what have you found in the library very interesting books at least to me carmina answered i have found many volumes of poetry do you ever read poetry mrs gallilee laid herself back in her chair and submitted patiently to her niece's simplicity poetry she repeated in accents of resignation oh good heavens unlucky carmina tried a more promising topic what beautiful flowers you have in the drawing room she said nothing remarkable my dear everybody has flowers in their drawing rooms they are part of the furniture did you arrange them yourself aunt mrs gallilee still endured it the florist's man she said does all that i sometimes dissect flowers but i never trouble myself to arrange them what would be the use of the man if i did this view of the question struck carmina dumb mrs gallilee went on by the by talking of flowers reminds one of other superfluities have you tried the piano in your room will it do the tone is quite perfect carmina answered with enthusiasm did you choose it mrs gallilee looked as if she was going to say good heavens again and perhaps to endure it no longer carmina was too simple to interpret these signs in the right way why should her aunt not choose a piano don't you like music she asked mrs gallilee made a last effort when you see a little more of society my child you will know that one must like music so again with pictures one must go to the royal academy exhibition so again before she could mention any more social sacrifices the servant came in with a letter and stopped her mrs gallilee looked at the address the weary indifference of her manner changed to vivid interest the moment she saw the handwriting from the professor she exclaimed excuse me for one minute she read the letter and closed it again with a sigh of relief i knew it she said to herself i have always maintained that the albuminoid substance of frog's eggs is insufficient viewed as nourishment to transform a tadpole into a frog and at last the professor owns that i am right i beg your pardon carmina i am carried away by a subject that i have been working at in my stolen intervals for weeks past let me give you some tea i have asked miss minerva to join us what is keeping her i wonder she is usually so punctual i suppose zoe has been behaving badly again in a few minutes more the governess herself confirmed this maternal forewarning of the truth zo had declined to commit to memory the political consequences of the granting of magna charta and now stood reserved for punishment when her mother had time to attend to it mrs gallilee at once disposed of this little responsibility bread and water for tea she said and proceeded to the business of the evening i wish to speak to you both she began on the subject of my son the two persons addressed waited in silence to hear more carmina's head drooped she looked down miss minerva attentively observed mrs gallilee why am i invited to hear what she has to say about her son was the question which occurred to the governess is she afraid that carmina might tell me about it if i was not let into the family secrets admirably reasoned and correctly guessed mrs gallilee had latterly observed that the governess was insinuating herself into the confidence of her niece that is to say into the confidence of a young lady whose father was generally reported to have died in possession of a handsome fortune personal influence once obtained over an heiress is not infrequently misused to check the further growth of a friendship of this sort without openly offending miss minerva was an imperative duty mrs gallilee saw her way to the discreet accomplishment of that object her niece and her governess were interested diversely interested in ovid if she invited them both together to consult with her on the delicate subject of her son there would be every chance of exciting some difference of opinion sufficiently irritating to begin the process of estrangement by keeping them apart when they had left the tea table it is most important that there should be no misunderstanding among us mrs gallilee proceeded let me set the example of speaking without reserve we all three know that ovid persists in remaining in london she paused on the point of finishing the sentence although she had converted a professor mrs gallilee was still only a woman there did enter into her other calculations the possibility of exciting some accidental betrayal of her governess's passion for her son on alluding to ovid she turned suddenly to miss minerva i am sure you will excuse my troubling you with family anxieties she said especially when they are connected with the health of my son it was cleverly done but it laboured under one disadvantage miss minerva had no idea of what the needless apology meant having no suspicion of the discovery of her secret by her employer but to feel herself baffled in trying to penetrate mrs gallilee's motives was enough of itself to put mrs gallilee's governess on her guard for the rest of the evening you honour me madam by admitting me to your confidence was what she said trip me up you cat if you can was what she thought mrs gallilee resumed we know that ovid persists in remaining in london when change of air and scene are absolutely necessary to the recovery of his health and we know why carmina my child don't think for a moment that i blame you don't even suppose that i blame my son you are too charming a person not to excuse nay even to justify any man's admiration but let us as we hard old people say look the facts in the face if ovid had not seen you he would be now on the health giving sea on his way to spain and italy you are the innocent cause of his obstinate indifference his most deplorable and dangerous disregard of the duty which he owes to himself he refuses to listen to his mother he sets the opinion of his skilled medical colleague at defiance but one person has any influence over him now she paused again and tried to trip up the governess once more miss minerva let me appeal to you i regard you as a member of our family i have the sincerest admiration of your tact and good sense am i exceeding the limits of delicacy if i say plainly to my niece persuade ovid to go if carmina had possessed an elder sister with a plain personal appearance and an easy conscience not even that sister could have matched the perfect composure with which miss minerva replied i don't possess your happy faculty of expressing yourself mrs gallilee but if i had been in your place i should have said to the best of my poor ability exactly what you have said now she bent her head with a graceful gesture of respect and looked at carmina with a gentle sisterly interest while she stirred her tea at the very opening of the skirmish mrs gallilee was defeated she had failed to provoke the slightest sign of jealousy or even of ill temper unquestionably the most crafty and most cruel woman of the two possessing the most dangerously deceitful manner and the most mischievous readiness of language she was nevertheless miss minerva's inferior in the one supreme capacity of which they both stood in need the capacity for self restraint she showed this inferiority on expressing her thanks the underlying malice broke through the smooth surface that was intended to hide it i am apt to doubt myself she said and such sound encouragement as yours always relieves me of course i don't ask you for more than a word of advice of course i don't expect you to persuade ovid of course not miss minerva agreed may i ask for a little more sugar in my tea mrs gallilee turned to carmina well my dear i have spoken to you as i might have spoken to one of my own daughters if she had been of your age tell me frankly in return whether i may count on your help still pale and downcast carmina obeyed i will do my best if you wish it but yes go on she still hesitated mrs gallilee tried gentle remonstrance my child surely you are not afraid of me she was certainly afraid but she controlled herself you are ovid's mother and i am only his cousin she resumed i don't like to hear you say that my influence over him is greater than yours it was far from the poor girl's intention but there was an implied rebuke in this in her present state of irritation mrs gallilee felt it come come she said don't affect to be ignorant my dear of what you know perfectly well carmina lifted her head for the first time in the experience of the two elder women this gentle creature showed that she could resent an insult the fine spirit that was in her fired her eyes and fixed them firmly on her aunt do you accuse me of deceit she asked let us call it false modesty mrs gallilee retorted carmina rose without another word and walked out of the room in the extremity of her surprise mrs gallilee appealed to miss minerva is she in a passion she didn't bang the door the governess quietly remarked i am not joking miss minerva i am not joking either madam the tone of that answer implied an uncompromising assertion of equality you are not to suppose it said that a lady drops below your level because she receives a salary and teaches your children mrs gallilee was so angry by this time that she forgot the importance of preventing a conference between miss minerva and her niece for once she was the creature of impulse the overpowering impulse to dismiss her insolent governess from her hospitable table may i offer you another cup of tea thank you no more may i return to my pupils by all means carmina had not been five minutes in her own room before she heard a knock at the door had mrs gallilee followed her who is there she asked and a voice outside answered only miss minerva chapter xvi i am afraid i have startled you said the governess carefully closing the door i thought it was my aunt carmina answered as simply as a child have you been crying i couldn't help it miss minerva mrs gallilee spoke cruelly to you i don't wonder at your feeling angry carmina gently shook her head i have been crying she explained because i am sorry and ashamed how can i make it up with my aunt shall i go back at once and beg her pardon i think you are my friend miss minerva will you advise me it was so prettily and innocently said that even the governess was touched for a moment shall i prove to you that i am your friend she proposed i advise you not to go back yet to your aunt and i will tell you why mrs gallilee bears malice she is a thoroughly unforgiving woman and i should be the first to feel it if she knew what i have just said to you oh miss minerva you don't think that i would betray your confidence no my dear i don't i felt attracted towards you when we first met you didn't return the feeling you very naturally disliked me i am ugly and ill tempered and if there is anything good in me it doesn't show itself on the surface yes yes i believe you are beginning to understand me if i can make your life here a little happier as time goes on i shall be only too glad to do it she put her long yellow hands on either side of carmina's head and kissed her forehead the poor child threw her arms round miss minerva's neck and cried her heart out on the bosom of the woman who was deceiving her i have nobody left now teresa has gone she said oh do try to be kind to me i feel so friendless and so lonely miss minerva neither moved nor spoke she waited and let the girl cry her heavy black eyebrows gathered into a frown her sallow face deepened in colour she was in a state of rebellion against herself through all the hardening influences of the woman's life through the fortifications against good which watchful evil builds in human hearts that innocent outburst of trust and grief had broken its way and had purified for a while the fetid inner darkness with divine light she had entered the room with her own base interests to serve in her small sordid way she like her employer was persecuted by debts miserable debts to sellers of expensive washes which might render her ugly complexion more passable in ovid's eyes to makers of costly gloves which might show ovid the shape of her hands and hide their colour to skilled workmen in fine leather who could tempt ovid to look at her high instep and her fine ankle the only beauties that she could reveal to the only man whom she cared to please for the time those importunate creditors ceased to threaten her for the time what she had heard in the conservatory while they were reading the will lost its tempting influence she remained in the room for half an hour more and she left it without having borrowed a farthing are you easier now yes dear carmina dried her eyes and looked shyly at miss minerva i have been treating you as if i had a sister she said you don't think me too familiar i hope i wish i was your sister god knows the words were hardly out of her mouth before she was startled by her own fervour shall i tell you what to do with mrs gallilee she said abruptly write her a little note yes yes and you will take it for me carmina's eyes brightened through her tears the suggestion was such a relief in a minute the note was written my dear aunt i have behaved very badly and i am very much ashamed of it may i trust to your kind indulgence to forgive me i will try to be worthier of your kindness for the future and i sincerely beg your pardon she signed her name in breathless haste please take it at once she said eagerly miss minerva smiled if i take it she said i shall do harm instead of good i shall be accused of interfering give it to one of the servants not yet when mrs gallilee is angry she doesn't get over it so soon as you seem to think leave her to dabble in science first said the governess in tones of immeasurable contempt when she has half stifled herself with some filthy smell or dissected some wretched insect or flower she may be in a better humour wait carmina thought of the happy days at home in italy when her father used to laugh at her little outbreaks of temper and good teresa only shrugged her shoulders what a change oh me what a change for the worse she drew from her bosom a locket hung round her neck by a thin gold chain and opened it and kissed the glass over the miniature portraits inside would you like to see them she said to miss minerva my mother's likeness was painted for me by my father and then he had his photograph taken to match it i open my portraits and look at them while i say my prayers it's almost like having them alive again sometimes oh if i only had my father to advise me now her heart swelled but she kept back the tears she was learning that self restraint poor soul already perhaps she went on i ought not to want advice after that fainting fit in the gardens if i can persuade ovid to leave us i ought to do it and i will do it miss minerva crossed the room and looked out of window carmina had roused the dormant jealousy carmina had fatally weakened the good influences which she had herself produced the sudden silence of her new friend perplexed her she too went to the window do you think it would be taking a liberty she asked no a short answer and still looking out of window carmina tried again besides there are my aunt's wishes to consider after my bad behaviour miss minerva turned round from the window sharply of course there can't be a doubt of it her tone softened a little you are young carmina i suppose i may call you by your name you are young and simple do those innocent eyes of yours ever see below the surface i don't quite understand you do you think your aunt's only motive in wishing mr ovid vere to leave london is anxiety about his health do you feel no suspicion that she wants to keep him away from you carmina toyed with her locket in an embarrassment which she was quite unable to disguise are you afraid to trust me miss minerva asked that reproach opened the girl's lips instantly i am afraid to tell you how foolish i am she answered perhaps i still feel a little strangeness between us it seems to be so formal to call you miss minerva i don't know what your christian name is will you tell me miss minerva replied rather unwillingly my name is frances don't call me fanny why not because it's too absurd to be endured what does the mere sound of fanny suggest a flirting dancing creature plump and fair and playful and pretty she went to the looking glass and pointed disdainfully to the reflection of herself sickening to think of she said when you look at that call me frances a man's name with only the difference between an i and an e no sentiment in it hard like me well what was it you didn't like to say of yourself carmina dropped her voice to a whisper it's no use asking me what i do see or don't see in my aunt she answered i am afraid we shall never be what we ought to be to each other when she came to that concert and sat by me and looked at me she stopped and shuddered over the recollection of it miss minerva urged her to go on first by a gesture then by a suggestion they said you fainted under the heat i didn't feel the heat i felt a horrid creeping all over me before i looked at her mind when i only knew that somebody was sitting next to me and then i did look round her eyes and my eyes flashed into each other in that one moment i lost all sense of myself as if i was dead i can only tell you of it in that way it was a dreadful surprise to me to remember it and a dreadful pain when they brought me to myself again though i do look so little and so weak i am stronger than people think i never fainted before my aunt is how can i say it properly hard to get on with since that time is there something wicked in my nature i do believe she feels in the same way towards me yes i dare say it's imagination but it's as bad as reality for all that oh i am sure you are right she does want to keep ovid out of my way because she doesn't like you said miss minerva is that the only reason you can think of what other reason can there be the governess summoned her utmost power of self restraint she needed it even to speak of the bare possibility of carmina's marriage to ovid as if it was only a matter of speculative interest to herself some people object to marriages between cousins she said you are cousins some people object to marriages between catholics and protestants you are a catholic no she could not trust herself to refer to him directly she went on to the next sentence and there might be some other reason she resumed do you know what that is carmina asked no more than you do thus far she spoke the plain truth thanks to the dog's interruption and to the necessity of saving herself from discovery the last clauses of the will had been read in her absence can't you even guess what it is carmina persisted mrs gallilee is very ambitious the governess replied and her son has a fortune of his own she may wish him to marry a lady of high rank but no she is always in need of money in some way money may be concerned in it in what way carmina asked i have already told you miss minerva answered that i don't know before the conversation could proceed they were interrupted by the appearance of mrs gallilee's maid with a message from the schoolroom miss maria wanted a little help in her latin lesson noticing carmina's letter as she advanced to the door it struck miss minerva that the woman might deliver it is mrs gallilee at home she asked mrs gallilee had just gone out one of her scientific lectures i suppose said miss minerva to carmina your note must wait till she comes back the door closed on the governess and the lady's maid took a liberty she remained in the room and produced a morsel of folded paper hitherto concealed from view smirking and smiling she handed the paper to carmina from mr ovid miss chapter xvii pray come to me i am waiting for you in the garden of the square in those two lines ovid's note began and ended mrs gallilee's maid deeply interested in an appointment which was not without precedent in her own experience ventured on an expression of sympathy before she returned to the servants' hall please to excuse me miss i hope mr ovid isn't ill he looked sadly pale i thought allow me to give you your hat carmina thanked her and hurried downstairs ovid was waiting at the gate of the square and he did indeed look wretchedly ill it was useless to make inquiries they only seemed to irritate him i am better already now you have come to me he said that and led the way to a sheltered seat among the trees in the later evening time the square was almost empty two middle aged ladies walking up and down who considerately remembered their own youth and kept out of the way and a boy rigging a model yacht who was too closely occupied to notice them were the only persons in the enclosure besides themselves does my mother know that you have come here ovid asked mrs gallilee has gone out i didn't stop to think of it when i got your letter am i doing wrong ovid took her hand is it doing wrong to relieve me of anxieties that i have no courage to endure when we meet in the house either my mother or her obedient servant miss minerva is sure to interrupt us at last my darling i have got you to myself you know that i love you why can't i look into your heart and see what secrets it is keeping from me i try to hope but i want some little encouragement carmina shall i ever hear you say that you love me she trembled and turned away her head her own words to the governess were in her mind her own conviction of the want of all sympathy between his mother and herself made her shrink from answering him i understand your silence with those words he dropped her hand and looked at her no more it was sadly not bitterly spoken she attempted to find excuses she showed but too plainly how she pitied him if i only had myself to think of her voice failed her a new life came into his eyes the colour rose in his haggard face even those few faltering words had encouraged him she tried again to make him understand her i am so afraid of distressing you ovid and i am so anxious not to make mischief between you and your mother what has my mother to do with it she went on without noticing the interruption you won't think me ungrateful we had better speak of something else only this evening your mother sent for me and don't be angry i am afraid she might be vexed if she knew what you have been saying to me perhaps i am wrong perhaps she only thinks i am too young oh ovid how you look at me your mother hasn't said in so many words what has she said in that question she saw the chance of speaking to him of other interests than the interests of love you must go away to another climate she said and your mother tells me i must persuade you to do it i obey her with a heavy heart dear ovid you know how i shall miss you you know what a loss it will be to me when you say good bye but there is only one way to get well again i entreat you to take that way your mother thinks i have some influence over you have i any influence judge for yourself he answered you wish me to leave you for your own sake only for your own sake do you wish me to come back again it's cruel to ask the question it rests with you carmina send me away when you like and where you like but before i go give me my one reason for making the sacrifice no change will do anything for me no climate will restore my health unless you give me your love i am old enough to know myself i have thought of it by day and by night am i cruel to press you in this way i will only say one word more it doesn't matter what becomes of me if you refuse to be my wife without experience without advice with her own heart protesting against her silence the restraint that she had laid on herself grew harder and harder to endure the tears rose in her eyes he saw them they embittered his mind against his mother with a darkening face he rose and walked up and down before her struggling with himself this is my mother's doing he said his tone terrified her the dread present to her mind all through the interview of making herself a cause of estrangement between mother and son so completely overcame her that she even made an attempt to defend mrs gallilee at the first words he sat down by her again for a moment he scrutinised her face without mercy and then repented of his own severity my poor child he said you are afraid to tell me what has happened i won't press you to speak against your own inclinations it would be cruel and needless i have got at the truth at last in the one hope of my life my mother is my enemy she is bent on separating us she shall not succeed i won't leave you carmina looked at him his eyes dropped before her in confusion and shame are you angry with me she asked no reproaches could have touched his heart as that question touched it angry with you oh my darling if you only knew how angry i am with myself it cuts me to the heart to see how i have distressed you i am a miserable selfish wretch i don't deserve your love forgive me and forget me i will make the best atonement i can carmina i will go away to morrow under hard trial she had preserved her self control she had resisted him she had resisted herself his sudden submission disarmed her in an instant with a low cry of love and fear she threw her arms round his neck and laid her burning cheek against his face i can't help it she whispered oh ovid don't despise me his arms closed round her his lips were pressed to hers kiss me he said she kissed him trembling in his embrace that innocent self abandonment did not plead with him in vain he released her and only held her hand there was silence between them long happy silence he was the first to speak again how can i go away now he said she only smiled at that reckless forgetfulness of the promise by which he had bound himself a few minutes since what did you tell me she asked playfully when you called yourself by hard names and said you didn't deserve my love her smile vanished softly and left only a look of tender entreaty in its place set me an example of firmness ovid don't leave it all to me remember what you have made me say remember she only hesitated for a moment remember what an interest i have in you now i love you ovid say you will go he said it gratefully my life is yours my will is yours decide for me and i will begin my journey she was so impressed by her sense of this new responsibility that she answered him as gravely as if she had been his wife i must give you time to pack up she said say time to be with you she fell into thought he asked if she was still considering when to send him away no she said it isn't that i was wondering at myself what is it that makes a great man like you so fond of me his arm stole round her waist he could just see her in the darkening twilight under the trees the murmuring of the leaves was the only sound near them his kisses lingered on her face she sighed softly don't make it too hard for me to send you away she whispered he raised her and put her arm in his come he said we will walk a little in the cool air they returned to the subject of his departure it was still early in the week she inquired if saturday would be too soon to begin his journey no he felt it too the longer they delayed the harder the parting would be have you thought yet where you will go she asked i must begin with a sea voyage he replied long railway journeys in my present state will only do me harm the difficulty is where to go to i have been to america india is too hot australia is too far benjulia has suggested canada as he mentioned the doctor's name her hand mechanically pressed his arm that strange man she said even his name startles one i hardly know what to think of him he seemed to have more feeling for the monkey than for you or me it was certainly kind of him to take the poor creature home and try what he could do with it are you sure he is a great chemist ovid stopped such a question from carmina sounded strange to him what makes you doubt it he said you won't laugh at me ovid you know i won't now you shall hear we knew a famous italian chemist at rome such a nice old man he and my father used to play piquet and i looked at them and tried to learn and i was too stupid but i had plenty of opportunities of noticing our old friend's hands they were covered with stains and he caught me looking at them he was not in the least offended he told me his experiments had spotted his skin in that way and nothing would clean off the stains i saw doctor benjulia's great big hands while he was giving you the brandy and i remembered afterwards that there were no stains on them i seem to surprise you you do indeed surprise me after knowing benjulia for years i have never noticed what you have discovered on first seeing him perhaps he has some way of cleaning the stains off his hands ovid agreed to this as the readiest means of dismissing the subject carmina had really startled him some irrational connection between the great chemist's attention to the monkey and the perplexing purity of his hands persisted in vaguely asserting itself in ovid's mind his unacknowledged doubts of benjulia troubled him as they had never troubled him yet he turned to carmina for relief still thinking my love thinking of you she answered i want you to promise me something and i am afraid to ask it afraid you don't love me after all then i will say it at once how long do you expect to be away for two or three months perhaps promise to wait till you return before you tell your mother that we are engaged yes you have my promise carmina but you make me uneasy why in my absence you will be under my mother's care and you don't like my mother few words and plain words and they sorely troubled her if she owned that he was right what would the consequence be he might refuse to leave her even assuming that he controlled himself he would take his departure harassed by anxieties which might exercise the worst possible influence over the good effect of the journey to prevaricate with herself or with him was out of the question that very evening she had quarrelled with his mother and she had yet to discover whether mrs gallilee had forgiven her in her heart of hearts she hated deceit and in her heart of hearts she longed to set his mind at ease in that embarrassing position which was the right way out satan persuaded eve and love persuaded carmina love asked if she was cruel enough to make her heart's darling miserable when he was so fond of her before she could realise it she had begun to deceive him poor humanity poor carmina you are almost as hard on me as if you were doctor benjulia himself she said i feel your mother's superiority and you tell me i don't like her haven't you seen how good she has been to me she thought this way of putting it irresistible ovid resisted nevertheless carmina plunged into lower depths of deceit immediately haven't you seen my pretty rooms my piano my pictures my china my flowers i should be the most insensible creature living if i didn't feel grateful to your mother and yet you are afraid of her she shook his arm impatiently i say no he was as obstinate as ever i say yes if you're not afraid why do you wish to keep our engagement from my mother's knowledge his reasoning was unanswerable but where is the woman to be found who is not supple enough to slip through the stiff fingers of reason she sheltered herself from his logic behind his language must i remind you again of the time when you were angry she rejoined you said your mother was bent on separating us if i don't want her to know of our engagement just yet isn't that a good reason she rested her head caressingly on his shoulder tell me she went on thinking of one of miss minerva's suggestions doesn't my aunt look to a higher marriage for you than a marriage with me it was impossible to deny that mrs gallilee's views might justify that inquiry had she not more than once advised him to wait a few years in other words to wait until he had won the highest honours of his profession before he thought of marrying at all but carmina was too precious to him to be humiliated by comparisons with other women no matter what their rank might be he paid her a compliment instead of giving her an answer my mother can't look higher than you he said i wish i could feel sure carmina in leaving you with her that i am leaving you with a friend whom you trust and love there was a sadness in his tone that grieved her wait till you come back she replied speaking as gaily as she could you will be ashamed to remember your own misgivings and don't forget dear that i have another friend besides your mother the best and kindest of friends to take care of me ovid heard this with some surprise a friend in my mother's house he asked certainly who is it miss minerva what his tone expressed such immeasurable amazement that carmina's sense of justice was roused in defence of her new friend if i began by wronging miss minerva i had the excuse of being a stranger she said warmly you have known her for years and you ought to have found out her good qualities long since are all men alike i wonder even my kind dear father used to call ugly women the inexcusable mistakes of nature poor miss minerva says herself she is ugly and expects everybody to misjudge her accordingly i don't misjudge her for one teresa has left me and you are going away next a miserable prospect ovid but not quite without hope frances yes i call her by her christian name and she calls me by mine frances will console me and make my life as happy as it can be till you come back excepting bad temper and merciless cultivation of the minds of children ovid knew of nothing that justified his prejudice against the governess still carmina's sudden conversion inspired him with something like alarm i suppose you have good reasons for what you tell me he said the best reasons she replied in the most positive manner he considered for a moment how he could most delicately inquire what those reasons might be but valuable opportunities may be lost even in a moment will you help me to do justice to miss minerva he cautiously began hush carmina interposed surely i heard somebody calling to me they paused and listened a voice hailed them from the outer side of the garden they started guiltily it was the voice of mrs gallilee chapter xviii carmina are you in the square leave it to me ovid whispered we will come to you directly he called back mrs gallilee was waiting for them at the gate ovid spoke the moment they were within sight of each other you will have no more cause to complain of me he said cheerfully i am going away at the end of the week mrs gallilee's answer was addressed to carmina instead of to her son thank you my dear she said and pressed her niece's hand it was too dark to see more of faces than their shadowy outline the learned lady's tone was the perfection of amiability she sent ovid across the road to knock at the house door and took carmina's arm confidentially you little goose she whispered how could you suppose i was angry with you i can't even regret your mistake you have written such a charming note ovid was waiting for them in the hall they went into the library mrs gallilee enfolded her son in a fervent motherly embrace this completes the enjoyment of a most delightful evening she said first a perfect lecture and then the relief of overpowering anxiety about my son i suppose your professional studies ovid have never taken you as high as the interspacial regions we were an immense audience to night to hear the professor on that subject and i really haven't recovered it yet fifty miles above us only fifty miles there is an atmosphere of cold that would freeze the whole human family to death in a second of time moist matter in that terrific emptiness would explode and become stone and listen to this carmina the explosion itself would be frozen and produce no sound think of serious people looking up in that dreadful direction and talking of going to heaven oh the insignificance of man except i am going to make a joke ovid except when he pleases his old mother by going away for the benefit of his health and where are you going has sensible carmina advised you i agree with her beforehand whatever she has said ovid informed his mother of benjulia's suggestion and asked her what she thought of it mrs gallilee's overflowing geniality instantly flooded the absent doctor he was rude he was ugly but what an inestimable friend what admirable advice in ovid's state of health he must not write letters his mother would write and thank the doctor and ask for introductions to local grandees who occupied a position in colonial society she seized the newspaper a steamer for canada sailed from liverpool on saturday ovid could secure his cabin the next morning amidships my dear if you can possibly get it and could leave london by friday's train in her eagerness to facilitate his departure she proposed to superintend the shutting up of his house in his absence and to arrange the disposal of the servants if he considered it worth while to keep them she even thought of the cat the easiest way to provide for the creature would be of course to have her poisoned but ovid was so eccentric in some things that practical suggestions were thrown away on him sixpence a week for cat's meat isn't much cried mrs gallilee in an outburst of generosity we will receive the cat ovid made his acknowledgments resignedly carmina could see that mrs gallilee's overpowering vitality was beginning to oppress her son i needn't trouble you mother he said my domestic affairs were all settled when i first felt the necessity of getting rest my manservant travels with me my housemaid and kitchenmaid will go to their friends in the country the cook will look after the house and her nephew the little page is almost as fond of the cat as i am if you will send for a cab i think i will go home like other people in my wretched state i feel fatigued towards night time his lips just touched carmina's delicate little ear while his mother turned away to ring the bell expect me to morrow he whispered i love you love you love you he seemed to find the perfection of luxury in the reiteration of those words when ovid had left them carmina expected to hear something of her aunt's discovery in the square mrs gallilee's innocence was impenetrable not finding her niece in the house she had thought of the square what could be more natural than that the cousins should take an evening walk in one of the prettiest enclosures in london her anticipation of ovid's recovery and her admiration of carmina's powers of persuasion appeared for the time to be the only active ideas in that comprehensive mind when the servant brought in the tray with the claret and soda water she sent for miss minerva to join them and hear the good news completely ignoring the interruption of their friendly relations earlier in the evening she became festive and facetious at the sight of the soda water let us imitate the men miss minerva and drink a toast before we go to bed be cheerful carmina and share half a bottle of soda water with me a pleasant journey to ovid and a safe return cheered by the influences of conviviality the friend of professors the tender nurse of half developed tadpoles lapsed into learning again mrs gallilee improvised an appropriate little lecture on canada on the botany of the dominion on the geology of the dominion on the number of gallons of water wasted every hour by the falls of niagara science will set it all right my dears we shall make that idle water work for us one of these days good night miss minerva dear carmina pleasant dreams safe in the solitude of her bedroom the governess ominously knitted her heavy eyebrows in all my experience she thought i never saw mrs gallilee in such spirits before what mischief is she meditating when she has got rid of her son chapter xix the lapse of a few hours exercised no deteriorating influence on mrs gallilee's amiability on the next day thanks to his mother's interference ovid was left in the undisturbed enjoyment of carmina's society not only miss minerva but even mr gallilee and the children were kept out of the way with a delicately exercised dexterity which defied the readiest suspicion to take offence in one word all that sympathy and indulgence could do to invite ovid's confidence was unobtrusively and modestly done never had the mistress of domestic diplomacy reached her ends with finer art in the afternoon a messenger delivered benjulia's reply to mrs gallilee's announcement of her son's contemplated journey despatched by the morning's post the doctor was confined to the house by an attack of gout if ovid wanted information on the subject of canada ovid must go to him and get it that was all have you ever been to doctor benjulia's house carmina asked never then all you have told me about him is mere report now you will find out the truth of course you will go ovid felt no desire to make a voyage of exploration to benjulia's house and said so plainly carmina used all her powers of persuasion to induce him to change his mind mrs gallilee superior to the influence of girlish curiosity felt the importance of obtaining introductions to canadian society and agreed with her niece i shall order the carriage she said assuming a playfully despotic tone and if you don't go to the doctor carmina and i will pay him a visit in your place threatened if he remained obstinate with such a result as this ovid had no alternative but to submit the one order that could be given to the coachman was to drive to the village of hendon on the north western side of london and to trust to inquiries for the rest of the way between hendon and willesden there are pastoral solitudes within an hour's drive of oxford street wooded lanes and wild flowers farms and cornfields still unprofaned by the devastating brickwork of the builder of modern times following winding ways under shadowing trees the coachman made his last inquiry at a roadside public house hearing that benjulia's place of abode was now within half a mile of him ovid set forth on foot leaving the driver and the horses to take their ease at their inn he arrived at an iron gate opening out of a lonely lane there in the middle of a barren little field he saw benjulia's house a hideous square building of yellow brick with a slate roof a low wall surrounded the place having another iron gate at the entrance the enclosure within was as barren as the field without not even an attempt at flower garden or kitchen garden was visible at a distance of some two hundred yards from the house stood a second and smaller building with a skylight in the roof which ovid recognised from description as the famous laboratory behind it was the hedge which parted benjulia's morsel of land from the land of his neighbour here the trees rose again and the fields beyond were cultivated no dwellings and no living creatures appeared so near to london and yet in its loneliness so far away there was something unnatural in the solitude of the place led by a feeling of curiosity which was fast degenerating into suspicion ovid approached the laboratory without showing himself in front of the house no watch dog barked no servant appeared on the look out for a visitor he was ashamed of himself as he did it but so strongly had he been impressed by carmina's observation of the doctor he even tried the locked door of the laboratory and waited and listened it was a breezy summer day the leaves of the trees near him rustled cheerfully was there another sound audible yes low and faint there rose through the sweet woodland melody a moaning cry it paused it was repeated it stopped he looked round him not quite sure whether the sound proceeded from the outside or the inside of the building he shook the door nothing happened the suffering creature if it was a suffering creature was silent or dead had chemical experiment accidentally injured some living thing or he recoiled from pursuing that second inquiry the laboratory had by this time become an object of horror to him he returned to the dwelling house he put his hand on the latch of the gate and looked back at the laboratory he hesitated that moaning cry so piteous and so short lived haunted his ears the idea of approaching benjulia became repellent to him what he might afterwards think of himself what his mother and carmina might think of him if he returned without having entered the doctors' house were considerations which had no influence over his mind in its present mood the impulse of the moment was the one power that swayed him he put the latch back in the socket i won't go in he said to himself it was too late as he turned from the house a manservant appeared at the door crossed the enclosure and threw the gate open for ovid without uttering a word they entered the passage the speechless manservant opened a door on the right and made a bow inviting the visitor to enter ovid found himself in a room as barren as the field outside there were the plastered walls there was the bare floor left exactly as the builders had left them when the house was finished after a short absence the man appeared again he might be depressed in spirits or crabbed in temper the fact remained that even now he had nothing to say he opened a door on the opposite side of the passage made another bow and vanished don't come near me cried benjulia the moment ovid showed himself the doctor was seated in an inner corner of the room robed in a long black dressing gown buttoned round his throat which hid every part of him below his fleshless face except his big hands and his tortured gouty foot rage and pain glared in his gloomy gray eyes and shook his clenched fists resting on the arms of an easy chair ten thousand red hot devils are boring ten thousand holes through my foot he said if you touch the pillow on my stool i shall fly at your throat he poured some cooling lotion from a bottle into a small watering pot and irrigated his foot as if it had been a bed of flowers by way of further relief to the pain he swore ferociously addressing his oaths to himself in thunderous undertones which made the glasses ring on the sideboard relieved in his present frame of mind to have escaped the necessity of shaking hands ovid took a chair and looked about him even here he discovered but little furniture and that little of the heavy old fashioned sort besides the sideboard he perceived a dining table six chairs and a dingy brown carpet there were no curtains on the window and no pictures or prints on the drab coloured walls the empty grate showed its bleak black cavity undisguised and the mantelpiece had nothing on it but the doctor's dirty and strong smelling pipe benjulia set down his watering pot as a sign that the paroxysm of pain had passed away a dull place to live in isn't it in those words he welcomed the visitor to his house irritated by the accident which had forced him into the repellent presence of benjulia ovid answered in a tone which matched the doctor on his own hard ground it's your own fault if the place is dull why haven't you planted trees and laid out a garden i dare say i shall surprise you benjulia quietly rejoined but i have a habit of speaking my mind i don't object to a dull place and i don't care about trees and gardens you don't seem to care about furniture either said ovid now that he was out of pain for awhile the doctor's innate insensibility to what other people might think of him or might say to him resumed its customary torpor in its own strangely unconscious way he seemed only to understand that ovid's curiosity was in search of information about trifles well there would be less trouble in giving him his information than in investigating his motives so benjulia talked of his furniture i dare say you're right he said my sister in law did you know i had a relation of that sort my sister in law got the tables and chairs and beds and basins buying things at shops doesn't interest me i gave her a cheque and i told her to furnish a room for me to eat in and a room for me to sleep in and not to forget the kitchen and the garrets for the servants what more do i want his intolerable composure only added to his guest's irritability a selfish way of putting it ovid broke out have you nobody to think of but yourself nobody i am happy to say that's downright cynicism benjulia the doctor reflected is it he said perhaps you may be right again i think it's only indifference myself curiously enough my brother looks at it from your point of view he even used the same word that you used just now i suppose he found my cynicism beyond the reach of reform at any rate he left off coming here i got rid of him on easy terms what do you say that inhuman way of talking is unworthy of me really i don't think so i'm not a downright savage it's only indifference does your brother return your indifference you must be a nice pair if he does benjulia seemed to find a certain dreary amusement in considering the question that ovid had proposed he decided on doing justice to his absent relative my brother's intelligence is perhaps equal to such a small effort as you suggest he said he has just brains enough to keep himself out of an asylum for idiots shall i tell you what he is in two words a stupid sensualist that's what he is i let his wife come here sometimes and cry it doesn't trouble me and it seems to relieve her more of my indifference eh well i don't know i gave her the change out of the furniture cheque to buy a new bonnet with you might call that indifference and you might be right once more i don't care about money will you have a drink you see i can't move please ring for the man ovid refused the drink and changed the subject your servant is a remarkably silent person he said that's his merit benjulia answered the women servants have quarrelled with every other man i've had they can't quarrel with this man i have raised his wages in grateful acknowledgment of his usefulness to me i hate noise is that the reason why you don't keep a watch dog i don't like dogs they bark he had apparently some other disagreeable association with dogs which he was not disposed to communicate his hollow eyes stared gloomily into vacancy ovid's presence in the room seemed to have become for the time being an impression erased from his mind he recovered himself with the customary vehement rubbing of his head and turned the talk to the object of ovid's visit so you have taken my advice he said you're going to canada and you want to get at what i can tell you before you start here's my journal it will jog my memory and help us both his writing materials were placed on a movable table screwed to his chair near them lay a shabby looking book guarded by a lock ten minutes after he had opened his journal and had looked here and there through the pages his hard intellect had grasped all that it required steadily and copiously his mind emptied its information into ovid's mind without a single digression from beginning to end and with the most mercilessly direct reference to the traveller's practical wants not a word escaped him relating to national character or to the beauties of nature mrs gallilee had criticized the falls of niagara as a reservoir of wasted power doctor benjulia's scientific superiority over the woman asserted itself with magnificent ease niagara being nothing but useless water he never mentioned niagara at all have i served your purpose as a guide he asked never mind thanking me yes or no will do very good i have got a line of writing to give you next he mended his quill pen and made an observation have you ever noticed that women have one pleasure which lasts to the end of their lives he said young and old they have the same inexhaustible enjoyment of society and young and old they are all alike incapable of understanding a man when he says he doesn't care to go to a party even your clever mother thinks you want to go to parties in canada he tried his pen and found it would do and began his letter seeing his hands at work ovid was again reminded of carmina's discovery his eyes wandered a little aside towards the corner formed by the pillar of the chimney piece and the wall of the room the big bamboo stick rested there a handle was attached to it made of light coloured horn and on that handle there were some stains ovid looked at them with a surgeon's practised eye they were dry stains of blood had he washed his hands on the last occasion when he used his stick and had he forgotten that the handle wanted washing too benjulia finished his letter and wrote the address he took up the envelope to give it to ovid and stopped as if some doubt tempted him to change his mind the hesitation was only momentary he persisted in his first intention and gave ovid the letter it was addressed to a doctor at montreal that man won't introduce you to society benjulia announced and won't worry your brains with medical talk keep off one subject on your side a mad bull is nothing to my friend if you speak of vivisection ovid looked at him steadily when he uttered the last word benjulia looked back just as steadily at ovid at the moment of that reciprocal scrutiny did the two men suspect each other ovid on his side determined not to leave the house without putting his suspicions to the test i thank you for the letter he began and i will not forget the warning the doctor's capacity for the exercise of the social virtues had its limits his reserves of hospitality were by this time near their end is there anything more i can do for you he interposed you can answer a simple question ovid replied my cousin carmina benjulia interrupted him again don't you think we said enough about your cousin in the gardens he suggested ovid acknowledged the hint with a neatness of retort almost worthy of his mother you have your own merciful disposition to blame if i return to the subject he replied my cousin cannot forget your kindness to the monkey the sooner she forgets my kindness the better the monkey is dead i am glad to hear it why i thought the creature was living in pain what do you mean i mean that i heard a moaning where in the building behind your house you heard the wind in the trees nothing of the sort are your chemical experiments ever made on animals the doctor parried that direct attack without giving ground by so much as a hair's breadth what did i say when i gave you your letter of introduction he asked i said a mad bull is nothing to my friend if you speak to him of vivisection now i have something more to tell you i am like my friend he waited a little will that do he asked yes said ovid that will do they were as near to an open quarrel as two men could be ovid took up his hat to go even at that critical moment benjulia's strange jealousy of his young colleague as a possible rival in some field of discovery which he claimed as his own showed itself once more there was no change in his tone he still spoke like a judicious friend a last word of advice he said you are travelling for your health don't let inquisitive strangers lead you into talk some of them might be physiologists and might suggest new ideas ovid rejoined determined to make him speak out this time benjulia nodded in perfect agreement with his guest's view are you afraid of new ideas ovid went on perhaps i am in your head he made that admission without hesitation or embarrassment good bye he resumed my sensitive foot feels noises don't bang the door getting out into the lane again ovid looked at his letter to the doctor at montreal his first impulse was to destroy it as benjulia had hesitated before giving him the letter so he now hesitated before tearing it up contrary to the usual practice in such cases the envelope was closed under those circumstances ovid's pride decided him on using the introduction time was still to pass before events opened his eyes to the importance of his decision to the end of his life he remembered that benjulia had been near to keeping back the letter and that he had been near to tearing it up chapter xx the wise ancient who asserted that time flies must have made that remarkable discovery while he was in a state of preparation for a journey when are we most acutely sensible of the shortness of life when do we consult our watches in perpetual dread of the result when does the night steal on us unawares and the morning take us by surprise when we are going on a journey the remaining days of the week went by with a rush ovid had hardly time to ask himself if friday had really come before the hours of his life at home were already numbered he had still a little time to spare when he presented himself at fairfield gardens late in the afternoon finding no one in the library he went up to the drawing room his mother was alone reading have you anything to say to me before i tell carmina that you are here mrs gallilee put that question quietly so far as her voice was concerned but she still kept her eyes on her book ovid knew that she was offering him his first and last chance of speaking plainly before he went away in carmina's interests he spoke mother he said i am leaving the one person in the world who is most precious to me under your care do you mean mrs gallilee asked that you and carmina are engaged to be married i mean that and i am not sure that you approve of the engagement will you be plainer with me than you were on the last occasion when we spoke on this subject when was that mrs gallilee inquired when you and i were alone for a few minutes on the morning when i breakfasted here you said it was quite natural that carmina should have attracted me but you were careful not to encourage the idea of a marriage between us i understood that you disapproved of it but you didn't plainly tell me why can women always give their reason yes when they are women like you thank you my dear for a pretty compliment i can trust my memory i think i hinted at the obvious objections to an engagement you and carmina are cousins and you belong to different religious communities i may add that a man with your brilliant prospects has in my opinion no reason to marry unless his wife is in a position to increase his influence and celebrity i had looked forward to seeing my clever son rise more nearly to a level with persons of rank who are members of our family there is my confession ovid if i did hesitate on the occasion to which you have referred i have now i think told you why am i to understand that you hesitate still ovid asked no with that brief reply she rose to put away her book ovid followed her to the bookcase has carmina conquered you he said she put her book back in its place carmina has conquered me she answered you say it coldly what does that matter if i say it truly the struggle in him between hope and fear burst its way out oh mother no words can tell you how fond i am of carmina for god's sake take care of her and be kind to her for your sake said mrs gallilee gently correcting the language of her excitable son from her own protoplastic point of view you do me an injustice if you feel anxious about carmina when you leave her here my dead brother's child is my child you may be sure of that she took his hand and drew him to her and kissed his forehead with dignity and deliberation if mr mool had been present during the registration of that solemn pledge he would have been irresistibly reminded of the other ceremony which is called signing a deed have you any instructions to give me mrs gallilee proceeded for instance do you object to my taking carmina to parties i mean of course parties which will improve her mind he fell sadly below his mother's level in replying to this do everything you can to make her life happy while i am away those were his only instructions but mrs gallilee had not done with him yet with regard to visitors she went on i presume you wish me to be careful if i find young men calling here oftener than usual ovid actually laughed at this do you think i doubt her he asked the earth doesn't hold a truer girl than my little carmina a thought struck him while he said it the brightness faded out of his face his voice lost its gaiety there is one person who may call on you he said whom i don't wish her to see who is he unfortunately he is a man who has excited her curiosity i mean benjulia it was now mrs gallilee's turn to be amused her laugh was not one of her foremost fascinations it was hard in tone and limited in range it opened her mouth but it failed to kindle any light in her eyes jealous of the ugly doctor she exclaimed oh ovid what next you never made a greater mistake in your life her son answered sharply then what is the objection to him mrs gallilee rejoined it was not easy to meet that question with a plain reply if ovid asserted that benjulia's chemical experiments were assumed for some reason known only to himself as a cloak to cover the atrocities of the savage science he would only raise the doctor in his mother's estimation if on the other hand he described what had passed between them when they met in the zoological gardens mrs gallilee might summon benjulia to explain the slur which he had indirectly cast on the memory of carmina's mother and might find in the reply some plausible reason for objecting to her son's marriage having rashly placed himself in this dilemma ovid unwisely escaped from it by the easiest way i don't think benjulia a fit person he said to be in the company of a young girl mrs gallilee accepted this expression of opinion with a readiness which would have told a more suspicious man that he had made a mistake ovid had roused the curiosity perhaps awakened the distrust of his clever mother you know best mrs gallilee replied i will bear in mind what you say she rang the bell for carmina and left the room ovid found the minutes passing slowly for the first time since the day had been fixed for his departure he attributed this impression to his natural impatience for the appearance of his cousin until the plain evidence of the clock pointed to a delay of five endless minutes and more as he approached the door to make inquiries it opened at last hurrying to meet carmina he found himself face to face with miss minerva she came in hastily and held out her hand without looking at him forgive me for intruding on you she said with a rapidity of utterance and a timidity of manner strangely unlike herself i'm obliged to prepare the children's lessons for to morrow and this is my only opportunity of bidding you good bye you have my best wishes my heartfelt wishes for your safety and your health and and your enjoyment of the journey good bye good bye after holding his hand for a moment she hastened back to the door there she stopped turned towards him again and looked at him for the first time i have one thing more to say she broke out i will do all i can to make carmina's life pleasant in your absence before he could thank her she was gone in another minute carmina came in and found ovid looking perplexed and annoyed she had passed frances on the stairs had there been any misunderstanding between ovid and the governess have you seen miss minerva she asked he put his arm round her and seated her by him on the sofa i don't understand miss minerva he said how is it that she came here when i was expecting you she asked me as a favour to let her see you first and she seemed to be so anxious about it that i gave way i didn't do wrong ovid did i my darling you are always kind and always right but why couldn't she say good bye with the others downstairs do you understand this curious woman i think i do she paused and toyed with the hair over ovid's forehead miss minerva is fond of you poor thing she said innocently fond of me the surprise which his tone expressed failed to attract her attention she quietly varied the phrase that she had just used miss minerva has a true regard for you and knows that you don't return it she explained still playing with ovid's hair i want to see how it looks she went on when it's parted in the middle no it looks better as you always wear it how handsome you are ovid don't you wish i was beautiful too everybody in the house loves you and everybody is sorry you are going away i like miss minerva i like everybody for being so fond of my dear dear hero oh what shall i do when day after day passes and only takes you farther and farther away from me no i won't cry you shan't go away with a heavy heart my dear one if i can help it where is your photograph you promised me your photograph let me look at it yes it's like you and yet not like you it will do to think over when i am alone my love it has copied your eyes but it has not copied the divine kindness and goodness that i see in them she paused and laid her head on his bosom i shall cry in spite of my resolution if i look at you any longer we won't look we won't talk i can feel your arm round me i can hear your heart silence is best i have been told of people dying happily and i never understood it before i think i could die happily now she put her hand over his lips before he could reprove her and nestled closer to him hush she said softly hush they neither moved nor spoke that silent happiness was the best happiness while it lasted mrs gallilee broke the charm she suddenly opened the door pointed to the clock and went away again the cruel time had come they made their last promises shared their last kisses held each other in the last embrace she threw herself on the sofa as he left her with a gesture which entreated him to go while she could still control herself once he looked round when he reached the door and then it was over alone on the landing he dashed the tears away from his eyes suffering and sorrow tried hard to get the better of his manhood they had shaken but had not conquered him he was calm when he joined the members of the family waiting in the library perpetually setting an example mrs gallilee ascended her domestic pedestal as usual she favoured her son with one more kiss and reminded him of the railway we understand each other ovid you have only five minutes to spare write when you get to quebec now maria say good bye maria presented herself to her brother with a grace which did honour to the family dancing master her short farewell speech was a model of its kind dear ovid i am only a child but i feel truly anxious for the recovery of your health at this favourable season you may look forward to a pleasant voyage please accept my best wishes she offered her cheek to be kissed and looked like a young person who had done her duty and knew it mr gallilee modestly secluded behind the window curtains appeared at a sign from his wife one of his plump red hands held a bundle of cigars the other clutched an enormous new travelling flask the giant of its tribe my dear boy it's possible there may be good brandy and cigars on board but that's not my experience of steamers is it yours he stopped to consult his wife my dear is it yours mrs gallilee held up the railway guide and shook it significantly mr gallilee went on in a hurry there's some of the right stuff in this flask ovid if you will accept it five and forty years old would you like to taste it would you like to taste it my dear mrs gallilee seized the railway guide again with a terrible look her husband crammed the big flask into one of ovid's pockets and the cigars into the other you'll find them a comfort when you're away from us god bless you my son you don't mind my calling you my son i couldn't be fonder of you if i really was your father let's part as cheerfully as we can said poor mr gallilee with the tears rolling undisguisedly over his fat cheeks we can write to each other can't we oh dear dear i wish i could take it as easy as maria does zo come and give him a kiss poor fellow where's zo mrs gallilee made the discovery she dragged zo into view from under the table ovid took his little sister on his knee and asked why she had hidden herself because i don't want to say good bye cried the child giving her reason with a passionate outbreak of sorrow that shook her from head to foot take me with you ovid take me with you he did his best to console her under adverse circumstances mrs gallilee's warning voice sounded like a knell time time zo's shrill treble rang out louder still zo was determined to write to ovid if she was not allowed to go with him pa's going to write to you why shouldn't i she screamed through her tears dear zoe you are too young maria remarked damned nonsense sobbed mr gallilee she shall write time time mrs gallilee reiterated taking no part in the dispute ovid directed two envelopes for zo and quieted her in that way he hurried into the hall he glanced at the stairs that led to the drawing room carmina was on the landing waiting for a farewell look at him on the higher flight of stairs invisible from the hall miss minerva was watching the scene of departure reckless of railways and steamers ovid ran up to carmina another and another kiss and then away to the house door with zo at his heels trying to get into the cab with him a last kind word to the child as they carried her back to the house a last look at the familiar faces in the doorway a last effort to resist that foretaste of death which embitters all human partings and ovid was gone volume two chapter xxi on the afternoon of the day that followed ovid's departure the three ladies of the household were in a state of retirement each in her own room the writing table in mrs gallilee's boudoir was covered with letters her banker's pass book and her cheque book were on the desk mr gallilee's affairs having been long since left as completely in the hands of his wife as if mr gallilee had been dead a sheet of paper lay near the cheque book covered with calculations divided into two columns the figures in the right hand column were contained in one line at the top of the page the figures in the left hand column filled the page from top to bottom with her fan in her hand and her pen in the ink bottle mrs gallilee waited steadily thinking it was the hottest day of the season all the fat women in london fanned themselves on that sultry afternoon and mrs gallilee followed the general example when she looked to the right her calculations showed the balance at the bank when she looked to the left her calculations showed her debts some partially paid some not paid at all if she wearied of the prospect thus presented and turned for relief to her letters she was confronted by polite requests for money from tradespeople in the first place and from secretaries of fashionable charities in the second here and there by way of variety were invitations to parties representing more pecuniary liabilities incurred for new dresses and for hospitalities acknowledged by dinners and conversaziones at her own house money that she owed money that she must spend nothing but outlay of money and where was it to come from so far as her pecuniary resources were concerned she was equally removed from hope and fear twice a year the same income flowed in regularly from the same investments what she could pay at any future time was far more plainly revealed to her than what she might owe with tact and management it would be possible to partially satisfy creditors and keep up appearances for six months more to that conclusion her reflections led her and left her to write cheques and after the six months what then having first completed her correspondence with the tradespeople and having next decided on her contributions to the charities this iron matron took up her fan again cooled herself and met the question of the future face to face ovid was the central figure in the prospect if he lived devoted to his profession and lived unmarried there was a last resource always left to mrs gallilee for years past his professional gains had added largely to the income which he had inherited from his father unembarrassed by expensive tastes he had some thousands of pounds put by for the simple reason that he was at a loss what else to do with them thus far her brother's generosity had spared mrs gallilee the hard necessity of making a confession to her son as things were now she must submit to tell the humiliating truth and ovid with no wife to check his liberal instincts would do what ovid's uncle with no wife living to check his liberal instincts had done already there was the prospect if her son remained a bachelor but her son had resolved to marry carmina what would be the result if she was weak enough to allow it there would be not one result but three results natural legal pecuniary the natural result would be children the legal result if only one of those children lived would be the loss to mrs gallilee and her daughters of the splendid fortune reserved for them in the will if carmina died without leaving offspring the pecuniary result would be adding the husband's income to the wife's about eight thousand a year for the young married people and how much for a loan applicable to the mother in law's creditors judging carmina by the standard of herself by what other standard do we really judge our fellow creatures no matter how clever we may be mrs gallilee decided that not one farthing would be left to help her to pay debts which were steadily increasing with every new concession that she made to the claims of society young mrs ovid vere at the head of a household would have the grand example of her other aunt before her eyes although her place of residence might not be a palace she would be a poor creature indeed if she failed to spend eight thousand a year in the effort to be worthy of the social position of lady northlake add to these results of ovid's contemplated marriage the loss of a thousand a year secured to the guardian by the will while the ward remained under her care and the statement of disaster would be complete we must leave this house and submit to be lady northlake's poor relations there is the price i pay for it if ovid and carmina become man and wife she quietly laid aside her fan as the thought in her completed itself in this form the trivial action and the look which accompanied it had a sinister meaning of their own beyond the reach of words and ovid was already on the sea and teresa was far away in italy the clock on the mantelpiece struck five the punctual parlour maid appeared with her mistress's customary cup of tea mrs gallilee asked for the governess the servant answered that miss minerva was in her room where are the young ladies my master has taken them out for a walk have they had their music lesson not yet ma'am mr le frank left word yesterday that he would come at six this evening does mr gallilee know that i heard miss minerva tell my master while i was helping the young ladies to get ready very well ask miss minerva to come here and speak to me miss minerva sat at the open window of her bedroom looking out vacantly at the backs of houses in the street behind fairfield gardens the evil spirit was the dominant spirit in her again she too was thinking of ovid and carmina her memory was busy with the parting scene on the previous day the more she thought of all that had happened in that short space of time the more bitterly she reproached herself her one besetting weakness had openly degraded her without so much as an attempt at resistance on her part the fear of betraying herself if she took leave of the man she secretly loved in the presence of his family had forced her to ask a favour of carmina and to ask it under circumstances which might have led her rival to suspect the truth admitted to a private interview with ovid she had failed to control her agitation and worse still in her ungovernable eagerness to produce a favourable impression on him at parting she had promised honestly promised in that moment of impulse to make carmina's happiness her own peculiar care carmina who had destroyed in a day the hope of years carmina who had taken him away from her who had clung round him when he ran upstairs and had kissed him fervently shamelessly kissed him before the servants in the hall she started to her feet roused to a frenzy of rage by her own recollections standing at the window she looked down at the pavement of the courtyard it was far enough below to kill her instantly if she fell on it through the heat of her anger there crept the chill and stealthy prompting of despair she leaned over the window sill she was not afraid she might have done it but for a trifling interruption somebody spoke outside it was the parlour maid instead of entering the room she spoke through the open door the woman was one of miss minerva's many enemies in the house mrs gallilee wishes to see you she said and shut the door again the instant the words were out of her mouth mrs gallilee the very name was full of promise at that moment it suggested hope merciless hope she left the window and consulted her looking glass even to herself her haggard face was terrible to see she poured eau de cologne and water into her basin and bathed her burning head and eyes her shaggy black hair stood in need of attention next she took almost as much pains with it as if she had been going into the presence of ovid himself i must make a calm appearance she thought still as far as ever from suspecting that her employer had guessed her secret or his mother may find me out her knees trembled under her she sat down for a minute to rest was she merely wanted for some ordinary domestic consultation or was there really a chance of hearing the question of ovid and carmina brought forward at the coming interview she believed what she hoped she believed that the time had come when mrs gallilee had need of an ally perhaps of an accomplice only let her object be the separation of the two cousins and miss minerva was eager to help her in either capacity suppose she was too cautious to mention her object miss minerva was equally ready for her employer in that case the doubt which had prompted her fruitless suggestions to carmina when they were alone in the young girl's room the doubt whether a clue to the discovery of mrs gallilee's motives might not be found in that latter part of the will which she had failed to overhear was as present as ever in the governess's mind the learned lady is not infallible she thought as she entered mrs gallilee's room if one unwary word trips over her tongue i shall pick it up mrs gallilee's manner was encouraging at the outset she had left her writing table and she now presented herself reclining in an easy chair weary and discouraged the picture of a woman in want of a helpful friend my head aches with adding up figures and writing letters she said i wish you would finish my correspondence for me miss minerva took her place at the desk she at once discovered the unfinished correspondence to be a false pretence three cheques for charitable subscriptions due at that date were waiting to be sent to three secretaries with the customary letters in five minutes the letters were ready for the post anything more miss minerva asked not that i remember do you mind giving me my fan i feel perfectly helpless i am wretchedly depressed to day the heat perhaps no the expenses every year the demands on our resources seem to increase on principle i dislike living up to our income and i am obliged to do it here plainly revealed to the governess's experienced eyes was another false pretence used to introduce the true object of the interview as something which might accidentally suggest itself in the course of conversation miss minerva expressed the necessary regret with innocent readiness might i suggest economy she asked with impenetrable gravity admirably advised mrs gallilee admitted but how is it to be done those subscriptions for instance are more than i ought to give and what happens if i lower the amount i expose myself to unfavourable comparison with other people of our rank in society miss minerva still patiently played the part expected of her you might perhaps do with only one carriage horse she remarked my good creature look at the people who have only one carriage horse situated as i am can i descend to that level don't suppose i care two straws about such things myself my one pride and pleasure in life is the pride and pleasure of improving my mind but i have lady northlake for a sister and i must not be entirely unworthy of my family connections i have two daughters and i must think of their interests in a few years maria will be presented at court thanks to you she will be one of the most accomplished girls in england think of maria's mother in a one horse chaise dear child tell me all about her lessons is she getting on as well as ever examine her yourself mrs gallilee i can answer for the result no miss minerva i have too much confidence in you to do anything of the kind besides in one of the most important of maria's accomplishments i am entirely dependent on yourself i know nothing of music you are not responsible for her progress in that direction still i should like to know if you are satisfied with maria's music quite satisfied you don't think she is getting how can i express it shall i say beyond the reach of mr le frank's teaching certainly not perhaps you would consider mr le frank equal to the instruction of an older and more advanced pupil than maria thus far miss minerva had answered the questions submitted to her with well concealed indifference this last inquiry roused her attention why did mrs gallilee show an interest for the first time in mr le frank's capacity as a teacher who was this older and more advanced pupil for whose appearance in the conversation the previous questions had so smoothly prepared the way feeling delicate ground under her the governess advanced cautiously i have always thought mr le frank an excellent teacher she said can you give me no more definite answer than that mrs gallilee asked i am quite unacquainted madam with the musical proficiency of the pupil to whom you refer i don't even know which adds to my perplexity whether you are speaking of a lady or a gentleman i am speaking said mrs gallilee quietly of my niece carmina those words set all further doubt at rest in miss minerva's mind introduced by such elaborate preparation the allusion to carmina's name could only lead in due course to the subject of carmina's marriage by indirect methods of approach mrs gallilee had at last reached the object that she had in view chapter xxii there was an interval of silence between the two ladies mrs gallilee waited for miss minerva to speak next miss minerva waited to be taken into mrs gallilee's confidence the sparrows twittered in the garden and far away in the schoolroom the notes of the piano announced that the music lesson had begun the birds are noisy said mrs gallilee and the piano sounds out of tune miss minerva remarked there was no help for it either mrs gallilee must return to the matter in hand or the matter in hand must drop i am afraid i have not made myself understood she resumed i am afraid i have been very stupid miss minerva confessed resigning herself to circumstances mrs gallilee put the adjourned question under a new form we were speaking of mr le frank as a teacher and of my niece as a pupil she said have you been able to form any opinion of carmina's musical abilities miss minerva remained as prudent as ever she answered i have had no opportunity of forming an opinion mrs gallilee met this cautious reply by playing her trump card she handed a letter to miss minerva i have received a proposal from mr le frank she said will you tell me what you think of it the letter was short and servile mr le frank presented his best respects if mrs gallilee's charming niece stood in need of musical instruction he ventured to hope that he might have the honour and happiness of superintending her studies looking back to the top of the letter the governess discovered that this modest request bore a date of eight days since have you written to mr le frank she asked only to say that i will take his request into consideration mrs gallilee replied had she waited for her son's departure before she committed herself to a decision on the chance that this might be the case miss minerva consulted her memory when mrs gallilee first decided on engaging a music master to teach the children her son had disapproved of employing mr le frank this circumstance might possibly be worth bearing in mind do you see any objection to accepting mr le frank's proposal mrs gallilee asked miss minerva saw an objection forthwith and thanks to her effort of memory discovered an especially mischievous way of stating it i feel a certain delicacy in offering an opinion she said modestly mrs gallilee was surprised do you allude to mr le frank she inquired no i don't doubt that his instructions would be of service to any young lady are you thinking of my niece no mrs gallilee i am thinking of your son in what way if you please in this way i believe your son would object to employing mr le frank as miss carmina's teacher on musical grounds no on personal grounds what do you mean miss minerva explained her meaning i think you have forgotten what happened when you first employed mr le frank to teach maria and zoe his personal appearance produced an unfavourable impression on your son and mr ovid made certain inquiries which you had not thought necessary pardon me if i persist in mentioning the circumstances i owe it to myself to justify my opinion an opinion you will please to remember that i did not volunteer mr ovid's investigations brought to light a very unpleasant report relating to mr le frank and a young lady who had been one of his pupils an abominable slander miss minerva i am surprised that you should refer to it i am referring madam to the view of the matter taken by mr ovid if mr le frank had failed to defend himself successfully he would of course not have been received into this house but your son had his own opinion of the defence i was present at the time and i heard him say that if maria and zoe had been older he should have advised employing a music master who had no false reports against him to contradict as they were only children he would say nothing more that is what i had in my mind when i gave my opinion i think mr ovid will be annoyed when he hears that mr le frank is his cousin's music master and if any foolish gossip reaches him in his absence i fear it might lead to mischievous results i mean to misunderstandings not easily set right by correspondence and quite likely therefore to lead in the end to distrust and jealousy there she paused and crossed her hands on her lap and waited for what was to come next if mrs gallilee could have looked into her mind at that moment as well as into her face she would have read miss minerva's thoughts in these plain terms all this time madam you have been keeping up appearances in the face of detection you are going to use mr le frank as a means of making mischief between ovid and carmina if you had taken me into your confidence i might have been willing to help you as it is please observe that i am not caught in the trap you have set for me if mr ovid discovers your little plot you can't lay the blame on your governess's advice mrs gallilee felt that she had again measured herself with miss minerva and had again been beaten she had confidently reckoned on the governess's secret feeling towards her son to encourage without hesitation or distrust any project for promoting the estrangement of ovid and carmina there was no alternative now but to put her first obstacle in the way of the marriage on her own sole responsibility i don't doubt that you have spoken sincerely she said but you have failed to do justice to my son's good sense and you are naturally enough in your position incapable of estimating his devoted attachment to carmina having planted that sting she paused to observe the effect not the slightest visible result rewarded her she went on almost the last words he said to me expressed his confidence his affectionate confidence in my niece the bare idea of his being jealous of anybody and especially of such a person as mr le frank is simply ridiculous i am astonished that you don't see it in that light i should see it in that light as plainly as you do miss minerva quietly replied if mr ovid was at home what difference does that make excuse me it makes a great difference as i think he has gone away on a long journey and gone away in bad health he will have his hours of depression at such times trifles are serious things and even well meant words in letters are sometimes misunderstood i can offer no better apology for what i have said and i can only regret that i have made so unsatisfactory a return for your flattering confidence in me having planted her sting she rose to retire have you any further commands for me she asked i should like to be quite sure that i have not misunderstood you said mrs gallilee you consider mr le frank to be competent as director of any young lady's musical studies thank you on the one point on which i wished to consult you my mind is at ease do you know where carmina is in her room i believe will you have the goodness to send her here with the greatest pleasure good evening so ended mrs gallilee's first attempt to make use of miss minerva without trusting her chapter xxiii the mistress of the house and the governess of the house had their own special reasons for retiring to their own rooms carmina was in solitude as a matter of necessity the only friends that the poor girl could gather round her now were the absent and the dead she had written to ovid merely for the pleasure of thinking that her letter would accompany him in the mail steamer which took him to quebec she had written to teresa she had opened her piano and had played the divinely beautiful music of mozart until its tenderness saddened her and she closed the instrument with an aching heart for a while she sat by the window thinking of ovid the decline of day has its melancholy affinities with the decline of life as the evening wore on her loneliness had become harder and harder to endure she rang for the maid and asked if miss minerva was at leisure miss minerva had been sent for by mrs gallilee where was zo in the schoolroom waiting until mr le frank had done with maria to take her turn at the piano left alone again carmina opened her locket and put ovid's portrait by it on the table her sad fancy revived her dead parents imagined her lover being presented to them saw him winning their hearts by his genial voice his sweet smile his wise and kindly words miss minerva entering the room found her still absorbed in her own little melancholy daydream recalling the absent reviving the dead as if she had been nearing the close of life and only seventeen years old alas for carmina only seventeen mrs gallilee wishes to see you she started is there anything wrong she asked no what makes you think so you speak in such a strange way oh frances i have been longing for you to keep me company and now you are here you look at me as coldly as if i had offended you perhaps you are not well that's it i am not well have some of my lavender water let me bathe your forehead and then blow on it to cool you this hot weather no sit down dear at any rate what does my aunt want with me i think i had better not tell you why your aunt is sure to ask you what i have said i have tried her temper you know what her temper is she has sent me here instead of sending a maid on the chance that i may commit some imprudence i give you her message exactly as the servant might have given it and you can tell her so with a safe conscience no more questions one more please is it anything about ovid no then my aunt can wait a little do sit down i want to speak to you about what about ovid of course carmina's look and tone at once set miss minerva's mind at ease her conduct on the day of ovid's departure had aroused no jealous suspicion in her innocent rival she refused to take the offered chair i have already told you your aunt is out of temper she said go to her at once carmina rose unwillingly there were so many things i wanted to say to you she began and was interrupted by a rapid little series of knocks at the door was the person in a hurry the person proved to be the discreet and accomplished maria she made her excuses to carmina with sweetness and turned to miss minerva with sorrow i regret to say that you are wanted in the schoolroom mr le frank can do nothing with zoe oh dear she sighed over her sister's wickedness and waited for instructions to be called away under any circumstances was a relief to miss minerva carmina's affectionate welcome had irritated her in the most incomprehensible manner she was angry with herself for being irritated she felt inclined to abuse the girl for believing her you fool why don't you see through me why don't you write to that other fool who is in love with you and tell him how i hate you both but for her self command she might have burst out with such mad words as those maria's appearance was inexpressibly welcome say i will follow you directly she answered maria in the language of the stage made a capital exit with a few hurried words of apology miss minerva prepared to follow carmina stopped her at the door don't be hard on zo she said i must do my duty miss minerva answered sternly we were sometimes naughty ourselves when we were children carmina pleaded and only the other day she had bread and water for tea i am so fond of zo and besides she looked doubtfully at miss minerva i don't think mr le frank is the sort of man to get on with children after what had just passed between mrs gallilee and herself this expression of opinion excited the governess's curiosity what makes you say that she asked well my dear for one thing mr le frank is so ugly don't you agree with me i think you had better keep your opinion to yourself if he heard of it is he vain my poor father used to say that all bad musicians were vain you don't call mr le frank a bad musician oh but i do i heard him at his concert mere execution of the most mechanical kind a musical box is as good as that man's playing this is how he does it her girlish good spirits had revived in her friend's company she turned gaily to the piano and amused herself by imitating mr le frank another knock at the door a single peremptory knock this time stopped the performance miss minerva had left the door ajar when carmina had prevented her from quitting the room she looked through the open space and discovered mr le frank his bald head trembled his florid complexion was livid with suppressed rage that little devil has run away he said and hurried down the stairs again as if he dare not trust himself to utter a word more has he heard me carmina asked in dismay he may only have heard you playing offering this hopeful suggestion miss minerva felt no doubt in her own mind that mr le frank was perfectly well acquainted with carmina's opinion of him it was easy enough to understand that he should himself inform the governess of an incident so entirely beyond the reach of his own interference as the flight of zo but it was impossible to assume that the furious anger which his face betrayed could have been excited by a child who had run away from a lesson no the vainest of men and musicians had heard that he was ugly and that his pianoforte playing resembled the performance of a musical box they left the room together carmina ill at ease to attend on her aunt miss minerva pondering on what had happened to find the fugitive zo the footman had already spared her the trouble of searching the house he had seen zo running out bare headed into the square and had immediately followed her the young rebel was locked up i don't care said zo i hate mr le frank miss minerva's mind was too seriously preoccupied to notice this aggravation of her pupil's offence one subject absorbed her attention the interview then in progress between carmina and her aunt how would mrs gallilee's scheme prosper now mr le frank might or might not consent to be carmina's teacher another result however was certain miss minerva thoroughly well knew the vindictive nature of the man he neither forgave nor forgot he was carmina's enemy for life chapter xxiv the month of july was near its end on the morning of the twenty eighth carmina was engaged in replying to a letter received from teresa her answer contained a record of domestic events during an interval of serious importance in her life under mrs gallilee's roof translated from the italian the letter was expressed in these terms are you vexed with me dearest for this late reply to your sad news from italy i have but one excuse to offer can i hear of your anxiety about your husband and not feel the wish to help you to bear your burden by writing cheerfully of myself over and over again i have thought of you and have opened my desk my spirits have failed me and i have shut it up again am i now in a happier frame of mind yes my good old nurse i am happier i have had a letter from ovid he has arrived safely at quebec and he is beginning to feel better already after the voyage you cannot imagine how beautifully how tenderly he writes i am almost reconciled to his absence when i read his letter will that give you some idea of the happiness and the consolation that i owe to this best and dearest of men ah my old granny i see you start and make that favourite mark with your thumb nail under the word 'consolation' i hear you say to yourself 'is she unhappy in her english home and is aunt gallilee to blame for it' yes it is even so what i would not for the whole world write to ovid i may confess to you aunt gallilee is indeed a hard hard woman do you remember telling me in your dear downright way that mr le frank looked like a rogue i don't know whether he is a rogue but i do know that it is through his conduct that my aunt is offended with me it happened three weeks ago she sent for me and said that my education must be completed and that my music in particular must be attended to i was quite willing to obey her and i said so with all needful readiness and respect she answered that she had already chosen a music master for me and then to my astonishment she mentioned his name mr le frank who taught her children was also to teach me i have plenty of faults but i really think vanity is not one of them it is only due to my excellent master in italy to say that i am a better pianoforte player than mr le frank i never breathed a word of this mind to my aunt it would have been ungrateful and useless she knows and cares nothing about music so we parted good friends and she wrote the same evening to engage my master the next day she got his reply mr le frank refused to be my professor of music and this after he had himself proposed to teach me in a letter addressed to my aunt being asked for his reasons he made an excuse the spare time at his disposal when he had written had been since occupied by another pupil the true reason for his conduct is that he heard me speak of him rashly enough i don't deny it as an ugly man and a bad player miss minerva sounded him on the subject at my request for the purpose of course of making my apologies he affected not to understand what she meant with what motive i am sure i don't know false and revengeful you may say and perhaps you may be right but the serious part of it so far as i am concerned is my aunt's behaviour to me if i had thwarted her in the dearest wish of her life she could hardly treat me with greater coldness and severity she has not stirred again in the matter of my education we only meet at meal times and she receives me when i sit down at table as she might receive a perfect stranger her icy civility is unendurable and this woman is my darling ovid's mother have i done with my troubles now no teresa not even yet oh how i wish i was with you in italy your letters persist in telling me that i am deluded in believing miss minerva to be truly my friend do pray remember even if i am wrong what a solitary position mine is in mrs gallilee's house i can play with dear little zo but whom can i talk to whom can i confide in if it turns out that miss minerva has been deceiving me when i wrote to you i refused to acknowledge that any such dreadful discovery as this could be possible i resented the bare idea of it as a cruel insult to my friend since that time my face burns with shame while i write it i am a little just a little shaken in my own opinion shall i tell you how it began yes i will my good old friend you have your prejudices but you speak your mind truly and whom else can i consult not ovid the one effort of my life is to prevent him from feeling anxious about me and besides i have contended against his opinion of miss minerva and have brought him to think of her more kindly has he been right notwithstanding and are you right and am i alone wrong you shall judge for yourself miss minerva began to change towards me after i had done the thing of all others which ought to have brought us closer together than ever she is very poorly paid by my aunt and she has been worried by little debts when she owned this i most willingly lent her the money to pay her bills a mere trifle only thirty pounds what do you think she did she crushed up the bank notes in her hand and left the room in the strangest headlong manner as if i had insulted her instead of helping her all the next day she avoided me the day after i myself went to her room and asked what was the matter she gave me a most extraordinary answer she said 'i don't know which of us two i most detest myself or you myself for borrowing your money or you for lending it' i left her not feeling offended only bewildered and distressed more than an hour passed before she made her excuses 'i am ill and miserable' that was all she said she did indeed look so wretched that i forgave her directly would you not have done so too in my place this happened a fortnight since only yesterday she broke out again and put my affection for her to a far more severe trial i have not got over it yet there was a message for her in ovid's letter expressed in the friendliest terms he remembered with gratitude her kind promise on saying good bye he believed she would do all that lay in her power to make my life happy in his absence and he only regretted her leaving him in such haste that he had no time to thank her personally such was the substance of the message i was proud and pleased to go to her room myself and read it to her can you guess how she received me nobody i say it positively nobody could guess she actually flew into a rage not only with me which i might have pardoned but with ovid which is perfectly inexcusable 'how dare he write to you' she burst out 'of what i said to him when we took leave of each other and how dare you come here and read it to me what do i care about your life in his absence of what earthly consequence are his remembrance and his gratitude to me' she spoke of him with such fury and such contempt that she roused me at last i said to her 'you abominable woman there is but one excuse for you you're mad' i left the room and didn't i bang the door we have not met since let me hear your opinion teresa i was in a passion when i told her she was mad but was i altogether wrong do you really think the poor creature is in her right senses looking back at your letter i see that you ask if i have made any new acquaintances i have been introduced to one of the sweetest women i ever met with and who do you think she is my other aunt mrs gallilee's younger sister lady northlake they say she was not so handsome as mrs gallilee when they were both young for my part i can only declare that no such comparison is possible between them now in look in voice in manner there is something so charming in lady northlake that i quite despair of describing it my father used to say that she was amiable and weak led by her husband and easily imposed upon i am not clever enough to have his eye for character and perhaps i am weak and easily imposed upon too before i had been ten minutes in lady northlake's company i would have given everything i possess in the world to have had her for my guardian she had called to say good bye on leaving london and my aunt was not at home we had a long delightful talk together she asked me so kindly to visit her in scotland and be introduced to lord northlake that i accepted the invitation with a glad heart when my aunt returned i quite forgot that we were on bad terms i gave her an enthusiastic account of all that had passed between her sister and myself how do you think she met this little advance on my part she positively refused to let me go to scotland as soon as i had in some degree got over my disappointment i asked for her reasons 'i am your guardian' she said 'and i am acting in the exercise of my own discretion i think it better you should stay with me' i made no further remark my aunt's cruelty made me think of my dead father's kindness it was as much as i could do to keep from crying thinking over it afterwards i supposed as this is the season when everybody leaves town that she had arranged to take me into the country with her mr gallilee who is always good to me thought so too and promised me some sailing at the sea side to the astonishment of everybody she has not shown any intention of going away from london even the servants ask what it means this is a letter of complaints am i adding to your anxieties instead of relieving them my kind old nurse there is no need to be anxious at the worst of my little troubles i have only to think of ovid and his mother's ice melts away from me directly i feel brave enough to endure anything take my heart's best love dear no next best love after ovid and give some of it to your poor suffering husband may i ask one little favour the english gentleman who has taken our old house at rome will not object to give you a few flowers out of what was once my garden send them to me in your next letter chapter xxv on the twelfth of august carmina heard from ovid again he wrote from montreal describing the presentation of that letter of introduction which he had once been tempted to destroy in the consequences that followed the presentation apparently harmless consequences at the time the destinies of ovid of carmina and of benjulia proved to be seriously involved ovid's letter was thus expressed i want to know my love if there is any other man in the world who is as fond of his darling as i am of you if such a person exists and if adverse circumstances compel him to travel i should like to ask a question is he perpetually calling to mind forgotten things which he ought to have said to his sweetheart before he left her this is my case let me give you an instance i have made a new friend here one mr morphew last night he was so kind as to invite me to a musical entertainment at his house he is a medical man and he amuses himself in his leisure hours by playing on that big and dreary member of the family of fiddles whose name is violoncello assisted by friends he hospitably cools his guests in the hot season by the amateur performance of quartets my dear i passed a delightful evening listening to the music not listening to a single note of it thinking of you have i roused your curiosity i fancy i can see your eyes brighten i fancy i can hear you telling me to go on my thoughts reminded me that music is one of the enjoyments of your life before i went away i ought to have remembered this and to have told you that the manager of the autumn concerts at the opera house is an old friend of mine he will be only too glad to place a box at your disposal on any night when his programme attracts your notice i have already made amends for my forgetfulness by writing to him by this mail miss minerva will be your companion at the theatre if mr le frank who is sure to be on the free list pays you a visit in your box tell him from me to put a wig on his bald head and to try if that will make him look like an honest man did i forget anything else before my departure did i tell you how precious you are to me how beautiful you are to me how entirely worthless my life is without you i dare say i did but i tell it all over again and when you are tired of the repetition you have only to let me know in the meanwhile have i nothing else to say have i no travelling adventures to relate you insist on hearing of everything that happens to me and you are to have your own way before we are married as well as after my sweet carmina your willing slave has something more serious than common travelling adventures to relate he has a confession to make in plain words i have been practising my profession again in the city of montreal i wonder whether you will forgive me when you are informed of the circumstances it is a sad little story but i am vain enough to think that my part in it will interest you i have been a vain man since that brightest and best of all possible days when you first made your confession when you said that you loved me look back in my letter and you will see mr morphew mentioned as a new friend of mine in canada i became acquainted with him through a letter of introduction given to me by benjulia say nothing to anybody of what i am now going to tell you and be especially careful if you happen to see him to keep benjulia in the dark i sincerely hope you will not see him he is a hard hearted man and he might say something which would distress you if he knew of the result which has followed his opening to me the door of his friend's house mr morphew is a worthy busy old gentleman who follows his professional routine and whose medical practice consists principally in bringing infant canadians into the world his services happened to be specially in request at the time when i made his acquaintance he was called away from his table on the day after the musical party when i dined with him i was the only guest and his wife was left to entertain me the good lady began by speaking of benjulia she roundly declared him to be a brute and she produced my letter of introduction closed by the doctor's own hand before he gave it to me as a proof would you like to read the letter too here is a copy 'the man who brings this is an overworked surgeon named ovid vere he wants rest and good air don't encourage him to use his brains and give him information enough to take him by the shortest way to the biggest desert in canada' you will now understand that i am indebted to myself for the hospitable reception which has detained me at montreal to return to my story mr morphew's services were again in request ten minutes after he had left the house this time the patient was a man and the messenger declared that he was at the point of death mrs morphew seemed to be at a loss what to do 'in this dreadful case' she said 'death is a mercy what i cannot bear to think of is the poor man's lonely position in his last moments there will not be a living creature at his bedside' hearing this i ventured to make some inquiries the answers painted such a melancholy picture of poverty and suffering and so vividly reminded me of a similar case in my own experience that i forgot i was an invalid myself and volunteered to visit the dying man in mr morphew's place the messenger led me to the poorest quarter of the city and to a garret in one of the wretchedest houses in the street there he lay without anyone to nurse him on a mattress on the floor what his malady was you will not ask to know i will only say that any man but a doctor would have run out of the room the moment he entered it to save the poor creature was impossible for a few days longer i could keep pain in subjection and could make death easy when it came at my next visit he was able to speak i discovered that he was a member of my own profession a mulatto from the southern states of america by birth the one fatal event of his life had been his marriage every worst offence of which a bad woman can be guilty his vile wife had committed and his infatuated love clung to her through it all she had disgraced and ruined him not once but again and again he had forgiven her under circumstances which degraded him in his own estimation and in the estimation of his best friends on the last occasion when she left him he had followed her to montreal in a fit of drunken frenzy she had freed him from her at last by self destruction her death affected his reason when he was discharged from the asylum he spent his last miserable savings in placing a monument over her grave as long as his strength held out he made daily pilgrimages to the cemetery and now when the shadow of death was darkening over him his one motive for clinging to life his one reason for vainly entreating me to cure him still centred in devotion to the memory of his wife 'nobody will take care of her grave' he said 'when i am gone' my love i have always thought fondly of you after hearing this miserable story my heart overflowed with gratitude to god for giving me carmina he died yesterday his last words implored me to have him buried in the same grave with the woman who had dishonoured him who am i that i should judge him besides i shall fulfil his last wishes as a thank offering for you there is still something more to tell on the day before his death he asked me to open an old portmanteau literally the one thing that he possessed he had no money left and no clothes in a corner of the portmanteau there was a roll of papers tied with a piece of string and that was all i can make you but one return' he said 'i give you my book' he was too weak to tell me what the book was about or to express any wish relative to its publication i am ashamed to say i set no sort of value on the manuscript presented to me except as a memorial of a sad incident in my life waking earlier than usual this morning i opened and examined my gift for the first time to my amazement i found myself rewarded a hundredfold for the little that i had been able to do this unhappy man must have been possessed of abilities which under favouring circumstances would i don't hesitate to say have ranked him among the greatest physicians of our time the language in which he writes is obscure and sometimes grammatically incorrect but he and he alone has solved a problem in the treatment of disease which has thus far been the despair of medical men throughout the whole civilised world if a stranger was looking over my shoulder he would be inclined to say this curious lover writes to his young lady as if she was a medical colleague we understand each other carmina don't we my future career is an object of interest to my future wife this poor fellow's gratitude has opened new prospects to me and who will be so glad to hear of it as you before i close my letter you will expect me to say a word more about my health sometimes i feel well enough to take my cabin in the next vessel that sails for liverpool but there are other occasions particularly when i happen to over exert myself in walking or riding which warn me to be careful and patient my next journey will take me inland to the mighty plains and forest of this grand country when i have breathed the health giving air of those regions i shall be able to write definitely of the blessed future day which is to unite us once more my mother has i suppose given her usual conversazione at the end of the season let me hear how you like the scientific people at close quarters and let me give you a useful hint when you meet in society with a particularly positive man who looks as if he was sitting for his photograph you may safely set that man down as a professor seriously i do hope that you and my mother get on well together you say too little of each other in your letters to me and i am sometimes troubled by misgivings there is another odd circumstance connected with our correspondence which sets me wondering i always send messages to miss minerva and miss minerva never sends any messages back to me do you forget or am i an object of perfect indifference to your friend my latest news of you all is from zo she has sent me a letter in one of the envelopes that i directed for her when i went away miss minerva's hair would stand on end if she could see the blots and the spelling zo's account of the family circle turned into intelligible english will i think personally interest you here it is in its own roman brevity with your pretty name shortened to two syllables 'except pa and car we are a bad lot at home' after that i can add nothing that is worth reading take the kisses my angel that i leave for you on the blank morsel of paper below and love me as i love you there is a world of meaning carmina even in those commonplace words oh if i could only go to you by the mail steamer in the place of my letter chapter xxvi the answers to ovid's questions were not to be found in carmina's reply she had reasons for not mentioning the conversazione and she shrank from writing to him of his mother her true position in mrs gallilee's house growing day by day harder and harder to endure threatening more and more plainly complications and perils to come was revealed in her next letter to her old friend in italy she wrote to teresa in these words if you love me forget the inhuman manner in which i have spoken of miss minerva after i had written to you i would have recalled my letter if it could have been done i began that evening to feel ashamed of what i had said in my anger as the hours went on and bedtime approached i became so wretched that i ran the risk of another harsh reception by intruding on her once more it was a circumstance in my favour that she was to all appearance in bad spirits too there was something in her voice when she asked what i wanted which made me think though she looks like the last person in the world to be guilty of such weakness that she had been crying i gave the best expression i could to my feelings of repentance and regret what i actually said to her has slipped out of my memory i was frightened and upset and i am always stupid in that condition my attempt at reconciliation may have been clumsy enough but she might surely have seen that i had no intention to mystify and distress her and yet what else could she have imagined to judge by her own actions and words her bedroom candle was on the table behind me she snatched it up and held it before my face and looked at me as if i was some extraordinary object that she had never seen or heard of before 'you are little better than a child' she said 'i have ten times your strength of will what is there in you that i can't resist go away from me be on your guard against me i am false i am suspicious i am cruel you simpleton have you no instincts to protect you is there nothing in you that shrinks from me' she put down the candle and burst into a wretched mocking laugh 'there she stands' cried this strange creature 'and looks at me with the eyes of a baby that sees something new i can't frighten her i can't disgust her what does it mean' she dropped into a chair her voice sank almost to a whisper i should have thought she was afraid of me if such a thing had been possible 'what do you know of me that i don't know of myself' she asked it was quite beyond me to understand what she meant i took a chair and sat down by her 'i only know what you said to me yesterday' i answered 'what did i say' 'you told me you were miserable' 'i told you a lie believe what i have said to you to day in your own interests believe it to be the truth' nothing would induce me to believe it 'no' i said 'you were miserable yesterday and you are miserable to day that is the truth' what put my next bold words into my head i don't know it doesn't matter the thought was in me and out it came 'i think you have some burden on your mind' i went on 'if i can't relieve you of it perhaps i can help you bear it come tell me what it is' i waited but it was of no use she never even looked at me because i am in love myself do i think everybody else is like me i thought she blushed i don't know what else i thought 'are you in love' i asked she jumped up from her chair so suddenly and so violently that she threw it on the floor still not a word passed her lips i found courage enough to go on but not courage enough to look at her 'i love ovid and ovid loves me' i said 'there is my consolation whatever my troubles may be are you not so fortunate' a dreadful expression of pain passed over her face how could i see it and not feel the wish to sympathise with her i ran the risk and said 'do you love somebody who doesn't love you' she turned her back on me and went to the toilet table i think she looked at herself in the glass 'well' she said speaking to me at last 'what else' 'nothing else' i answered 'except that i hope i have not offended you' she left the glass as suddenly as she had approached it and took up the candle again once more she held it so that it lit my face 'guess who he is' she said 'how can i do that' i asked she quietly put down the candle again in some way quite incomprehensible to myself i seemed to have relieved her she spoke to me in a changed voice gently and sadly you are the best of good girls and you mean kindly it's of no use you can do nothing forgive my insolence yesterday i was mad with envy of your happy marriage engagement you don't understand such a nature as mine so much the better ah so much the better good night' there was such hopeless submission such patient suffering in those words that i could not find it in my heart to leave her i thought of how i might have behaved of the wild things i might have said if ovid had cared nothing for me had some cruel man forsaken her that was her secret i asked myself what i could do to encourage her your last letter with our old priest's enclosure was in my pocket i took it out 'would you mind reading a short letter' i said 'before we wish each other goodnight' i held out the priest's letter she drew back with a dark look she appeared to have some suspicion of it 'who is the writer' she inquired sharply 'a person who is a stranger to you' her face cleared directly she took the letter from me and waited to hear what i had to say next 'the person' i told her 'is a wise and good old man the priest who married my father and mother and baptised me we all of us used to consult father patrizio when we wanted advice my nurse teresa felt anxious about me in ovid's absence she spoke to him about my marriage engagement and of my exile forgive me for using the word in this house he said he would consider before he gave her his opinion the next day he sent her the letter which you have got in your hand' there i came to a full stop having something yet to say but not knowing how to express myself with the necessary delicacy 'why do you wish me to read the letter' she asked quietly i think there is something in it which might ' there like a fool i came to another full stop she was as patient as ever she only made a little sign to me to go on 'i think father patrizio's letter might put you in a better frame of mind' i said 'it might keep you from despising yourself' she went back to her chair and read the letter you have permitted me to keep the comforting words of the good father among my other treasures i copy his letter for you in this place so that you may read it again and see what i had in my mind and understand how it affected poor miss minerva 'teresa my well beloved friend i have considered the anxieties that trouble you with this result that i can do my best conscientiously to quiet your mind i have had the experience of forty years in the duties of the priesthood in that long time the innermost secrets of thousands of men and women have been confided to me from such means of observation i have drawn many useful conclusions and some of them may be also useful to you i will put what i have to say in the plainest and fewest words consider them carefully on your side the growth of the better nature in women is perfected by one influence and that influence is love are you surprised that a priest should write in this way did you expect me to say religion love my sister is religion in women it opens their hearts to all that is good for them and it acts independently of the conditions of human happiness a miserable woman tormented by hopeless love is still the better and the nobler for that love and a time will surely come when she will show it you have fears for carmina cast away poor soul among strangers with hard hearts i tell you to have no fears she may suffer under trials she may sink under trials but the strength to rise again is in her and that strength is love' having read our old friend's letter miss minerva turned back and read it again and waited a little repeating some part of it to herself 'does it encourage you' i asked she handed the letter back to me 'i have got one sentence in it by heart' she said you will know what that sentence is without my telling you i felt so relieved when i saw the change in her for the better i was so inexpressibly happy in the conviction that we were as good friends again as ever that i bent down to kiss her on saying goodnight she put up her hand and stopped me 'no' she said 'not till i have done something to deserve it you are more in need of help than you think stay here a little longer i have a word to say to you about your aunt' i returned to my chair feeling a little startled her eyes rested on me absently she was as i imagined considering with herself before she spoke i refrained from interrupting her thoughts the night was still and dark not a sound reached our ears from without in the house the silence was softly broken by a rustling movement on the stairs it came nearer the door was opened suddenly mrs gallilee entered the room what folly possessed me why was i frightened i really could not help it i screamed my aunt walked straight up to me without taking the smallest notice of miss minerva 'what are you doing here when you ought to be in your bed' she asked she spoke in such an imperative manner with such authority and such contempt that i looked at her in astonishment some suspicion seemed to be roused in her by finding me and miss minerva together no more gossip' she called out sternly 'do you hear me go to bed' was it not enough to rouse anybody i felt my pride burning in my face 'am i a child or a servant' i said 'i shall go to bed early or late as i please' she took one step forward she seized me by the arm and forced me to my feet think of it teresa in all my life i have never had a hand laid on me except in kindness who knows it better than you i tried vainly to speak i saw miss minerva rise to interfere i heard her say 'mrs gallilee you forget yourself' somehow i got out of the room on the landing a dreadful fit of trembling shook me from head to foot i sank down on the stairs at first i thought i was going to faint no i shook and shivered but i kept my senses i could hear their voices in the room mrs gallilee began 'did you tell me just now that i had forgotten myself' miss minerva answered 'certainly madam you did forget yourself' the next words escaped me after that they grew louder and i heard them again my aunt first 'i am dissatisfied with your manner to me miss minerva it has latterly altered very much for the worse' 'in what respect mrs gallilee' 'in this respect your way of speaking to me implies an assertion of equality ' 'stop a minute madam i am not so rich as you are but i am at a loss to know in what other way i am not your equal did you assert your superiority may i ask when you came into my room without first knocking at the door' 'miss minerva do you wish to remain in my service' 'say employment mrs gallilee if you please i am quite indifferent in the matter i am equally ready at your entire convenience to stay or to go' mrs gallilee's voice sounded nearer as if she was approaching the door 'i think we arranged' she said 'that there was to be a month's notice on either side when i first engaged you' 'yes at my suggestion' 'take your month's notice if you please' 'dating from to morrow' 'of course' my aunt came out and found me on the stairs i tried to rise it was not to be done my head turned giddy she must have seen that i was quite prostrate and yet she took no notice of the state i was in cruel cruel creature she accused me of listening 'can't you see that the poor girl is ill' it was miss minerva's voice i looked round at her feeling fainter and fainter she stooped i felt her strong sinewy arms round me she lifted me gently 'i'll take care of you' she whispered and carried me downstairs to my room as easily as if i had been a child i must rest teresa the remembrance of that dreadful night brings it all back again don't be anxious about me my old dear you shall hear more to morrow chapter xxvii on the next day events happened the influence of which upon carmina's excitable nature urged her to complete her unfinished letter without taking the rest that she needed once more and as the result proved for the last time she wrote to her faithful old friend in these words don't ask me to tell you how the night passed miss minerva was the first person who came to me in the morning she had barely said a few kind words when maria interrupted us reminding her governess of the morning's lessons 'mrs gallilee has sent her' miss minerva whispered 'i will return to you in the hour before the children's dinner' the next person who appeared was as we had both anticipated mrs gallilee herself she brought me a cup of tea and the first words she spoke were words of apology for her conduct on the previous night her excuse was that she had been 'harassed by anxieties which completely upset her' and can you believe it she implored me not to mention 'the little misunderstanding between us when i next wrote to her son' is this woman made of iron and stone instead of flesh and blood does she really think me such a wretch as to cause ovid under any provocation a moment's anxiety while he is away the fewest words that would satisfy her and so send her out of my room were the only words i said after this an agreeable surprise was in store for me the familiar voice of good mr gallilee applied for admission through the keyhole 'are you asleep my dear may i come in' his kind fat old face peeped round the door when i said yes and reminded me of zo at dinner when she asks for more pudding and doesn't think she will get it mr gallilee had something to ask for and some doubt of getting it which accounted for the resemblance 'i've taken the liberty carmina of sending for our doctor you're a delicate plant my dear ' here his face disappeared and he spoke to somebody outside 'you think so yourself don't you mr null and you have a family of daughters haven't you' his face appeared again more like zo than ever 'do please see him my child i'm not easy about you i was on the stairs last night nobody ever notices me do they mr null and i saw miss minerva good creature and lord how strong carrying you to your bed mr null's waiting outside don't distress me by saying no' is there anybody cruel enough to distress mr gallilee the doctor came in looking like a clergyman dressed all in black with a beautiful frill to his shirt and a spotless white cravat he stared hard at me he produced a little glass tube he gave it a shake and put it under my arm he took it away again and consulted it he said 'aha' he approved of my tongue he disliked my pulse he gave his opinion at last 'perfect quiet i must see mrs gallilee' and there was an end of it mr gallilee observed the medical proceedings with awe 'mr null is a wonderful man' he whispered before he followed the doctor out ill and wretched as i was this little interruption amused me i wonder why i write about it here there are serious things waiting to be told am i weakly putting them off miss minerva came back to me as she had promised 'it is well' she said gravely 'that the doctor has been to see you' i asked if the doctor thought me very ill he thinks you have narrowly escaped a nervous fever and he has given some positive orders one of them is that your slightest wishes are to be humoured if he had not said that mrs gallilee would have prevented me from seeing you she has been obliged to give way and she hates me almost as bitterly carmina as she hates you' this called to my mind the interruption of the previous night when miss minerva had something important to tell me when i asked what it was she shook her head and said painful subjects of conversation were not fit subjects in my present state need i add that i insisted on hearing what she had to say oh how completely my poor father must have been deceived when he made his horrible sister my guardian if i had not fortunately offended the music master she would have used mr le frank as a means of making ovid jealous and of sowing the seeds of dissension between us having failed so far she is as miss minerva thinks at a loss to discover any other means of gaining her wicked ends her rage at finding herself baffled seems to account for her furious conduct when she discovered me in miss minerva's room you will ask as i did what has she to gain by this wicked plotting and contriving with its shocking accompaniments of malice and anger miss minerva answered 'i still believe that money is the motive her son is mistaken about her her friends are mistaken they think she is fond of money the truer conclusion is she is short of money there is the secret of the hard bargains she drives and the mercenary opinions she holds i don't doubt that her income would be enough for most other women in her position it is not enough for a woman who is jealous of her rich sister's place in the world wait a little and you will see that i am not talking at random you were present at the grand party she gave some week's since' 'i wish i had stayed in my own room' i said 'mrs gallilee was offended with me for not admiring her scientific friends with one or two exceptions they talked of nothing but themselves and their discoveries and oh dear how ugly they were' 'never mind that now carmina did you notice the profusion of splendid flowers in the hall and on the staircase as well as in the reception rooms' 'yes' 'did you observe no you are a young girl did you hear any of the gentlemen in the supper room expressing their admiration of the luxuries provided for the guests the exquisite french cookery and the delicious wine why was all the money which these things cost spent in one evening because lady northlake's parties must be matched by mrs gallilee's parties lady northlake lives in a fashionable neighbourhood in london and has splendid carriages and horses this is a fashionable neighbourhood judge what this house costs and the carriages and horses when i tell you that the rent of the stables alone is over a hundred pounds a year lady northlake has a superb place in scotland mrs gallilee is not able to rival her sister in that respect but she has her marine villa in the isle of wight when mr gallilee said you should have some sailing this autumn did you think he meant that he would hire a boat he referred to the yacht which is part of the establishment at the sea side lady northlake goes yachting with her husband and mrs gallilee goes yachting with her husband do you know what it costs when the first milliner in paris supplies english ladies with dresses that milliner's lowest charge for a dress which mrs gallilee would despise ordinary material my dear and imitation lace is forty pounds think a little and even your inexperience will see that the mistress of this house is spending more than she can afford and is likely unless she has resources that we know nothing about to be sooner or later in serious need of money' this was a new revelation to me and it altered my opinion of course but i still failed to see what mrs gallilee's extravagances had to do with her wicked resolution to prevent ovid from marrying me miss minerva's only answer to this was to tell me to write to mr mool while i had the chance and ask for a copy of my father's will 'i will take the letter to him' she said 'and bring the reply myself it will save time if it does nothing else' the letter was written in a minute just as she took it from me the parlour maid announced that the early dinner was ready two hours later the reply was in my hands the old father had taken maria and zo for their walk and miss minerva had left the house by herself sending word to mrs gallilee that she was obliged to go out on business of her own 'did mrs gallilee see you come in' i asked 'yes she was watching for me no doubt' did she see you go upstairs to my room' 'yes' 'and said nothing' 'nothing' we looked at each other both of us feeling the same doubt of how the day would end miss minerva pointed impatiently to the lawyer's reply i opened it mr mool's letter was very kind but quite incomprehensible in the latter part of it after referring me to his private residence in case i wished to consult him personally later in the day he mentioned some proceeding called 'proving the will' and some strange place called 'doctors' commons' however there was the copy of the will and that was all we wanted i began reading it how i pitied the unfortunate men who have to learn the law my dear teresa i might as well have tried to read an unknown tongue the strange words the perpetual repetitions the absence of stops utterly bewildered me i handed the copy to miss minerva instead of beginning on the first page as i had done she turned to the last with what breathless interest i watched her face first i saw that she understood what she was reading then after a while she turned pale and then she lifted her eyes to me 'don't be frightened' she said but i was frightened my ignorant imagination pictured some dreadful unknown power given to mrs gallilee by the will 'what can my aunt do to me' i asked miss minerva composed me without concealing the truth 'in her position carmina and with her intensely cold and selfish nature there is no fear of her attempting to reach her ends by violent means your happiness may be in danger and that prospect god knows is bad enough' when she talked of my happiness i naturally thought of ovid i asked if there was anything about him in the will it was no doubt a stupid thing to say at such a time and it seemed to annoy her 'you are the only person concerned' she answered sharply 'it is mrs gallilee's interest that you shall never be her son's wife or any man's wife if she can have her way you will live and die an unmarried woman' this did me good it made me angry i began to feel like myself again i said 'please let me hear the rest of it' miss minerva first patiently explained to me what she had read in the will she then returned to the subject of my aunt's extravagance speaking from experience of what had happened in her own family 'if mrs gallilee borrows money' she said 'her husband will in all probability have to repay the loan and if borrowings go on in that way maria and zoe will be left wretchedly provided for in comparison with lady northlake's daughters a fine large fortune would wonderfully improve these doubtful prospects can you guess carmina where it is to come from' i could easily guess now i understood the will my good teresa if i die without leaving children the fine large fortune comes from me you see it all now don't you after i had thanked miss minerva turned away my head on the pillow overpowered by disgust the clock in the hall struck the hour of the children's tea miss minerva would be wanted immediately at parting she kissed me 'there is the kiss that you meant to give me last night' she said 'don't despair of yourself i am to be in the house for a month longer and i am a match for mrs gallilee we will say no more now compose yourself and try to sleep' she went away to her duties sleep was out of the question my attention wandered when i tried to read doing nothing meant in other words thinking of what had happened if you had come into my room i should have told you all about it the next best thing was to talk to you in this way you don't know what a relief it has been to me to write these lines the night has come and mrs gallilee's cruelty has at last proved too much even for my endurance try not to be surprised try not to be alarmed if my mind to morrow is the same as my mind to night i shall attempt to make my escape i shall take refuge with lady northlake oh if i could go to ovid but he is travelling in the deserts of canada until his return to the coast i can only write to him to the care of his bankers at quebec i should not know where to find him when i arrived and what a dreadful meeting if i did find him to be obliged to acknowledge that it is his mother who has driven me away there will be nothing to alarm him if i go to his mother's sister if you could see lady northlake you would feel as sure as i do that she will take my part after writing to you i must have fallen asleep it was quite dark when i was awakened by the striking of a match in my room i looked round expecting to see miss minerva the person lighting my candle was mrs gallilee she poured out the composing medicine which mr null had ordered for me i took it in silence she sat down by the bedside 'my child' she began 'we are friends again now you bear no malice i am sure' distrust still kept me silent i remembered that she had watched for miss minerva's return and that she had seen miss minerva go up to my room the idea that she meant to be revenged on us both for having our secrets and keeping them from her knowledge took complete possession of my mind 'are you feeling better' she asked 'yes' 'is there anything i can get for you' 'not now thank you' 'would you like to see mr null again before to morrow' 'oh no' these were ungraciously short replies but it cost me an effort to speak to her at all she showed no signs of taking offence she proceeded as smoothly as ever my dear carmina i have my faults of temper and with such pursuits as mine i am not perhaps a sympathetic companion for a young girl but i hope you believe that it is my duty and my pleasure to be a second mother to you' yes she did really say that whether i was only angry or whether i was getting hysterical i don't know i began to feel an oppression in my breathing that almost choked me there are two windows in my room and one of them only was open i was obliged to ask her to open the other she did it she came back and fanned me i submitted as long as i could and then i begged her not to trouble herself any longer she put down the fan and went on with what she had to say 'i wish to speak to you about miss minerva you are aware that i gave her notice last night to leave her situation for your sake i regret that i did not take this step before you came to england' my confidence in myself returned when i heard miss minerva spoken of in this way i said at once that i considered her to be one of my best and truest friends 'my dear child that is exactly what i lament this person has insinuated herself into your confidence and she is utterly unworthy of it' could i let those abominable words pass in silence 'mrs gallilee' i said 'you are cruelly wronging a woman whom i love and respect' 'mrs gallilee' she repeated 'do i owe it to miss minerva that you have left off calling me aunt your obstinacy carmina leaves me no alternative but to speak out if i had done my duty i ought to have said long since what i am going to say now you are putting your trust in the bitterest enemy you have an enemy who secretly hates you with the unforgiving hatred of a rival' look back at my letter describing what passed between miss minerva and me when i went to her room and you will know what i felt on hearing her spoken of as 'a rival' my sense of justice refused to believe it but oh my dear old nurse there was some deeper sense in me that said as if in words it is true mrs gallilee went on without mercy 'i know her thoroughly i have looked into her false heart nobody has discovered her but me charge her with it if you like and let her deny it if she dare miss minerva is secretly in love with my son' she got up her object was gained she was even with me and with the woman who had befriended me at last 'lie down in your bed again' she said 'and think over what i have told you in your own interests think over it well' i was left alone shall i tell you what saved me from sinking under the shock ovid thousands and thousands of miles away ovid saved me i love him with all my heart and soul and i do firmly believe that i know him better than i know myself if his mother had betrayed miss minerva to him as she has betrayed her to me that unhappy woman would have had his truest pity i am as certain of this as i am that i see the moon while i write shining on my bed ovid would have pitied her and i pitied her i wrote the lines that follow and sent them to her by the maid in the fear that she might mistake my motives and think me angry and jealous i addressed her with my former familiarity by her christian name 'last night frances i ventured to ask if you loved some one who did not love you and you answered by saying to me guess who he is my aunt has just told me that he is her son has she spoken the truth' i am now waiting to receive miss minerva's reply for the first time since i have been in the house my door is locked i cannot and will not see mrs gallilee again all her former cruelties are as i feel it nothing to the cruelty of her coming here when i am ill and saying to me what she has said the weary time passes and still there is no reply is frances angry or is she hesitating how to answer me personally or by writing no she has too much delicacy of feeling to answer in her own person i have only done her justice the maid has just asked me to open the door i have got my answer read it 'mrs gallilee has spoken the truth 'how i can have betrayed myself so that she has discovered my miserable secret is more than i can tell i will not own it to her or to any living creature but yourself undeserving as i am i know that i can trust you it is needless to dwell at any length on this confession many things in my conduct which must have perplexed you will explain themselves flow there has been however one concealment on my part which it is due to you that i should acknowledge 'if mrs gallilee had taken me into her confidence i confess that my jealousy would have degraded me into becoming her accomplice as things were i was too angry and too cunning to let her make use of me without trusting me 'there are other acts of deceit which i ought to acknowledge if i could summon composure enough to write about them better to say at once i am not worthy of your pardon not worthy even of your pity 'with the same sincerity i warn you that the wickedness in me on which mrs gallilee calculated may be in me still the influence of your higher and better nature helped perhaps by that other influence of which the old priest spoke in his letter has opened my heart to tenderness and penitence of which i never believed myself capable has brought the burning tears into my eyes which make it a hard task to write to you all this i know and yet i dare not believe in myself it is useless to deny it carmina i love him even now when you have found me out i love him don't trust me oh god what torture it is to write it but i do write it i will write it don't trust me 'one thing i may say for myself i know the utter hopelessness of that love which i have acknowledged i know that he returns your love and will never return mine so let it be 'i am not young i have no right to comfort myself with hopes that i know to be vain if one of us is to suffer let it be that one who is used to suffering i have never been the darling of my parents like you i have not been used at home to the kindness and the love that you remember a life without sweetness and joy has well fitted me for a loveless future and besides you are worthy of him and i am not mrs gallilee is wrong carmina if she thinks i am your rival i am not your rival i never can be your rival believe nothing else but for god's sake believe that 'i have no more to say at least no more that i can remember now perhaps you shrink from remaining in the same house with me let me know it and i shall be ready i might almost say glad to go' have you read her letter teresa am i wrong in feeling that this poor wounded heart has surely some claim on me if i am wrong oh what am i to do what am i to do chapter xxviii the last lines addressed by carmina to her old nurse were completed on the seventeenth of august and were posted that night the day that followed was memorable to carmina and memorable to mrs gallilee doctor benjulia had his reasons also for remembering the eighteenth of august still in search of a means to undermine the confidence which united ovid and carmina and still calling on her invention in vain mrs gallilee had passed a sleepless night her maid entering the room at the usual hour was ordered to leave her in bed and not to return until the bell rang on ordinary occasions mrs gallilee was up in time to receive the letters arriving by the first delivery the correspondence of the other members of the household being sorted by her own hands before it was distributed by the servant on this particular morning after sleeping a little through sheer exhaustion she entered the empty breakfast room two hours later than usual the letters waiting for her were addressed only to herself she rang for the maid any other letters this morning she asked two for my master no more than that nothing more ma'am except a telegram for miss carmina when did it come soon after the letters have you given it to her being a telegram ma'am i thought i ought to take it to miss carmina at once quite right you can go a telegram for carmina was there some private correspondence going on and were the interests involved too important to wait for the ordinary means of communication by post considering these questions mrs gallilee poured out a cup of tea and looked over her letters only one of them especially attracted her notice in her present frame of mind the writer was benjulia he dispensed as usual with the customary forms of address i have had a letter about ovid from a friend of mine in canada there is an allusion to him of the complimentary sort which i don't altogether understand i want to ask you about it but i can't spare the time to go a visiting so much the better for me i hate conversation and i like work you have got your carriage and your fine friends are out of town if you want a drive come to me and bring your last letters from ovid with you mrs gallilee decided on considering this characteristic proposal later in the day her first and foremost interest took her upstairs to her niece's room carmina had left her bed robed in her white dressing gown she lay on the sofa in the sitting room when her aunt came in she started and shuddered those signs of nervous aversion escaped the notice of mrs gallilee her attention had been at once attracted by a travelling bag opened as if in preparation for packing the telegram lay on carmina's lap the significant connection between those two objects asserted itself plainly but it was exactly the opposite of the connection suspected by mrs gallilee the telegram had prevented carmina from leaving the house mrs gallilee paved the way for the necessary investigation by making a few common place inquiries how had carmina passed the night had the maid taken care of her at breakfast time was there anything that her aunt could do for her carmina replied with a reluctance which she was unable to conceal mrs gallilee passed over the cold reception accorded to her without remark and pointed with a bland smile to the telegram no bad news i hope carmina handed the telegram silently to her aunt the change of circumstances which the arrival of the message had produced made concealment superfluous mrs gallilee opened the telegram keeping her suspicions in reserve it had been sent from rome by the old foreign woman named teresa and it contained these words my husband died this morning expect me in london from day to day why is this person coming to london mrs gallilee inquired stung by the insolent composure of that question carmina answered sharply her name is on the telegram you ought to know indeed said mrs gallilee perhaps she likes london she hates london you have had her in the house you have seen us together now she has lost her husband do you think she can live apart from the one person in the world whom she loves best my dear these matters of mere sentiment escape my notice mrs gallilee rejoined it's an expensive journey from italy to england what was her husband her husband was foreman in a manufactory till his health failed him and then mrs gallilee concluded the money failed him of course what did he manufacture artists' colours oh an artists' colourman not a very lucrative business i should think has his widow any resources of her own my purse is hers very generous i am sure even the humblest lodgings are dear in this neighbourhood however with your assistance your old servant may be able to live somewhere near you having settled the question of teresa's life in london in this way mrs gallilee returned to the prime object of her suspicion she took possession of the travelling bag carmina looked at her with the submission of utter bewilderment teresa had been the companion of her life teresa had been received as her attendant when she was first established under her aunt's roof she had assumed that her nurse would become a member of the household again as a matter of course with teresa to encourage her she had summoned the resolution to live with ovid's mother until ovid came back and now she had been informed in words too plain to be mistaken that teresa must find a home for herself when she returned to london surprise disappointment indignation held carmina speechless this thing mrs gallilee proceeded holding up the bag will only be in your way here i will have it put with our own bags and boxes in the lumber room and by the bye i fancy you don't quite understand naturally enough at your age our relative positions in this house my child the authority of your late father is the authority which your guardian holds over you i hope never to be obliged to exercise it especially if you will be good enough to remember two things i expect you to consult me in your choice of companions and to wait for my approval before you make arrangements which well let us say which require the bag to be removed from the lumber room without waiting for a reply she turned to the door after opening it she paused and looked back into the room have you thought of what i told you last night she asked sorely as they had been tried carmina's energies rallied at this i have done my best to forget it she answered at miss minerva's request carmina took no notice of the question mrs gallilee persisted have you had any communication with that person there was still no reply preserving her temper mrs gallilee stepped out on the landing and called to miss minerva the governess answered from the upper floor please come down here said mrs galilee miss minerva obeyed her face was paler than usual her eyes had lost something of their piercing brightness she stopped outside carmina's door mrs gallilee requested her to enter the room after an instant only an instant of hesitation miss minerva crossed the threshold she cast one quick glance at carmina and lowered her eyes before the look could be returned mrs gallilee discovered no mute signs of an understanding between them she turned to the governess have you been here already this morning she inquired no is there some coolness between you and my niece none madam that i know of then why don't you speak to her when you come into the room miss carmina has been ill i see her resting on the sofa and i am unwilling to disturb her not even by saying good morning not even that you are exceedingly careful miss minerva i have had some experience of sick people and i have learnt to be careful may i ask if you have any particular reason for calling me downstairs mrs gallilee prepared to put her niece and her governess to the final test i wish you to suspend the children's lesson for an hour or two she answered certainly shall i tell them no i will tell them myself what do you wish me to do said miss minerva i wish you to remain here with my niece if mrs gallilee after answering in those terms had looked at her niece instead of looking at her governess she would have seen carmina distrustful of her own self control move on the sofa so as to turn her face to the wall as it was miss minerva's attitude and look silently claimed some explanation mrs gallilee addressed her in a whisper let me say a word to you at the door miss minerva followed her to the landing outside carmina turned again listening anxiously i am not at all satisfied with her looks this morning mrs gallilee proceeded and i don't think it right she should be left alone my household duties must be attended to will you take my place at the sofa until mr null comes now she thought if there is jealousy between them i shall see it she saw nothing the governess quietly bowed to her and went back to carmina she heard nothing although the half closed door gave her opportunities for listening ignorant she had entered the room ignorant she left it carmina lay still and silent with noiseless step miss minerva approached the sofa and stood by it waiting neither of them lifted her eyes the one to the other the woman suffered her torture in secret the girl's sweet eyes filled slowly with tears one by one the minutes of the morning passed not many in number before there was a change in silence carmina held out her hand in silence miss minerva took it and kissed it chapter xxix mrs gallilee saw her housekeeper as usual and gave her orders for the day if there is anything forgotten she said i must leave it to you for the next hour or two don't let me be disturbed some of her letters of the morning were still unread others required immediate acknowledgment she was not as ready for her duties as usual for once the most unendurably industrious of women was idle and sat thinking even her unimaginative nature began to tremble on the verge of superstition twice had the subtle force of circumstances defeated her in the attempt to meddle with the contemplated marriage of her son by means of the music master she had planned to give ovid jealous reasons for doubting carmina and she had failed by means of the governess she had planned to give carmina jealous reasons for doubting ovid and she had failed when some people talked of fatality were they quite such fools as she had hitherto supposed them to be it would be a waste of time to inquire what next step could she take urged by the intolerable sense of defeat to find reasons for still looking hopefully to the future the learned mrs gallilee lowered herself to the intellectual level of the most ignorant servant in the house the modern muse of science unconsciously opened her mind to the vulgar belief in luck she said to herself as her kitchen maid might have said we will see what comes of it the third time benjulia's letter was among the other letters waiting on the table she took it up and read it again in her present frame of mind to find her thoughts occupied by the doctor was to be reminded of ovid's strange allusion to his professional colleague on the day of his departure speaking of carmina he had referred to one person whom he did not wish her to see in his absence and that person he had himself admitted to be benjulia he had been asked to state his objection to the doctor and how had he replied he had said i don't think benjulia a fit person to be in the company of a young girl why there are many men of mature age who are not fit persons to be in the company of young girls but they are either men who despise or men who admire young girls benjulia belonged neither to the one nor to the other of these two classes girls were objects of absolute indifference to him with the one exception of zo aged ten never yet after meeting him in society hundreds of times had mrs gallilee seen him talk to young ladies or even notice young ladies ovid's alleged reason for objecting to benjulia stood palpably revealed as a clumsy excuse in the present posture of events to arrive at that conclusion was enough for mrs gallilee without stopping to pursue the idea she rang the bell and ordered her carriage to be ready that afternoon at three o'clock doubtful and more than doubtful though it might be the bare prospect of finding herself possessed before the day was out of a means of action capable of being used against carmina raised mrs gallilee's spirits she was ready at last to attend to her correspondence one of the letters was from her sister in scotland among other subjects it referred to carmina why won't you let that sweet girl come and stay with us lady northlake asked my daughters are longing for such a companion and both my sons are ready to envy ovid the moment they see her tell my nephew when you next write that i thoroughly understand his falling in love with that gentle pretty creature at first sight carmina's illness was the ready excuse which presented itself in mrs gallilee's reply with or without an excuse lady northlake was to be resolutely prevented from taking a foremost place in her niece's heart and encouraging the idea of her niece's marriage mrs gallilee felt almost pious enough to thank heaven that her sister's palace in the highlands was at one end of great britain and her own marine villa at the other the marine villa reminded her of the family migration to the sea side when would it be desirable to leave london not until her mind was relieved of the heavier anxieties that now weighed on it not while events might happen in connection with the threatening creditors or the contemplated marriage which would baffle her latest calculations and make her presence in london a matter of serious importance to her own interests miss minerva again was a new obstacle in the way to take her to the isle of wight was not to be thought of for a moment to dismiss her at once by paying the month's salary might be the preferable course to pursue but for two objections in the first place if the friendly understanding between them really continued carmina might communicate with the discarded governess in secret in the second place to pay miss minerva's salary before she had earned it was a concession from which mrs gallilee's spite and mrs gallilee's principles of paltry economy recoiled in disgust no the waiting policy in london under whatever aspect it might be viewed was for the present the one policy to pursue she returned to the demands of her correspondence just as she had taken up her pen the sanctuary of the boudoir was violated by the appearance of a servant what is it now didn't the housekeeper tell you that i am not to be disturbed i beg your pardon ma'am my master what does your master want he wishes to see you ma'am this was a circumstance entirely without parallel in the domestic history of the house in sheer astonishment mrs gallilee pushed away her letters and said show him in when the boys of fifty years since were naughty the schoolmaster of the period was not accustomed to punish them by appealing to their sense of honour if a boy wanted a flogging in those days the educational system seized a cane or a birch rod and gave it to him mr gallilee entered his wife's room with the feelings which had once animated him on entering the schoolmaster's study to be caned when he said good morning my dear his face presented the expression of fifty years since when he had said please sir let me off this time now said mrs gallilee what do you want only a little word how well you're looking my dear after a sleepless night followed by her defeat in carmina's room mrs gallilee looked and knew that she looked ugly and old and her wretched husband had reminded her of it go on she answered sternly mr gallilee moistened his dry lips i think i'll take a chair if you will allow me he said having taken his chair at a respectful distance from his wife he looked all round the room with the air of a visitor who had never seen it before how very pretty he remarked softly such taste in colour i think the carpet was your own design wasn't it how chaste will you come to the point mr gallilee with pleasure my dear with pleasure i'm afraid i smell of tobacco i don't care if you do this was such an agreeable surprise to mr gallilee that he got on his legs again to enjoy it standing up how kind really now how kind he approached mrs gallilee confidentially and do you know my dear it was one of the most remarkable cigars i ever smoked mrs gallilee laid down her pen and eyed him with an annihilating frown in the extremity of his confusion mr gallilee ventured nearer he felt the sinister fascination of the serpent in the expression of those awful eyebrows how well you are looking how amazingly well you are looking this morning he leered at his learned wife and patted her shoulder for the moment mrs gallilee was petrified at his time of life was this fat and feeble creature approaching her with conjugal endearments at that early hour of the day had his guilty lips tasted his favourite champagne foaming in his well beloved silver mug over his much admired lump of ice and was this the result mr gallilee yes my dear sit down mr gallilee sat down have you been to the club mr gallilee got up again sit down mr gallilee sat down i was about to say my dear that i'll show you over the club with the greatest pleasure if that's what you mean if you are not a downright idiot said mrs gallilee understand this either say what you have to say or she lifted her hand and let it down on the writing table with a slap that made the pens ring in the inkstand or leave the room mr gallilee lifted his hand and searched in the breast pocket of his coat he pulled out his cigar case and put it back in a hurry he tried again and produced a letter he looked piteously round the room in sore need of somebody whom he might appeal to and ended in appealing to himself what sort of temper will she be in he whispered what have you got there mrs gallilee asked sharply one of the letters you had this morning mr gallilee looked at her with admiration wonderful woman he said nothing escapes her allow me my dear he rose and presented the letter as if he was presenting a petition mrs gallilee snatched it out of his hand mr gallilee went softly back to his chair and breathed a devout ejaculation oh lord it was a letter from one of the tradespeople whom mrs gallilee had attempted to pacify with a payment on account the tradesman felt compelled in justice to himself to appeal to mr gallilee as master of the house it was impossible for him he submitted with the greatest respect to accept a payment which did not amount to one third of the sum owing to him for more than a twelvemonth wretch cried mrs gallilee i'll settle his bill and never employ him again she opened her cheque book and dipped her pen in the ink a faint voice meekly protested mr gallilee was on his legs again mr gallilee said please don't his incredible rashness silenced his wife there he stood his round eyes staring at the cheque book his fat cheeks quivering with excitement you mustn't do it he said with a first and last outburst of courage give me a minute my dear oh good gracious give me a minute he searched in his pocket again and produced another letter his eyes wandered towards the door drops of perspiration oozed out on his forehead he laid the second letter on the table he looked at his wife and ran out of the room mrs gallilee opened the second letter another dissatisfied tradesman no creditors far more formidable than the grocer and the butcher an official letter from the bankers informing mr gallilee that the account was overdrawn she seized her pass book and her paper of calculations never yet had her rigid arithmetic committed an error column by column she revised her figures and made the humiliating discovery of her first mistake she had drawn out all and more than all the money deposited in the bank and the next half yearly payment of income was not due until christmas there was but one thing to be done to go at once to the bank if ovid had not been in the wilds of canada mrs gallilee would have made her confession to him without hesitation as it was the servant called a cab and she made her confession to the bankers the matter was soon settled to her satisfaction it rested exactly as miss minerva had anticipated with mr gallilee in the house he might abdicate his authority to his heart's content out of the house in matters of business he was master still his investments represented excellent security he had only to say how much he wanted to borrow and to sign certain papers and the thing was done mrs gallilee went home again with her pecuniary anxieties at rest for the time the carriage was waiting for her at the door should she fulfil her intention of visiting benjulia she was not a person who readily changed her mind and besides after the troubles of the morning the drive into the country would be a welcome relief hearing that mr gallilee was still at home she looked in at the smoking room unerring instinct told her where to find her husband under present circumstances there he was enjoying his cigar in comfort with his coat off and his feet on a chair she opened the door i want you this evening she said and shut the door again leaving mr gallilee suffocated by a mouthful of his own smoke before getting into the carriage she only waited to restore her face with a flush of health from paris modified by a sprinkling of pallor from london benjulia's humour was essentially an uncertain humour it might be necessary to fascinate the doctor chapter xxx the complimentary allusion to ovid which benjulia had not been able to understand was contained in a letter from mr morphew and was expressed in these words let me sincerely thank you for making us acquainted with mr ovid vere now that he has left us we really feel as if we had said good bye to an old friend i don't know when i have met with such a perfectly unselfish man and i say this speaking from experience of him in my unavoidable absence he volunteered to attend a serious case of illness accompanied by shocking circumstances and this at a time when as you know his own broken health forbids him to undertake any professional duty while he could preserve the patient's life and he did wonders in this way he was every day at the bedside taxing his strength in the service of a perfect stranger i fancy i see you with your impatience of letter writing at any length looking to the end don't be alarmed i am writing to your brother lemuel by this mail and i have little time to spare was this serious case of illness described as being accompanied by shocking circumstances a case of disease of the brain there was the question proposed by benjulia's inveterate suspicion of ovid the bare doubt cost him the loss of a day's work he reviled poor mr morphew as a born idiot for not having plainly stated what the patient's malady was instead of wasting paper on smooth sentences encumbered by long words if ovid had alluded to his canadian patient in his letters to his mother his customary preciseness of language might be trusted to relieve benjulia's suspense with that purpose in view the doctor had written to mrs gallilee before he laid down his pen he looked once more at mr morphew's letter and paused thoughtfully over one line i am writing to your brother lemuel by this mail the information of which he was in search might be in that letter if mrs gallilee's correspondence with her son failed to enlighten him here was another chance of making the desired discovery surely the wise course to take would be to write to lemuel as well his one motive for hesitating was dislike of his younger brother dislike so inveterate that he even recoiled from communicating with lemuel through the post there had never been any sympathy between them but indifference had only matured into downright enmity on the doctor's part a year since accident the result of his own absence of mind while he was perplexed by an unsuccessful experiment had placed lemuel in possession of his hideous secret the one person in the world who knew how he was really occupied in the laboratory was his brother here was the true motive of the bitterly contemptuous tone in which benjulia had spoken to ovid of his nearest relation lemuel's character was certainly deserving of severe judgment in some of its aspects in his hours of employment as clerk in the office of a london publisher he steadily and punctually performed the duties entrusted to him in his hours of freedom his sensual instincts got the better of him and his jealous wife had her reasons for complaint among his friends he was the subject of a wide diversity of opinion some of them agreed with his brother in thinking him little better than a fool others suspected him of possessing natural abilities but of being too lazy perhaps too cunning to exert them in the office he allowed himself to be called a mere machine and escaped the overwork which fell to the share of quicker men when his wife and her relations declared him to be a mere animal he never contradicted them and so gained the reputation of a person on whom reprimand was thrown away under the protection of this unenviable character he sometimes said severe things with an air of perfect simplicity when the furious doctor discovered him in the laboratory and said i'll be the death of you if you tell any living creature what i am doing lemuel answered with a stare of stupid astonishment make your mind easy i should be ashamed to mention it further reflection decided benjulia on writing even when he had a favour to ask he was unable to address lemuel with common politeness i hear that morphew has written to you by the last mail i want to see the letter so much he wrote and no more what was barely enough for the purpose was enough for the doctor when he addressed his brother chapter xxxi between one and two o'clock the next afternoon benjulia at work in his laboratory heard the bell which announced the arrival of a visitor at the house no matter what the circumstances might be the servants were forbidden to disturb him at his studies in any other way very unwillingly he obeyed the call locking the door behind him at that hour it was luncheon time in well regulated households and it was in the last degree unlikely that mrs gallilee could be the visitor getting within view of the front of the house he saw a man standing on the doorstep advancing a little nearer he recognised lemuel hullo cried the elder brother hullo answered the younger like an echo they stood looking at each other with the suspicious curiosity of two strange cats between nathan benjulia the famous doctor and lemuel benjulia the publisher's clerk there was just family resemblance enough to suggest that they were relations the younger brother was only a little over the ordinary height he was rather fat than thin he wore a moustache and whiskers he dressed smartly and his prevailing expression announced that he was thoroughly well satisfied with himself but he inherited benjulia's gipsy complexion and in form and colour he had benjulia's eyes how d'ye do nathan he said what the devil brings you here was the answer lemuel passed over his brother's rudeness without notice his mouth curled up at the corners with a mischievous smile i thought you wished to see my letter he said why couldn't you send it by post my wife wished me to take the opportunity of calling on you that's a lie said benjulia quietly try another excuse or do a new thing for once speak the truth without waiting to hear the truth he led the way into the room in which he had received ovid lemuel followed still showing no outward appearance of resentment how did you get away from your office benjulia inquired it's easy to get a holiday at this time of year business is slack old boy stop i don't allow you to speak to me in that way no offence brother nathan brother lemuel i never allow a fool to offend me i put him in his place that's all the distant barking of a dog became audible from the lane by which the house was approached the sound seemed to annoy benjulia what's that he asked lemuel saw his way to making some return for his brother's reception of him it's my dog he said and it's lucky for you that i have left him in the cab why well he's as sweet tempered a dog as ever lived but he has one fault he doesn't take kindly to scientific gentlemen in your line of business lemuel paused and pointed to his brother's hands if he smelt that he might try his teeth at vivisecting you the spots of blood which ovid had once seen on benjulia's stick were on his hands now with unruffled composure he looked at the horrid stains silently telling their tale of torture what's the use of washing my hands he answered when i am going back to my work he wiped his finger and thumb on the tail of his coat now he resumed if you have got your letter with you let me look at it lemuel produced the letter there are some bits in it he explained which you had better not see if you want the truth that's the reason i brought it myself read the first page and then i'll tell you where to skip so far there was no allusion to ovid benjulia turned to the second page and lemuel pointed to the middle of it read as far as that he went on and then skip till you come to the last bit at the end on the last page ovid's name appeared he was mentioned as a delightful person introduced by your brother and with that the letter ended in the first bitterness of his disappointment benjulia conceived an angry suspicion of those portions of the letter which he had been requested to pass over unread what has morphew got to say to you that i mustn't read he asked suppose you tell me first what you want to find in the letter lemuel rejoined morphew is a doctor like you is it anything medical benjulia answered this in the easiest way he nodded his head is it vivisection lemuel inquired slyly benjulia at once handed the letter back and pointed to the door his momentary interest in the suppressed passages was at an end that will do he answered take yourself and your letter away ah said lemuel i'm glad you don't want to look at it again he put the letter away and buttoned his coat and tapped his pocket significantly you have got a nasty temper nathan and there are things here that might try it in the case of any other man benjulia would have seen that the one object of these prudent remarks was to irritate him misled by his profound conviction of his brother's stupidity he now thought it possible that the concealed portions of the letter might be worth notice he stopped lemuel at the door i've changed my mind he said i want to look at the letter again you had better not lemuel persisted morphew's going to write a book against you and he asks me to get it published at our place i'm on his side you know i shall do my best to help him i can lay my hand on literary fellows who will lick his style into shape it will be an awful exposure benjulia still held out his hand with over acted reluctance lemuel unbuttoned his coat the distant dog barked again as he gave the letter back please excuse my dear old dog he said with maudlin tenderness the poor dumb animal seems to know that i'm taking his side in the controversy bow wow means in his language fie upon the cruel hands that bore holes in our head and use saws on our backs ah nathan if you have got any dogs in that horrid place of yours pat them and give them their dinner you never heard me talk like this before did you i'm a new man since i joined the society for suppressing you oh if i only had the gift of writing the effect of this experiment on his brother's temper failed to fulfil lemuel's expectations the doctor's curiosity was roused on the doctor's own subject of inquiry you're quite right about one thing said benjulia gravely i never heard you talk in this way before you suggest some interesting considerations of the medical sort come to the light he led lemuel to the window looked at him with the closest attention and carefully consulted his pulse lemuel smiled i'm not joking said benjulia sternly tell me this have you had headaches lately do you find your memory failing you as he put those questions he thought to himself seriously thought is this fellow's brain softening i wish i had him on my table lemuel persisted in presenting himself under a sentimental aspect he had not forgiven his elder brother's rudeness yet and he knew by experience the one weakness in benjulia's character which with his small resources it was possible to attack thank you for your kind inquiries he replied never mind my head so long as my heart's in the right place i don't pretend to be clever but i've got my feelings and i could put some awkward questions on what you call medical research if i had morphew to help me i'll help you said benjulia interested in developing the state of his brother's brain i don't believe you said lemuel interested in developing the state of his brother's temper try me lemuel all right nathan the two brothers returned to their chairs reduced for once to the same moral level chapter xxxii now said benjulia what is it to be the favourite public bugbear vivisection yes very well what can i do for you tell me first said lemuel what is law nobody knows well then what ought it to be justice i suppose let me wait a bit nathan and get that into my mind benjulia waited with exemplary patience now about yourself lemuel continued you won't be offended will you should i be right if i called you a dissector of living creatures benjulia was reminded of the day when he had discovered his brother in the laboratory his dark complexion deepened in hue his cold gray eyes seemed to promise a coming outbreak lemuel went on does the law forbid you to make your experiments on a man he asked of course it does why doesn't the law forbid you to make your experiments on a dog benjulia's face cleared again the one penetrable point in his ironclad nature had not been reached yet that apparently childish question about the dog appeared not only to have interested him but to have taken him by surprise his attention wandered away from his brother his clear intellect put lemuel's objection in closer logical form and asked if there was any answer to it thus the law which forbids you to dissect a living man allows you to dissect a living dog why there was positively no answer to this suppose he said because a dog is an animal could he as a physiologist deny that a man is an animal too suppose he said because a dog is the inferior creature in intellect the obvious answer to this would be but the lower order of savage or the lower order of lunatic compared with the dog is the inferior creature in intellect and in these cases the dog has on your own showing the better right to protection of the two suppose he said because a man is a creature with a soul and a dog is a creature without a soul this would be simply inviting another unanswerable question how do you know honestly accepting the dilemma which thus presented itself the conclusion that followed seemed to be beyond dispute if the law in the matter of vivisection asserts the principle of interference the law has barred its right to place arbitrary limits on its own action if it protects any living creatures it is bound in reason and in justice to protect all well said lemuel am i to have an answer i'm not a lawyer with this convenient reply benjulia opened mr morphew's letter and read the forbidden part of it which began on the second page there he found the very questions with which his brother had puzzled him followed by the conclusion at which he had himself arrived you interpreted the language of your dog just now he said quietly to lemuel and i naturally supposed your brain might be softening such as it is i perceive that your memory is in working order accept my excuses for feeling your pulse you have ceased to be an object of interest to me he returned to his reading lemuel watched him still confidently waiting for results the letter proceeded in these terms your employer may perhaps be inclined to publish my work if i can satisfy him that it will address itself to the general reader we all know what are the false pretences under which english physiologists practice their cruelties i want to expose those false pretences in the simplest and plainest way by appealing to my own experience as an ordinary working member of the medical profession take the pretence of increasing our knowledge of the curative action of poisons by trying them on animals the very poisons the action of which dogs and cats have been needlessly tortured to demonstrate i have successfully used on my human patients in the practice of a lifetime i should also like to ask what proof there is that the effect of a poison on an animal may be trusted to inform us with certainty of the effect of the same poison on a man to quote two instances only which justify doubt and to take birds this time by way of a change a pigeon will swallow opium enough to kill a man and will not be in the least affected by it and parsley which is an innocent herb in the stomach of a human being is deadly poison to a parrot i should deal in the same way with the other pretence of improving our practice of surgery by experiment on living animals not long since i saw the diseased leg of a dog cut off at the hip joint when the limb was removed not a single vessel bled try the same operation on a man and twelve or fifteen vessels must be tied as a matter of absolute necessity again we are told by a great authority that the baking of dogs in ovens has led to new discoveries in treating fever i have always supposed that the heat in fever is not a cause of disease but a consequence however let that be and let us still stick to experience has this infernal cruelty produced results which help us to cure scarlet fever our bedside practice tells us that scarlet fever runs it course as it always did i can multiply such examples as these by hundreds when i write my book briefly stated you now have the method by which i propose to drag the scientific english savage from his shelter behind the medical interests of humanity and to show him in his true character as plainly as the scientific foreign savage shows himself of his own accord he doesn't shrink behind false pretences he doesn't add cant to cruelty he boldly proclaims the truth i do it because i like it benjulia rose and threw the letter on the floor i proclaim the truth he said i do it because i like it there are some few englishmen who treat ignorant public opinion with the contempt that it deserves and i am one of them he pointed scornfully to the letter that wordy old fool is right about the false pretences publish his book and i'll buy a copy of it that's odd said lemuel what's odd well nathan i'm only a fool but if you talk in that way of false pretences and public opinion why do you tell everybody that your horrid cutting and carving is harmless chemistry and why were you in such a rage when i got into your workshop and found you out answer me that let me congratulate you first said benjulia it isn't every fool who knows that he is a fool now you shall have your answer before the end of the year all the world will be welcome to come into my workshop and see me at the employment of my life brother lemuel when you stole your way through my unlocked door you found me travelling on the road to the grandest medical discovery of this century you stupid ass do you think i cared about what you could find out i am in such perpetual terror of being forestalled by my colleagues that i am not master of myself even when such eyes as yours look at my work in a month or two more perhaps in a week or two i shall have solved the grand problem i labour at it all day i think of it i dream of it all night it will kill me strong as i am it will kill me what do you say am i working myself into my grave in the medical interests of humanity that for humanity i am working for my own satisfaction for my own pride for my own unutterable pleasure in beating other men for the fame that will keep my name living hundreds of years hence humanity i say with my foreign brethren knowledge for its own sake is the one god i worship knowledge is its own justification and its own reward the roaring mob follows us with its cry of cruelty we pity their ignorance knowledge sanctifies cruelty the old anatomist stole dead bodies for knowledge in that sacred cause if i could steal a living man without being found out i would tie him on my table and grasp my grand discovery in days instead of months where are you going what you're afraid to be in the same room with me a man who can talk as i do is a man who would stick at nothing is that the light in which you lower order of creatures look at us look a little higher and you will see that a man who talks as i do is a man set above you by knowledge exert yourself and try to understand me have i no virtues even from your point of view am i not a good citizen don't i pay my debts don't i serve my friends you miserable creature you have had my money when you wanted it look at that letter on the floor the man mentioned in it is one of those colleagues whom i distrust i did my duty by him for all that i gave him the information he wanted i introduced him to a friend in a land of strangers have i no feeling as you call it my last experiments on a monkey horrified me his cries of suffering his gestures of entreaty were like the cries and gestures of a child i would have given the world to put him out of his misery but i went on in the glorious cause i went on my hands turned cold my heart ached i thought of a child i sometimes play with i suffered i resisted i went on all for knowledge all for knowledge his brother's presence was forgotten his dark face turned livid his gigantic frame shuddered his breath came and went in deep sobbing gasps it was terrible to see him and hear him lemuel slunk out of the room the jackal had roused the lion the mean spirit of mischief in him had not bargained for this i begin to believe in the devil he said to himself when he got to the house door as he descended the steps a carriage appeared in the lane a footman opened the gate of the enclosure the carriage approached the house with a lady in it lemuel ran back to his brother here's a lady coming he said you're in a nice state to see her pull yourself together nathan and damn it wash your hands he took benjulia's arm and led him upstairs when lemuel returned to the hall mrs gallilee was ascending the house steps he bowed profoundly in homage to the well preserved remains of a fine woman my brother will be with you directly ma'am pray allow me to give you a chair his hat was in his hand mrs gallilee's knowledge of the world easily set him down at his true value she got rid of him with her best grace pray don't let me detain you sir i will wait with pleasure if she had been twenty years younger the hint might have been thrown away as it was lemuel retired chapter xxxiii an unusually long day's work at the office had fatigued good mr mool he pushed aside his papers and let his weary eyes rest on a glass vase full of flowers on the table a present from a grateful client as a man he enjoyed the lovely colours of the nosegay as a botanist he lamented the act which had cut the flowers from their parent stems and doomed them to a premature death i should not have had the heart to do it myself he thought but tastes differ the office boy came into the room with a visiting card in his hand i'm going home to dinner said mr mool the person must call to morrow the boy laid the card on the table the person was mrs gallilee mrs gallilee at seven o'clock in the evening mrs gallilee without a previous appointment by letter mr mool trembled under the apprehension of some serious family emergency in imminent need of legal interference he submitted as a matter of course show the lady in before a word had passed between them the lawyer's mind was relieved mrs gallilee shone on him with her sweetest smiles pressed his hand with her friendliest warmth admired the nosegay with her readiest enthusiasm quite perfect she said especially the pansy the round flat edge mr mool the upper petals perfectly uniform there is a flower that defies criticism i long to dissect it mr mool politely resigned the pansy to dissection murderous mutilation he would have called it in the case of one of his own flowers and waited to hear what his learned client might have to say to him i am going to surprise you mrs gallilee announced no to shock you no even that is not strong enough let me say to horrify you mr mool's anxieties returned complicated by confusion the behaviour of mrs gallilee exhibited the most unaccountable contrast to her language she showed no sign of those strong emotions to which she had alluded how am i to put it she went on with a transparent affectation of embarrassment shall i call it a disgrace to our family mr mool started mrs gallilee entreated him to compose himself she approached the inevitable disclosure by degrees i think she said you have met doctor benjulia at my house i have had that honour mrs gallilee not a very sociable person if i may venture to say so downright rude mr mool on some occasions but that doesn't matter now i have just been visiting the doctor was this visit connected with the disgrace to the family mr mool ventured to put a question doctor benjulia is not related to you ma'am is he not the least in the world please don't interrupt me again i am so to speak laying a train of circumstances before you and i might leave one of them out when doctor benjulia was a young man i am returning to my train of circumstances mr mool he was at rome pursuing his professional studies i have all this mind straight from the doctor himself at rome he became acquainted with my late brother after the period of his unfortunate marriage stop i have failed to put it strongly enough again i ought to have said his disgraceful marriage really mrs gallilee mr mool i beg your pardon ma'am don't mention it the next circumstance is ready in my mind one of the doctor's fellow students described as being personally an irresistible man was possessed of abilities which even attracted our unsociable benjulia they became friends at the time of which i am now speaking my brother's disgusting wife oh but i repeat it mr mool i say again his disgusting wife was the mother of a female child your niece mrs gallilee no not miss carmina miss carmina is no more my niece than she is your niece carry your mind back to what i have just said i mentioned a medical student who was an irresistible man miss carmina's father was that man mr mool's astonishment and indignation would have instantly expressed themselves if he had not been a lawyer as it was his professional experience warned him of the imprudence of speaking too soon mrs galilee's exultation forced its way outwards her eyes glittered her voice rose the law mr mool what does the law say she broke out is my brother's will no better than waste paper is the money divided among his only near relations tell me tell me mr mool suddenly plunged his face into his vase of flowers did he feel that the air of the office wanted purifying or was he conscious that his face might betray him unless he hid it mrs galilee was at no loss to set her own clever interpretation on her lawyer's extraordinary proceeding take your time she said with the most patronising kindness i know your sensitive nature i know what i felt myself when this dreadful discovery burst upon me if you remember i said i should horrify you take your time my dear sir pray take your time to be encouraged in this way as if he was the emotional client and mrs gallilee the impassive lawyer was more than even mr mool could endure shy men are in the innermost depths of their nature proud men the lawyer had his professional pride he came out of his flowery retreat with a steady countenance for the first time in his life he was not afraid of mrs galilee before we enter on the legal aspect of the case he began the shocking case mrs gallilee interposed in the interests of virtue under any other circumstances mr mool would have accepted the correction he actually took no notice of it now there is one point he proceeded on which i must beg you to enlighten me by all means i am ready to go into any details no matter how disgusting they may be mr mool thought of certain ladies objects of perfectly needless respect among men who being requested to leave the court at unmentionable trials persist in keeping their places it was a relief to him to feel if his next questions did nothing else that they would disappoint mrs galilee am i right in supposing that you believe what you have told me he resumed most assuredly is doctor benjulia the only person who has spoken to you on the subject the only person his information being derived from his friend the fellow student whom you mentioned just now in other words mrs gallilee answered viciously the father of the wretched girl who has been foisted on my care if mr mool's courage had been in danger of failing him he would have found it again now his regard for carmina his respect for the memory of her mother had been wounded to the quick strong on his own legal ground he proceeded as if he was examining a witness in a police court i suppose the doctor had some reason for believing what his friend told him ample reason vice and poverty generally go together this man was poor he showed doctor benjulia money received from his mistress her husband's money it is needless to say her motive might be innocent mrs gallilee had the man any letters of hers to show letters from a woman in her position it's notorious mr mool that italian models don't know how to read or write may i ask if there are any further proofs you have had proofs enough with all possible respect ma'am i deny that mrs gallilee had not been asked to enter into disgusting details mrs gallilee had been contradicted by her obedient humble servant of other days she thought it high time to bring the examination to an end if you are determined to believe in the woman's innocence she said without knowing any of the circumstances mr mool went on from bad to worse he interrupted her now excuse me mrs gallilee i think you have forgotten that one of my autumn holidays many years since was spent in italy i was in rome like doctor benjulia after your brother's marriage his wife was to my certain knowledge received in society her reputation was unblemished and her husband was devoted to her in plain english said mrs gallilee my brother was a poor weak creature and his wife when you knew her had not been found out that is just the difficulty i feel mr mool rejoined how is it that she is only found out now years have passed since she died more years have passed since this attack on her character reached doctor benjulia's knowledge he is an old friend of yours why has he only told you of it to day i hope i don't offend you by asking these questions oh dear no your questions are so easily answered i never encouraged the doctor to speak of my brother and his wife the subject was too distasteful to me and i don't doubt that doctor benjulia felt about it as i did until to day the lawyer remarked doctor benjulia appears to have been quite ready to mention the subject to day under special circumstances mr mool perhaps you will not allow that special circumstances make any difference on the contrary mr mool made every allowance at the same time he waited to hear what the circumstances might be but mrs galilee had her reasons for keeping silence it was impossible to mention benjulia's reception of her without inflicting a wound on her self esteem to begin with he had kept the door of the room open and had remained standing have you got ovid's letters leave them here i'm not fit to look at them now those were his first words there was nothing in the letters which a friend might not read she accordingly consented to leave them the doctor had expressed his sense of obligation by bidding her get into her carriage again and go i have been put in a passion i have made a fool of myself i haven't a nerve in my body that isn't quivering with rage go go go there was his explanation impenetrably obstinate mrs galilee faced him standing between the doctor and the door without shrinking she had not driven all the way to benjulia's house to be sent back again without gaining her object she had her questions to put to him and she persisted in pressing them as only a woman can he was left with the education of a gentleman against him between the two vulgar alternatives of turning her out by main force or of yielding and getting rid of her decently in that way at any other time he would have flatly refused to lower himself to the level of a scandal mongering woman by entering on the subject in his present mood if pacifying mrs galilee and ridding himself of mrs gallilee meant one and the same thing he was ready recklessly ready to let her have her own way she heard the infamous story which she had repeated to her lawyer and she had lemuel benjulia's visit and mr morphew's contemplated attack on vivisection to thank for getting her information mr mool waited and waited in vain he reminded his client of what she had just said you mentioned certain circumstances may i know what they are he asked mrs gallilee rose before she replied your time is valuable and my time is valuable she said we shall not convince each other by prolonging our conversation i came here mr mool to ask you a question about the law permit me to remind you that i have not had my answer yet my own impression is that the girl now in my house not being my brother's child has no claim on my brother's property tell me in two words if you please am i right or wrong i can do it in one word mrs gallilee wrong what mr mool entered on the necessary explanation triumphing in the reply that he had just made it's the smartest thing he thought i ever said in my life while husbands and wives live together he continued the law holds that all children born in wedlock are the husband's children even if miss carmina's mother had not been as good and innocent a woman as ever drew the breath of life that will do mr mool you really mean to say that this girl's interest in my brother's will remains quite unaffected ma'am by all that you have told me and i am still obliged to keep her under my care or mr mool answered to resign the office of guardian in favour of lady northlake appointed to act in your place i won't trouble you any further sir good evening she turned to leave the office mr mool actually tried to stop her one word more mrs galilee no we have said enough already mr mool's audacity arrived at its climax he put his hand on the lock of the office door and held it shut the young lady mrs gallilee i am sure you will never breathe a word of this to the pretty gentle young lady even if it was true and as god is my witness i am sure it's false good evening mr mool he opened the door and let her go her looks and tones told him that remonstrance was worse than useless from year's end to year's end this modest and amiable man had never been heard to swear he swore now damn doctor benjulia he burst out in the solitude of his office his dinner was waiting for him at home instead of putting on his hat he went back to his writing table his thoughts projected themselves into the future and discovered possibilities from which they recoiled he took up his pen and began a letter to john gallilee esquire dear sir circumstances have occurred which i am not at liberty to mention but which make it necessary for me in justice to my own views and feelings to withdraw from the position of legal adviser to yourself and family he paused and considered with himself no he decided i may be of some use to that poor child while i am the family lawyer he tore up his unfinished letter when mr mool got home that night it was noticed that he had a poor appetite for his dinner on the other hand he drank more wine than usual chapter xxxiv i don't know what is the matter with me sometimes i think i am going to be really ill it was the day after mrs gallilee's interview with her lawyer and this was carmina's answer when the governess entered her room after the lessons of the morning and asked if she felt better are you still taking medicine miss minerva inquired yes mr null says it's a tonic and it's sure to do me good it doesn't seem to have begun yet i feel so dreadfully weak frances the least thing makes me cry and i put off doing what i ought to do and want to do without knowing why you remember what i told you about teresa she may be with us in a few days more for all i know to the contrary i must find a nice lodging for her poor dear and here i am thinking about it instead of doing it let me do it miss minerva suggested carmina's sad face brightened that's kind indeed she said nonsense i shall take the children out after dinner to day looking over lodgings will be an amusement to me and to them where is zo why haven't you brought her with you she is having her music lesson and i must go back to keep her in order about the lodging a sitting room and bedroom will be enough i suppose in this neighbourhood i am afraid the terms will be rather high oh never mind that let us have clean airy rooms and a kind landlady teresa mustn't know it if the terms are high will she allow you to pay her expenses ah you put it delicately my aunt seemed to doubt if teresa had any money of her own i forgot at the time that my father had left her a little income she told me so herself and wondered poor dear how she was to spend it all she mustn't be allowed to spend it all we will tell her that the terms are half what they may really be and i will pay the other half isn't it cruel of my aunt not to let my old nurse live in the same house with me at that moment a message arrived from one of the persons of whom she was speaking mrs gallilee wished to see miss carmina immediately my dear said miss minerva when the servant had withdrawn why do you tremble so there's something in me frances that shudders at my aunt ever since she stopped miss minerva understood that sudden pause the undesigned allusion to carmina's guiltless knowledge of her feeling towards ovid by unexpressed consent on either side they still preserved their former relations as if mrs gallilee had not spoken miss minerva looked at carmina sadly and kindly good bye for the present she said and went upstairs again to the schoolroom in the hall carmina found the servant waiting for her he opened the library door the learned lady was at her studies i have been speaking to mr null about you said mrs gallilee on the previous evening carmina had kept her room she had breakfasted in bed and she now saw her aunt for the first time since mrs gallilee had left the house on her visit to benjulia the girl was instantly conscious of a change to be felt rather than to be realised a subtle change in her aunt's way of looking at her and speaking to her her heart beat fast she took the nearest chair in silence the doctor mrs gallilee proceeded thinks it of importance to your health to be as much as possible in the air he wishes you to drive out every day while the fine weather lasts i have ordered the open carriage to be ready after luncheon other engagements will prevent me from accompanying you you will be under the care of my maid and you will be out for two hours mr null hopes you will gain strength is there anything you want nothing thank you perhaps you wish for a new dress oh no you have no complaint to make of the servants the servants are always kind to me i needn't detain you any longer i have a person coming to speak to me carmina had entered the room in doubt and fear she left it with strangely mingled feelings of perplexity and relief her sense of a mysterious change in her aunt had strengthened with every word that mrs gallilee had said to her she had heard of reformatory institutions and of discreet persons called matrons who managed them in her imaginary picture of such places mrs gallilee's tone and manner realised in the strangest way her idea of a matron speaking to a penitent as she crossed the hall her thoughts took a new direction some indefinable distrust of the coming time got possession of her an ugly model of the colosseum in cork stood on the hall table she looked at it absently i hope teresa will come soon she thought and turned away to the stairs she ascended slowly her head drooping her mind still preoccupied arrived at the first landing a sound of footsteps disturbed her she looked up and found herself face to face with mr le frank leaving the schoolroom after his music lesson at that sudden discovery a cry of alarm escaped her the common little scream of a startled woman mr le frank made an elaborately formal bow he apologised with sternly stupid emphasis i beg your pardon moved by a natural impulse penitently conscious of those few foolish words of hers which he had so unfortunately overheard the poor girl made an effort to conciliate him i have very few friends mr le frank she said timidly may i still consider you as one of them will you forgive and forget will you shake hands mr le frank made another magnificent bow he was proud of his voice in his most resonant and mellifluous tones he said you do me honour and took the offered hand and lifted it grandly and touched it with his lips she held by the baluster with her free hand and controlled the sickening sensation which that momentary contact with him produced he might have detected the outward signs of the struggle but for an interruption which preserved her from discovery mrs gallilee was standing at the open library door mrs gallilee said i am waiting for you mr le frank carmina hurried up the stairs pursued already by a sense of her own imprudence in her first confusion and dismay but one clear idea presented itself oh she said have i made another mistake meanwhile mrs gallilee had received her music master with the nearest approach to an indulgent welcome of which a hardened nature is capable take the easy chair mr le frank you are not afraid of the open window oh dear no i like it he rapidly unrolled some leaves of music which he had brought downstairs with regard to the song that i had the honour of mentioning mrs gallilee pointed to the table put the song there for the present i have a word to say first how came you to frighten my niece i heard something like a scream and naturally looked out she was making an apology she asked you to forgive and forget what does all this mean mr le frank exhausted his ingenuity in efforts of polite evasion without the slightest success from first to last if the expression may be permitted mrs gallilee had him under her thumb he was not released until he had literally reported carmina's opinion of him as a man and a musician and had exactly described the circumstances under which he had heard it mrs gallilee listened with an interest which under less embarrassing circumstances would have even satisfied mrs le frank's vanity she was not for a moment deceived by the clumsy affectation of good humour with which he told his story her penetration discovered the vindictive feeling towards carmina which offered him in case of necessity as an instrument ready made to her hand by fine degrees she presented herself in the new character of a sympathising friend i know now mr le frank why you declined to be my niece's music master allow me to apologise for having ignorantly placed you in a false position i appreciate the delicacy of your conduct i understand and admire you mr le frank's florid cheeks turned redder still his cold blood began to simmer heated by an all pervading glow of flattered self esteem my niece's motives for concealment are plain enough mrs gallilee proceeded let me hope that she was ashamed to confess the total want of taste delicacy and good manners which has so justly offended you miss minerva however has no excuse for keeping me in the dark her conduct in this matter offers i regret to say one more instance of her habitual neglect of the duties which attach to her position in my house there seems to be some private understanding between my governess and my niece of which i highly disapprove however the subject is too distasteful to dwell on you were speaking of your song the last effort of your genius i think his genius the inner glow in mr le frank grew warmer and warmer i asked for the honour of an interview he explained to make a request he took up his leaves of music this is my last and i hope my best effort at composition may i dedicate it to me mrs gallilee exclaimed with a burst of enthusiasm mr le frank felt the compliment he bowed gratefully need i say how gladly i accept the honour with this gracious answer mrs gallilee rose was the change of position a hint suggesting that mr le frank might leave her to her studies now that his object was gained or was it an act of homage offered by science to art mr le frank was incapable of placing an unfavourable interpretation on any position which a woman and such a woman could assume in his presence he felt the compliment again the first copy published shall be sent to you he said and snatched up his hat eager to set the printers at work and five and twenty copies more for which i subscribe cried his munificent patroness cordially shaking hands with him mr le frank attempted to express his sense of obligation generous mrs gallilee refused to hear him he took his leave he got as far as the hall and then he was called back softly confidentially called back to the library a thought has just struck me said mrs gallilee please shut the door for a moment about that meeting between you and my niece perhaps i am taking a morbid view she paused mr le frank waited with breathless interest or is there something out of the common way in that apology of hers mrs gallilee proceeded have you any idea what the motive might be mr le frank's ready suspicion was instantly aroused not the least idea he answered can you tell me i am as completely puzzled as you are mrs gallilee rejoined mr le frank considered his suspicions made an imaginative effort assisted by his vanity after my refusal to teach her he suggested that proposal to shake hands may have a meaning there his invention failed him he stopped and shook his head ominously mrs gallilee's object being attained she made no attempt to help him perhaps time will show she answered discreetly good bye again with best wishes for the success of the song chapter xxxv the solitude of her own room was no welcome refuge to carmina in her present state of mind she went on to the schoolroom miss minerva was alone the two girls in obedience to domestic regulations were making their midday toilet before dinner carmina described her interview with mrs gallilee and her meeting with mr le frank don't scold me she said i make no excuse for my folly if mr le frank had left the house after you spoke to him miss minerva answered i should not have felt the anxiety which troubles me now i don't like his going to mrs gallilee afterwards especially when you tell me of that change in her manner towards you yours is a vivid imagination carmina are you sure that it has not been playing you any tricks perfectly sure miss minerva was not quite satisfied will you help me to feel as certain about it as you do she asked mrs gallilee generally looks in for a few minutes while the children are at dinner stay here and say something to her in my presence i want to judge for myself the girls came in maria's perfect toilet reflected maria's perfect character she performed the duties of politeness with her usual happy choice of words dear carmina it is indeed a pleasure to see you again in our schoolroom we are naturally anxious about your health this lovely weather is no doubt in your favour and papa thinks mr null a remarkably clever man zo stood by frowning while these smooth conventionalities trickled over her sister's lips carmina asked what was the matter zo looked gloomily at the dog on the rug i wish i was tinker she said maria smiled sweetly dear zoe what a very strange wish what would you do if you were tinker the dog hearing his name rose and shook himself zo pointed to him with an appearance of the deepest interest he hasn't got to brush his hair before he goes out for a walk his nails don't took black when they're dirty and i say she whispered the next words in carmina's ear he hasn't got a governess the dinner made its appearance and mrs gallilee followed the dinner maria said grace zo always ravenous at meals forgot to say amen carmina standing behind her chair prompted her zo said amen oh bother the first word at the top of her voice and the last two in a whisper mrs gallilee looked at carmina as she might have looked at an obtrusive person who had stepped in from the street you had better dress before luncheon she suggested or you will keep the carriage waiting hearing this zo laid down her knife and fork and looked over her shoulder ask if i may go with you she said carmina made the request no mrs gallilee answered the children must walk my maid will accompany you carmina glanced at miss minerva on leaving the room the governess replied by a look she too had seen the change in mrs gallilee's manner and was at a loss to understand it mrs gallilee's maid marceline belonged to a quick tempered race she was a jersey woman it is not easy to say which of the two felt most oppressed by their enforced companionship in the carriage the maid was perhaps the most to be pitied secretly drawn towards carmina like the other servants in the house she was forced by her mistress's private instruction to play the part of a spy if the young lady changes the route which the coachman has my orders to take or if she communicates with any person while your are out you are to report it to me mrs gallilee had not forgotten the discovery of the travelling bag and mr mool's exposition of the law had informed her that the superintendence of carmina was as much a matter of serious pecuniary interest as ever but recent events had in one respect at least improved the prospect if ovid as his mother actually ventured to hope broke off his engagement when he heard the scandalous story of carmina's birth there was surely a chance that she like other girls of her sensitive temperament might feel the calamity that had fallen on her so acutely as to condemn herself to a single life misled partly by the hope of relief from her own vile anxieties partly by the heartless incapability of appreciating generous feeling in others developed by the pursuits of her later life mrs gallilee seriously contemplated her son's future decision as a matter of reasonable doubt in the meanwhile this detestable child of adultery this living obstacle in the way of the magnificent prospects which otherwise awaited maria and zoe to say nothing of their mother must remain in the house submitted to her guardian's authority watched by her guardian's vigilance the hateful creature was still entitled to medical attendance when she was ill and must still be supplied with every remedy that the doctor's ingenuity could suggest a liberal allowance was paid for the care of her and the trustees were bound to interfere if it was not fairly earned looking after the carriage as it drove away marceline on the front seat presenting the picture of discomfort and carmina opposite to her unendurably pretty and interesting with the last new poem on her lap mrs gallilee's reflections took their own bitter course accidents happen to other carriages with other girls in them not to my carriage with that girl in it nothing will frighten my horses to day and fat as he is my coachman will not have a fit on the box it was only too true at the appointed hour the carriage appeared again and to complete the disappointment marceline had no report to make miss minerva had not forgotten her promise when she returned from her walk with the children the rooms had been taken teresa's london lodging was within five minutes' walk of the house that evening carmina sent a telegram to rome on the chance that the nurse might not yet have begun her journey the message deferring other explanations until they met merely informed her that her rooms were ready adding the address and the landlady's name guessing in the dark carmina and the governess had ignorantly attributed the sinister alteration in mrs gallilee's manner to the prospect of teresa's unwelcome return while you have the means in your power miss minerva advised it may be as well to let your old friend know that there is a home for her when she reaches london chapter xxxvi the weather to carmina's infinite relief changed for the worse the next day incessant rain made it impossible to send her out in the carriage again but it was an eventful day nevertheless on that rainy afternoon mr gallilee asserted himself as a free agent in the terrible presence of his wife it's an uncommonly dull day my dear he began this passed without notice which was a great encouragement to go on if you will allows me to say so carmina wants a little amusement mrs gallilee looked up from her book fearing that he might stop altogether if he took his time as usual mr gallilee proceeded in a hurry there's an afternoon performance of conjuring tricks and do you know i really think i might take carmina to see it we shall be delighted if you will accompany us my dear and they do say perhaps you have heard of it yourself that there's a good deal of science in this exhibition his eyes rolled in uneasy expectation as he waited to hear what his wife might decide she waved her hand contemptuously in the direction of the door mr gallilee retired with the alacrity of a young man now we shall enjoy ourselves he thought as he went up to carmina's room they were just leaving the house when the music master arrived at the door to give his lesson mr gallilee immediately put his head out of the cab window we are going to see the conjuring he shouted cheerfully carmina don't you see mr le frank he is bowing to you do you like conjuring mr le frank don't tell the children where we are going they would be disappointed poor things but they must have their lessons mustn't they good bye i say stop a minute if you ever want your umbrella mended i know a man who will do it cheap and well nasty day isn't it go on go on the general opinion which ranks vanity among the lighter failings of humanity commits a serious mistake vanity wants nothing but the motive power to develop into absolute wickedness vanity can be savagely suspicious and diabolically cruel what are the two typical names which stand revealed in history as the names of the two vainest men that ever lived nero and robespierre in his obscure sphere and within his restricted means the vanity of mrs gallilee's music master had developed its inherent qualities under her cunning and guarded instigation once set in action his suspicion of carmina passed beyond all limits there could be no reason but a bad reason for that barefaced attempt to entrap him into a reconciliation every evil motive which it was possible to attribute to a girl of her age no matter how monstrously improbable it might be occurred to him when he recalled her words her look and her manner at their meeting on the stairs his paltry little mind at other times preoccupied in contemplating himself and his abilities was now so completely absorbed in imagining every variety of conspiracy against his social and professional position that he was not even capable of giving his customary lesson to two children before the appointed hour had expired miss minerva remarked that his mind did not appear to be at ease and suggested that he had better renew the lesson on the next day after a futile attempt to assume an appearance of tranquillity he thanked her and took his leave on his way downstairs he found the door of carmina's room left half open she was absent with mr gallilee miss minerva remained upstairs with the children mrs gallilee was engaged in scientific research at that hour of the afternoon there were no duties which called the servants to the upper part of the house he listened he hesitated he went into the room it was possible that she might keep a journal it was certain that she wrote and received letters if he could only find her desk unlocked and her drawers open the inmost secrets of her life would be at his mercy he tried her desk he tried the cupboard under the bookcase they were both locked the cabinet between the windows and the drawer of the table were left unguarded no discovery rewarded the careful search that he pursued in these two repositories he opened the books that she had left on the table and shook them no forgotten letter no private memorandum used as marks dropped out he looked all round him he peeped into the bedroom he listened to make sure that nobody was outside he entered the bedroom and examined the toilet table and opened the doors of the wardrobe and still the search was fruitless persevere as he might returning to the sitting room he shook his fist at the writing desk you wouldn't be locked he thought unless you had some shameful secrets to keep i shall have other opportunities and she may not always remember to turn the key he stole quietly down the stairs and met no one on his way out the bad weather continued on the next day the object of mr le frank's suspicion remained in the house and the second opportunity failed to offer itself as yet the visit to the exhibition of conjuring had done carmina harm instead of good her head ached in the close atmosphere she was too fatigued to be able to stay in the room until the performance came to an end poor mr gallilee retired in disgrace to the shelter of his club at dinner even his perfect temper failed him for the moment he found fault with the champagne and then apologised to the waiter i'm sorry i was a little hard on you just now the fact is i'm out of sorts you have felt in that way yourself haven't you the wine's first rate and really the weather is so discouraging i think i'll try another pint but carmina's buoyant heart defied the languor of illness and the gloomy day the post had brought her a letter from ovid enclosing a photograph taken at montreal which presented him in his travelling costume he wrote in a tone of cheerfulness which revived carmina's sinking courage and renewed for a time at least the happiness of other days the air of the plains of canada he declared to be literally intoxicating every hour seemed to be giving him back the vital energy that he had lost in his london life he slept on the ground in the open air more soundly than he had ever slept in a bed but one anxiety troubled his mind in the roving life which he now enjoyed it was impossible that his letters could follow him and yet every day that passed made him more unreasonably eager to hear that carmina was not weary of waiting for him and that all was well at home and how have these vain aspirations of mine ended the letter went on they have ended my darling in a journey for one of my guides an indian whose fidelity i have put to the proof and whose zeal i have stimulated by a promise of reward the indian takes these lines to be posted at quebec he is also provided with an order authorising my bankers to trust him with the letters that are waiting for me i begin a canoe voyage to morrow and after due consultation with the crew we have arranged a date and a place at which my messenger will find me on his return shall i confess my own amiable weakness or do you know me well enough already to suspect the truth my love i am sorely tempted to be false to my plans and arrangements to go back with the indian to quebec and to take a berth in the first steamer that returns to england don't suppose that i am troubled by any misgivings about what is going on in my absence it is one of the good signs of my returning health that i take the brightest view of our present lives and of our lives to come i feel tempted to go back for the same reason that makes me anxious for letters i want to hear from you because i love you i want to return at once because i love you there is longing unutterable longing in my heart no doubts my sweet one and no fears but i was a doctor before i became a lover my medical knowledge tells me that this is an opportunity of thoroughly fortifying my constitution and with god's blessing of securing to myself reserves of health and strength which will take us together happily on the way to old age dear love you must be my wife not my nurse there is the thought that gives me self denial enough to let the indian go away by himself carmina answered this letter as soon as she had read it before the mail could carry her reply to its destination she well knew that the indian messenger would be on the way back to his master but ovid had made her so happy that she felt the impulse to write to him at once as she might have felt the impulse to answer him at once if he had been present and speaking to her when the pages were filled and the letter had been closed and addressed the effort produced its depressing effect on her spirits there now appeared to her a certain wisdom in the loving rapidity of her reply even in the fullness of her joy she was conscious of an underlying distrust of herself although he refused to admit it mr null had betrayed a want of faith in the remedy from which he had anticipated such speedy results by writing another prescription he had also added a glass to the daily allowance of wine which he had thought sufficient thus far without despairing of herself carmina felt that she had done wisely in writing her answer while she was still well enough to rival the cheerful tone of ovid's letter she laid down to rest on the sofa with the photograph in her hand no sense of loneliness oppressed her now the portrait was the best of all companions outside the heavy rain pattered in the room the busy clock ticked she listened lazily and looked at her lover and kissed the faithful image of him peacefully happy the opening of the door was the first little event that disturbed her zo peeped in her face was red her hair was tousled her fingers presented inky signs of a recent writing lesson i'm in a rage she announced and so is the other one carmina called her to the sofa and tried to find out who this second angry person might be oh you know zo answered doggedly she rapped my knuckles i call her a beast hush you mustn't talk in that way she'll be here directly zo proceeded you look out she'd rap your knuckles only you're too big if it wasn't raining i'd run away carmina assumed an air of severity and entered a serious protest adapted to her young friend's intelligence she might as well have spoken in a foreign language zo had another reason to give besides the rap on the knuckles for running away i say she resumed you know the boy what boy dear he comes round sometimes he's got a hurdy gurdy he's got a monkey he grins he says aha gimmee haypenny i mean to go to that boy as a confession of zo's first love this was irresistible carmina burst out laughing zo indignantly claimed a hearing i haven't done yet she burst out the boy dances like this she cocked her head and slapped her thigh and imitated the boy and sometimes he sings she cried with another outburst of admiration yah yah yah bellah vitah yah that's italian carmina the door opened again while the performer was in full vigour and miss minerva appeared when she entered the room carmina at once saw that zo had correctly observed her governess miss minerva's heavy eyebrows lowered her lips were pale her head was held angrily erect carmina she said sharply you shouldn't encourage that child she turned round in search of the truant pupil incurably stupid at her lessons zo's mind had its gleams of intelligence in a state of liberty one of those gleams had shone propitiously and had lighted her out of the room miss minerva took a chair she dropped into it like a person worn out with fatigue carmina spoke to her gently words of sympathy were thrown away on that self tormenting nature no i'm not ill she said a night without sleep a perverse child to teach in the morning and a detestable temper at all times that's what is the matter with me she looked at carmina you seem to be wonderfully better to day has stupid mr null really done you some good at last she noticed the open writing desk and discovered the letter or is it good news i have heard from ovid carmina answered the photograph was still in her hand but her inbred delicacy of feeling kept the portrait hidden the governess's sallow complexion turned little by little to a dull greyish white her hands loosely clasped in her lap tightened when she heard ovid's name that slight movement over she stirred no more after waiting a little carmina ventured to speak frances she said you have not shaken hands with me yet miss minerva slowly looked up keeping her hands still clasped on her lap when is he coming back she asked it was said quietly carmina quietly replied not yet i am sorry to say i am sorry too it's good of you frances to say that no it's not good of me i'm thinking of myself not of you she suddenly lowered her tone i wish you were married to him she said there was a pause miss minerva was the first to speak again do you understand me she asked perhaps you will help me to understand carmina answered if you were married to him even my restless spirit might be at peace the struggle would be over she left her chair and walked restlessly up and down the room the passionate emotion which she had resolutely suppressed began to get beyond her control i was thinking about you last night she abruptly resumed you are a gentle little creature but i have seen you show some spirit when your aunt's cold blooded insolence roused you do you know what i would do if i were in your place i wouldn't wait tamely till he came back to me i would go to him carmina carmina leave this horrible house she stopped close by the sofa let me look at you ha i believe you have thought of it yourself i have thought of it what did i say you poor little prisoner you have the right spirit in you i wish i could give you some of my strength the half mocking tone in which she spoke suddenly failed her her piercing eyes grew dim the hard lines in her face softened she dropped on her knees and wound her lithe arms round carmina and kissed her you sweet child she said and burst passionately into tears even then the woman's fiercely self dependent nature asserted itself she pushed carmina back on the sofa don't look at me don't speak to me she gasped leave me to get over it she stifled the sobs that broke from her still on her knees she looked up shuddering a ghastly smile distorted her lips ah what fools we are she said where is that lavender water my dear your favourite remedy for a burning head she found the bottle before carmina could help her and soaked her handkerchief in the lavender water and tied it round her head yes she went on as if they had been gossiping on the most commonplace subjects i think you're right this is the best of all perfumes she looked at the clock the children's dinner will be ready in ten minutes i must and will say what i have to say to you it may be the last poor return i can make carmina for all your kindness she returned to her chair i can't help it if i frighten you she resumed i must tell you plainly that i don't like the prospect in the first place the sooner we two are parted oh only for a while the better for you after what i went through last night no i am not going to enter into any particulars i am only going to repeat what i have said already don't trust me i mean it carmina your generous nature shall not mislead you if i can help it when you are a happy married woman when he is farther removed from me than he is even now remember your ugly ill tempered friend and let me come to you enough of this i have other misgivings that are waiting to be confessed you know that old nurse of yours intimately while i only speak from a day or two's experience of her to my judgment she is a woman whose fondness for you might be turned into a tigerish fondness on very small provocation you write to her constantly does she know what you have suffered have you told her the truth yes without reserve entirely without reserve when that old woman comes to london carmina and sees you and sees mrs gallilee don't you think the consequences may be serious and your position between them something if you were ten times stronger than you are that no fortitude can endure carmina started up on the sofa she was not able to speak miss minerva gave her time to recover herself after another look at the clock i am not alarming you for nothing she proceeded i have something hopeful to propose your friend teresa has energies wild energies make a good use of them she will do anything you ask or her take her with you to canada oh frances miss minerva pointed to the letter on the desk does he tell you when he will be back no he feels the importance of completely restoring his health he is going farther and farther away he has sent to quebec for his letters then there is no fear of your crossing each other on the voyage go to quebec and wait for him there i should frighten him not you what can i say to him what you must say if you are weak enough to wait for him here do you think his mother will consider his feelings when he comes back to marry you i tell you again i am not talking at random i have thought it all out i know how you can make your escape and defy pursuit you have plenty of money you have teresa to take care of you go for your own sake for his sake go the clock struck the hour she rose and removed the handkerchief from her head hush she said do i hear the rustling of a dress on the landing below she snatched up a bottle of mr null's medicine as a reason for being in the room the sound of the rustling dress came nearer and nearer mrs gallilee on her way to the schoolroom dinner opened the door she instantly understood the purpose which the bottle was intended to answer it is my business to give carmina her medicine she said your business is at the schoolroom table she took possession of the bottle and advanced to carmina there were two looking glasses in the room one in the usual position over the fireplace the other opposite on the wall behind the sofa turning back before she left the room miss minerva saw mrs gallilee's face when she and carmina looked at each other reflected in the glass the girls were waiting for their dinner maria received the unpunctual governess with her ready smile and her appropriate speech dear miss minerva we were really almost getting alarmed about you pardon me for noticing it you look she caught the eye of the governess and stopped confusedly well said miss minerva how do i look maria still hesitated zo spoke out as usual you look as if somebody had frightened you chapter xxxvii after two days of rain the weather cleared again it was a calm sunshiny sunday morning the flat country round benjulia's house wore its brightest aspect on that clear autumn day even the doctor's gloomy domestic establishment reflected in some degree the change for the better when he rose that morning benjulia presented himself to his household in a character which they were little accustomed to see the character of a good humoured master he astonished his silent servant by attempting to whistle a tune if you ever looked cheerful in your life he said to the man look cheerful now i'm going to take a holiday after working incessantly never leaving his laboratory eating at his dreadful table snatching an hour's rest occasionally on the floor he had completed a series of experiments with results on which he could absolutely rely he had advanced by one step nearer towards solving that occult problem in brain disease which had thus far baffled the investigations of medical men throughout the civilised world if his present rate of progress continued the lapse of another month might add his name to the names that remain immortal among physicians in the annals of discovery so completely had his labours absorbed his mind that he only remembered the letters which mrs gallilee had left with him when he finished his breakfast on sunday morning upon examination there appeared no allusion in ovid's correspondence to the mysterious case of illness which he had attended at montreal the one method now left by which benjulia could relieve the doubt that still troubled him was to communicate directly with his friend in canada he decided to celebrate his holiday by taking a walk his destination being the central telegraph office in london but before he left the house his domestic duties claimed attention he issued his orders to the cook at three o'clock he would return to dinner that day was to witness the celebration of his first regular meat for forty eight hours past and he expected the strictest punctuality the cook lately engaged was a vigourous little woman with fiery hair and a high colour she like the man servant felt the genial influence of her master's amiability he looked at her for the first time since she had entered the house a twinkling light showed itself furtively in his dreary gray eyes he took a dusty old hand screen from the sideboard and made her a present of it there he said with his dry humour don't spoil your complexion before the kitchen fire the cook possessed a sanguine temperament and a taste to be honoured and encouraged the taste for reading novels she put her own romantic construction on the extraordinary compliment which the doctor's jesting humour had paid to her as he walked out grimly smiling and thumping his big stick on the floor a new idea illuminated her mind her master admired her her master was no ordinary man it might end in his marrying her on his way to the telegraph office benjulia left ovid's letters at mrs gallilee's house if he had personally returned them he would have found the learned lady in no very gracious humour on the previous day she had discovered carmina and miss minerva engaged in a private conference without having been able even to guess what the subject under discussion between them might be they were again together that morning maria and zo had gone to church with their father miss minerva was kept at home by a headache at that hour and under those circumstances there was no plausible pretence which would justify mrs gallilee's interference she seriously contemplated the sacrifice of a month's salary and the dismissal of her governess without notice when the footman opened the door benjulia handed in the packet of letters after his latest experience of mrs gallilee he had no intention of returning her visit he walked away without uttering a word the cable took his message to mr morphew in these terms ovid's patient at montreal was the complaint brain disease yes or no having made arrangements for the forwarding of the reply from his club he set forth on the walk back to his house at five minutes to three he was at home again as the clock struck the hour he rang the bell the man servant appeared without the dinner benjulia's astonishing amiability on his holiday was even equal to this demand on its resources i ordered roast mutton at three he said with terrifying tranquillity where is it the dinner will be ready in ten minutes sir why is it not ready now the cook hopes you will excuse her sir she is a little behindhand to day what has hindered her if you please the silent servant on all other occasions the most impenetrable of human beings began to tremble the doctor had literally kicked a man out of the house who had tried to look through the laboratory skylight he had turned away a female servant at half an hour's notice for forgetting to shut the door a second time in one day but what were these highhanded proceedings compared with the awful composure which being kept waiting for dinner only asked what had hindered the cook and put the question politely by saying if you please perhaps you were making love to her the doctor suggested as gently as ever this outrageous insinuation stung the silent servant into speech i'm incapable of the action sir he answered indignantly the woman was reading a story benjulia bent his head as if in acknowledgment of a highly satisfactory explanation oh reading a story people who read stories are said to have excitable brains should you call the cook excitable i should sir most cooks are excitable they say it's the kitchen fire do they you can go now don't hurry the cook i'll wait he waited apparently following some new train of thought which highly diverted him ten minutes passed then a quarter of an hour then another five minutes when the servant returned with the dinner the master's private reflections continued to amuse him his thin lips were still widening grimly distended by his formidable smile on being carved the mutton proved to be underdone at other times this was an unpardonable crime in benjulia's domestic code of laws all he said now was take it away he dined on potatoes and bread and cheese when he had done he was rather more amiable than ever he said ask the cook to come and see me the cook presented herself with one hand on her palpitating heart and the other holding her handkerchief to her eyes what are you crying about benjulia inquired i haven't scolded you have i the cook began an apology the doctor pointed to a chair sit down and recover yourself the cook sat down faintly smiling through her tears this otherwise incomprehensible reception of a person who had kept the dinner waiting twenty minutes and who had not done the mutton properly even then taken in connection with the master's complimentary inquiries reported downstairs by the footman could bear but one interpretation it wasn't every woman who had her beautiful hair and her rosy complexion why had she not thought of going upstairs first just to see whether she looked her best in the glass would he begin by making a confession or would he begin by kissing her he began by lighting his pipe for a while he smoked placidly with his eye on the cook i hear you have been reading a story he resumed what is the name of it 'pamela or virtue rewarded' sir benjulia went on with his smoking the cook thus far demure and downcast lifted her eyes experimentally he was still looking at her did he want encouragement the cook cautiously offered a little literary information the author's name is on the book sir name of richardson the information was graciously received yes i've heard of the name and heard of the book is it interesting oh sir it's a beautiful story my only excuse for being late with the dinner who's pamela a young person in service sir i'm sure i wish i was more like her i felt quite broken hearted when you sent the mutton down again and you so kind as to overlook the error in the roasting benjulia stopped the apology once more he pursued his own ends with a penitent cook just as he pursued his own ends with a vivisected animal nothing moved him out of his appointed course in the one or in the other he returned to pamela and what becomes of her at the end of the story he asked the cook simpered it's pamela who is the virtuous young person sir and so the story comes true pamela or virtue rewarded who rewards her was there ever anything so lucky as this pamela's situation was fast becoming the cook's situation the bosom of the vigourous little woman began to show signs of tender agitation distributed over a large surface she rolled her eyes amorously benjulia puffed out another mouthful of smoke well he repeated who rewards pamela her master sir what does he do the cook's eyes sank modestly to her lap the cook's complexion became brighter than ever her master marries her sir oh that was all he said he was not astonished or confused or encouraged he simply intimated that he now knew how pamela's master had rewarded pamela and more dispiriting still he took the opportunity of knocking the ashes out of his pipe and filled it and lit it again if the cook had been one of the few miserable wretches who never read novels she might have felt her fondly founded hopes already sinking from under her as it was richardson sustained her faith in herself richardson reminded her that pamela's master had hesitated and that pamela's virtue had not earned its reward on easy terms she stole another look at the doctor the eloquence of women's eyes so widely and justly celebrated in poetry and prose now spoke in the cook's eyes they said marry me dear sir and you shall never have underdone mutton again the hearts of other savages have been known to soften under sufficient influences why should the scientific savage under similar pressure not melt a little too the doctor took up the talk again he made a kind allusion to the cook's family circumstances when you first came here i think you told me you had no relations i am an orphan sir and you had been some time out of a situation when i engaged you yes sir my poor little savings were nearly at an end could he resist that pathetic picture of the orphan's little savings framed as it were in a delicately designed reference to her fellow servant in the story i was as poor as pamela she suggested softly and as virtuous benjulia added the cook's eloquent eyes said thank you sir he laid down his pipe that was a good sign surely he drew his chair nearer to her better and better his arm was long enough in the new position to reach her waist her waist was ready for him you have nothing in particular to do this afternoon and i have nothing particular to do he delivered himself of this assertion rather abruptly at the same time it was one of those promising statements which pave the way for anything he might say having nothing particular to do to day why shouldn't we make love or he might say having nothing particular to do to morrow why shouldn't we get the marriage license would he put it in that way no he made a proposal of quite another kind he said you seem to be fond of stories suppose i tell you a story perhaps there was some hidden meaning in this there was unquestionably a sudden alteration in his look and manner the cook asked herself what it meant if she had seen the doctor at his secret work in the laboratory the change in him might have put her on her guard he was now looking experimentally at the inferior creature seated before him in the chair as he looked experimentally at the other inferior creatures stretched under him on the table his story began in the innocent old fashioned way once upon a time there was a master and there was a maid we will call the master by the first letter of the alphabet mr a and we will call the maid by the second letter miss b the cook drew a long breath of relief there was a hidden meaning in the doctor's story the unfortunate woman thought to herself i have not only got fine hair and a beautiful complexion i am clever as well on her rare evenings of liberty she sometimes gratified another highly creditable taste besides the taste for reading novels she was an eager play goer that notable figure in the drama the man who tells his own story under pretence of telling the story of another person was no unfamiliar figure in her stage experience her encouraging smile made its modest appearance once more in the very beginning of her master's story she saw already the happy end we all of us have our troubles in life benjulia went on and miss b had her troubles for a long time she was out of a situation and she had no kind parents to help her miss b was an orphan her little savings were almost gone it was too distressing the cook took out her handkerchief and pitied miss b with all her heart the doctor proceeded but virtue as we know when we read 'pamela' is sure of its reward circumstances occurred in the household of mr a which made it necessary for him to engage a cook he discovered an advertisement in a newspaper which informed him that miss b was in search of a situation mr a found her to be a young and charming woman mr a engaged her at that critical part of the story benjulia paused and what did mr a do next he asked the cook could restrain herself no longer she jumped out of her chair and threw her arms round the doctor's neck benjulia went on with his story as if nothing had happened and what did mr a do next he repeated he put his hand in his pocket he gave miss b a month's wages and he turned her out of the house you impudent hussy you have delayed my dinner spoilt my mutton and hugged me round the neck there is your money go with glaring eyes and gaping mouth the cook stood looking at him like a woman struck to stone in a moment more the rage burst out of her in a furious scream she turned to the table and snatched up a knife benjulia wrenched it from her hand and dropped back into his chair completely overpowered by the success of his little joke he did what he had never done within the memory of his oldest friend he burst out laughing this has been a holiday he said why haven't i got somebody with me to enjoy it at that laugh at those words the cook's fury in its fiercest heat became frozen by terror there was something superhuman in the doctor's diabolical joy even he felt the wild horror in the woman's eyes as they rested on him what's the matter with you he asked she muttered and mumbled and shrinking away from him crept towards the door as she approached the window a man outside passed by it on his way to the house she pointed to him and repeated benjulia's own words somebody to enjoy it with you she said she opened the dining room door the man servant appeared in the hall with a gentleman behind him the gentleman was a scrupulously polite person he looked with alarm at the ghastly face of the cook as she ran past him making for the kitchen stairs i'm afraid i intrude on you at an unfortunate time he said to benjulia pray excuse me i will call again come in sir the doctor spoke absently looking towards the hall and thinking of something else the gentleman entered the room my name is mool he said i have had the honour of meeting you at one of mrs gallilee's parties very likely i don't remember it myself take a seat he was still thinking of something else modest mr mool took a seat in confusion the doctor crossed the room and opened the door excuse me for a minute he said i will be back directly he went to the top of the kitchen stairs and called to the housemaid is the cook down there yes sir what is she doing crying her heart out benjulia turned away again with the air of a disappointed man a violent moral shock sometimes has a serious effect on the brain especially when it is the brain of an excitable woman always a physiologist even in those rare moments when he was amusing himself it had just struck benjulia that the cook after her outbreak of fury might be a case worth studying but she had got relief in crying her brain was safe she had ceased to interest him he returned to the dining room chapter xxxviii you look hot sir have a drink old english ale out of the barrel the tone was hearty he poured out the sparkling ale into a big tumbler with hospitable good will mr mool was completely and most agreeably taken by surprise he too was feeling the influence of the doctor's good humour enriched in quality by pleasant remembrances of his interview with the cook i live in the suburbs doctor benjulia on this side of london mr mool explained and i have had a nice walk from my house to yours if i have done wrong sir in visiting you on sunday i can only plead that i am engaged in business during the week all right one day's the same as another provided you don't interrupt me you don't interrupt me now do you smoke no thank you do you mind my smoking i like it doctor very amiable on your part i'm sure what did you say your name was mool benjulia looked at him suspiciously was he a physiologist and a rival you're not a doctor are you he said i am a lawyer one of the few popular prejudices which benjulia shared with his inferior fellow creatures was the prejudice against lawyers but for his angry recollection of the provocation successfully offered to him by his despicable brother mrs gallilee would never have found her way into his confidence but for his hearty enjoyment of the mystification of the cook mr mool would have been requested to state the object of his visit in writing and would have gone home again a baffled man the doctor's holiday amiability had reached its full development indeed when he allowed a strange lawyer to sit and talk with him gentlemen of your profession he muttered never pay visits to people whom they don't know without having their own interests in view mr mool you want something of me what is it mr mool's professional tact warned him to waste no time on prefatory phrases i venture on my present intrusion he began in consequence of a statement recently made to me in my office by mrs gallilee stop cried benjulia i don't like your beginning i can tell you is it necessary to mention the name of that old he used a word described in dictionaries as having a twofold meaning first a female of the canine kind second a term of reproach for a woman it shocked mr mool and it is therefore unfit to be reported really doctor benjulia does that mean that you positively must talk about her mr mool smiled let us say that it may bear that meaning he answered go on then and get it over she made a statement in your office out with it my good fellow has it anything to do with me i should not otherwise doctor benjulia have ventured to present myself at your house with that necessary explanation mr mool related all that had passed between mrs gallilee and himself at the outset of the narrative benjulia angrily laid aside his pipe on the point of interrupting the lawyer he changed his mind and putting a strong constraint on himself listened in silence i hope sir mr mool concluded you will not take a hard view of my motive it is only the truth to say that i am interested in miss carmina's welfare i felt the sincerest respect and affection for her parents you knew them too they were good people on reflection you must surely regret it if you have carelessly repeated a false report won't you help me to clear the poor mother's memory of this horrid stain benjulia smoked in silence had that simple and touching appeal found its way to him he began very strangely when he consented at last to open his lips you're what they call a middle aged man he said i suppose you have had some experience of women mr mool blushed i am a married man sir he replied gravely very well that's experience of one kind when a man's out of temper and a woman wants something of him do you know how cleverly she can take advantage of her privileges to aggravate him till there's nothing he won't do to get her to leave him in peace that's how i came to tell mrs gallilee what she told you he waited a little and comforted himself with his pipe mind this he resumed i don't profess to feel any interest in the girl and i never cared two straws about her parents at the same time if you can turn to good account what i am going to say next do it and welcome this scandal began in the bragging of a fellow student of mine at rome he was angry with me and angry with another man for laughing at him when he declared himself to be mrs robert graywell's lover and he laid us a wager that we should see the woman alone in his room that night we were hidden behind a curtain and we did see her in his room i paid the money i had lost and left rome soon afterwards the other man refused to pay on what ground mr mool eagerly asked on the ground that she wore a thick veil and never showed her face an unanswerable objection doctor benjulia perhaps it might be i didn't think so myself two hours before mrs robert graywell and i had met in the street she had on a dress of a remarkable colour in those days a sort of sea green and a bonnet to match which everybody stared at because it was not half the size of the big bonnets then in fashion there was no mistaking the strange dress or the tall figure when i saw her again in the student's room so i paid the bet do you remember the name of the man who refused to pay his name was egisto baccani have you heard anything of him since yes he got into some political scrape and took refuge like the rest of them in england and got his living like the rest of them by teaching languages he sent me his prospectus that's how i came to know about it have you got the prospectus torn up long ago mr mool wrote down the name in his pocket book there is nothing more you can tell me he said nothing accept my best thanks doctor good day if you find baccani let me know another drop of ale are you likely to see mrs gallilee soon yes if i find baccani do you ever play with children i have five of my own to play with mr mool answered very well ask for the youngest child when you go to mrs gallilee's we call her zo put your finger on her spine here just below the neck press on the place so and when she wriggles say with the big doctor's love getting back to his own house mr mool was surprised to find an open carriage at the garden gate a smartly dressed woman on the front seat surveyed him with an uneasy look if you please sir she said would you kindly tell miss carmina that we really mustn't wait any longer the woman's uneasiness was reflected in mr mool's face a visit from carmina at his private residence could have no ordinary motive the fear instantly occurred to him that mrs gallilee might have spoken to her of her mother before he opened the drawing room door this alarm passed away he heard carmina talking with his wife and daughters may i say one little word to you mr mool he took her into his study she was shy and confused but certainly neither angry nor distressed my aunt sends me out every day when it's fine for a drive she said as the carriage passed close by i thought i might ask you a question certainly my dear as many questions as you please it's about the law my aunt says she has the authority over me now which my dear father had while he was living is that true quite true for how long is she my guardian until you are twenty one years old the faint colour faded from carmina's face more than three years perhaps to suffer she said sadly to suffer what do you mean my dear she turned paler still and made no reply i want to ask one thing more she resumed in sinking tones would my aunt still be my guardian supposing i was married mr mool answered this with his eyes fixed on her in grave scrutiny in that case your husband is the only person who has any authority over you these are rather strange questions carmina won't you take me into your confidence in sudden agitation she seized his hand and kissed it i must go she said i have kept the carriage waiting too long already she ran out without once looking back chapter xxxix mrs gallilee's maid looked at her watch when the carriage left mr mool's house we shall be nearly an hour late before we get home she said it's my fault marceline tell your mistress the truth if she questions you i shall not think the worse of you for obeying your orders i'd rather lose my place miss than get you into trouble the woman spoke truly carmina's sweet temper had made her position not only endurable but delightful she had been treated like a companion and a friend but for that circumstance so keenly had marceline felt the degradation of being employed as a spy she would undoubtedly have quitted mrs gallilee's service on the way home instead of talking pleasantly as usual carmina was silent and sad had this change in her spirits been caused by the visit to mr mool it was even so the lawyer had innocently decided her on taking the desperate course which miss minerva had proposed if mrs gallilee's assertion of her absolute right of authority as guardian had been declared by mr mool to be incorrect carmina hopefully forgetful of her aunt's temper had thought of a compromise she would have consented to remain at mrs gallilee's disposal until ovid returned on condition of being allowed when teresa arrived in london to live in retirement with her old nurse this change of abode would prevent any collision between mrs gallilee and teresa and would make carmina's life as peaceful and even as happy as she could wish but now that the lawyer had confirmed her aunt's statement of the position in which they stood towards one another instant flight to ovid's love and protection seemed to be the one choice left unless carmina could resign herself to a life of merciless persecution and perpetual suspense the arrangements for the flight were already complete that momentary view of mrs gallilee's face reflected in the glass had confirmed miss minerva's resolution to interfere closeted with carmina on the sunday morning she had proposed a scheme of escape which would even set mrs gallilee's vigilance and cunning at defiance no pecuniary obstacle stood in the way the first quarterly payment of carmina's allowance of five hundred a year had been already made by mool's advice enough was left even without the assistance which the nurse's resources would render to purchase the necessary outfit and to take the two women to quebec on the day after teresa's arrival at an hour of the morning while the servants were still in bed carmina and her companion could escape from the house on foot and not leave a trace behind them meanwhile fortune befriended mrs gallilee's maid no questions were put to her no notice even was taken of the late return five minutes before the carriage drew up at the house a learned female friend from the country called by appointment on mrs gallilee on the coming tuesday afternoon an event of the deepest scientific interest was to take place a new professor had undertaken to deliver himself by means of a lecture of subversive opinions on matter a general discussion was to follow and in that discussion upon certain conditions mrs gallilee herself proposed to take part if the professor attempts to account for the mutual action of separate atoms she said i defy him to do it without assuming the existence of a continuous material medium in space and this point of view being accepted follow me here what is the result in plain words cried mrs gallilee rising excitedly to her feet we dispense with the idea of atoms the friend looked infinitely relieved by the prospect of dispensing with atoms now observe mrs gallilee proceeded in connection with this part of the subject i shall wait to see if the professor adopts thomson's theory you are acquainted with thomson's theory no let me put it briefly mere heterogeneity together with gravitation is sufficient to explain all the apparently discordant laws of molecular action you understand very well if the professor passes over thomson then i rise in the body of the hall and take my stand follow me again on these grounds while mrs gallilee's grounds were being laid out for the benefit of her friend the coachman took the carriage back to the stables the maid went downstairs to tea and carmina joined miss minerva in the schoolroom all three being protected from discovery by mrs gallilee's rehearsal of her performance in the comedy of atoms the monday morning brought with it news from rome serious news which confirmed miss minerva's misgivings carmina received a letter bearing the italian postmark but not addressed to her in teresa's handwriting she looked to the signature before she began to read her correspondent was the old priest father patrizio he wrote in these words my dear child our good teresa leaves us to day on her journey to london she has impatiently submitted to the legal ceremonies rendered necessary by her husband having died without making a will he hardly left anything in the way of money after payment of his burial expenses and his few little debts what is of far greater importance he lived and died a good christian i was with him in his last moments offer your prayers my dear for the repose of his soul teresa left me declaring her purpose of travelling night and day so as to reach you the sooner in her headlong haste she has not even waited to look over her husband's papers but has taken the case containing them to england to be examined at leisure in your beloved company strong as this good creature is i believe she will be obliged to rest on the road for a night at least calculating on this i assume that my letter will get to you first i have something to say about your old nurse which it is well that you should know do not for a moment suppose that i blame you for having told teresa of the unfriendly reception which you appear to have met with from your aunt and guardian who should you confide in if not in the excellent woman who has filled the place of a mother to you besides from your earliest years have i not always instilled into you the reverence of truth you have told the truth in your letters my child i commend you and feel for you but the impression produced on teresa is not what you or i could wish it is one of her merits that she loves you with the truest devotion it is one of her defects that she is fierce and obstinate in resentment your aunt has become an object of absolute hatred to her i have combated successfully as i hope and believe this unchristian state of feeling she is now beyond the reach of my influence my purpose in writing is to beg you to continue the good work that i have begun compose this impetuous nature restrain this fiery spirit your gentle influence carmina has a power of its own over those who love you and who loves you like teresa of which perhaps you are not yourself aware use your power discreetly and with the blessing of god and his saints i have no fear of the result write to me my child when teresa arrives and let me hear that you are happier and better in health tell me also whether there is any speedy prospect of your marriage if i may presume to judge from the little i know your dearest earthly interests depend on the removal of obstacles to this salutary change in your life i send you my good wishes and my blessing if a poor old priest like me can be of any service do not forget father patrizio any lingering hesitation that carmina might still have felt was at an end when she read this letter good father patrizio like good mr mool had innocently urged her to set her guardian's authority at defiance chapter xl when the morning lessons were over carmina showed the priest's letter to miss minerva the governess read it and handed it back in silence have you nothing to say carmina asked nothing you know my opinion already that letter says what i have said with greater authority it has determined me to follow your advice frances then it has done well and you see carmina continued that father patrizio speaks of obstacles in the way of my marriage teresa has evidently shown him my letters do you think he fears as i do that my aunt may find some means of separating us even when ovid comes back very likely she spoke in faint weary tones listlessly leaning back in her chair carmina asked if she had passed another sleepless night yes she said another bad night and the usual martyrdom in teaching the children i don't know which disgusts me most zoe's impudent stupidity or maria's unendurable humbug she had never yet spoken of maria in this way even her voice seemed to be changed instead of betraying the usual angry abruptness her tones coldly indicated impenetrable contempt in the silence that ensued she looked up and saw carmina's eyes resting on her anxiously and kindly any other human being but you she said would find me disagreeable and rude and would be quite right too i haven't asked after your health you look paler than usual have you too had a bad night i fell asleep towards the morning and oh i had such a delightful dream i could almost wish that i had never awakened from it who did you dream of she put the question mechanically frowning as if at some repellent thought suggested to her by what she had just heard i dreamed of my mother carmina answered miss minerva raised herself at once in the chair whatever that passing impression might have been she was free from it now there was some little life again in her eyes some little spirit in her voice take me out of myself she said tell me your dream it is nothing very remarkable frances we all of us sometimes see our dear lost ones in sleep i saw my mother again as i used to see her in the nursery at bedtime tall and beautiful with her long dark hair failing over her white dressing gown to the waist she stooped over me and kissed me and she looked surprised she said 'my little angel why are you here in a strange house i have come to take you back to your own cot by my bedside' i wasn't surprised or frightened i put my arms round her neck and we floated away together through the cool starry night and we were at home again i saw my cot with its pretty white curtains and pink ribbons i heard my mother tell me an english fairy story out of a book which my father had given to her and her kind voice grew fainter and fainter while i grew more and more sleepy and it ended softly just as it used to end in the happy old days and i woke crying do you ever dream of your mother now i god forbid oh frances what a dreadful thing to say is it it was the thought in me when you spoke and with good reason too i was the last of a large family the ugly one the ill tempered one the encumbrance that made it harder than ever to find money enough to pay the household expenses my father swore at my mother for being my mother she reviled him just as bitterly in return and vented the rest of her ill temper on my wretched little body with no sparing hand bedtime was her time for beating me talk of your mother not of mine you were very young were you not when she died too young to feel my misfortune but old enough to remember the sweetest woman that ever lived let me show you my father's portrait of her again doesn't that face tell you what an angel she was there was some charm in her that all children felt i can just remember some of my playfellows who used to come to our garden other good mothers were with us but the children all crowded round my mother they would have her in all their games they fought for places on her lap when she told them stories some of them cried and some of them screamed when it was time to take them away from her oh why do we live why do we die i have bitter thoughts sometimes frances like you i have read in poetry that death is a fearful thing to me death is a cruel thing and it has never seemed so cruel as in these later days since i have known ovid if my mother had but lived till now what happiness would have been added to my life and to hers how ovid would have loved her how she would have loved ovid miss minerva listened in silence it was the silence of true interest and sympathy while carmina was speaking of her mother when her lover's name became mingled with the remembrances of her childhood the change came once more the tell tale lines began to harden in the governess's face she lay back again in her chair her fingers irritably platted and unplatted the edge of her black apron carmina was too deeply absorbed in her thoughts too eagerly bent on giving them expression to notice these warning signs i have all my mother's letters to my father she went on when he was away from her on his sketching excursions you have still a little time to spare i should so like to read some of them to you i was reading one last night which perhaps accounts for my dream it is on a subject that interests everybody in my father's absence a very dear friend of his met with a misfortune and my mother had to prepare his wife to hear the bad news oh that reminds me there is something i want to say to you first about yourself miss minerva asked about ovid i want your advice miss minerva was silent carmina went on it's about writing to ovid she explained write of course the reply was suddenly and sharply given surely i have not offended you carmina said nonsense let me hear your mother's letter yes but i want you to hear the circumstances first you have mentioned them already no no i mean the circumstances in my case she drew her chair closer to miss minerva i want to whisper for fear of somebody passing on the stairs the more i think of it the more i feel that i ought to prepare ovid for seeing me before i make my escape you said when we talked of it never mind what i said oh but i do mind you said i could go to ovid's bankers at quebec and then write when i knew where he was i have been thinking over it since and i see a serious risk he might return from his inland journey on the very day that i get there he might even meet me in the street in his delicate health i daren't think of what the consequences of such a surprise might be and then there is the dreadful necessity of telling him that his mother has driven me into taking this desperate step in my place wouldn't you feel that you could do it more delicately in writing i dare say i might write to morrow for instance to morrow is one of the american mail days my letter would get to canada remembering the roundabout way by which teresa and i are to travel for fear of discovery days and days before we could arrive i should shut myself up in an hotel at quebec and teresa could go every day to the bank to hear if ovid was likely to send for his letters or likely to call soon and ask for them then he would be prepared then when we meet the governess left her chair and pointed to the clock carmina looked at her and rose in alarm are you in pain she asked yes neuralgia i think i have the remedy in my room don't keep me my dear mrs gallilee mustn't find me here again the paroxysm of pain which carmina had noticed passed over her face once more she subdued it and left the room the pain mastered her again a low cry broke from her when she closed the door carmina ran out frances what is it frances looked over her shoulder while she slowly ascended the stairs never mind she said gently i have got my remedy carmina advanced a step to follow her and drew back was that expression of suffering really caused by pain of the body or was it attributable to anything that she had rashly said she tried to recall what had passed between frances and herself the effort wearied her her thoughts turned self reproachfully to ovid if he had been speaking to a friend whose secret sorrow was known to him would he have mentioned the name of the woman whom they both loved she looked at his portrait and reviled herself as a selfish insensible wretch will ovid improve me she wondered shall i be a little worthier of him when i am his wife luncheon time came and mrs gallilee sent word that they were not to wait for her she's studying said mr gallilee with awe struck looks she's going to make a speech at the discussion to morrow the man who gives the lecture is the man she's going to pitch into i don't know him but how do you feel about it yourself carmina i wouldn't stand in his shoes for any sum of money you could offer me poor devil i beg your pardon my dear let me give you a wing of the fowl boiled fowl eh and tongue ha do you know the story of the foreigner he dined out fifteen times with his english friends and there was boiled fowl and tongue at every dinner the fifteenth time the foreigner couldn't stand it any longer he slapped his forehead and he said 'ah merciful heaven cock and bacon again' you won't mention it will you and perhaps you think as i do i'm sick of cock and bacon myself mr null's medical orders still prescribed fresh air the carriage came to the door at the regular hour and mr gallilee with equal regularity withdrew to his club carmina was too uneasy to leave the house without seeing miss minerva first she went up to the schoolroom there was no sound of voices when she opened the door miss minerva was writing and silence had been proclaimed the girls were ready dressed for their walk industrious maria had her book idle zo perched on a high chair sat kicking her legs if you say a word she whispered as carmina passed her you'll be called an imp and stuck up on a chair i shall go to the boy are you better frances much better my dear her face denied it the look of suffering was there still she tore up the letter which she had been writing and threw the fragments into the waste paper basket that's the second letter you've torn up zo remarked say a word more and you shall have bread and water for tea miss minerva was not free from irritation although she might be free from pain even zo noticed how angry the governess was i wish you could drive with me in the carriage said carmina the air would do you so much good impossible but you may soothe my irritable nerves in another way if you like how relieve me of these girls take them out with you do you mind zo instantly jumped off her chair and even maria looked up from her book i will take them with pleasure must we ask my aunt's permission we will dispense with your aunt's permission she is shut up in her study and we are all forbidden to disturb her i will take it on myself she turned to the girls with another outbreak of irritability be off maria rose with dignity and made one of her successful exits i am sorry dear miss minerva if i have done anything to make you angry she pointed the emphasis on i by a side look at her sister zo bounced out of the room and performed the italian boy's dance on the landing for shame said maria zo burst into singing yah yah yah bellah vitah yah jolly jolly jolly we are going out for a drive carmina waited to say a friendly word before she followed the girls you didn't think me neglectful frances when i let you go upstairs by yourself miss minerva answered sadly and kindly the best thing you could do was to leave me by myself carmina's mind was still not quite at ease yes but you were in pain she said you curious child i am not in pain now will you make me comfortable frances give me a kiss two my dear if you like she kissed carmina on one cheek and on the other now leave me to write she said carmina left her the drive ought to have been a pleasant one with zo in the carriage to marceline it was a time of the heartiest enjoyment maria herself condescended to smile now and then there was only one dull person among them miss carmina was but poor company the maid remarked when they got back mrs gallilee herself received them in the hall you will never take the children out again without my leave she said to carmina the person who is really responsible for what you have done will mislead you no more with those words she entered the library and closed the door maria and zo at the sight of their mother had taken flight carmina stood alone in the hall mrs gallilee had turned her cold after awhile she followed the children as far as her own room there her resolution failed her she called faintly upstairs frances there was no answering voice she went into her room a small paper packet was on the table sealed and addressed to herself she tore it open a ring with a spinel ruby in it dropped out she recognised the stone it was miss minerva's ring some blotted lines were traced on the paper inside i have tried to pour out my heart to you in writing and i have torn up the letters the fewest words are the best look back at my confession and you will know why i have left you you shall hear from me when i am more worthy of you than i am now in the meantime wear my ring it will tell you how mean i once was f m carmina looked at the ring she remembered that frances had tried to make her accept it as security in return for the loan of thirty pounds she referred to the confession two passages in it were underlined the wickedness in me on which mrs gallilee calculated may be in me still and again even now when you have found me out i love him don't trust me never had carmina trusted her more faithfully than at that bitter moment chapter xli the ordinary aspect of the schoolroom was seen no more installed in a position of temporary authority the parlour maid sat silently at her needlework maria stood by the window in the new character of an idle girl with her handkerchief in her hand and her everlasting book dropped unnoticed on the floor zo lay flat on her back on the hearth rug hugging the dog in her arms at intervals she rolled herself over slowly from side to side and stared at the ceiling with wondering eyes miss minerva's departure had struck the parlour maid dumb and had demoralized the pupils maria broke the silence at last i wonder where carmina is she said in her room most likely the parlour maid suggested had i better go and see after her the cautious parlour maid declined to offer advice maria's well balanced mind was so completely unhinged that she looked with languid curiosity at her sister zo still stared at the ceiling and still rolled slowly from one side to the other the dog on her breast lulled by the regular motion slept profoundly not even troubled by a dream of fleas while maria was still considering what it might be best to do carmina entered the room she looked as the servant afterwards described it like a person who had lost her way maria exhibited the feeling of the schoolroom by raising her handkerchief in solemn silence to her eyes without taking notice of this demonstration carmina approached the parlour maid and said did you see miss minerva before she went away i took her message miss what message the message saying she wished to see my mistress for a few minutes well well miss i was told to show the governess into the library she went down with her bonnet on ready dressed to go out before she had been five minutes with my mistress she came out again and rang the hall bell and spoke to joseph 'my boxes are packed and directed' she says 'i will send for them in an hour's time good day joseph' and she stepped into the street as quietly as if she was going out shopping round the corner have the boxes been sent for yes miss carmina lifted her head and spoke in steadier tones where have they been taken to to the flower shop at the back to be kept till called for no other address none the last faint hope of tracing frances was at an end carmina turned wearily to leave the room zo called to her from the hearth rug always kind to the child she retraced her steps what is it she asked zo got on her legs before she spoke like a member of parliament i've been thinking about that governess she announced didn't i once tell you i was going to run away and wasn't it because of her hush here's the part of it i can't make out she's run away from me i don't bear malice i'm only glad in myself no more dirty nails no more bread and water for tea that's all good morning zo laid herself down again on the rug and the dog laid himself down again on zo carmina returned to her room to reflect on what she had heard from the parlour maid it was now plain that mrs gallilee had not been allowed the opportunity of dismissing her governess at a moment's notice miss minerva's sudden departure was unquestionably due to miss minerva herself thus far carmina was able to think clearly and no farther the confused sense of helpless distress which she had felt after reading the few farewell words that frances had addressed to her still oppressed her mind there were moments when she vaguely understood and bitterly lamented the motives which had animated her unhappy friend other moments followed when she impulsively resented the act which had thrown her on her own resources at the very time when she had most need of the encouragement that could be afforded by the sympathy of a firmer nature than her own she began to doubt the steadiness of her resolution without frances to take leave of her on the morning of the escape for the first time she was now tortured by distrust of ovid's reception of her by dread of his possible disapproval of her boldness by morbid suspicion even of his taking his mother's part bewildered and reckless she threw herself on the sofa her heart embittered against frances indifferent whether she lived or died at dinner time she sent a message begging to be excused from appearing at the table mrs gallilee at once presented herself harder and colder than ever to inspect the invalid perceiving no immediate necessity for summoning mr null she said ring if you want anything and left the room mr gallilee followed after an interval with a little surreptitious offering of wine hidden under his coat and with a selection of tarts crammed into his pocket smuggled goods my dear he whispered picked up when nobody happened to be looking my way when we are miserable has the idea ever occurred to you it's a sign from kind providence that we are intended to eat and drink the sherry's old and the pastry melts in your mouth shall i stay with you you would rather not just my feeling remarkable similarity in our opinions don't you think so yourself i'm sorry for poor miss minerva suppose you go to bed carmina was in no mood to profit by this excellent advice she was still walking restlessly up and down her room when the time came for shutting up the house with the sound of closing locks and bolts there was suddenly mingled a sharp ring at the bell followed by another unexpected event mr gallilee paid her a second visit in a state of transformation his fat face was flushed he positively looked as if he was capable of feeling strong emotion unconnected with champagne and the club he presented a telegram to carmina and when he spoke there were thrills of agitation in the tones of his piping voice my dear something very unpleasant has happened i met joseph taking this to my wife highly improper in my opinion what do you say yourself to take it to mrs gallilee when it's addressed to you it was no mistake he was so impudent as to say he had his orders i have reproved joseph mr gallilee looked astonished at himself when he made this latter statement then relapsed into his customary sweetness of temper no bad news he asked anxiously when carmina opened the telegram good news the best of good news she answered impetuously mr gallilee looked as happy as if the welcome telegram had been addressed to himself on his way out of the room he underwent another relapse the footman's audacious breach of trust began to trouble him once more this time in its relation to mrs gallilee the serious part of it was that the man had acted under his mistress's orders mr gallilee said he actually said without appealing to anybody if this happens again i shall be obliged to speak to my wife the telegram was from teresa it had been despatched from paris that evening and the message was thus expressed too tired to get on to england by to night's mail shall leave by the early train to morrow morning and be with you by six o'clock carmina's mind was exactly in the state to feel unmingled relief at the prospect of seeing the dear old friend of her happiest days she laid her head on the pillow that night without a thought of what might follow the event of teresa's return volume three chapter xlii the next day the important tuesday of the lecture on matter the delightful tuesday of teresa's arrival brought with it special demands on carmina's pen her first letter was addressed to frances it was frankly and earnestly written entreating miss minerva to appoint a place at which they might meet and assuring her in the most affectionate terms that she was still loved trusted and admired by her faithful friend helped by her steadier flow of spirits carmina could now see all that was worthiest of sympathy and admiration all that claimed loving submission and allowance from herself in the sacrifice to which miss minerva had submitted how bravely the poor governess had controlled the jealous misery that tortured her how nobly she had pronounced carmina's friendship for carmina's sake later in the day marceline took the letter to the flower shop and placed it herself under the cord of one of the boxes still waiting to be claimed the second letter filled many pages and occupied the remainder of the morning with the utmost delicacy but with perfect truthfulness at the same time carmina revealed to her betrothed husband the serious reasons which had forced her to withdraw herself from his mother's care bound to speak at last in her own defence she felt that concealments and compromises would be alike unworthy of ovid and of herself what she had already written to teresa she now wrote again with but one modification she expressed herself forbearingly towards ovid's mother the closing words of the letter were worthy of carmina's gentle just and generous nature you will perhaps say why do i only hear now of all that you have suffered my love i have longed to tell you of it i have even taken up my pen to begin but i thought of you and put it down again how selfish how cruel to hinder your recovery by causing you sorrow and suspense to bring you back perhaps to england before your health was restored i don't regret the effort that it has cost me to keep silence my only sorrow in writing to you is that i must speak of your mother in terms which may lower her in her son's estimation joseph brought the luncheon up to carmina's room the mistress was still at her studies the master had gone to his club as for the girls their only teacher for the present was the teacher of music when the ordeal of the lecture and the discussion had been passed mrs gallilee threatened to take miss minerva's place herself until a new governess could be found for once maria and zo showed a sisterly similarity in their feelings it was hard to say which of the two looked forward to her learned mother's instruction with the greatest terror carmina heard the pupils at the piano while she was eating her luncheon the profanation of music ceased when she went into the bedroom to get ready for her daily drive she took her letter duly closed and stamped downstairs with her to be sent to the post with the other letters of the day placed in the hall basket in the weakened state of her nerves the effort that she had made in writing to ovid had shaken her her heart beat uneasily her knees trembled as she descended the stairs arrived in sight of the hall she discovered a man walking slowly to and fro he turned towards her as she advanced and disclosed the detestable face of mr le frank the music master's last reserves of patience had come to an end watch for them as he might no opportunities had presented themselves of renewing his investigation in carmina's room in the interval that had passed his hungry suspicion of her had been left to feed on itself the motives for that incomprehensible attempt to make a friend of him remained hidden in as thick a darkness as ever victim of adverse circumstances he had determined with the greatest reluctance to take the straightforward course instead of secretly getting his information from carmina's journals and letters he was now reduced to openly applying for enlightenment to carmina herself occupying for the time being the position of an honourable man he presented himself at cruel disadvantage he was not master of his own glorious voice he was without the self possession indispensable to the perfect performance of his magnificent bow i have waited to have a word with you he began abruptly before you go out for your drive already unnerved even before she had seen him painfully conscious that she had committed a serious error on the last occasion when they had met in speaking at all carmina neither answered him nor looked at him she bent her head confusedly and advanced a little nearer to the house door he at once moved so as to place himself in her way i must request you to call to mind what passed between us he resumed when we met by accident some little time since he had speculated on frightening her his insolence stirred her spirit into asserting itself let me by if you please she said the carriage is waiting for me the carriage can wait a little longer he answered coarsely on the occasion to which i have referred you were so good as to make advances to which i cannot consider myself as having any claim perhaps you will favour me by stating your motives i don't understand you sir oh yes you do she stepped back and laid her hand on the bell which rang below stairs in the pantry must i ring she said it was plain that she would do it if he moved a step nearer to her he drew aside with a look which made her tremble on passing the hall table she placed her letter in the post basket his eye followed it as it left her hand he became suddenly penitent and polite i am sorry if i have alarmed you he said and opened the house door for her without showing himself to marceline and the coachman outside the carriage having been driven away he softly closed the door again and returned to the hall table he looked into the post basket was there any danger of discovery by the servants the footman was absent attending his mistress on her way to the lecture none of the female servants were on the stairs he took up carmina's letter and looked at the address to ovid vere esq his eyes twinkled furtively his excellent memory for injuries reminded him that ovid vere had formerly endeavoured without even caring to conceal it to prevent mrs gallilee from engaging him as her music master by subtle links of its own forging his vindictive nature now connected his hatred of the person to whom the letter was addressed with his interest in stealing the letter itself for the possible discovery of carmina's secrets the clock told him that there was plenty of time to open the envelope and if the contents proved to be of no importance to close it again and take it himself to the post after a last look round he withdrew undiscovered with the letter in his pocket on its way back to the house the carriage was passed by a cab with a man in it driven at such a furious rate that there was a narrow escape of collision the maid screamed carmina turned pale the coachman wondered why the man in the cab was in such a hurry the man was mr mool's head clerk charged with news for doctor benjulia chapter xliii the mind of the clerk's master had been troubled by serious doubts after carmina left his house on sunday her agitated manner her strange questions and her abrupt departure all suggested to mr mool's mind some rash project in contemplation perhaps even the plan of an elopement to most other men the obvious course to take would have been to communicate with mrs gallilee but the lawyer preserved a vivid remembrance of the interview which had taken place at his office the detestable pleasure which mrs gallilee had betrayed in profaning the memory of carmina's mother had so shocked and disgusted him that he recoiled from the idea of holding any further intercourse with her no matter how pressing the emergency might be it was possible after what had passed that carmina might feel the propriety of making some explanation by letter he decided to wait until the next morning on the chance of hearing from her on the monday no letter arrived proceeding to the office mr mool found in his business correspondence enough to occupy every moment of his time he had purposed writing to carmina but the idea was now inevitably pressed out of his mind it was only at the close of the day's work that he had leisure to think of a matter of greater importance that is to say of the necessity of discovering benjulia's friend of other days the italian teacher baccani he left instructions with one of his clerks to make inquiries the next morning at the shops of foreign booksellers there and there only the question might be answered whether baccani was still living and living in london the inquiries proved successful on tuesday afternoon baccani's address was in mr mool's hands busy as he still was the lawyer set aside his own affairs in deference to the sacred duty of defending the memory of the dead and to the pressing necessity of silencing mrs gallilee's cruel and slanderous tongue arrived at baccani's lodgings he was informed that the language master had gone to his dinner at a neighbouring restaurant mr mool waited at the lodgings and sent a note to baccani in ten minutes more he found himself in the presence of an elderly man of ascetic appearance whose looks and tones showed him to be apt to take offence on small provocation and more than half ready to suspect an eminent solicitor of being a spy but mr mool's experience was equal to the call on it having fully explained the object that he had in view he left the apology for his intrusion to be inferred and concluded by appealing in his own modest way to the sympathy of an honourable man silently forming his opinion of the lawyer while he listened baccani expressed the conclusion at which he had arrived in these terms my experience of mankind sir has been a bitterly bad one you have improved my opinion of human nature since you entered this room that is not a little thing to say at my age and in my circumstances he bowed gravely and turned to his bed from under it he pulled out a clumsy tin box having opened the rusty lock with some difficulty he produced a ragged pocket book and picked out from it a paper which looked like an old letter there he said handing the paper to mr mool is the statement which vindicates this lady's reputation before you open the manuscript i must tell you how i came by it he appeared to feel such embarrassment in approaching the subject that mr mool interposed i am already acquainted he said with some of the circumstances to which you are about to allude i happen to know of the wager in which the calumny originated and of the manner in which that wager was decided the events which followed are the only events that i need trouble you to describe baccani's grateful sense of relief avowed itself without reserve i feel your kindness he said almost as keenly as i feel my own disgraceful conduct in permitting a woman's reputation to be made the subject of a wager from whom did you obtain your information from the person who mentioned your name to me doctor benjulia baccani lifted his hand with a gesture of angry protest don't speak of him again in my presence he burst out that man has insulted me when i took refuge from political persecution in this country i sent him my prospectus from my own humble position as a teacher of languages i looked up without envy to his celebrity among doctors i thought i might remind him not unfavourably of our early friendship i who had done him a hundred kindnesses in those past days he has never taken the slightest notice of me he has not even acknowledged the receipt of my prospectus despicable wretch let me hear no more of him pray forgive me if i refer to him again for the last time mr mool pleaded did your acquaintance with him continue after the question of the wager had been settled no sir baccani answered sternly when i was at leisure to go to the club at which we were accustomed to meet he had left rome from that time to this i rejoice to say it i have never set eyes on him the obstacles which had prevented the refutation of the calumny from reaching benjulia were now revealed mr mool had only to hear next how that refutation had been obtained a polite hint sufficed to remind baccani of the explanation that he had promised i am naturally suspicious he began abruptly and i doubted the woman when i found that she kept her veil down besides it was not in my way of thinking to believe that an estimable married lady could have compromised herself with a scoundrel who had boasted that she was his mistress i waited in the street until the woman came out i followed her and saw her meet a man the two went together to a theatre i took my place near them she lifted her veil as a matter of course my suspicion of foul play was instantly confirmed when the performance was over i traced her back to mr robert graywell's house he and his wife were both absent at a party i was too indignant to wait till they came back under the threat of charging the wretch with stealing her mistress's clothes i extorted from her the signed confession which you have in your hand she was under notice to leave her place for insolent behaviour the personation which had been intended to deceive me was an act of revenge planned between herself and the blackguard who had employed her to make his lie look like truth a more shameless creature i never met with she said to me 'i am as tall as my mistress and a better figure and i've often worn her fine clothes on holiday occasions' in your country mr mool such women so i am told are ducked in a pond there is one thing more to add before you read the confession mrs robert graywell did imprudently send the man some money in answer to a begging letter artfully enough written to excite her pity a second application was refused by her husband what followed on that you know already having read the confession mr mool was permitted to take a copy and to make any use of it which he might think desirable his one remaining anxiety was to hear what had become of the person who had planned the deception surely he said that villain has not escaped punishment baccani answered this in his own bitter way my dear sir how can you ask such a simple question that sort of man always escapes punishment in the last extreme of poverty his luck provides him with somebody to cheat common respect for mrs robert graywell closed my lips and i was the only person acquainted with the circumstances i wrote to our club declaring the fellow to be a cheat and leaving it to be inferred that he cheated at cards he knew better than to insist on my explaining myself he resigned and disappeared i dare say he is living still living in clover on some unfortunate woman the beautiful and the good die untimely deaths he and his kind last and live mr mool had neither time nor inclination to plead in favour of the more hopeful view which believes in the agreeable fiction called poetical justice he tried to express his sense of obligation at parting baccani refused to listen the obligation is all on my side he said as i have already told you your visit has added a bright day to my calendar in our pilgrimage my friend through this world of rogues and fools we may never meet again let us remember gratefully that we have met farewell so they parted returning to his office mr mool attached to the copy of the confession a brief statement of the circumstances under which the italian had become possessed of it he then added these lines addressed to benjulia you set the false report afloat i leave it to your sense of duty to decide whether you ought not to go at once to mrs gallilee and tell her that the slander which you repeated is now proved to be a lie if you don't agree with me i must go to mrs gallilee myself in that case please return by the bearer the papers which are enclosed the clerk instructed to deliver these documents within the shortest possible space of time found mr mool waiting at the office on his return he answered his master's inquiries by producing benjulia's reply the doctor's amiable humour was still in the ascendant his success in torturing his unfortunate cook had been followed by the receipt of a telegram from his friend at montreal containing this satisfactory answer to his question not brain disease with his mind now set completely at rest his instincts as a gentleman were at full liberty to control him i entirely agree with you he wrote to mr mool i go back with your clerk the cab will drop me at mrs gallilee's house mr mool turned to the clerk did you wait to hear if mrs gallilee was at home he asked mrs gallilee was absent sir attending a lecture what did doctor benjulia do went into the house to wait her return chapter xliv mrs gallilee's page attending to the house door in the footman's absence had just shown benjulia into the library when there was another ring at the bell the new visitor was mr le frank he appeared to be in a hurry without any preliminary questions he said take my card to mrs gallilee my mistress is out sir the music master looked impatiently at the hall clock the hall clock answered him by striking the half hour after five do you expect mrs gallilee back soon we don't know sir the footman had his orders to be in waiting with the carriage at five after a moment of irritable reflection mr le frank took a letter from his pocket say that i have an appointment and am not able to wait give mrs gallilee that letter the moment she comes in with those directions he left the house the page looked at the letter it was sealed and over the address two underlined words were written private immediate mindful of visits from tradespeople anxious to see his mistress and provided beforehand with letters to be delivered immediately the boy took a pecuniary view of mr le frank's errand at the house another of them he thought wanting his money as he placed the letter on the hall table the library door opened and benjulia appeared weary already of waiting without occupation for mrs gallilee's return is smoking allowed in the library he asked the page looked up at the giant towering over him with the envious admiration of a short boy he replied with a discretion beyond his years would you please step into the smoking room sir anybody there my master sir benjulia at once declined the invitation to the smoking room anybody else at home he inquired miss carmina was upstairs the page answered and i think he added mr null is with her who's mr null the doctor sir benjulia declined to disturb the doctor he tried a third and last question where's zo here cried a shrill voice from the upper regions who are you to the page's astonishment the giant gentleman with the resonant bass voice answered this quite gravely i'm benjulia he said come up cried zo benjulia ascended the stairs stop shouted the voice from above benjulia stopped have you got your big stick yes bring it up with you benjulia retraced his steps into the hall the page respectfully handed him his stick zo became impatient look sharp she called out benjulia obediently quickened his pace zo left the schoolroom in spite of the faintly heard protest of the maid in charge to receive him on the stairs they met on the landing outside carmina's room zo possessed herself of the bamboo cane and led the way in carmina here's the big stick i told you about she announced whose stick dear zo returned to the landing come in benjulia she said and seized him by the coat tails mr null rose instinctively was this his celebrated colleague with some reluctance carmina appeared at the door thinking of the day when ovid had fainted and when the great man had treated her so harshly in fear of more rudeness she unwillingly asked him to come in still immovable on the landing he looked at her in silence the serious question occurred to him which had formerly presented itself to mr mool had mrs gallilee repeated in carmina's presence the lie which slandered her mother's memory the lie which he was then in the house to expose watching benjulia respectfully mr null saw in that grave scrutiny an opportunity of presenting himself under a favourable light he waved his hand persuasively towards carmina some nervous prostration sir in my interesting patient as you no doubt perceive he began not such rapid progress towards recovery as i had hoped i think of recommending the air of the seaside benjulia's dreary eyes turned on him slowly and estimated his mental calibre at its exact value in a moment mr null felt that look in the very marrow of his bones he bowed with servile submission and took his leave in the meantime benjulia had satisfied himself that the embarrassment in carmina's manner was merely attributable to shyness she was now no longer an object even of momentary interest to him he was ready to play with zo but not on condition of amusing himself with the child in carmina's presence i am waiting till mrs gallilee returns he said to her in his quietly indifferent way if you will excuse me i'll go downstairs again i won't intrude her pale face flushed as she listened to him innocently supposing that she had made her little offer of hospitality in too cold a manner she looked at benjulia with a timid and troubled smile pray wait here till my aunt comes back she said zo will amuse you i'm sure zo seconded the invitation by hiding the stick and laying hold again on her big friend's coattails he let the child drag him into the room without noticing her the silent questioning of his eyes had been again directed to carmina at the moment when she smiled his long and terrible experience made its own merciless discoveries in the nervous movement of her eyelids and her lips the poor girl pleasing herself with the idea of having produced the right impression on him at last had only succeeded in becoming an object of medical inquiry pursued in secret when he companionably took a chair by her side and let zo climb on his knee he was privately regretting his cold reception of mr null under certain conditions of nervous excitement carmina might furnish an interesting case if i had been commonly civil to that fawning idiot he thought i might have been called into consultation they were all three seated but there was no talk zo set the example you haven't tickled me yet she said show carmina how you do it he gravely operated on the back of zo's neck and his patient acknowledged the process with a wriggle and a scream the performance being so far at an end zo called to the dog and issued her orders once more now make tinker kick his leg benjulia obeyed once again the young tyrant was not satisfied yet now tickle carmina she said he heard this without laughing his fleshless lips never relaxed into a smile to carmina's unutterable embarrassment he looked at her when she laughed with steadier attention than ever those coldly inquiring eyes exercised some inscrutable influence over her now they made her angry and now they frightened her the silence that had fallen on them again became an unendurable infliction she burst into talk she was loud and familiar ashamed of her own boldness and quite unable to control it you are very fond of zo she said suddenly it was a perfectly commonplace remark and yet it seemed to perplex him am i he answered she went on against her own will she persisted in speaking to him and i'm sure zo is fond of you he looked at zo are you fond of me he asked zo staring hard at him got off his knee retired to a little distance to think and stood staring at him again he quietly repeated the question zo answered this time as she had formerly answered teresa in the gardens i don't know he turned again to carmina in a slow puzzled way i don't know either he said hearing the big man own that he was no wiser than herself zo returned to him without however getting on his knee again she clasped her chubby hands under the inspiration of a new idea let's play at something she said to benjulia do you know any games he shook his head didn't you know any games when you were only as big as me i have forgotten them haven't you got children no haven't you got a wife no haven't you got a friend no well you are a miserable chap thanks to zo carmina's sense of nervous oppression burst its way into relief she laughed loudly and wildly she was on the verge of hysterics when benjulia's eyes silently questioning her again controlled her at the critical moment her laughter died away but the exciting influence still possessed her still forced her into the other alternative of saying something she neither knew nor cared what i couldn't live such a lonely life as yours she said to him so loudly and so confidently that even zo noticed it i couldn't live such a life either he admitted but for one thing and what is that why are you so loud zo interposed do you think he's deaf benjulia made a sign commanding the child to be silent without turning towards her he answered carmina as if there had been no interruption my medical studies he said reconcile me to my life suppose you got tired of your studies she asked i should never get tired of them suppose you couldn't study any more in that case i shouldn't live any more do you mean that it would kill you to leave off no then what do you mean he laid his great soft fingers on her pulse she shrank from his touch he deliberately held her by the arm you're getting excited he said never mind what i mean zo left unnoticed and not liking it saw a chance of asserting herself i know why carmina's excited she said the old woman's coming at six o'clock he paid no attention to the child he persisted in keeping watch on carmina who is the woman he asked the most lovable woman in the world she cried my dear old nurse she started up from the sofa and pointed with theatrical exaggeration of gesture to the clock on the mantelpiece look it's only ten minutes to six in ten minutes i shall have my arms round teresa's neck don't look at me in that way it's your fault if i'm excited it's your dreadful eyes that do it come here zo i want to give you a kiss she seized on zo with a roughness that startled the child and looked wildly at benjulia ha you don't understand loving and kissing do you what's the use of speaking to you about my old nurse he pointed imperatively to the sofa sit down again she obeyed him but he had not quite composed her yet her eyes sparkled she went on talking ah you're a hard man a miserable man a man that will end badly you never loved anybody you don't know what love is what is it that icy question cooled her in an instant her head sank on her bosom she suddenly became indifferent to persons and things about her when will teresa come she whispered to herself oh when will teresa come any other man whether he really felt for her or not would as a mere matter of instinct have said a kind word to her at that moment not the vestige of a change appeared in benjulia's impenetrable composure she might have been a man or a baby or the picture of a girl instead of the girl herself so far as he was concerned he quietly returned to his question well he resumed and what is love not a word not a movement escaped her i want to know he persisted waiting for what might happen nothing happened he was not perplexed by the sudden change this is the reaction he thought we shall see what comes of it he looked about him a bottle of water stood on one of the tables likely to be useful he concluded in case she feels faint zo had been listening zo saw her way to getting noticed again not quite sure of herself this time she appealed to carmina didn't he say just now he wanted to know carmina neither heard nor heeded her zo tried benjulia next shall i tell you what we do in the schoolroom when we want to know his attention like carmina's attention seemed to be far away from her zo impatiently reminded him of her presence she laid her hand on his knee it was only the hand of a child an idle quaint perverse child but it touched ignorantly touched the one tender place in his nature unprofaned by the infernal cruelties which made his life acceptable to him the one tender place hidden so deep from the man himself that even his far reaching intellect groped in vain to find it out there nevertheless was the feeling which drew him to zo contending successfully with his medical interest in a case of nervous derangement that unintelligible sympathy with a child looked dimly out of his eyes spoke faintly in his voice when he replied to her well he said what do you do in the schoolroom we look in the dictionary zo answered carmina's got a dictionary i'll get it she climbed on a chair and found the book and laid it on benjulia's lap i don't so much mind trying to spell a word she explained what i hate is being asked what it means miss minerva won't let me off she says look i won't let you off i'm miss minerva and you're zo look he humoured her silently and mechanically just as he had humoured her in the matter of the stick and in the matter of the tickling having opened the dictionary he looked again at carmina she had not moved she seemed to be weary enough to fall asleep the reaction nothing but the reaction it might last for hours or it might be at an end in another minute an interesting temperament whichever way it ended he opened the dictionary love he muttered grimly to himself it seems i'm an object of compassion because i know nothing about love well what does the book say about it he found the word and ran his finger down the paragraphs of explanation which followed seven meanings to love he remarked first an affection of the mind excited by beauty and worth of any kind or by the qualities of an object which communicate pleasure second courtship third patriotism as the love of country fourth benevolence fifth the object beloved sixth a word of endearment seventh cupid the god of love he paused and reflected a little zo hearing nothing to amuse her strayed away to the window and looked out he glanced at carmina which of those meanings makes the pleasure of her life he wondered which of them might have made the pleasure of mine he closed the dictionary in contempt the very man whose business is to explain it tries seven different ways and doesn't explain it after all and yet there is such a thing he reached that conclusion unwillingly and angrily for the first time a doubt about himself forced its way into his mind might he have looked higher than his torture table and his knife had he gained from his life all that his life might have given to him left by herself zo began to grow tired of it she tried to get carmina for a companion come and look out of window she said carmina gently refused she was unwilling to be disturbed since she had spoken to benjulia her thoughts had been dwelling restfully on ovid in another day she might be on her way to him when would teresa come benjulia was too preoccupied to notice her the weak doubt that had got the better of his strong reason still held him in thrall love he broke out in the bitterness of his heart it isn't a question of sentiment it's a question of use who is the better for love she heard the last words and answered him everybody is the better for it she looked at him with sorrowful eyes and laid her hand on his arm everybody she added but you he smiled scornfully everybody is the better for it he repeated and who knows what it is she drew away her hand and looked towards the heavenly tranquillity of the evening sky who knows what it is he reiterated god she said benjulia was silent chapter xlv the clock on the mantelpiece struck six zo turning suddenly from the window ran to the sofa here's the carriage she cried teresa carmina exclaimed zo crossed the room on tiptoe to the door of the bed chamber it's mamma she said don't tell i'm going to hide why dear the answer to this was given mysteriously in a whisper she said i wasn't to come to you she's a quick one on her legs she might catch me on the stairs with that explanation zo slipped into the bedroom and held the door ajar the minutes passed and mrs gallilee failed to justify the opinion expressed by her daughter not a sound was audible on the stairs not a word more was uttered in the room benjulia had taken the child's place at the window he sat there thinking carmina had suggested to him some new ideas relating to the intricate connection between human faith and human happiness slowly slowly the clock recorded the lapse of minutes carmina's nervous anxiety began to forecast disaster to the absent nurse she took teresa's telegram from her pocket and consulted it again there was no mistake six o'clock was the time named for the traveller's arrival and it was close on ten minutes past the hour in her ignorance of railway arrangements she took it for granted that trains were punctual but her reading had told her that trains were subject to accident i suppose delays occur she said to benjulia without danger to the passengers before he could answer mrs gallilee suddenly entered the room she had opened the door so softly that she took them both by surprise to carmina's excited imagination she glided into their presence like a ghost her look and manner showed serious agitation desperately suppressed in certain places the paint and powder on her face had cracked and revealed the furrows and wrinkles beneath her hard eyes glittered her laboured breathing was audible indifferent to all demonstrations of emotion which did not scientifically concern him benjulia quietly rose and advanced towards her she seemed to be unconscious of his presence he spoke allowing her to ignore him without troubling himself to notice her temper when you are able to attend to me i want to speak to you shall i wait downstairs he took his hat and stick to leave the room looked at carmina as he passed her and at once went back to his place at the window her aunt's silent and sinister entrance had frightened her benjulia waited in the interests of physiology to see how the new nervous excitement would end thus far mrs gallilee had kept one of her hands hidden behind her she advanced close to carmina and allowed her hand to be seen it held an open letter she shook the letter in her niece's face in the position which mrs gallilee now occupied carmina was hidden for the moment from benjulia's view biding his time at the window he looked out a cab with luggage on it had just drawn up at the house was this the old nurse who had been expected to arrive at six o'clock the footman came out to open the cab door he was followed by mr gallilee eager to help the person inside to alight the traveller proved to be a grey headed woman shabbily dressed mr gallilee cordially shook hands with her patted her on the shoulder gave her his arm led her into the house the cab with the luggage on it remained at the door the nurse had evidently not reached the end of her journey yet carmina shrank back on the sofa when the leaves of the letter touched her face mrs gallilee's first words were now spoken in a whisper the inner fury of her anger struggling for a vent began to get the better of her she gasped for breath and speech do you know this letter she said carmina looked at the writing it was the letter to ovid which she had placed in the post basket that afternoon the letter which declared that she could no longer endure his mother's cold blooded cruelty and that she only waited teresa's arrival to join him at quebec after one dreadful moment of confusion her mind realised the outrage implied in the stealing and reading of her letter in the earlier time of carmina's sojourn in the house mrs gallilee had accused her of deliberate deceit she had instantly resented the insult by leaving the room the same spirit in her the finely strung spirit that vibrates unfelt in gentle natures while they live in peace steadied those quivering nerves roused that failing courage she met the furious eyes fixed on her without shrinking she spoke gravely and firmly the letter is mine she said how did you come by it how dare you ask me how dare you steal my letter mrs gallilee tore open the fastening of her dress at the throat to get breath you impudent bastard she burst out in a frenzy of rage waiting patiently at the window benjulia heard her hold your damned tongue he cried she's your niece mrs gallilee turned on him her fury broke into a screaming laugh my niece she repeated you lie and you know it she's the child of an adulteress she's the child of her mother's lover the door opened as those horrible words passed her lips the nurse and her husband entered the room she was in no position to see them she was incapable of hearing them the demon in her urged her on she attempted to reiterate the detestable falsehood her first word died away in silence the lean brown fingers of the italian woman had her by the throat held her as the claws of a tigress might have held her her eyes rolled in the mute agony of an appeal for help in vain in vain not a cry not a sound had drawn attention to the attack her husband's eyes were fixed horror struck on the victim of her rage benjulia had crossed the room to the sofa when carmina heard the words spoken of her mother from that moment he was watching the case mr gallilee alone looked round when the nurse tightened her hold in a last merciless grasp dashed the insensible woman on the floor and turning back fell on her knees at her darling's feet she looked up in carmina's face a ghastly stare through half closed eyes showed death in life blankly returning her look the shock had struck carmina with a stony calm she had not started she had not swooned rigid immovable there she sat voiceless and tearless insensible even to touch her arms hanging down her clenched hands resting on either side of her teresa grovelled and groaned at her feet those ferocious hands that had laid the slanderer prostrate on the floor feebly beat her bosom and her gray head oh saints beloved of god oh blessed virgin mother of christ spare my child my sweet child she rose in wild despair she seized benjulia and madly shook him who are you how dare you touch her give her to me or i'll be the death of you oh my carmina is it sleep that holds you wake wake wake listen to me said benjulia sternly she dropped on the sofa by carmina's side and lifted one of the cold clenched hands to her lips the tears fell slowly over her haggard face i am very fond of her sir she said humbly i'm only an old woman see what a dreadful welcome my child gives to me it's hard on an old woman hard on an old woman his self possession was not disturbed even by this do you know what i am he asked i am a doctor leave her to me he's a doctor that's good a doctor's good yes yes does the old man know this doctor the kind old man she looked vacantly for mr gallilee he was bending over his wife sprinkling water on her deathly face teresa got on her feet and pointed to mrs gallilee the breath of that she devil poisons the air she said i must take my child out of it to my place sir if you please only to my place she attempted to lift carmina from the sofa and drew back breathlessly watching her her rigid face faintly relaxed her eyelids closed and quivered mr gallilee looked up from his wife will one of you help me he asked his tone struck benjulia it was the hushed tone of sorrow no more i'll see to it directly with that reply benjulia turned to teresa where is your place he said far or near the message she answered confusedly the message says she signed to him to look in her hand bag dropped on the floor he found carmina's telegram containing the address of the lodgings the house was close by after some consideration he sent the nurse into the bedroom with instructions to bring him the blankets off the bed in the minute that followed he examined mrs gallilee there's nothing to be frightened about let her maid attend to her mr gallilee again surprised benjulia he turned from his wife and looked at carmina for god's sake don't leave her here he broke out after what she has heard this house is no place for her give her to the old nurse benjulia only answered as he had answered already i'll see to it mr gallilee persisted is there any risk in moving her he asked it's the least of two risks no more questions look to your wife mr gallilee obeyed in silence when he lifted his head again and rose to ring the bell for the maid the room was silent and lonely a little pale frightened face peeped out through the bedroom door zo ventured in her father caught her in his arms and kissed her as he had never kissed her yet his eyes were wet with tears zo noticed that he never said a word about mamma the child saw the change in her father as benjulia had seen it she shared one human feeling with her big friend she too was surprised chapter xlvi the first signs of reviving life had begun to appear when marceline answered the bell in a few minutes more it was possible to raise mrs gallilee and to place her on the sofa having so far assisted the servant mr gallilee took zo by the hand and drew back daunted by the terrible scene which she had witnessed from her hiding place the child stood by her father's side in silence the two waited together watching mrs gallilee she looked wildly round the room discovering that she was alone with the members of her family she became composed her mind slowly recovered its balance her first thought was for herself has that woman disfigured me she said to the maid knowing nothing of what had happened marceline was at a loss to understand her bring me a glass she said the maid found a hand glass in the bedroom and presented it to her she looked at herself and drew a long breath of relief that first anxiety at an end she spoke to her husband where is carmina out of the house thank god the answer seemed to bewilder her she appealed to marceline did he say thank god yes ma'am can you tell me nothing who knows where carmina has gone joseph knows ma'am he heard dr benjulia give the address to the cabman with that answer she turned anxiously to her master is miss carmina seriously ill sir her mistress spoke again before mr gallilee could reply marceline send joseph up here no said mr gallilee his wife eyed him with astonishment why not she asked he said quietly i forbid it mrs gallilee addressed herself to the maid go to my room and bring me another bonnet and a veil stop she tried to rise and sank back i must have something to strengthen me get the sal volatile marceline left the room mr gallilee followed her as far as the door still leading his little daughter go back my dear to your sister in the schoolroom he said i am distressed zo be a good girl and you will console me say the same to maria it will be dull for you i am afraid be patient my child and try to bear it for a while may i whisper something said zo will carmina die god forbid will they bring her back here in her eagerness the child spoke above a whisper mrs gallilee heard the question and answered it they will bring carmina back she said the moment i can get out zo looked at her father do you say that she asked he shook his head gravely and told her again to go to the schoolroom on the first landing she stopped and looked back i'll be good papa she said and went on up the stairs having reached the schoolroom she became the object of many questions not one of which she answered followed by the dog she sat down in a corner what are you thinking about her sister inquired this time she was willing to reply i'm thinking about carmina mr gallilee closed the door when zo left him he took a chair without speaking to his wife or looking at her what are you here for she asked i must wait he said what for to see what you do marceline returned and administered a dose of sal volatile strengthened by the stimulant mrs gallilee was able to rise my head is giddy she said as she took the maid's arm but i think i can get downstairs with your help mr gallilee silently followed them out at the head of the stairs the giddiness increased firm as her resolution might be it gave way before the bodily injury which mrs gallilee had received her husband's help was again needed to take her to her bedroom she stopped them at the ante chamber still obstinately bent on following her own designs i shall be better directly she said put me on the sofa marceline relieved her of her bonnet and veil and asked respectfully if there was any other service required she looked defiantly at her husband and reiterated the order send for joseph intelligent resolution is sometimes shaken the inert obstinacy of a weak creature man or animal is immovable mr gallilee dismissed the maid with these words you needn't wait my good girl i'll speak to joseph myself downstairs his wife heard him with amazement and contempt are you in your right senses she asked he paused on his way out you were always hard and headstrong he said sadly i knew that a cleverer man than i am might i suppose it's possible a clear headed man might have found out how wicked you are she lay thinking indifferent to anything he could say to her are you not ashamed he asked wonderingly and not even sorry she paid no heed to him he left her descending to the hall he was met by joseph doctor benjulia has come back sir he wishes to see you where is he in the library wait joseph i have something to say to you if your mistress asks where they have taken miss carmina you mustn't this is my order joseph you mustn't tell her if you have mentioned it to any of the other servants it's quite likely they may have asked you isn't it he said falling into his old habit for a moment if you have mentioned it to the others he resumed they mustn't tell her that's all my good man that's all to his own surprise joseph found himself regarding his master with a feeling of respect mr gallilee entered the library how is she he asked eager for news of carmina the worse for being moved benjulia replied what about your wife answering that question mr gallilee mentioned the precautions that he had taken to keep the secret of teresa's address you need be under no anxiety about that said benjulia i have left orders that mrs gallilee is not to be admitted there is a serious necessity for keeping her out in these cases of partial catalepsy there is no saying when the change may come when it does come i won't answer for her niece's reason if those two see each other again send for you own medical man the girl is his patient and he is the person on whom the responsibility rests let the servant take my card to him directly we can meet in consultation at the house he wrote a line on one of his visiting cards it was at once sent to mr null there's another matter to be settled before i go benjulia proceeded here are some papers which i have received from your lawyer mr moot they relate to a slander which your wife unfortunately repeated mr gallilee got up from his chair don't take my mind back to that pray don't he pleaded earnestly i can't bear it doctor benjulia i can't bear it please to excuse my rudeness it isn't intentional i don't know myself what's the matter with me i've always led a quiet life sir i'm not fit for such things as these don't suppose i speak selfishly i'll do what i can if you will kindly spare me he might as well have appealed to the sympathy of the table at which they were sitting benjulia was absolutely incapable of understanding the state of mind which those words revealed can you take these papers to your wife he asked i called here this evening being the person to blame to set the matter right as it is i leave her to make the discovery for herself i desire to hold no more communication with your wife have you anything to say to me before i go only one thing is there any harm in my calling at the house to ask how poor carmina goes on ask as often as you like provided mrs gallilee doesn't accompany you if she's obstinate it may not be amiss to give your wife a word of warning in my opinion the old nurse is not likely to let her off next time with her life i've had a little talk with that curious foreign savage i said 'you have committed what we consider in england a murderous assault if mrs gallilee doesn't mind the public exposure you may find yourself in a prison' she snapped her fingers in my face 'suppose i find myself with the hangman's rope round my neck' she said 'what do i care so long as carmina is safe from her aunt' after that pretty answer she sat down by her girl's bedside and burst out crying mr gallilee listened absently his mind still dwelt on carmina i meant well he said when i asked you to take her out of this house it's no wonder if i was wrong what i am too stupid to understand is why you allowed her to be moved benjulia listened with a grim smile mr gallilee's presumption amused him i wonder whether there was any room left for memory when nature furnished your narrow little head he answered pleasantly didn't i say that moving her was the least of two risks and haven't i just warned you of what might have happened if we had left your wife and her niece together in the same house when i do a thing at my time of life mr gallilee don't think me conceited i know why i do it while he was speaking of himself in these terms he might have said something more he might have added that his dread of the loss of carmina's reason really meant his dread of a commonplace termination to an exceptionally interesting case he might also have acknowledged that he was not yielding obedience to the rules of professional etiquette in confiding the patient to her regular medical attendant but following the selfish suggestions of his own critical judgment his experience brief as it had been had satisfied him that stupid mr null's course of action could be trusted to let the instructive progress of the malady proceed mr null would treat the symptoms in perfect good faith without a suspicion of the nervous hysteria which in such a constitution as carmina's threatened to establish itself in course of time as the hidden cause these motives not only excused but even ennobled by their scientific connection with the interests of medical research he might have avowed under more favourable circumstances while his grand discovery was still barely within reach doctor benjulia stood committed to a system of diplomatic reserve which even included simple mr gallilee he took his hat and stick and walked out into the hall can i be of further use he asked carelessly you will hear about the patient from mr null you won't desert carmina said mr gallilee you will see her yourself from time to time won't you don't be afraid i'll look after her he spoke sincerely in saying this carmina's case had already suggested new ideas even the civilised savage of modern physiology where his own interests are concerned is not absolutely insensible to a feeling of gratitude mr gallilee opened the door for him by the bye he added as he stepped out what's become of zo she's upstairs in the schoolroom he made one of his dreary jokes tell her when she wants to be tickled again to let me know good evening mr gallilee returned to the upper part of the house with the papers left by benjulia in his hand arriving at the dressing room door he hesitated the papers were enclosed in a sealed envelope addressed to his wife secured in this way from inquisitive eyes there was no necessity for personally presenting them he went on to the schoolroom and beckoned to the parlour maid to come out and speak to him having instructed her to deliver the papers telling her mistress that they had been left at the house by doctor benjulia he dismissed the woman from duty you needn't return he said i'll look after the children myself maria was busy with her book and even idle zo was employed she was writing at her own inky desk and she looked up in confusion when her father appeared unsuspicious mr gallilee took if for granted that his favourite daughter was employed on a writing lesson following maria's industrious example for once good children he said looking affectionately from one to the other i won't disturb you go on he took a chair satisfied comforted even to be in the same room with the girls if he had placed himself nearer to the desk he might have seen that zo had been thinking of carmina to some purpose what could she do to make her friend and playfellow well and happy again there was the question which zo asked herself after having seen carmina carried insensible out of the room possessed of that wonderful capacity for minute observation of the elder persons about them which is one among the many baffling mysteries presented by the minds of children zo had long since discovered that the member of the household preferred to all others by carmina was the good brother who had gone away and left them in his absence she was always talking of him and zo had seen her kiss his photograph before she put it back in the case dwelling on these recollections the child's slowly working mental process arrived more easily than usual at the right conclusion the way to make carmina well and happy again was to bring ovid back one of the two envelopes which he had directed for her still remained waiting for the letter which might say to him come home zo determined to write that letter and to do it at once she might have confided this design to her father the one person besides carmina who neither scolded her nor laughed at her if mr gallilee had distinguished himself by his masterful position in the house but she had seen him as everybody else had seen him afraid of mamma the doubt whether he might not tell mamma decided her on keeping her secret as the event proved the one person who informed ovid of the terrible necessity that existed for his return was the little sister whom it had been his last kind effort to console when he left england when mr gallilee entered the room zo had just reached the end of her letter her system of composition excluded capitals and stops and reduced all the words in the english language by a simple process of abridgment to words of one syllable dear ov you come back car is ill she wants you be quick be quick don't say i writ this miss min is gone i hate books i like you zo with the pen still in her hand the wary writer looked round at her father she had her directed envelope sadly crumpled in her pocket but she was afraid to take it out maria she thought would know what to do in my place horrid maria fortune using the affairs of the household as an instrument befriended zo in a minute more her opportunity arrived the parlour maid unexpectedly returned she addressed mr gallilee with the air of mystery in which english servants in possession of a message especially delight if you please sir joseph wishes to speak to you where is he outside sir tell him to come in thanks to the etiquette of the servants' hall which did not permit joseph to present himself voluntarily in the regions above the drawing room without being first represented by an ambassadress attention was now diverted from the children zo folded her letter enclosed it in the envelope and hid it in her pocket joseph appeared i beg your pardon sir i don't quite know whether i ought to disturb my mistress mr le frank has called and asked if he can see her mr gallilee consulted the parlour maid was your mistress asleep when i sent you to her no sir she told me to bring her a cup of tea on those rare former occasions when mrs gallilee had been ill her attentive husband never left it to the servants to consult her wishes that time had gone by for ever tell your mistress joseph that mr le frank is here chapter xlvii the slander on which mrs gallilee had reckoned as a means of separating ovid and carmina was now a slander refuted by unanswerable proof and the man whose exertions had achieved this result was her own lawyer the agent whom she had designed to employ in asserting that claim of the guardian over the ward which teresa had defied as a necessary consequence the relations between mr mool and herself were already at an end there she lay helpless her authority set at naught her person outraged by a brutal attack there she lay urged to action by every reason that a resolute woman could have for asserting her power and avenging her wrong without a creature to take her part without an accomplice to serve her purpose she got on her feet with the resolution of despair her heart sank the room whirled round her she dropped back on the sofa in a recumbent position the giddiness subsided she could ring the hand bell on the table at her side send instantly for mr null she said to the maid if he is out let the messenger follow him wherever he may be the messenger came back with a note mr null would call on mrs gallilee as soon as possible he was then engaged in attendance on miss carmina at that discovery mrs gallilee's last reserves of independent resolution gave way the services of her own medical attendant were only at her disposal when carmina had done with him at the top of his letter the address which she had thus far tried vainly to discover stared her in the face the house was within five minutes' walk and she was not even able to cross the room for the first time in her life mrs gallilee's imperious spirit acknowledged defeat for the first time in her life she asked herself the despicable question who can i find to help me someone knocked at the door who is it she cried joseph's voice answered her mr le frank has called ma'am and wishes to know if you can see him she never stopped to think she never even sent for the maid to see to her personal appearance the horror of her own helplessness drove her on here was the man whose timely betrayal of carmina had stopped her on her way to ovid in the nick of time here was the self devoted instrument waiting to be employed i'll see mr le frank she said show him up the music master looked round the obscurely lit room and bowed to the recumbent figure on the sofa i fear i disturb you madam at an inconvenient time i am suffering from illness mr le frank but i am able to receive you as you see she stopped there now when she saw him and heard him some perverse hesitation in her began to doubt him now when it was too late she weakly tried to put herself on her guard what a decay of energy she felt it herself in the ready and resolute woman equal to any emergency at other times to what am i to attribute the favour of your visit she resumed even her voice failed her it faltered in spite of her efforts to steady it mr le frank's vanity drew its own encouraging conclusion from this one circumstance i am anxious to know how i stand in your estimation he replied early this evening i left a few lines here enclosing a letter with my compliments have you received the letter yes have you read it mrs gallilee hesitated mr le frank smiled i won't trouble you madam for any more direct reply he said i will speak plainly be so good as to tell me plainly on your side which i am a man who has disgraced himself by stealing a letter or a man who has distinguished himself by doing you a service an unpleasant alternative neatly defined to disavow mr le frank or to use mr le frank there was the case for mrs gallilee's consideration she was incapable of pronouncing judgment the mere effort of decision after what she had suffered fatigued and irritated her i can't deny she said with weary resignation that you have done me a service he rose and made a generous return for the confidence that had been placed in him he repeated his magnificent bow and sat down again our position towards each other seems too plain to be mistaken he proceeded your niece's letter perfectly useless for the purpose with which i opened it offers me a means of being even with miss carmina and a chance of being useful to you shall i begin by keeping an eye on the young lady is that said mr le frank out of devotion to me my devotion to you might wear out he answered audaciously you may trust my feeling towards your niece to last i never forget an injury is it indiscreet to inquire how you mean to keep miss carmina from joining her lover in quebec does a guardian's authority extend to locking her up in her room mrs gallilee felt the underlying familiarity in these questions elaborately concealed as it was under an assumption of respect my niece is no longer in my house she answered coldly gone cried mr le frank she corrected the expression removed she said and dropped the subject there mr le frank took the subject up again removed i presume under the care of her nurse he rejoined the nurse what did he know about the nurse may i ask mrs gallilee began he smiled indulgently and stopped her there you are not quite yourself to night he said permit me to remind you that your niece's letter to mr ovid vere is explicit and that i took the liberty of reading it before i left it at your house mrs gallilee listened in silence conscious that she had committed another error she had carefully excluded from her confidence a man who was already in possession of her secrets mr le frank's courteous sympathy forbade him to take advantage of the position of superiority which he now held i will do myself the honour of calling again he said when you are better able to place the right estimate on my humble offers of service i wouldn't fatigue you mrs gallilee for the world at the same time permit me to put one last question which ought not to be delayed when miss carmina left you did she take away her writing desk and her keys no allow me to suggest that she may send for them at any moment before it was possible to ask for an explanation joseph presented himself again mr null was waiting downstairs mrs gallilee arranged that he should be admitted when she rang her bell mr le frank approached the sofa when they were alone and returned to his suggestion in a whisper surely you see the importance of using your niece's keys he resumed we don't know what correspondence may have been going on in which the nurse and the governess have been concerned after we have already intercepted a letter hesitation is absurd you are not equal to the effort yourself i know the room don't be afraid of discovery i have a naturally soft footfall and my excuse is ready if somebody else has a soft footfall too leave it to me he lit a candle as he spoke but for that allusion to the nurse mrs gallilee might have ordered him to blow it out again eager for any discovery which might by the barest possibility place teresa at her mercy she silently submitted to mr le frank i'll call to morrow he said and slipped out of the room when mr null was announced mrs gallilee pushed up the shade over the globe of the lamp her medical attendant's face might be worth observing under a clear light his timid look his confused manner when he made the conventional apologies told her at once that teresa had spoken and that he knew what had happened even he had never before been so soothing and so attentive but he forgot or he was afraid to consult appearances by asking what was the matter before he felt the pulse and took the temperature and wrote his prescription not a word was uttered by mrs gallilee until the medical formalities came to an end is there anything more that i can do he asked you can tell me she said when i shall be well again mr null was polite mr null was sympathetic mrs gallilee might be herself again in a day or two or mrs gallilee might be unhappily confined to her room for some little time he had hope in his prescription and hope in perfect quiet and repose he would suggest the propriety of going to bed at once and would not fail to call early the next morning sit down again said mrs gallilee mr null turned pale he foresaw what was coming you have been in attendance on miss carmina i wish to know what her illness is mr null began to prevaricate at the outset the case causes us serious anxiety the complications are formidable doctor benjulia himself in plain words mr null can she be moved this produced a definite answer quite impossible she only ventured to put her next question after waiting a little to control herself is that foreign woman the nurse the only nurse in attendance don't speak of her mrs gallilee a dreadful woman coarse furious a perfect savage when i suggested a second nurse i understand you asked just now if you could do anything for me you can do me a great service you can recommend me a trustworthy lawyer mr null was surprised as the old medical attendant of the family he was not unacquainted with the legal adviser he mentioned mr mool's name mr mool has forfeited my confidence mrs gallilee announced can you or can you not recommend a lawyer oh certainly my own lawyer you will find writing materials on the table behind me i won't keep you more than five minutes i want you to write from my dictation my dear lady in your present condition do as i tell you my head is quiet while i lie down even a woman in my condition can say what she means to do i shall not close my eyes tonight unless i can feel that i have put that wretch in her right place who are your lawyers mr null mentioned the names and took up his pen introduce me in the customary form mrs gallilee proceeded and then refer the lawyers to my brother's will is it done in due time it was done tell them next how my niece has been taken away from me and where she has been taken to to the best of his ability mr null complied now said mrs gallilee write what i mean to do the prospect of being revenged on teresa revived her for the moment at least she almost looked like herself again mr null turned over to a new leaf with a hand that trembled a little the dictating voice pronounced these words i forbid the woman teresa to act in the capacity of nurse to miss carmina and even to enter the room in which that young lady is now lying ill i further warn this person that my niece will be restored to my care the moment her medical attendants allow her to be removed and i desire my legal advisers to assert my authority as guardian to morrow morning mr null finished his task in silent dismay he took out his handkerchief and wiped his forehead is there any very terrible effort required in saying those few words even to a shattered creature like me mrs gallilee asked bitterly let me hear that the lawyers have got their instructions when you come to morrow and give me the name and address of a nurse whom you can thoroughly recommend good night at last mr null got away as he softly closed the dressing room door the serious question still dwelt on his mind what would teresa do chapter xlviii even in the welcome retirement of the school room mr gallilee's mind was not at ease he was troubled by a question entirely new to him the question of himself in the character of husband and father accustomed through long years of conjugal association to look up to his wife as a superior creature he was now conscious that her place in his estimation had been lost beyond recovery if he considered next what ought to be done with maria and zo he only renewed his perplexity and distress to leave them as he had hitherto left them absolutely submitted to their mother's authority was to resign his children to the influence of a woman who had ceased to be the object of his confidence and respect he pondered over it in the schoolroom he pondered over it when he went to bed on the next morning he arrived at a conclusion in the nature of a compromise he decided on applying to his good friend mr mool for a word of advice his first proceeding was to call at teresa's lodgings in the hope of hearing better news of carmina the melancholy report of her was expressed in two words no change he was so distressed that he asked to see the landlady and tried in his own helpless kindhearted way to get a little hopeful information by asking questions useless questions repeated over and over again in futile changes of words the landlady was patient she respected the undisguised grief of the gentle modest old man but she held to the hard truth the one possible answer was the answer which her servant had already given when she followed him out to open the door mr gallilee requested permission to wait a moment in the hall if you will allow me ma'am i'll wipe my eyes before i go into the street arriving at the office without an appointment he found the lawyer engaged a clerk presented to him a slip of paper with a line written by mr mool is it anything of importance simple mr gallilee wrote back oh dear no it's only me i'll call again besides his critical judgment in the matter of champagne this excellent man possessed another accomplishment a beautiful handwriting mr mool discovering a crooked line and some ill formed letters in the reply drew his own conclusions he sent word to his old friend to wait in ten minutes more they were together and the lawyer was informed of the events that had followed the visit of benjulia to fairfield gardens on the previous day for a while the two men sat silently meditating daunted by the prospect before them when the time came for speaking they exercised an influence over each other of which both were alike unconscious out of their common horror of mrs gallilee's conduct and their common interest in carmina they innocently achieved between them the creation of one resolute man my dear gallilee this is a very serious thing my dear mool i feel it so or i shouldn't have disturbed you don't talk of disturbing me i see so many complications ahead of us i hardly know where to begin just my case it's a comfort to me that you feel it as i do mr mool rose and tried walking up and down his room as a means of stimulating his ingenuity there's this poor young lady he resumed if she gets better don't put it in that way mr gallilee interposed it sounds as if you doubted her ever getting well you see it yourself in that light don't you be a little more positive mool in mercy to me by all means mr mool agreed let us say when she gets better but the difficulty meets us all the same if mrs gallilee claims her right what are we to do mr gallilee rose in his turn and took a walk up and down the room that well meant experiment only left him feebler than ever what possessed her brother to make her carmina's guardian he asked with the nearest approach to irritability of which he was capable the lawyer was busy with his own thoughts he only enlightened mr gallilee after the question had been repeated i had the sincerest regard for mr robert graywell he said a better husband and father and don't let me forget it a more charming artist never lived but said mr mool with the air of one strong minded man appealing to another weak sadly weak if you will allow me to say so your wife's self asserting way well it was so unlike her brother's way that it had its effect on him if lady northlake had been a little less quiet and retiring the matter might have ended in a very different manner as it was i don't wish to put the case offensively mrs gallilee imposed on him and there she is in authority under the will let that be we must protect this poor girl we must act cried mr mool with a burst of energy we must act mr gallilee repeated and feebly clenched his fist and softly struck the table i think i have an idea the lawyer proceeded suggested by something said to me by miss carmina herself may i ask if you are in her confidence mr gallilee's face brightened at this certainly he answered i always kiss her when we say good night and kiss her again when we say good morning this proof of his friend's claims as carmina's chosen adviser seemed rather to surprise mr mool did she ever hint at an idea of hastening her marriage he inquired plainly as the question was put it thoroughly puzzled mr gallilee his honest face answered for him he was not in carmina's confidence mr mool returned to his idea the one thing we can do he said is to hasten mr ovid's return there is the only course to take as i see it let's do it at once cried mr gallilee but tell me mr mool insisted greedy for encouragement does my suggestion relieve your mind it's the first happy moment i've had to day mr gallilee's weak voice piped high he was getting firmer and firmer with every word he uttered one of them produced a telegraph form the other seized a pen shall we send the message in your name mr mool asked if mr gallilee had possessed a hundred names he would have sent them and paid for them all john gallilee fairfield gardens london to there the pen stopped ovid was still in the wilds of canada the one way of communicating with him was through the medium of the bankers at quebec to the bankers accordingly the message was sent please telegraph mr ovid vere's address the moment you know it when the telegram had been sent to the office an interval of inaction followed mr gallilee's fortitude suffered a relapse it's a long time to wait he said his friend agreed with him morally speaking mr mool's strength lay in points of law no point of law appeared to be involved in the present conference he shared mr gallilee's depression of spirits we are quite helpless he remarked till mr ovid comes back in the interval i see no choice for miss carmina but to submit to her guardian unless he looked hard at mr gallilee before he finished his sentence unless he resumed you can get over your present feeling about your wife get over it mr gallilee repeated it seems quite impossible now i dare say the worthy lawyer admitted a very painful impression has been produced on you naturally naturally but the force of habit a married life of many years your own kind feeling what do you mean asked mr gallilee bewildered impatient almost angry a little persuasion on your part my good friend at the interesting moment of reconciliation might be followed by excellent results mrs gallilee might not object to waive her claims until time has softened existing asperities surely a compromise is possible if you could only prevail on yourself to forgive your wife forgive her i should be only too glad to forgive her cried mr gallilee bursting into violent agitation how am i to do it good god mool how am i to do it you didn't hear those infamous words you didn't see that dreadful death struck look of the poor girl i declare to you i turn cold when i think of my wife i can't go to her when i ought to go i send the servants into her room my children too my dear good children it's enough to break one's heart think of their being brought up by a mother who could say what she said and do what will they see i ask you what will they see if she gets carmina back in the house and treats that sweet young creature as she will treat her there were times last night when i thought of going away for ever lord knows where and taking the girls with me what am i talking about i had something to say and i don't know what it is i don't know my own self there there i'll keep quiet it's my poor stupid head i suppose hot mool burning hot let's be reasonable yes yes yes let's be reasonable you're a lawyer i said to myself when i came here 'i want mool's advice' be a dear good fellow set my mind at ease oh my friend my old friend what can i do for my children amazed and distressed utterly at a loss how to interfere to any good purpose mr mool recovered his presence of mind the moment mr gallilee appealed to him in his legal capacity don't distress yourself about your children he said kindly thank god we stand on firm ground there do you mean it mool i mean it where your daughters are concerned the authority is yours be firm gallilee be firm i will you set me the example don't you you're firm eh firm as a rock i agree with you for the present at least the children must be removed at once mool at once the lawyer repeated they had wrought each other up to the right pitch of resolution by this time they were almost loud enough for the clerks to hear them in the office no matter what my wife may say mr gallilee stipulated no matter what she may say mr mool rejoined the father is master and you know the law and i know the law you have only to assert yourself and you have only to back me for your children's sake gallilee under my lawyer's advice mool the one resolute man was produced at last without a flaw in him anywhere they were both exhausted by the effort mr mool suggested a glass of wine mr gallilee ventured on a hint you don't happen to have a drop of champagne handy he said the lawyer rang for his housekeeper in five minutes they were pledging each other in foaming tumblers in five minutes more they plunged back into business the question of the best place to which the children could be removed was easily settled mr mool offered his own house acknowledging modestly that it had perhaps one drawback it was within easy reach of mrs gallilee the statement of this objection stimulated his friend's memory lady northlake was in scotland lady northlake had invited maria and zo over and over again to pass the autumn with their cousins but mrs gallilee's jealousy had always contrived to find some plausible reason for refusal write at once mr mool advised you may do it in two lines your wife is ill miss carmina is ill you are not able to leave london and the children are pining for fresh air in this sense mr gallilee wrote he insisted on having the letter sent to the post immediately i know it's long before post time he explained but i want to compose my mind the lawyer paused with his glass of wine at his lips i say you're not hesitating already no more than you are mr gallilee answered you will really send the girls away the girls shall go on the day when lady northlake invites them i'll make a note of that said mr mool he made the note and they rose to say good bye faithful mr gallilee still thought of carmina do consider it again he said at parting are you sure the law won't help her i might look at her father's will mr mool replied mr gallilee saw the hopeful side of this suggestion in the brightest colours why didn't you think of it before he asked mr mool gently remonstrated don't forget how many things i have on my mind he said it only occurs to me now that the will may give us a remedy if there is any open opposition to the ward's marriage engagement on the guardian's part there he stopped knowing mrs gallilee's methods of opposition too well to reckon hopefully on such a result as this but he was a merciful man and he kept his misgivings to himself on the way home mr gallilee encountered his wife's maid marceline was dropping a letter into the pillar post box at the corner of the square she changed colour on seeing her master corresponding with her sweetheart mr gallilee concluded entering the house with an unfinished cigar in his mouth he made straight for the smoking room and passed his youngest daughter below him waiting out of sight on the kitchen stairs have you done it zo whispered when marceline returned by the servants' entrance it's safe in the post dear now tell me what you saw yesterday when you were hidden in miss carmina's bedroom the tone in which she spoke implied a confidential agreement with honourable promptitude zo perched on her friend's knee exerted her memory and rewarded marceline for posting her letter to ovid chapter xlix it was past the middle of the day before mr le frank paid his promised visit to mrs gallilee he entered the room with gloomy looks and made his polite inquiries as became a depressed musician in the minor key i am sorry madam to find you still on the sofa is there no improvement in your health none whatever does your medical attendant give you any hope he does what they all do he preaches patience no more of myself you appear to be in depressed spirits mr le frank admitted with a sigh that appearances had not misrepresented him i have been bitterly disappointed he said my feelings as an artist are wounded to the quick but why do i trouble you with my poor little personal affairs i humbly beg your pardon his eyes accompanied this modest apology with a look of uneasy anticipation he evidently expected to be asked to explain himself events had followed her instructions to mr null which left mrs gallilee in need of employing her music master's services she felt the necessity of exerting herself and did it with an effort you have no reason i hope to complain of your pupils she said at this time of year madam i have no pupils they are all out of town she was too deeply preoccupied by her own affairs to trouble herself any further the direct way was the easy way she said wearily well what is it he answered in plain terms this time a bitter humiliation mrs gallilee i have been made to regret that i asked you to honour me by accepting the dedication of my song the music sellers on whom the sale depends have not taken a tenth part of the number of copies for which we expected them to subscribe has some extraordinary change come over the public taste my composition has been carefully based on fashionable principles that is to say on the principles of the modern german school as little tune as possible and that little strictly confined to the accompaniment and what is the result loss confronts me instead of profit my agreement makes me liable for half the expenses of publication and what is far more serious in my estimation your honoured name is associated with a failure don't notice me the artist nature i shall be better in a minute he took out a profusely scented handkerchief and buried his face in it with a groan mrs gallilee's hard common sense understood the heart broken composer to perfection stupid of me not to have offered him money yesterday she thought this waste of time need never have happened she set her mistake right with admirable brevity and directness don't distress yourself mr le frank now my name is on it the song is mine if your publisher's account is not satisfactory be so good as to send it to me mr le frank dropped his dry handkerchief and sprang theatrically to his feet his indulgent patroness refused to hear him to this admirable woman the dignity of art was a sacred thing not a word more on that subject she said tell me how you prospered last night your investigations cannot have been interrupted or i should have heard of it come to the result have you found anything of importance in my niece's room mr le frank had again been baffled so far as the confirmation of his own suspicions was concerned but the time was not favourable to a confession of personal disappointment he understood the situation and made himself the hero of it in three words judge for yourself he said and held out the letter of warning from father patrizio in silence mrs gallilee read the words which declared her to be the object of teresa's inveterate resentment and which charged carmina with the serious duty of keeping the peace does it alarm you mr le frank asked i hardly know what i feel she answered give me time to think mr le frank went back to his chair he had reason to congratulate himself already he had shifted to other shoulders the pecuniary responsibility involved in the failure of his song observing mrs gallilee he began to see possibilities of a brighter prospect still thus far she had kept him at a certain distance was the change of mind coming which would admit him to the position with all its solid advantages of a confidential friend she suddenly took up father patrizio's letter and showed it to him what impression does it produce on you she asked knowing no more than you know now the priest's cautious language madam speaks for itself you have an enemy who will stick at nothing she still hesitated to trust him you see me here she went on confined to my room likely perhaps to be in this helpless condition for some time to come how would you protect yourself against that woman in my place i should wait for what purpose if you will allow me to use the language of the card table i should wait till the woman shows her hand she has shown it may i ask when this morning mr le frank said no more if he was really wanted mrs gallilee had only to speak after a last moment of hesitation the pitiless necessities of her position decided her once more you see me too ill to move she said the first thing to do is to tell you why she related the plain facts without a word of comment without a sign of emotion but her husband's horror of her had left an impression which neither pride nor contempt had been strong enough to resist she allowed the music master to infer that contending claims to authority over carmina had led to a quarrel which provoked the assault the secret of the words that she had spoken was the one secret that she kept from mr le frank while i was insensible she proceeded my niece was taken away from me she has been suffering from nervous illness she was naturally terrified and she is now at the nurse's lodgings too ill to be moved there you have the state of affairs up to last night some people might think mr le frank remarked that the easiest way out of it so far would be to summon the nurse for the assault the easiest way compels me to face a public exposure mrs gallilee answered in my position that is impossible mr le frank accepted this view of the case as a matter of course under the circumstances he said it's not easy to advise you how can you make the woman submit to your authority while you are lying here my lawyers have made her submit this morning in the extremity of his surprise mr le frank forgot himself the devil they have he exclaimed they have forbidden her in my name mrs gallilee continued to act as nurse to my niece they have informed her that miss carmina will be restored to my care the moment she can be moved and they have sent me her unconditional submission in writing signed by herself she took it from the desk at her side and read it to him in these words i humbly ask pardon of mrs gallilee for the violent and unlawful acts of which i have been guilty i acknowledge and submit to her authority as guardian of miss carmina graywell and i appeal to her mercy which i own i have not deserved to spare me the misery of separation from miss carmina on any conditions which it may be her good will and pleasure to impose now mrs galilee concluded what do you say speaking sincerely for once mr le frank made a startling reply submit on your side he said do what she asks of you and when you are well enough to go to her lodgings decline with thanks if she offers you anything to eat or drink mrs gallilee raised herself on the sofa are you insulting me sir she asked by making this serious emergency the subject of a joke i never was more in earnest madam in my life you think you really think that she is capable of trying to poison me most assuredly i do mrs gallilee sank back on the pillow mr le frank stated his reasons checking them off one by one on his fingers who is she he began she is an italian woman of the lower orders the virtues of the people among whom she had been born and bred are not generally considered to include respect for the sanctity of human life what do we know already that she has done she has alarmed the priest who keeps her conscience and knows her well and she has attacked you with such murderous ferocity that it is a wonder you have escaped with your life what sort of message have you sent to her after this experience of her temper you have told the tigress that you have the power to separate her from her cub and that you mean to use it on those plain facts as they stare us in the face which is the soundest conclusion to believe that she really submits or to believe that she is only gaining time and is capable if she sees no other alternative of trying to poison you what would you advise me to do in those words mrs gallilee never before reduced to ask advice of anybody owned that sound reasoning was not thrown away on her mr le frank answered the demand made on him without hesitation the nurse has not signed that act of submission he said without having her own private reasons for appearing to give way rely on it she is prepared for you and there is at least a chance that some proof of it may be found have all her movements privately watched and search the room she lives in as i searched miss carmina's room last night well said mrs gallilee well mr le frank repeated she angrily gave way say at once that you are the man to do it for me she answered and say next if you can how it is to be done mr le frank's manner softened to an air of gentle gallantry pray compose yourself he said i am so glad to be of service to you and it is so easily done easily dear madam quite easily isn't the house a lodging house and at this time of year have i anything to do he rose and took his hat surely you see me in my new character now a single gentleman wants a bedroom his habits are quiet and he gives excellent references the address mrs gallilee may i trouble you for the address chapter l towards seven o'clock on the evening of thursday carmina recognised teresa for the first time her half closed eyes opened as if from a long sleep they rested on the old nurse without any appearance of surprise i am so glad to see you my dear she said faintly are you very tired after you journey none of the inquiries which might have been anticipated followed those first words not the slightest allusion to mrs gallilee escaped her she expressed no anxiety about miss minerva no sign of uneasiness at finding herself in a strange room disturbed her quiet face contentedly reposing she looked at teresa from time to time and said you will stay with me won't you now and then she confessed that her head felt dull and heavy and asked teresa to take her hand i feel as if i was sinking away from you she said keep hold of my hand and i shan't be afraid to go to sleep the words were hardly spoken before she sank into slumber occasionally teresa felt her hand tremble and kissed it she seemed to be conscious of the kiss without waking she smiled in her sleep but when the first hours of the morning came this state of passive repose was disturbed a violent attack of sickness came on it was repeated again and again teresa sent for mr null he did what he could to relieve the new symptom and he despatched a messenger to his illustrious colleague benjulia lost no time in answering personally the appeal that had been made to him mr null said serious derangement of the stomach sir benjulia agreed with him mr null showed his prescription benjulia sanctioned the prescription mr null said is there anything you wish to suggest sir benjulia had nothing to suggest he waited nevertheless until carmina was able to speak to him teresa and mr null wondered what he would say to her he only said do you remember when you last saw me after a little consideration she answered yes zo was with us zo brought in your big stick and we talked she tried to rouse her memory what did we talk about she asked a momentary agitation brought a flush to her face i can't remember it she said i can't remember when you went away does it matter benjulia replied not the least in the world go to sleep but he still remained in the room watching her as she grew drowsy great weakness mr null whispered and benjulia answered yes i'll call again on his way out he took teresa aside no more questions he said and don't help her memory if she asks you will she remember when she gets better teresa inquired impossible to say yet wait and see he left her in a hurry his experiments were waiting for him on the way home his mind dwelt on carmina's case some hidden process was at work there give it time and it would show itself i hope that ass won't want me he said thinking of his medical colleague for at least a week to come the week passed and the physiologist was not disturbed during that interval mr null succeeded in partially overcoming the attacks of sickness they were less violent and they were succeeded by longer intervals of repose in other respects there seemed as teresa persisted in thinking to be some little promise of improvement a certain mental advance was unquestionably noticeable in carmina it first showed itself in an interesting way she began to speak of ovid her great anxiety was that he should know nothing of her illness she forbade teresa to write to him she sent messages to mr and mrs gallilee and even to mr mool entreating them to preserve silence the nurse engaged to deliver the messages and failed to keep her word this breach of promise as events had ordered it proved to be harmless mrs gallilee had good reasons for not writing her husband and mr mool had decided on sending their telegram to the bankers as for teresa herself she had no desire to communicate with ovid his absence remained inexcusable from her point of view well or ill with or without reason it was the nurse's opinion that he ought to have remained at home in carmina's interests no other persons were in the least likely to write to ovid nobody thought of zo as a correspondent carmina was pacified once or twice at this later time the languid efforts of her memory took a wider range she wondered why mrs gallilee never came near her owning that her aunt's absence was a relief to her but not feeling interest enough in the subject to ask for information she also mentioned miss minerva do you know where she has gone don't you think she ought to write to me teresa offered to make inquiries she turned her head wearily on the pillow and said never mind on another occasion she asked for zo and said it would be pleasant if mr gallilee would call and bring her with him but she soon dropped the subject not to return to it again the only remembrance which seemed to dwell on her mind for more than a few minutes was her remembrance of the last letter which she had written to ovid she pleased herself with imagining his surprise when he received it she grew impatient under her continued illness because it delayed her in escaping to canada she talked to teresa of the clever manner in which the flight had been planned with this strange failure of memory that she attributed the various arrangements for setting discovery at defiance not to miss minerva but to the nurse here for the first time her mind was approaching dangerous ground the stealing of the letter and the events that had followed it stood next in the order of remembrance if she was capable of a continued effort her weakness saved her beyond the writing of the letter her recollections were unable to advance not the faintest allusion to any later circumstances escaped her the poor stricken brain still sought its rest in frequent intervals of sleep sometimes she drifted back into partial unconsciousness sometimes the attacks of sickness returned mr null set an excellent example of patience and resignation he believed as devoutly as ever in his prescriptions he placed the greatest reliance on time and care the derangement of the stomach as he called it presented something positive and tangible to treat he had got over the doubts and anxieties that troubled him when carmina was first removed to the lodgings looking confidently at the surface without an idea of what was going on below it he could tell teresa with a safe conscience that he understood the case he was always ready to comfort her when her excitable italian nature passed from the extreme of hope to the extreme of despair my good woman we see our way now it's a great point gained i assure you to see our way what do you mean by seeing your way said the downright nurse tell me when carmina will be well again mr null's medical knowledge was not yet equal to this demand on it the progress is slow he admitted still miss carmina is getting on is her aunt getting on teresa asked abruptly when is mistress gallilee likely to come here in a few days mr null was about to add i hope but he thought of what might happen when the two women met as it was teresa's face showed signs of serious disturbance her mind was plainly not prepared for this speedy prospect of a visit from mrs gallilee she took a letter out of her pocket i find a good deal of sly prudence in you she said to mr null you must have seen something in your time of the ways of deceitful englishwomen what does that palaver mean in plain words she handed the letter to him with some reluctance he read it mrs gallilee declines to contract any engagement with the person formerly employed as nurse in the household of the late mr robert graywell mrs gallilee so far recognises the apology and submission offered to her as to abstain from taking immediate proceedings in arriving at this decision she is also influenced by the necessity of sparing her niece any agitation which might interfere with the medical treatment when the circumstances appear to require it she will not hesitate to exert her authority the handwriting told mr null that this manifesto had not been written by mrs gallilee herself the person who had succeeded him in the capacity of that lady's amanuensis had been evidently capable of giving sound advice little did he suspect that this mysterious secretary was identical with an enterprising pianist who had once prevailed on him to take a seat at a concert price five shillings well said teresa mr null hesitated the nurse stamped impatiently on the floor tell me this when she does come here will she part me from carmina is that what she means possibly said prudent mr null teresa pointed to the door good morning i want nothing more of you oh man man leave me by myself the moment she was alone she fell on her knees fiercely whispering she repeated over and over again the words of the lord's prayer 'lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil' christ hear me mother of christ hear me oh carmina carmina she rose and opened the door which communicated with the bedroom trembling pitiably she looked for a while at carmina peacefully asleep then turned away to a corner of the room in which stood an old packing case fitted with a lock she took it up and returning with it to the sitting room softly closed the bedroom door again after some hesitation she decided to open the case in the terror and confusion that possessed her she tried the wrong key setting this mistake right she disclosed strangely mingled with the lighter articles of her own dress a heap of papers some of them letters and bills some of them faded instructions in writing for the preparation of artists' colours she recoiled from the objects which her own act had disclosed why had she not taken father patrizio's advice if she had only waited another day if she had only sorted her husband's papers before she threw the things that her trunk was too full to hold into that half empty case what torment might have been spared to her her eyes turned mournfully to the bedroom door oh my darling i was in such a hurry to get to you at last she controlled herself and put her hand into the case searching it in one corner she produced a little tin canister a dirty label was pasted on the canister bearing this quaint inscription in the italian language if there is any of the powder we employ in making some of our prettiest colours left in here i request my good wife or any other trustworthy person in her place to put a seal on it and take it directly to the manufactory with the late foreman's best respects it looks like nice sugar beware of looks or you may taste poison on the point of opening the canister she hesitated under some strange impulse she did what a child might have done she shook it and listened the rustle of the rising and falling powder renewing her terror seemed to exercise some irresistible fascination over her the devil's dance she said to herself with a ghastly smile softly up and softly down and tempting me to take off the cover all the time why don't i get rid of it that question set her thinking of carmina's guardian if mr null was right in a day or two mrs gallilee might come to the house after the lawyers had threatened teresa with the prospect of separation from carmina she had opened the packing case for the first time since she had left rome intending to sort her husband's papers as a means of relief from her own thoughts in this way she had discovered the canister the sight of the deadly powder had tempted her there were the horrid means of setting mrs gallilee's authority at defiance some women in her place would use them though she was not looking into the canister now she felt that thought stealing back into her mind there was but one hope for her she resolved to get rid of the poison how at that period of the year there was no fire in the grate within the limits of the room the means of certain destruction were slow to present themselves her own morbid horror of the canister made her suspicious of the curiosity of other people who might see it in her hand if she showed herself on the stairs but she was determined if she lit a fire for the purpose to find the way to her end the firmness of her resolution expressed itself by locking the case again without restoring the canister to its hiding place providing herself next with a knife she sat down in a corner between the bedroom door on one side and a cupboard in an angle of the wall on the other and began the work of destruction by scraping off the paper label the fragments might be burnt and the powder if she made a vow to the virgin to do it might be thrown into the fire next and then the empty canister would be harmless she had made but little progress in the work of scraping when it occurred to her that the lighting of a fire on that warm autumn day might look suspicious if the landlady or mr null happened to come in it would be safer to wait till night time when everybody would be in bed arriving at this conclusion she mechanically suspended the use of her knife in the moment of silence that followed she heard someone enter the bedroom by the door which opened on the stairs immediately afterwards the person turned the handle of the second door at her side she had barely time enough to open the cupboard and hide the canister in it when the landlady came in teresa looked at her wildly the landlady looked at the cupboard she was proud of her cupboard plenty of room there she said boastfully not another house in the neighbourhood could offer you such accommodation as that yes the lock is out of order i don't deny it the last lodger's doings she spoilt my tablecloth and put the inkstand over it to hide the place beast there's her character in one word you didn't hear me knock at the bedroom door i am so glad to see her sleeping nicely poor dear her chicken broth is ready when she wakes i'm late to day in making my inquiries after our young lady you see we have been hard at work upstairs getting the bedroom ready for a new lodger such a contrast to the person who has just left a perfect gentleman this time and so kind in waiting a week till i was able to accommodate him my ground floor rooms were vacant as you know but he said the terms were too high for him oh i didn't forget to mention that we had an invalid in the house quiet habits i said are indeed an essential qualification of any new inmate at such a time as this he understood 'i've been an invalid myself' he said 'and the very reason i am leaving my present lodgings is that they are not quiet enough' isn't that just the sort of man we want and let me tell you a handsome man too with a drawback i must own in the shape of a bald head but such a beard and such a thrilling voice hush did i hear her calling at last the landlady permitted other sounds to be audible besides the sound of her own voice it became possible to discover that carmina was now awake teresa hurried into the bedroom left by herself in the sitting room the landlady purely out of curiosity as she afterwards said in conversation with her new lodger opened the cupboard and looked in the canister stood straight before her on an upper shelf did miss carmina's nurse take snuff she examined the canister there was a white powder inside the mutilated label spoke in an unknown tongue she wetted her finger and tasted the powder the result was so disagreeable that she was obliged to use her handkerchief she put the canister back and closed the cupboard medicine undoubtedly the landlady said to herself why should she hurry to put it away when i came in chapter li in eight days from the date of his second interview with mrs gallilee mr le frank took possession of his new bedroom he had arranged to report his proceedings in writing in teresa's state of mind she would certainly distrust a fellow lodger discovered in personal communication with mrs gallilee mr le frank employed the first day after his arrival in collecting the materials for a report in the evening he wrote to mrs gallilee under cover to a friend who was instructed to forward the letter private and confidential dear madam i have not wasted my time and my opportunities as you will presently see my bedroom is immediately above the floor of the house which is occupied by miss carmina and her nurse having some little matters of my own to settle i was late in taking possession of my room before the lights on the staircase were put out i took the liberty of looking down at the next landing do you remember when you were a child learning to write that one of the lines in your copy books was 'virtue is its own reward' this ridiculous assertion was actually verified in my case before i had been five minutes at my post i saw the nurse open her door she looked up the staircase without discovering me it is needless to say and she looked down the staircase and seeing nobody about returned to her rooms waiting till i heard her lock the door i stole downstairs and listened outside one of my two fellow lodgers you know that i don't believe in miss carmina's illness was lighting a fire on such a warm autumn night that the staircase window was left open i am absolutely sure of what i say i heard the crackle of burning wood i smelt coal smoke the motive of this secret proceeding it seems impossible to guess at if they were burning documents of a dangerous and compromising kind a candle would have answered their purpose if they wanted hot water surely a tin kettle and a spirit lamp must have been at hand in an invalid's bedroom perhaps your superior penetration may be able to read the riddle which baffles my ingenuity so much for the first night this afternoon i had some talk with the landlady my professional avocations having trained me in the art of making myself agreeable to the sex i may say without vanity that i produced a favourable impression in other words i contrived to set my fair friend talking freely about the old nurse and the interesting invalid out of the flow of words poured on me one fact of very serious importance has risen to the surface there is a suspicious canister in the nurse's possession the landlady calls the powder inside medicine i say poison am i rushing at a fanciful conclusion please wait a little during the week of delay which elapsed before the lodger in possession vacated my room you kindly admitted me to an interview i ventured to put some questions relating to teresa's life in italy and to the persons with whom she associated do you remember telling me when i asked what you knew of her husband that he was foreman in a manufactory of artists' colours and that you had your information from miss carmina herself after she had shown you the telegram announcing his death a lady possessed of your scientific knowledge does not require to be told that poisons are employed in making artists' colours remember what the priest's letter says of teresa's feeling towards you and then say is it so very unlikely that she has brought with her to england one of the poisons used by her husband in his trade and is it quite unreasonable to suppose when she looks at her canister that she may be thinking of you i may be right or i may be wrong thanks to the dilapidated condition of a lock i can decide the question at the first opportunity offered to me by the nurse's absence from the room my next report shall tell you that i have contrived to provide myself with a sample of the powder leaving the canister undisturbed the sample shall be tested by a chemist if he pronounces it to be poison i have a bold course of action to propose as soon as you are well enough to go to the house give the nurse her chance of poisoning you dear madam don't be alarmed i will accompany you and i will answer for the result we will pay our visit at tea time let her offer you a cup and let me under pretence of handing it get possession of the poisoned drink before she can cry stop i shall be on my way to the chemist the penalty for attempted murder is penal servitude if you still object to a public exposure we have the chemist's report together with your own evidence ready for your son on his return how will he feel about his marriage engagement when he finds that miss carmina's dearest friend and companion has tried perhaps with her young lady's knowledge to poison his mother before concluding i may mention that i had a narrow escape only two hours since of being seen by teresa on the stairs i was of course prepared for this sort of meeting when i engaged my room and i have therefore not been foolish enough to enter the house under an assumed name on the contrary i propose in your interests to establish a neighbourly acquaintance with time to help me but the matter of the poison admits of no delay my chance of getting at it unobserved may be seriously compromised if the nurse remembers that she first met with me in your house and distrusts me accordingly your devoted servant l f having completed his letter he rang for the maid and gave it to her to post on her way downstairs she was stopped on the next landing by mr null he too had a letter ready addressed to doctor benjulia the fierce old nurse followed him out and said post it instantly the civil maid asked if miss carmina was better worse was all the rude foreigner said she looked at poor mr null as if it was his fault left in the retirement of his room mr le frank sat at the writing table frowning and biting his nails were these evidences of a troubled mind connected with the infamous proposal which he had addressed to mrs gallilee nothing of the sort having sent away his letter he was now at leisure to let his personal anxieties absorb him without restraint he was thinking of carmina the oftener his efforts were baffled the more resolute he became to discover the secret of her behaviour to him for the hundredth time he said to himself her devilish malice reviles me behind my back and asks me before my face to shake hands and be friends the more outrageously unreasonable his suspicions became under the exasperating influence of suspense the more inveterately his vindictive nature held to its delusion after meeting her in the hall at fairfield gardens he really believed carmina's illness to have been assumed as a means of keeping out of his way if a friend had said to him but what reason have you to think so he would have smiled compassionately and have given that friend up for a shallow minded man he stole out again and listened undetected at their door carmina was speaking but the words in those faint tones were inaudible teresa's stronger voice easily reached his ears my darling talking is not good for you i'll light the night lamp try to sleep hearing this he went back to his bedroom to wait a little teresa's vigilance might relax if carmina fell asleep she might go downstairs for a gossip with the landlady after smoking a cigar he tried again the lights on the staircase were now put out it was eleven o'clock she was not asleep the nurse was reading to her from some devotional book he gave it up for that night his head ached the ferment of his own abominable thoughts had fevered him a cowardly dread of the slightest signs of illness was one of his special weaknesses the whole day to morrow was before him he felt his own pulse and determined in justice to himself to go to bed ten minutes later the landlady on her way to bed ascended the stairs she too heard the voice still reading aloud and tapped softly at the door teresa opened it is the poor thing not asleep yet no has she been disturbed in some way somebody has been walking about overhead teresa answered that's the new lodger exclaimed the landlady i'll speak to mr le frank on the point of closing the door and saying good night teresa stopped and considered for a moment is he your new lodger she said yes do you know him i saw him when i was last in england well nothing more teresa answered good night chapter lii watching through the night by carmina's bedside teresa found herself thinking of mr le frank it was one way of getting through the weary time to guess at the motive which had led him to become a lodger in the house common probabilities pointed to the inference that he might have reasons for changing his residence which only concerned himself but common probabilities from teresa's point of view did not apply to mr le frank on meeting him at the time of her last visit to england his personal appearance had produced such a disagreeable impression on her that she had even told carmina the music master looked like a rogue with her former prejudice against him now revived and with her serious present reasons for distrusting mrs gallilee she rejected the idea of his accidental presence under her landlady's roof to her mind the business of the new lodger in the house was in all likelihood the business of a spy while mr le frank was warily laying his plans for the next day he had himself become an object of suspicion to the very woman whose secrets he was plotting to surprise this was the longest and saddest night which the faithful old nurse had passed at her darling's bedside for the first time carmina was fretful and hard to please patient persuasion was needed to induce her to take her medicine even when she was thirsty she had an irritable objection to being disturbed if the lemonade was offered to her which she had relished at other times once or twice when she drowsily stirred in her bed she showed symptoms of delusion the poor girl supposed it was the eve or her wedding day and eagerly asked what teresa had done with her new dress a little later when she had perhaps been dreaming she fancied that her mother was still alive and repeated the long forgotten talk of her childhood what have i said to distress you she asked wonderingly when she found teresa crying soon after sunrise there came a long interval of repose at the later time when benjulia arrived she was quiet and uncomplaining the change for the worse which had induced teresa to insist on sending for him was perversely absent mr null expected to be roughly rebuked for having disturbed the great man by a false alarm he attempted to explain and teresa attempted to explain benjulia paid not the slightest attention to either of them he made no angry remarks and he showed in his own impenetrable way as gratifying an interest in the case as ever draw up the blind he said i want to have a good look at her mr null waited respectfully and imposed strict silence on teresa while the investigation was going on it lasted so long that he ventured to say do you see anything particular sir benjulia saw his doubts cleared up time as he had anticipated had brought development with it and had enabled him to arrive at a conclusion the shock that had struck carmina had produced complicated hysterical disturbance which was now beginning to simulate paralysis benjulia's profound and practised observation detected a trifling inequality in the size of the pupils of the eyes and a slightly unequal action on either side of the face delicately presented in the eyelids the nostrils and the lips here was no common affection of the brain which even mr null could understand here at last was benjulia's reward for sacrificing the precious hours which might otherwise have been employed in the laboratory from that day carmina was destined to receive unknown honour she was to take her place along with the other animals in his note book of experiments he turned quietly to mr null and finished the consultation in two words all right have you nothing to suggest sir mr null inquired go on with the treatment and draw down the blind if she complains of the light good day are you sure he's a great doctor said teresa when the door had closed on him the greatest we have cried mr null with enthusiasm is he a good man why do you ask i want to know if we can trust him to tell us the truth not a doubt of it who could doubt it indeed after he had approved of mr null's medical treatment there's one thing you have forgotten teresa persisted you haven't asked him when carmina can be moved my good woman if i had put such a question he would have set me down as a fool nobody can say when she will be well enough to be moved he took his hat the nurse followed him out are you going to mrs gallilee sir not to day is she better she is almost well again chapter liii left alone teresa went into the sitting room she was afraid to show herself at the bedside mr null had destroyed the one hope which had supported her thus far the hope of escaping from england with carmina before mrs gallilee could interfere looking steadfastly at that inspiriting prospect she had forced herself to sign the humble apology and submission which the lawyers had dictated what was the prospect now heavily had the merciless hand of calamity fallen on that brave old soul and at last it had beaten her down while she stood at the window mechanically looking out the dreary view of the back street trembled and disappeared teresa was crying happily for herself she was unable to control her own weakness the tears lightened her heavy heart she waited a little in the fear that her eyes might betray her before she returned to carmina in that interval she heard the sound of a closing door on the floor above the music master she said to herself in an instant she was at the sitting room door looking through the keyhole it was the one safe way of watching him and that was enough for teresa his figure appeared suddenly within her narrow range of view on the mat outside the door if her distrust of him was without foundation he would go on downstairs no he stopped on the mat to listen he stooped his eye would have been at the keyhole in another moment she seized a chair and moved it the sound instantly drove him away he went on down the stairs teresa considered with herself what safest means of protection and if possible of punishment as well lay within her reach how and where could the trap be set that might catch him she was still puzzled by that question when the landlady made her appearance politely anxious to hear what the doctors thought of their patient satisfied so far the wearisome woman had her apologies to make next for not having yet cautioned mr le frank thinking over it since last night she said confidentially i cannot imagine how you heard him walking overhead he has such a soft step that he positively takes me by surprise when he comes into my room he has gone out for an hour and i have done him a little favour which i am not in the habit of conferring on ordinary lodgers i have lent him my umbrella as it threatens rain in his absence i will ask you to listen while i walk about in his room one can't be too particular when rest is of such importance to your young lady and it has struck me as just possible that the floor of his room may be in fault my dear the boards may creak i'm a sad fidget i know but if the carpenter can set things right without any horrid hammering of course the sooner he is sent for the more relieved i shall feel through this harangue the nurse had waited with a patience far from characteristic of her for an opportunity of saying a timely word by some tortuous mental process that she was quite unable to trace the landlady's allusion to mr le frank had suggested the very idea of which in her undisturbed solitude she had been vainly in search never before had the mistress of the house appeared to teresa in such a favourable light you needn't trouble yourself ma'am she said as soon as she could make herself heard it was the creaking of the boards that told me somebody was moving overhead then i'm not a fidget after all oh how you relieve me whatever the servants may have to do one of them shall be sent instantly to the carpenter so glad to be of any service to that sweet young creature teresa consulted her watch before she returned to the bedroom the improvement in carmina still continued she was able to take some of the light nourishment that was waiting for her as benjulia had anticipated she asked to have the blind lowered a little teresa drew it completely over the window she had her own reasons for tempting carmina to repose in half an hour more the weary girl was sleeping and the nurse was at liberty to set her trap for mr le frank her first proceeding was to dip the end of a quill pen into her bottle of salad oil and to lubricate the lock and key of the door that gave access to the bedroom from the stairs having satisfied herself that the key could now be used without making the slightest sound she turned to the door of communication with the sitting room next this door was covered with green baize it had handles but no lock and it swung inwards so as to allow the door of the cupboard situated in the angle of the sitting room wall to open towards the bedroom freely teresa oiled the hinges and the brass bolt and staple which protected the baize door on the side of the bedroom that done she looked again at her watch mr le frank's absence was expected to last for an hour in five minutes more the hour would expire after bolting the door of communication she paused in the bedroom and wafted a kiss to carmina still at rest she left the room by the door which opened on the stairs and locked it taking away the key with her having gone down the first flight of stairs she stopped and went back the one unsecured door was the door which led into the sitting room from the staircase she opened it and left it invitingly ajar now she said to herself the trap will catch him the hall clock struck the hour when she entered the landlady's room the woman of many words was at once charmed and annoyed charmed to hear that the dear invalid was resting and to receive a visit from the nurse annoyed by the absence of the carpenter at work somewhere else for the whole of the day if my dear husband had been alive we should have been independent of carpenters he could turn his hand to anything now do sit down i want you to taste some cherry brandy of my own making as teresa took a chair mr le frank returned the two secret adversaries met face to face surely i remember this lady he said teresa encountered him on his own ground she made her best curtsey and reminded him of the circumstances under which they had formerly met the hospitable landlady produced her cherry brandy we are going to have a nice little chat do sit down sir and join us mr le frank made his apologies the umbrella which had been so kindly lent to him had not protected his shoes his feet were wet and he was so sadly liable to take cold that he must beg permission to put on his dry things immediately having bowed himself out he stopped in the passage and standing on tiptoe peeped through a window in the wall by which light was conveyed to the landlady's little room the two women were comfortably seated together with the cherry brandy and a plate of biscuits on a table between them in for a good long gossip thought mr le frank now is my time not five minutes more had passed before teresa made an excuse for running upstairs again she had forgotten to leave the bell rope in case carmina woke within the reach of her hand the excellent heart of the hostess made allowance for natural anxiety do it you good soul she said and come back directly left by herself she filled her glass again and smiled sweetness of temper encouraged by cherry brandy can even smile at a glass unless it happens to be empty approaching her own rooms teresa waited and listened before she showed herself no sound reached her through the half open sitting room door she noiselessly entered the bedroom and then locked the door again once more she listened and once more there was nothing to be heard had he seen her on the stairs as the doubt crossed her mind she heard the boards creak on the floor above mr le frank was in his room did this mean that her well laid plan had failed or did it mean that he was really changing his shoes and stockings the last inference was the right one he had made no mere excuse downstairs the serious interests that he had at stake were not important enough to make him forget his precious health his chest was delicate a cold might settle on his lungs the temptation of the half open door had its due effect on this prudent man but it failed to make him forget that his feet were wet the boards creaked again the door of his room was softly closed then there was silence teresa only knew when he had entered the sitting room by hearing him try the bolted baize door after that he must have stepped out again he next tried the door of the bedchamber from the stairs there was a quiet interval once more teresa noiselessly drew back the bolt and opening the baize door by a mere hair's breadth admitted sound from the sitting room she now heard him turning the key in a chiffonier which only contained tradesmen's circulars receipted bills and a few books even with the canister in the cupboard waiting to be opened his uppermost idea was to discover carmina's vindictive motive in carmina's papers the contents of the chiffonier disappointed him judging by the tone in which he muttered to himself the next sound startled teresa it was a tap against the lintel of the door behind which she was standing he had thrown open the cupboard the rasping of the cover as he took it off told her that he was examining the canister she had put it back on the shelf a harmless thing now the poison and the label having been both destroyed by fire nevertheless his choosing the canister from dozens of other things scattered invitingly about it inspired her with a feeling of distrustful surprise she was no longer content to find out what he was doing by means of her ears determined to see him and to catch him in the fact she pulled open the baize door at the moment when he must have discovered that the canister was empty a faint thump told her he had thrown it on the floor the view of the sitting room was still hidden from her she had forgotten the cupboard door now that it was wide open it covered the entrance to the bedroom and completely screened them one from the other for the moment she was startled and hesitated whether to show herself or not his voice stopped her is there another canister he said to himself the dirty old savage may have hidden it teresa heard no more the dirty old savage was an insult not to be endured she forgot her intention of stealing on him unobserved she forgot her resolution to do nothing that could awaken carmina her fierce temper urged her into furious action with both hands outspread she flew at the cupboard door and banged it to in an instant a shriek of agony rang through the house the swiftly closing door had caught and crushed the fingers of le frank's right hand at the moment when he was putting it into the cupboard again without stopping to help him without even looking at him she ran back to carmina the swinging baize door fell to and closed of itself no second cry was heard nothing happened to falsify her desperate assertion that the shriek was the delusion of a vivid dream she took carmina in her arms and patted and fondled her like a child see my darling i'm with you as usual and i have heard nothing don't oh don't tremble in that way there i'll wrap you up in my shawl and read to you no let's talk of ovid her efforts to compose carmina were interrupted by a muffled sound of men's footsteps and women's voices in the next room she hurriedly opened the door and entreated them to whisper and be quiet in the instant before she closed it again she saw and heard le frank lay in a swoon on the floor the landlady was kneeling by him looking at his injured hand and the lodgers were saying send him to the hospital chapter liv on monday morning the strain on mrs gallilee's powers of patient endurance came to an end with the help of mr null's arm she was able to get downstairs to the library on tuesday there would be no objection to her going out for a drive mr null left her restored to her equable flow of spirits he had asked if she wished to have somebody to keep her company and she had answered briskly not on any account i prefer being alone on the morning of saturday she had received mr le frank's letter but she had not then recovered sufficiently to be able to read it through she could now take it up again and get to the end other women might have been alarmed by the atrocious wickedness of the conspiracy which the music master had planned mrs gallilee was only offended that he should think her capable in her social position of favouring such a plot as he had suggested was an insult which she was determined neither to forgive nor forget fortunately she had not committed herself in writing he could produce no proof of the relations that had existed between them the first and best use to make of her recovery would be to dismiss him after paying his expenses privately and prudently in money instead of by cheque in the meantime the man's insolence had left its revolting impression on her mind the one way to remove it was to find some agreeable occupation for her thoughts look at your library table learned lady and take the appropriate means of relief that it offers see the lively modern parasites that infest science eager to invite your attention to their little crawling selves follow scientific inquiry rushing into print to proclaim its own importance and to declare any human being who ventures to doubt or differ a fanatic or a fool respect the leaders of public opinion writing notices of professors who have made discoveries not yet tried by time not yet universally accepted even by their brethren in terms which would be exaggerated if they were applied to newton or to bacon submit to lectures and addresses by dozens which if they prove nothing else prove that what was scientific knowledge some years since is scientific ignorance now and that what is scientific knowledge now may be scientific ignorance in some years more absorb your mind in controversies and discussions in which mr always right and mr never wrong exhibit the natural tendency of man to believe in himself in the most rampant stage of development that the world has yet seen and when you have done all this doubt not that you have made a good use of your time you have discovered what the gentle wisdom of faraday saw and deplored when he warned the science of his day in words which should live for ever the first and last step in the education of the judgment is humility having agreeably occupied her mind with subjects that were worthy of it mrs gallilee rose to seek a little physical relief by walking up and down the room passing and repassing the bookcases she noticed a remote corner devoted to miscellaneous literature a volume in faded binding of sky blue had been placed upside down she looked at the book before she put it in its right position the title was gallery of british beauty among the illustrations long since forgotten appeared her own portrait when she was a girl of carmina's age a faintly contemptuous smile parted her hard lips provoked by the recollections of her youth what a fool she had been at that early period of her life in those days she had trembled with pleasure at the singing of a famous italian tenor she had flown into a passion when a new dress proved to be a misfit on the evening of a ball she had given money to beggars in the street she had fallen in love with a poor young man and had terrified her weak minded hysterical mother by threatening to commit suicide when the beloved object was forbidden the house comparing the girl of seventeen with the matured and cultivated woman of later years what a matchless example mrs gallilee presented of the healthy influence of education directed to scientific pursuits ah she thought as she put the book back in its place my girls will have reason to thank me when they grow up they have had a mother who has done her duty she took a few more turns up and down the room the sky had cleared again a golden gleam of sunlight drew her to the window the next moment she regretted even this concession to human weakness a disagreeable association presented itself and arrested the pleasant flow of her thoughts mr gallilee appeared on the door step leaving the house on foot and carrying a large brown paper parcel under his arm with servants at his disposal why was he carrying the parcel himself the time had been when mrs gallilee would have tapped at the window and would have insisted on his instantly returning and answering the question but his conduct since the catastrophe in carmina's room had produced a complete estrangement between the married pair all his inquiries after his wife's health had been made by deputy when he was not in the schoolroom with the children he was at his club until he came to his senses and made humble apology no earthly consideration would induce mrs gallilee to take the slightest notice of him she returned to her reading the footman came in with two letters one arriving by post the other having been dropped into the box by private messenger communications of this latter sort proceeded not unfrequently from creditors mrs gallilee opened the stamped letter first it contained nothing more important than a few lines from a daily governess whom she had engaged until a successor to miss minerva could be found in obedience to mrs gallilee's instructions the governess would begin her attendance at ten o'clock on the next morning the second letter was of a very different kind it related the disaster which had befallen mr le frank mr null was the writer as miss carmina's medical attendant it was his duty to inform her guardian that her health had been unfavourably affected by an alarm in the house having described the nature of the alarm he proceeded in these words you will i fear lose the services of your present music master inquiries made this morning at the hospital and reported to me appear to suggest serious results the wounded man's constitution is in an unhealthy state the surgeons are not sure of being able to save two of the fingers i will do myself the honour of calling to morrow before you go out for your drive the impression produced by this intelligence on the lady to whom it was addressed can only be reported in her own words she who knew on the best scientific authority that the world had created itself completely lost her head and actually said thank god for weeks to come perhaps for months if the surgeons' forebodings were fulfilled mrs gallilee had got rid of mr le frank in that moment of infinite relief if her husband had presented himself it is even possible that he might have been forgiven as it was mr gallilee returned late in the afternoon entered his own domain of the smoking room and left the house again five minutes afterwards joseph officiously opened the door for him and joseph was surprised precisely as his mistress had been surprised mr gallilee had a large brown paper parcel under his arm the second which he had taken out of the house with his own hands moreover he looked excessively confused when the footman discovered him that night he was late in returning from the club joseph now on the watch observed that he was not steady on his legs and drew his own conclusions accordingly punctual to her time on the next morning the new governess arrived mrs gallilee received her and sent for the children the maid in charge of them appeared alone she had no doubt that the young ladies would be back directly the master had taken them out for a little walk before they began their lessons he had been informed that the lady who had been appointed to teach them would arrive at ten o'clock and what had he said he had said very good the half hour struck eleven o'clock struck and neither the father nor the children returned ten minutes later someone rang the door bell the door being duly opened nobody appeared on the house step joseph looked into the letter box and found a note addressed to his mistress in his master's handwriting he immediately delivered it hitherto mrs gallilee had only been anxious joseph waiting for events outside the door heard the bell rung furiously and found his mistress as he forcibly described it like a woman gone distracted not without reason to do her justice mr gallilee's method of relieving his wife's anxiety was remarkable by its brevity in one sentence he assured her that there was no need to feel alarmed in another he mentioned that he had taken the girls away with him for a change of air and then he signed his initials j g every servant in the house was summoned to the library when mrs gallilee had in some degree recovered herself one after another they were strictly examined and one after another they had no evidence to give excepting the maid who had been present when the master took the young ladies away the little she had to tell pointed to the inference that he had not admitted the girls to his confidence before they left the house maria had submitted without appearing to be particularly pleased at the prospect of so early a walk zo never ready to exert either her intelligence or her legs had openly declared that she would rather stay at home to this the master had answered get your things on directly and had said it so sharply that miss zoe stared at him in astonishment had they taken anything with them a travelling bag for instance they had taken nothing except mr gallilee's umbrella who had seen mr gallilee last on the previous night joseph had seen him last the lower classes in england have one and but one true feeling of sympathy with the higher classes the man above them appeals to their hearts and merits their true service when he is unsteady on his legs joseph nobly confined his evidence to what he had observed some hours previously he mentioned the parcel mrs gallilee's keen perception quickened by her own experience at the window arrived at the truth those two bulky packages must have contained clothes left in anticipation of the journey under the care of an accomplice it was impossible that mr gallilee could have got at the girls' dresses and linen and have made the necessary selections from them without a woman's assistance the female servants were examined again each one of them positively asserted her innocence mrs gallilee threatened to send for the police the indignant women all cried in chorus search our boxes mrs gallilee took a wiser course she sent to the lawyers who had been recommended to her by mr null the messenger had just been despatched when mr null himself in performance of yesterday's engagement called at the house he too was agitated it was impossible that he could have heard what had happened was he the bearer of bad news mrs gallilee thought of carmina first and then of mr le frank prepare for a surprise mr null began a joyful surprise mrs gallilee i have received a telegram from your son he handed it to her as he spoke september th arrived at quebec and received information of carmina's illness shall catch the boston steamer and sail to morrow for liverpool break the news gently to c for god's sake send telegram to meet me at queenstown it was then the th of september if all went well ovid might be in london in ten days more chapter lv mrs gallilee read the telegram paused and read it again she let it drop on her lap but her eyes still rested mechanically on the slip of paper when she spoke her voice startled mr null usually loud and hard her tones were strangely subdued if his back had been turned towards her he would hardly have known who was speaking to him i must ask you to make allowances for me she began abruptly i hardly know what to say this surprise comes at a time when i am badly prepared for it i am getting well but you see i am not quite so strong as i was before that woman attacked me my husband has gone away i don't know where and has taken my children with him read his note but don't say anything you must let me be quiet or i can't think she handed the letter to mr null he looked at her read the few words submitted to him and looked at her again for once his stock of conventional phrases failed him who could have anticipated such conduct on the part of her husband who could have supposed that she herself would have been affected in this way by the return of her son mrs gallilee drew a long heavy breath i have got it now she said my son is coming home in a hurry because of carmina's illness has carmina written to him mr null was in his element again this question appealed to his knowledge of his patient impossible mrs gallilee in her present state of health in her present state of health i forgot that there was something else oh yes has carmina seen the telegram mr null explained he had just come from carmina in his medical capacity he had thought it judicious to try the moral effect on his patient of a first allusion to the good news he had only ventured to say that mr ovid's agents in canada had heard from him on his travels and had reason to believe that he would shortly return to quebec upon the whole the impression produced on the young lady it was useless to go on mrs gallilee was pursuing her own thoughts without even the pretence of listening to him i want to know who wrote to my son she persisted was it the nurse mr null considered this to be in the last degree unlikely the nurse's language showed a hostile feeling towards mr ovid in consequence of his absence mrs gallilee looked once more at the telegram why she asked does ovid telegraph to you mr null answered with his customary sense of what was due to himself as the medical attendant of the family your son naturally supposed madam that miss carmina was under my care the implied reproof produced no effect i wonder whether my son was afraid to trust us was all mrs gallilee said it was the chance guess of a wandering mind but it had hit the truth kept in ignorance of carmina's illness by the elder members of the family at what other conclusion could ovid arrive with zo's letter before him after a momentary pause mrs gallilee went on i suppose i may keep the telegram she said prudent mr null offered a copy and made the copy then and there the original he explained was his authority for acting on mr ovid's behalf and he must therefore beg leave to keep it mrs gallilee permitted him to exchange the two papers is there anything more she asked your time is valuable of course don't let me detain you may i feel your pulse before i go she held out her arm to him in silence the carriage came to the door while he was counting the beat of the pulse she glanced at the window and said send it away mr null remonstrated my dear lady the air will do you good she answered obstinately and quietly no and once more became absorbed in thought it had been her intention to combine her first day of carriage exercise with a visit to teresa's lodgings and a personal exertion of her authority the news of ovid's impending return made it a matter of serious importance to consider this resolution under a new light she had now not only to reckon with teresa but with her son with this burden on her enfeebled mind heavily laden by the sense of injury which her husband's flight had aroused she had not even reserves enough of energy to spare for the trifling effort of dressing to go out she broke into irritability for the first time i am trying to find out who has written to my son how can i do it when you are worrying me about the carriage have you ever held a full glass in your hand and been afraid of letting it overflow that's what i'm afraid of in my mind i don't mean that my mind is a glass i mean her forehead turned red will you leave me she cried he left her instantly the change in her manner the difficulty she found in expressing her thoughts had even startled stupid mr null she had herself alluded to results of the murderous attack made on her by teresa which had not perhaps hitherto sufficiently impressed him in the shock inflicted on the patient's body had there been involved some subtly working influence that had disturbed the steady balance of her mind pondering uneasily on that question he spoke to joseph in the hall do you know about your master and the children he said yes sir i wish you had told me of it when you let me in have i done any harm sir i don't know yet if you want me i shall be at home to dinner at seven the next visitor was one of the partners in the legal firm to which mrs gallilee had applied for advice after what mr null had said joseph hesitated to conduct this gentleman into the presence of his mistress he left the lawyer in the waiting room and took his card mrs gallilee's attitude had not changed she sat looking down at the copied telegram and the letter from her husband lying together on her lap joseph was obliged to speak twice before he could rouse her to morrow was all she said what time shall i say ma'am she put her hand to her head and broke into anger against joseph settle it yourself you wretch her head drooped again over the papers joseph returned to the lawyer my mistress is not very well sir she will be obliged if you will call to morrow at your own time about an hour later she rang her bell rang it unintermittingly until joseph appeared i'm famished she said something to eat i never was so hungry in my life at once i can't wait the cook sent up a cold fowl and a ham her eyes devoured the food while the footman was carving it for her her bad temper seemed to have completely disappeared she said what a delicious dinner just the very things i like she lifted the first morsel to her mouth and laid the fork down again with a weary sigh no i can't eat what has come to me with those words she pushed her chair away from the table and looked slowly all round her i want the telegram and the letter joseph found them can you help me she said i am trying to find out who wrote my son say yes or no at once i hate waiting joseph left her in her old posture with her head down and the papers on her lap the appearance of the uneaten dinner in the kitchen produced a discussion followed by a quarrel joseph was of the opinion that the mistress had got more upon her mind than her mind could well bear it was useless to send for mr null he had already mentioned that he would not be home until seven o'clock there was no superior person in the house to consult it was not for the servants to take responsibility on themselves fetch the nearest doctor and let him be answerable if anything serious happens such was joseph's advice the women angrily remembering that mrs gallilee had spoken of sending for the police ridiculed the footman's cautious proposal with one exception when the others ironically asked him if he was not accustomed to the mistress's temper yet mrs gallilee's own maid marceline said what do we know about it joseph is the only one of us who has seen her since the morning this perfectly sensible remark had the effect of a breath of wind on a smouldering fire the female servants all equally suspected of having assisted mr gallilee in making up his parcels were all equally assured that there was a traitress among them and that marceline was the woman hitherto suppressed this feeling now openly found its way to expression marceline lost her temper and betrayed herself as her master's guilty confederate i'm a mean mongrel am i cried the angry maid repeating the cook's allusion to her birthplace in the channel islands the mistress shall know this minute that i'm the woman who did it why didn't you say so before the cook retorted because i promised my master not to tell on him till he got to his journey's end who'll lay a wager asked the cook i bet half a crown she changes her mind before she gets to the top of the stairs perhaps she thinks the mistress will forgive her the parlour maid suggested ironically or perhaps the housemaid added she means to give the mistress notice to leave that's exactly what i'm going to do said marceline the women all declined to believe her she appealed to joseph what did i tell you when the mistress first sent me out in the carriage with poor miss carmina didn't i say that i was no spy and that i wouldn't submit to be made one i would have left the house i would but for miss carmina's kindness any other young lady would have made me feel my mean position she treated me like a friend and i don't forget it i'll go straight from this place and help to nurse her with that declaration marceline left the kitchen arrived at the library door she paused not as the cook had suggested to change her mind but to consider beforehand how much she should confess to her mistress and how much she should hold in reserve zo's narrative of what had happened on the evening of teresa's arrival had produced its inevitable effect on the maid's mind strengthening by the sympathy which it excited her grateful attachment to carmina it had necessarily intensified her dislike of mrs gallilee and mrs gallilee's innocent husband had profited by that circumstance unexpectedly tried by time mr gallilee's resolution to assert his paternal authority in spite of his wife had failed him the same timidity which invents a lie in a hurry can construct a stratagem at leisure marceline had discovered her master putting a plan of escape devised by himself to its first practical trial before the open wardrobe of his daughters and had asked slyly if she could be of any use never remarkable for presence of mind in emergencies mr gallilee had helplessly admitted to his confidence the last person in the house whom anyone else in his position would have trusted my good soul i want to take the girls away quietly for change of air you have got little secrets of your own like me haven't you and the fact is i don't quite know how many petticoats there he checked himself conscious when it was too late that he was asking his wife's maid to help him in deceiving his wife the ready marceline helped him through the difficulty i understand sir my mistress's mind is much occupied and you don't want to trouble her about this little journey mr gallilee at a loss for any other answer pulled out his purse marceline modestly drew back at the sight of it my mistress pays me sir i serve you for nothing in those words she would have informed any other man of the place which mrs gallilee held in her estimation her master simply considered her to be the most disinterested woman he had ever met with if she lost her situation through helping him he engaged to pay her wages until she found another place the maid set his mind at rest on that subject a woman who understands hairdressing as i do sir can refer to other ladies besides mrs gallilee and can get a place whenever she wants one having decided on what she should confess and on what she should conceal marceline knocked at the library door receiving no answer she went in mrs gallilee was leaning back in her chair her hands hung down on either side of her her eyes looked up drowsily at the ceiling prepared to see a person with an overburdened mind the maid without sympathy to quicken her perceptions saw nothing but a person on the point of taking a nap can i speak a word ma'am mrs gallilee's eyes remained fixed on the ceiling is that my maid she asked treated to all appearance with marked contempt marceline no longer cared to assume the forms of respect either in language or manner i wish to give you notice to leave she said abruptly i find i can't get on with my fellow servants mrs gallilee slowly raised her head and looked at her maid and said nothing and while i'm about it the angry woman proceeded i may as well own the truth you suspect one of us of helping my master to take away the young ladies' things i mean some few of their things well you needn't blame innocent people i'm the person mrs gallilee laid her head back again on the chair and burst out laughing for one moment marceline looked at her mistress in blank surprise then the terrible truth burst on her she ran into the hall and called for joseph he hurried up the stairs the instant he presented himself at the open door mrs gallilee rose to her feet my medical attendant she said with an assumption of dignity i must explain myself she held up one hand outstretched and counted her fingers with the other first my husband then my son now my maid one two three mr null do you know the proverb 'it's the last hair that breaks the camel's back' she suddenly dropped on her knees will somebody pray for me she cried piteously i don't know how to pray for myself where is god bareheaded as he was joseph ran out the nearest doctor lived on the opposite side of the square he happened to be at home when he reached the house the women servants were holding their mistress down by main force chapter lvi on the next day mr mool returning from a legal consultation to an appointment at his office found a gentleman whom he knew by sight walking up and down before his door apparently bent on intercepting him mr null i believe he said with his customary politeness mr null answered to his name and asked for a moment of mr mool's time mr mool looked grave and said he was late for an appointment already mr null admitted that the clerks in the office had told him so and said at last what he ought to have said at first i am mrs gallilee's medical attendant there is serious necessity for communicating with her husband mr mool instantly led the way into the office the chief clerk approached his employer with some severity of manner the parties have been waiting sir for more than a quarter of an hour mr mool's attention wandered he was thinking of mrs gallilee is she dying he asked she is out of her mind mr null answered those words petrified the lawyer he looked helplessly at the clerk who in his turn looked indignantly at the office clock mr mool recovered himself say i am detained by a most distressing circumstance i will call on the parties later in the day at their own hour giving those directions to the clerk he hurried mr null upstairs into a private room tell me about it pray tell me about it stop perhaps there is not time enough what can i do mr null put the question which he ought to have asked when they met at the house door can you tell me mr gallilee's address certainly care of the earl of northlake will you please write it in my pocket book i am so upset by this dreadful affair that i can't trust my memory such a confession of helplessness as this was all that was wanted to rouse mr mool he rejected the pocket book and wrote the address on a telegram return directly your wife is seriously ill in five minutes more the message was on its way to scotland and mr null was at liberty to tell his melancholy story if he could with assistance from mr mool he got through it this morning he proceeded i have had the two best opinions in london assuming that there is no hereditary taint the doctors think favourably of mrs gallilee's chances of recovery is it violent madness mr mool asked mr null admitted that two nurses were required the doctors don't look on her violence as a discouraging symptom he said they are inclined to attribute it to the strength of her constitution i felt it my duty to place my own knowledge of the case before them without mentioning painful family circumstances i happen to be acquainted with the circumstances mr mool interposed are they in any way connected with this dreadful state of things he put that question eagerly as if he had some strong personal interest in hearing the reply mr null blundered on steadily with his story i thought it right with all due reserve to mention that mrs gallilee had been subjected to i won't trouble you with medical language let us say to a severe shock involving mental disturbance as well as bodily injury before her reason gave way and they considered that to be the cause mr null asserted his dignity the doctors agreed with me that it had shaken her power of self control you relieve me mr null you infinitely relieve me if our way of removing the children had done the mischief i should never have forgiven myself he blushed and said no more had mr null noticed the slip of the tongue into which his agitation had betrayed him mr null did certainly look as if he was going to put a question the lawyer desperately forestalled him may i ask how you came to apply to me for mr gallilee's address did you think of it yourself mr null had never had an idea of his own from the day of his birth downward a very intelligent man he answered reminded me that you were an old friend of mr gallilee in short it was joseph the footman at fairfield gardens joseph's good opinion was of no importance to mr mool's professional interests he could gratify mr null's curiosity without fear of lowering himself in the estimation of a client i had better perhaps explain that chance allusion of mine to the children he began my good friend mr gallilee had his own reasons for removing his daughters from home for a time reasons i am bound to add in which i concur the children were to be placed under the care of their aunt lady northlake unfortunately her ladyship was away with my lord cruising in their yacht they were not able to receive maria and zoe at once in the interval that elapsed excuse my entering into particulars our excellent friend had his own domestic reasons for arranging the the sort of clandestine departure which did in fact take place it was perhaps unwise on my part to consent in short i permitted some of the necessary clothing to be privately deposited here and called for on the way to the station very unprofessional i am aware i did it for the best and allowed my friendly feeling to mislead me can i be of any use how is poor miss carmina no better oh dear dear mr ovid will hear dreadful news when he comes home can't we prepare him for it in any way mr null announced that a telegram would meet ovid at queenstown with the air of a man who had removed every obstacle that could be suggested to him the kind hearted lawyer shook his head is there no friend who can meet him there mr mool suggested i have clients depending on me cases in which property is concerned and reputation is at stake or i would gladly go myself you with your patients are as little at liberty as i am can't you think of some other friend mr null could think of nobody and had nothing to propose of the three weak men now brought into association by the influence of domestic calamity he was the feeblest beyond all doubt mr mool had knowledge of law and could on occasion be incited to energy mr gallilee had warm affections which being stimulated could at least assert themselves mr null professionally and personally was incapable of stepping beyond his own narrow limits under any provocation whatever he submitted to the force of events as a cabbage leaf submits to the teeth of a rabbit after leaving the office carmina's medical attendant had his patient to see since the unfortunate alarm in the house he had begun to feel doubtful and anxious about her again in the sitting room he found teresa and the landlady in consultation in her own abrupt way the nurse made him acquainted with the nature of the conference we have two worries to bother us she said and the music master is the worst of the two there's a notion at the hospital set agoing i don't doubt by the man himself that i crushed his fingers on purpose that's a lie with the open cupboard door between us how could i see him or he see me when i gave it a push to i no more knew where his hand was than you do if i meant anything i meant to slap his face for prying about in my room we've made out a writing between us to show to the doctors you shall have a copy in case you're asked about it now for the other matter you keep on telling me i shall fall ill myself if i don't get a person to help me with carmina make your mind easy the person has come where is she teresa pointed to the bedroom recommended by me mr null inquired recommended by herself and we don't like her that's the other worry mr null's dignity declined to attach any importance to the other worry no nurse has any business here without my sanction i'll send her away directly he pushed open the baize door a lady was sitting by carmina's bedside even in the dim light there was no mistaking that face mr null recognised miss minerva she rose and bowed to him he returned the bow stiffly nature's protecting care of fools supplies them with an instinct which distrusts ability mr null never liked miss minerva at the same time he was a little afraid of her this was not the sort of nurse who could be ordered to retire at a moment's notice i have been waiting anxiously to see you she said and led the way to the farther end of the room carmina terrifies me she added in a whisper i have been here for an hour when i entered the room her face poor dear seemed to come to life again she was able to express her joy at seeing me even the jealous old nurse noticed the change for the better why didn't it last look at her oh look at her the melancholy relapse that had followed the short interval of excitement was visible to anyone now there was the simulated paralysis showing itself plainly in every part of the face she lay still as death looking vacantly at the foot of the bed mr null was inclined to resent the interference of a meddling woman in the discharge of his duty he felt carmina's pulse in sulky silence her eyes never moved her hand showed no consciousness of his touch teresa opened the door and looked in impatiently eager to see the intruding nurse sent away miss minerva invited her to return to her place at the bedside i only ask to occupy it she said considerately when you want rest teresa was ready with an ungracious reply but found no opportunity of putting it into words miss minerva turned quickly to mr null i must ask you to let me say a few words more she continued i will wait for you in the next room her resolute eyes rested on him with a look which said plainly i mean to be heard he followed her into the sitting room and waited in sullen submission to hear what she had to say i must not trouble you by entering into my own affairs she began i will only say that i have obtained an engagement much sooner than i had anticipated and that the convenience of my employers made it necessary for me to meet them in paris i owed carmina a letter but i had reasons for not writing until i knew whether she had or had not left london with that object i called this morning at her aunt's house you now see me here after what i have heard from the servants i make no comment and i ask for no explanations one thing only i must know teresa refers me to you is carmina attended by any other medical man mr null answered stiffly i am in consultation with doctor benjulia and i expect him to day the reply startled her dr benjulia she repeated the greatest man we have mr null asserted in his most positive manner she silently determined to wait until doctor benjulia arrived what is the last news of mr ovid she said to him after an interval of consideration he told her the news in the fewest words possible even he observed that it seemed to excite her oh mr null who is to prepare him for what he will see in that room who is to tell him what he must hear of his mother there was a certain familiarity in the language of this appeal which mr null felt it necessary to discourage the matter is left in my hands he announced i shall telegraph to him at queenstown when he comes home he will find my prescriptions on the table being a medical man himself my treatment of the case will tell mr ovid vere everything the obstinate insensibility of his tone stopped her on the point of saying what mr mool had said already she too felt for ovid when she thought of the cruel brevity of a telegram at what date will the vessel reach queenstown she asked by way of making sure said mr null i shall telegraph in a week's time she troubled him with no more inquiries he had purposely remained standing in the expectation that she would take the hint and go and he now walked to the window and looked out she remained in her chair thinking in a few minutes more there was a heavy step on the stairs benjulia had arrived he looked hard at miss minerva in unconcealed surprise at finding her in the house she rose and made an effort to propitiate him by shaking hands i am very anxious she said gently to hear your opinion your hand tells me that he answered it's a cold hand on a warm day you're an excitable woman he looked at mr null and led the way into the bedroom left by herself miss minerva discovered writing materials placed ready for mr null's next prescription on a side table she made use of them at once to write to her employer a dear friend of mine is seriously ill and in urgent need of all that my devotion can do for her if you are willing to release me from my duties for a short time your sympathy and indulgence will not be thrown away on an ungrateful woman if you cannot do me this favour i ask your pardon for putting you to inconvenience and leave some other person whose mind is at ease to occupy the place which i am for the present unfit to fill having completed her letter in those terms she waited benjulia's return there was sadness in her face but no agitation as she looked patiently towards the bedroom door at last in her inmost heart she knew it the victory over herself was a victory won carmina could trust her now and ovid himself should see it mr null returned to the sitting room alone doctor benjulia had no time to spare he had left the bedroom by the other door i may say as you seem anxious that my colleague approves of a proposal on my part to slightly modify the last prescription we recognise the new symptoms without feeling alarm having issued this bulletin mr null sat down to make his feeble treatment of his patient feebler still when he looked up again the room was empty had she left the house no her travelling hat and her gloves were on the other table had she boldly confronted teresa on her own ground he took his modified prescription into the bedroom there she was and there sat the implacable nurse already persuaded into listening to her what conceivable subject could there be which offered two such women neutral ground to meet on mr null left the house without the faintest suspicion that carmina might be the subject may i try to rouse her teresa answered by silently resigning her place at the bedside miss minerva touched carmina's hand and spoke have you heard the good news dear ovid is coming back in little more than a week carmina looked reluctantly looked at her friend and said with an effort i am glad you will be better miss minerva continued the moment you see him her face became faintly animated i shall be able to say good bye she answered not good bye darling he is returning to you after a long journey i am going frances on a longer journey still she closed her eyes too weary or too indifferent to say more miss minerva drew back struggling against the tears that fell fast over her face the jealous old nurse quietly moved nearer to her and kissed her hand i've been a brute and a fool said teresa you're almost as fond of her as i am a week later miss minerva left london to wait for ovid at queenstown chapter lvii mr mool was in attendance at fairfield gardens when his old friend arrived from scotland to tell him what the cautiously expressed message in the telegram really meant but one idea seemed to be impressed on mr gallilee's mind the idea of reconciliation he insisted on seeing his wife it was in vain to tell him that she was utterly incapable of reciprocating or even of understanding his wishes absolute resistance was the one alternative left and it was followed by distressing results the kind hearted old man burst into a fit of crying which even shook the resolution of the doctors one of them went upstairs to warn the nurses the other said let him see her the instant he showed himself in the room mrs gallilee recognised him with a shriek of fury the nurses held her back while mr mool dragged him out again and shut the door the object of the doctors had been gained his own eyes had convinced him of the terrible necessity of placing his wife under restraint she was removed to a private asylum maria and zo had been left in scotland as perfectly happy as girls could be in the society of their cousins and under the affectionate care of their aunt mr gallilee remained in london but he was not left alone in the deserted house the good lawyer had a spare room at his disposal and mrs mool and her daughters received him with true sympathy coming events helped to steady his mind he was comforted in the anticipation of ovid's return and interested in hearing of the generous motive which had led miss minerva to meet his stepson i never agreed with the others when they used to abuse our governess he said she might have been quick tempered and she might have been ugly i suppose i saw her in some other light myself he had truly seen her under another light in his simple affectionate nature there had been instinctive recognition of that great heart he was allowed to see carmina in the hope that pleasant associations connected with him might have a favourable influence she smiled faintly and gave him her hand when she saw him at the bedside but that was all too deeply distressed to ask to see her again he made his inquiries for the future at the door day after day the answer was always the same before she left london miss minerva had taken it on herself to engage the vacant rooms on the ground floor of the lodging house for ovid she knew his heart as she knew her own heart once under the same roof with carmina he would leave it no more until life gave her back to him or death took her away hearing of what had been done mr gallilee removed to ovid's rooms the writing desk and the books the favourite music and the faded flowers left by carmina at fairfield gardens anything that belongs to her he thought will surely be welcome to the poor fellow when he comes back on one afternoon never afterwards to be forgotten he had only begun to make his daily inquiry when the door on the ground floor was opened and miss minerva beckoned to him her face daunted mr gallilee he asked in a whisper if ovid had returned she pointed upwards and answered he is with her now how did he bear it we don't know we were afraid to follow him into the room she turned towards the window as she spoke teresa was sitting there vacantly looking out mr gallilee spoke to her kindly she made no answer she never even moved worn out miss minerva whispered to him when she thinks of carmina now she thinks without hope he shuddered the expression of his own fear was in those words and he shrank from it miss minerva took his hand and led him to a chair ovid will know best she reminded him let us wait for what ovid will say did you meet him on board the vessel mr gallilee asked yes how did he look so well and so strong that you would hardly have known him again till he asked about carmina then he turned pale i knew that i must tell him the truth but i was afraid to take it entirely on myself something mr null said to me before i left london suggested that i might help ovid to understand me if i took the prescriptions to queenstown i had not noticed that they were signed by doctor benjulia as well as by mr null don't ask me what effect the discovery had on him i bore it at the time i can't speak of it now you good creature you dear good creature forgive me if i have distressed you i didn't meant it you have not distressed me is there anything else i can tell you mr gallilee hesitated there is one thing more he said it isn't about carmina this time he hesitated again miss minerva understood yes she answered i spoke to ovid of his mother in mercy to himself and to me he would hear no details 'i know enough' he said 'if i know that she is the person to blame i was prepared to hear it my mother's silence could only be accounted for in one way when i had read zo's letter' don't you know mr gallilee that the child wrote to ovid the surprise and delight of zo's fond old father when he heard the story of the letter forced a smile from miss minerva even at that time of doubt and sorrow he declared that he would have returned to his daughter by the mail train of that night but for two considerations he must see his stepson before he went back to scotland and he must search all the toy shops in london for the most magnificent present that could be offered to a young person of ten years old tell ovid with my love i'll call again to morrow he said looking at his watch i have just time to write to zo by to day's post he went to his club for the first time since he had returned to london miss minerva thought of bygone days and wondered if he would enjoy his champagne a little later mr null called anxious to know if ovid had arrived other women in the position of miss minerva and teresa might have hesitated to keep the patient's room closed to the doctor these two were resolved they refused to disturb ovid even by sending up a message mr null took offence understand both of you he said when i call to morrow morning i shall insist on going upstairs and if i find this incivility repeated i shall throw up the case he left the room triumphing in his fool's paradise of aggressive self conceit they waited for some time longer and still no message reached them from upstairs we may be wrong in staying here miss minerva suggested he may want to be alone when he leaves her let us go she rose to return to the house of her new employers they respected her and felt for her while carmina's illness continued she had the entire disposal of her time the nurse accompanied her to the door resigned to take refuge in the landlady's room i'm afraid to be by myself teresa said even that woman's chatter is better for me than my own thoughts before parting for the night they waited in the hall looking towards the stairs and listening anxiously not a sound disturbed the melancholy silence chapter lviii among many vain hopes one hope had been realised they had met again in the darkened room her weary eyes could hardly have seen the betrayal of what he suffered even if she had looked up in his face she was content to rest her head on his breast and to feel his arm round her i am glad dear she said to have lived long enough for this those were her first words after the first kiss she had trembled and sighed when he ran to her and bent over her it was the one expression left of all her joy and all her love but it passed away as other lesser agitations had passed away one last reserve of energy obeyed the gentle persuasion of love silent towards all other friends she was able to speak to ovid you used to breathe so lightly she said how is it that i hear you now oh ovid don't cry i couldn't bear that he answered her quietly don't be afraid darling i won't distress you and you will let me say what i want to say oh yes this satisfied her i may rest a little now she said he too was silent held down by the heavy hand of despair the time had been in the days of his failing health when the solemn shadows of evening falling over the fields the soaring song of the lark in the bright heights of the midday sky the dear lost remembrances that the divine touch of music finds again brought tears into his eyes they were dry eyes now those once tremulous nerves had gathered steady strength on the broad prairies and in the roving life could trembling sorrow seeking its way to the sources of tears overbear the robust vitality that rioted in his blood whether she lived or whether she died in those deep breathings that had alarmed her she had indeed heard the struggle of grief vainly urging its way to expression against the masterful health and strength that set moral weakness at defiance nature had remade this man and nature never pities it was an effort to her to collect her thoughts but she did collect them she was able to tell him what was in her mind do you think ovid your mother will care much what becomes of me when i die he started at those dreadful words so softly so patiently spoken you will live he said my carmina what am i here for but to bring you back to life she made no attempt to dispute with him quietly persistently she returned to the thought that was in her say that i forgive your mother ovid and that i only ask one thing in return i ask her to leave me to you when the end has come my dear there is a feeling in me that i can't get over don't let me be buried in a great place all crowded with the dead i once saw a picture it was at home in italy i think an english picture of a quiet little churchyard in the country the shadows of the trees rested on the lonely graves and some great poet had written oh such beautiful words about it the red breast loves to build and warble there and little footsteps lightly print the ground promise ovid you will take me to some place far from crowds and noise where children may gather the flowers on my grave he promised and she thanked him and rested again there was something else she said when the interval had passed my head is so sleepy i wonder whether i can think of it after a while she did think of it i want to make you a little farewell present will you undo my gold chain don't cry ovid oh don't cry he obeyed her the gold chain held the two lockets the treasured portraits of her father and her mother wear them for my sake she murmured lift me up i want to put them round your neck myself she tried vainly tried to clasp the chain her head fell back on his breast too sleepy she said always too sleepy now say you love me ovid he said it kiss me dear he kissed her now lay me down on the pillow i'm not eighteen yet and i feel as old as eighty rest all i want is rest looking at him fondly her eyes closed little by little then softly opened again don't wait in this dull room darling i will send for you if i wake it was the only wish of hers that he disobeyed from time to time his fingers touched her pulse and felt its feeble beat from time to time he stooped and let the faint coming and going of her breath flutter on his cheek the twilight fell and darkness began to gather over the room still he kept his place by her like a man entranced chapter lix the first trivial sound that broke the spell was the sound of a match struck in the next room he rose and groped his way to the door teresa had ventured upstairs and had kindled a light some momentary doubt of him kept the nurse silent when he looked at her he stammered and stared about him confusedly when he spoke where where he seemed to have lost his hold on his thoughts he gave it up and tried again i want to be alone he said recovering for the moment some power of expressing himself teresa's first fear of him vanished she took him by the hand like a child and led him downstairs to his rooms he stood silently watching her while she lit the candles when carmina sleeps now he asked does it last long often for hours together the nurse answered he said no more he seemed to have forgotten that there was another person in the room she found courage in her pity for him try to pray she said and left him he fell on his knees but still the words failed him he tried to quiet his mind by holy thoughts no the dumb agony in him was powerless to find relief only the shadows of thoughts crossed his mind his eyes ached with a burning heat he began to be afraid of himself the active habits of the life that he had left drove him out with the instincts of an animal into space and air neither knowing nor caring in what direction he turned his steps he walked on at the top of his speed on and on till the crowded houses began to grow more rare till there were gaps of open ground on either side of him till the moon rose behind a plantation of trees and bathed in its melancholy light a lonely high road he followed the road till he was tired of it and turned aside into a winding lane the lights and shadows alternating with each other soothed and pleased him he had got the relief in exercise that had been denied him while he was in repose he could think again he could feel the resolution stirring in him to save that dear one or to die with her now at last he was man enough to face the terrible necessity that confronted him and fight the battle of art and love against death he stopped and looked round eager to return and be ready for her waking in that solitary place there was no hope of finding a person to direct him he turned to go back to the high road at that same moment he became conscious of the odour of tobacco wafted towards him on the calm night air some one was smoking in the lane he retraced his steps until he reached a gate with a barren field behind it there was the man whose tobacco smoke he had smelt leaning on the gate with his pipe in his mouth the moonlight fell full on ovid's face as he approached to ask his way the man suddenly stood up stared at him and said hullo is it you or your ghost his face was in shadow but his voice answered for him the man was benjulia have you come to see me he asked no won't you shake hands no what's wrong ovid waited to answer until he had steadied his temper i have seen carmina he said benjulia went on with his smoking an interesting case isn't it he remarked you were called into consultation by mr null ovid continued and you approved of his ignorant treatment you who knew better i should think i did benjulia rejoined you deliberately encouraged an incompetent man you let that poor girl go on from bad to worse for some vile end of your own benjulia good naturedly corrected him no no for an excellent end for knowledge if i fail to remedy the mischief which is your doing and yours alone benjulia took his pipe out of his mouth how do you mean to cure her he eagerly interposed have you got a new idea if i fail ovid repeated her death lies at your door you merciless villain as certainly as that moon is now shining over us your life shall answer for hers astonishment immeasurable astonishment sealed benjulia's lips he looked down the lane when ovid left him completely stupefied the one imaginable way of accounting for such language as he had heard spoken by a competent member of his own profession presented the old familiar alternative drunk or mad he wondered while he lit his pipe again walking back to the house his old distrust of ovid troubled him once more he decided to call at teresa's lodgings in a day or two and ascertain from the landlady and the chemist how carmina was being cured returning to the high road ovid was passed by a tradesman driving his cart towards london the man civilly offered to take him as far as the nearest outlying cabstand neither the landlady nor teresa had gone to their beds when he returned their account of carmina during his absence contained nothing to alarm him he bade them goodnight eager to be left alone in his room in the house and out of the house there was now the perfect silence that helps a man to think his mind was clear his memory answered when he called on it to review that part of his own medical practice which might help him by experience in his present need but he shrank with carmina's life in his hands from trusting wholly to himself a higher authority than his was waiting to be consulted he took from his portmanteau the manuscript presented to him by the poor wretch whose last hours he had soothed in the garret at montreal the work opened with a declaration which gave it a special value in ovid's estimation if this imperfect record of experience is ever read by other eyes than mine i wish to make one plain statement at the outset the information which is presented in these pages is wholly derived from the results of bedside practice pursued under miserable obstacles and interruptions and spread over a period of many years whatever faults and failings i may have been guilty of as a man i am innocent in my professional capacity of ever having perpetrated the useless and detestable cruelties which go by the name of vivisection without entering into any of the disputes on either side which this practice has provoked i declare my conviction that no asserted usefulness in the end can justify deliberate cruelty in the means the man who seriously maintains that any pursuit in which he can engage is independent of moral restraint is a man in a state of revolt against god i refuse to hear him in his own defense on that ground ovid turned next to the section of the work which was entitled brain disease the writer introduced his observations in these prefatory words a celebrated physiologist plainly avowing the ignorance of doctors in the matter of the brain and its diseases and alluding to appearances presented by post mortem examination concludes his confession thus 'we cannot even be sure whether many of the changes discovered are the cause or the result of the disease or whether the two are the conjoint results of a common cause' so this man writes after experience in vivisection let my different experience be heard next not knowing into what hands this manuscript may fall or what unexpected opportunities of usefulness it may encounter after my death i purposely abstain from using technical language in the statement which i have now to make in medical investigations as in all other forms of human inquiry the result in view is not infrequently obtained by indirect and unexpected means what i have to say here on the subject of brain disease was first suggested by experience of two cases which seemed in the last degree unlikely to help me they were both cases of young women each one having been hysterically affected by a serious moral shock terminating after a longer or shorter interval in simulated paralysis one of these cases i treated successfully while i was still in attendance on the other pursuing the same course of treatment which events had already proved to be right a fatal accident terminated my patient's life and rendered a post mortem examination necessary from those starting points i arrived by devious ways which i am now to relate at deductions and discoveries that threw a new light on the nature and treatment of brain disease hour by hour ovid studied the pages that followed until his mind and the mind of the writer were one he then returned to certain preliminary allusions to the medical treatment of the two girls inexpressibly precious to him in carmina's present interests the dawn of day found him prepared at all points and only waiting until the lapse of the next few hours placed the means of action in his hands but there was one anxiety still to be relieved before he lay down to rest he took off his shoes and stole upstairs to carmina's door the faithful teresa was astir earnestly persuading her to take some nourishment the little that he could hear of her voice as she answered made his heart ache it was so faint and so low still she could speak and still there was the old saying to remember which has comforted so many and deceived so many while there's life there's hope chapter lx after a brief interview with his step son mr gallilee returned to his daughters in scotland touched by his fatherly interest in carmina ovid engaged to keep him informed of her progress towards recovery if the anticipation of saving her proved to be the sad delusion of love and hope silence would signify what no words could say in ten days' time there was a happy end to suspense the slow process of recovery might extend perhaps to the end of the year but if no accident happened ovid had the best reasons for believing that carmina's life was safe freed from the terrible anxieties that had oppressed him he was able to write again a few days later in a cheerful tone and to occupy his pen at mr gallilee's express request with such an apparently trifling subject as the conduct of mr null your old medical adviser was quite right in informing you that i had relieved him from any further attendance on carmina but his lively imagination or perhaps i ought to say his sense of his own consequence has misled you when he also declares that i purposely insulted him i took the greatest pains not to wound his self esteem he left me in anger nevertheless a day or two afterwards i received a note from him addressing me as 'sir' and asking ironically if i had any objection to his looking at the copies of my prescriptions in the chemist's book though he was old enough to be my father he remarked it seemed that experience counted for nothing he had still something to learn from his junior in the treatment of disease and so on at that miserable time of doubt and anxiety i could only send a verbal reply leaving him to do what he liked before i tell you of the use that he made of his liberty of action i must confess something relating to the prescriptions themselves don't be afraid of long and learned words and don't suppose that i am occupying your attention in this way without a serious reason for it which you will presently understand a note in the manuscript to my study of which i owe under god the preservation of carmina's life warned me that chemists in the writer's country had either refused to make up certain prescriptions given in the work or had taken the liberty of altering the new quantities and combinations of some of the drugs prescribed precisely the same thing happened here in the case of the first chemist to whom i sent he refused to make up the medicine unless i provided him with a signed statement taking the whole responsibility on myself having ascertained the exact nature of his objection i dismissed him without his guarantee and employed another chemist taking care in the interests of my time and my temper to write my more important prescriptions under reserve that is to say i followed the conventional rules as to quantities and combinations and made the necessary additions or changes from my own private stores when the medicine was sent home poor foolish mr null finding nothing to astonish him in my course of medicine as represented by the chemist appears by his own confession to have copied the prescriptions with a malicious object in view 'i have sent them he informs me in a second letter to doctor benjulia in order that he too may learn something in his profession from the master who has dispensed with our services' this new effort of irony means that i stand self condemned of vanity in presuming to rely on my own commonplace resources represented by the deceitful evidence of the chemist's book but i am grateful to mr null notwithstanding he has done me a service in meaning to do me an injury my imperfect prescriptions have quieted the mind of the man to whom he sent them this wretch's distrust has long since falsely suspected me of some professional rivalry pursued in secret the feeling showed itself again when i met with him by accident on the night of my return to london since mr null has communicated with him the landlady is no longer insulted by his visits and offended by his questions all relating to the course of treatment which i was pursuing upstairs you now understand why i have ventured to trouble you on a purely professional topic to turn to matters of more interest our dear carmina is well enough to remember you and to send her love to you and the girls but even this little effort is followed by fatigue i don't mean only fatigue of body that is now a question of time and care i mean fatigue of mind expressing itself by defect of memory on the morning when the first positive change for the better appeared i was at her bedside when she woke she looked at me in amazement 'why didn't you warn me of your sudden return' she asked 'i have only written to you to day to your bankers at quebec what does it mean' i did my best to soothe her and succeeded there is a complete lapse in her memory i am only too sure of it she has no recollection of anything that has happened since she wrote her last letter to me a letter which must have been lost perhaps intercepted or i should have received it before i left quebec this forgetfulness of the dreadful trials through which my poor darling has passed is in itself a circumstance which we must all rejoice over for her sake but i am discouraged by it at the same time fearing it may indicate some more serious injury than i have yet discovered miss minerva what should i do without the help and sympathy of that best of true women miss minerva has cautiously tested her memory in other directions with encouraging results so far but i shall not feel easy until i have tried further experiments by means of some person who does not exercise a powerful influence over her and whose memory is naturally occupied with what we older people call trifles when you all leave scotland next month bring zo here with you my dear little correspondent is just the sort of quaint child i want for the purpose kiss her for me till she is out of breath and say that is what i mean to do when we meet the return to london took place in the last week in october lord and lady northlake went to their town residence taking maria and zo with them there were associations connected with fairfield gardens which made the prospect of living there without even the society of his children unendurable to mr gallilee ovid's house still waiting the return of its master was open to his step father the poor man was only too glad in his own simple language to keep the nest warm for his son the latest inquiries made at the asylum were hopefully answered thus far the measures taken to restore mrs gallilee to herself had succeeded beyond expectation but one unfavourable symptom remained she was habitually silent when she did speak her mind seemed to be occupied with scientific subjects she never mentioned her husband or any other member of the family time and attention would remove this drawback in two or three months more perhaps if all went well she might return to her family and her friends as sane a woman as ever calling at fairfield gardens for any letters that might be waiting there mr gallilee received a circular in lithographed writing accompanied by a roll of thick white paper the signature revealed the familiar name of mr le frank the circular set forth that the writer had won renown and a moderate income as pianist and teacher of music a terrible accident ladies and gentlemen has injured my right hand and has rendered amputation of two of my fingers necessary deprived for life of my professional resources i have but one means of subsistence left viz collecting subscriptions for a song of my own composition nb the mutilated musician leaves the question of terms in the hands of the art loving public and will do himself the honour of calling to morrow good natured mr gallilee left a sovereign to be given to the victim of circumstances and then set forth for lord northlake's house he and ovid had arranged that zo was to be taken to see carmina that day on his way through the streets he was met by mr mool the lawyer looked at the song under his friend's arm what's that you're taking such care of he asked it looks like music a new piece for the young ladies eh mr gallilee explained mr mool struck his stick on the pavement as the nearest available means of expressing indignation never let another farthing of your money get into that rascal's pocket it's no merit of his that the poor old italian nurse has not made her appearance in the police reports with this preface mr mool related the circumstances under which mr le frank had met with his accident his first proceeding when they discharged him from the hospital continued the lawyer was to summon teresa before a magistrate fortunately she showed the summons to me i appeared for her provided with a plan of the rooms which spoke for itself and i put two questions to the complainant what business had he in another person's room and why was his hand in that other person's cupboard the reporter kindly left the case unrecorded and when the fellow ended by threatening the poor woman outside the court we bound him over to keep the peace i have my eye on him and i'll catch him yet under the vagrant act chapter lxi aided by time care and skill carmina had gained strength enough to pass some hours of the day in the sitting room reclining in an invalid chair invented for her by ovid the welcome sight of zo brightened and developed by happy autumn days passed in scotland brought a deep flush to her face and quickened the pulse which ovid was touching under pretence of holding her hand these signs of excessive nervous sensibility warned him to limit the child's visit to a short space of time neither miss minerva nor teresa were in the room carmina could have zo all to herself now my dear she said in a kiss tell me about scotland scotland zo answered with dignity belongs to uncle northlake he pays for everything and i'm missus it's true said mr gallilee bursting with pride my lord says it's no use having a will of your own where zo is when he introduces her to anybody on the estate he says 'here's the missus' mr gallilee's youngest daughter listened critically to the parental testimony you see he knows she said to ovid there's nothing to laugh at carmina tried another question did you think of me dear when you were far away think of you zo repeated you're to sleep in my bedroom when we go back to scotland and i'm to be out of bed and one of 'em when you eat your first scotch dinner shall i tell you what you'll see on the table you'll see a big brown steaming bag in a dish and you'll see me slit it with a knife and the bag's fat inside will tumble out all smoking hot and stinking that's a scotch dinner oh she cried losing her dignity in the sudden interest of a new idea oh carmina do you remember the italian boy and his song here was one of those tests of her memory for trifles applied with a child's happy abruptness for which ovid had been waiting he listened eagerly to his unutterable relief carmina laughed of course i remember it she said who could forget the boy who sings and grins and says gimmeehaypenny that's it cried zo the boy's song was a good one in its way i've learnt a better in scotland you've heard of donald haven't you no zo turned indignantly to her father why didn't you tell her of donald mr gallilee humbly admitted that he was in fault carmina asked who donald was and what he was like zo unconsciously tested her memory for the second time you know that day she said when joseph had an errand at the grocer's and i went along with him and miss minerva said i was a vulgar child carmina's memory recalled this new trifle without an effort i know she answered you told me joseph and the grocer weighed you in the great scales zo delighted ovid by trying her again when they put me into the scales carmina what did i weigh nearly four stone dear quite four stone donald weighs fourteen' what do you think of that mr gallilee once more offered his testimony the biggest piper on my lord's estate he began comes of a highland family and was removed to the lowlands by my lord's father a great player and my friend zo explained stopping her father in full career he takes snuff out of a cow's horn he shovels it up his fat nose with a spoon like this his nose wags he says 'try my sneeshin' sneeshin's scotch for snuff he boos till he's nearly double when uncle northlake speaks to him boos is scotch for bows he skirls on the pipes skirls means screeches when you first hear him he'll make your stomach ache you'll get used to that and you'll find you like him he wears a purse and a petticoat he never had a pair of trousers on in his life there's no pride about him say you're my friend and he'll let you smack his legs here ovid was obliged to bring the biography of donald to a close carmina's enjoyment of zo was becoming too keen for her strength her bursts of laughter grew louder and louder the wholesome limit of excitement was being rapidly passed tell us about your cousins he said by way of effecting a diversion the big ones zo asked no the little ones like you nice girls they play at everything i tell 'em jolly boys when they knock a girl down they pick her up again and clean her carmina was once more in danger of passing the limit ovid made another attempt to effect a diversion singing would be comparatively harmless in its effect as he rashly supposed what's that song you learnt in scotland he asked it's donald's song zo replied he taught me at the sound of donald's dreadful name ovid looked at his watch and said there was no time for the song mr gallilee suddenly and seriously sided with his step son how she got among the men after dinner he said nobody knows lady northlake has forbidden donald to teach her any more songs and i have requested him as a favour to me not to let her smack his legs come my dear it's time we were home again well intended by both gentlemen but too late zo was ready for the performance her hat was cocked on one side her plump little arms were set akimbo her round eyes opened and closed facetiously in winks worthy of a low comedian i'm donald she announced and burst out with the song we're gayly yet we're gayly yet we're not very fou but we're gayly yet then sit ye awhile and tipple a bit for we're not very fou but we're gayly yet she snatched up carmina's medicine glass and waved it over her head with a bacchanalian screech fill a brimmer tammie here's to redshanks and pray who is redshanks asked a lady standing in the doorway zo turned round and instantly collapsed a terrible figure associated with lessons and punishments stood before her the convivial friend of donald the established missus of lord northlake disappeared and a polite pupil took their place if you please miss minerva redshanks is nickname for a highlander who would have recognised the singer of we're gayly yet in the subdued young person who made that reply the door opened again another disastrous intrusion yes another teresa appeared this time caught zo up in her arms and gave the child a kiss that was heard all over the room ah mia giocosa cried the old nurse too happy to speak in any language but her own what does that mean zo asked settling her ruffled petticoats it means said teresa who prided herself on her english ah my jolly this to a young lady who could slit a haggis this to the only person in scotland privileged to smack donald's legs zo turned to her father and recovered her dignity maria herself could hardly have spoken with more severe propriety i wish to go home said zo ovid had only to look at carmina and to see the necessity of immediate compliance with his little sister's wishes no more laughing no more excitement for that day he led zo out himself and resigned her to her father at the door of his rooms on the ground floor cheered already by having got away from miss minerva and the nurse zo desired to know who lived downstairs and hearing that these were ovid's rooms insisted on seeing them the three went in together ovid drew mr gallilee into a corner i'm easier about carmina now he said the failure of her memory doesn't extend backwards it begins with the shock to her brain on the day when teresa removed her to this house and it will end i feel confident with the end of her illness mr gallilee's attention suddenly wandered zo he called out don't touch your brother's papers the one object that had excited the child's curiosity was the writing table dozens of sheets of paper were scattered over it covered with writing blotted and interlined some of these leaves had overflowed the table and found a resting place on the floor zo was amusing herself by picking them up well she said handing them obediently to ovid i've had many a rap on the knuckles for writing not half as bad as yours hearing his daughter's remark mr gallilee became interested in looking at the fragments of manuscript what an awful mess he exclaimed may i try if i can read a bit ovid smiled try by all means you will make one useful discovery at least you will see that the most patient men on the face of the civilised earth are printers mr gallilee tried a page and gave it up before he turned giddy is it fair to ask what this is something easy to feel and hard to express ovid answered these ill written lines are my offering of gratitude to the memory of an unknown and unhappy man the man you told me of who died at montreal yes you never mentioned his name his last wishes forbade me to mention it to any living creature god knows there were pitiable most pitiable reasons for his dying unknown the stone over his grave only bears his initials and the date of his death but said ovid kindling with enthusiasm as he laid his hand on his manuscript the discoveries of this great physician shall benefit humanity and my debt to him shall be acknowledged with the admiration and the devotion that i truly feel in a book asked mr gallilee in a book that is now being printed you will see it before the new year finding nothing to amuse her in the sitting room zo had tried the bedroom next she now returned to ovid dragging after her a long white staff that looked like an alpen stock what's this she asked a broomstick a specimen of rare canadian wood my dear would you like to have it zo took the offer quite seriously she looked with longing eyes at the specimen three times as tall as herself and shook her head i'm not big enough for it yet she said look at it papa benjulia's stick is nothing to this that name on the child's lips had a sound revolting to ovid don't speak of him he said irritably mustn't i speak of him zo asked when i want him to tickle me ovid beckoned to her father take her away now he whispered and never let her see that man again the warning was needless the man's destiny had decreed that he and zo were never more to meet chapter lxii benjulia's servants had but a dull time of it poor souls in the lonely house towards the end of december they subscribed among themselves to buy one of those wonderful christmas numbers presenting year after year the same large eyed ladies long legged lovers corpulent children snow landscapes and gluttonous merry makings which have become a national institution say the pictorial plum puddings of the english nation the servants had plenty of time to enjoy their genial newspaper before the dining room bell disturbed them for some weeks past the master had again begun to spend the whole of his time in the mysterious laboratory on the rare occasions when he returned to the house he was always out of temper if the servants knew nothing else they knew what these signs meant the great man was harder at work than ever and in spite of his industry he was not getting on so well as usual on this particular evening the bell rang at the customary time and the cook successor to the unfortunate creature with pretensions to beauty and sentiment hastened to get the dinner ready the footman turned to the dresser and took from it a little heap of newspapers carefully counting them before he ventured to carry them upstairs this was doctor benjulia's regular weekly supply of medical literature and here again the mysterious man presented an incomprehensible problem to his fellow creatures he subscribed to every medical publication in england and he never read one of them the footman cut the leaves and the master with his forefinger to help him ran his eye up and down the pages apparently in search of some announcement that he never found and still more extraordinary without showing the faintest sign of disappointment when he had done every week he briskly shoved his unread periodicals into a huge basket and sent them downstairs as waste paper the footman took up the newspapers and the dinner together and was received with frowns and curses he was abused for everything that he did in his own department and for everything that the cook had done besides whatever the master's working at he announced on returning to the kitchen he's farther away from hitting the right nail on the head than ever upon my soul i think i shall have to give warning let's relieve our minds where's the christmas number half an hour later the servants were startled by a tremendous bang of the house door which shook the whole building the footman ran upstairs the dining room was empty the master's hat was not on its peg in the hall and the medical newspapers were scattered about in the wildest confusion close to the fender lay a crumpled leaf torn out its position suggested that it had narrowly missed being thrown into the fire the footman smoothed it out and looked at it one side of the leaf contained a report of a lecture this was dry reading the footman tried the other side and found a review of a new medical work this would have been dull reading too but for an extract from a preface stating how the book came to be published and what wonderful discoveries relating to peoples' brains it contained there were some curious things said here especially about a melancholy deathbed at a place called montreal which made the preface almost as interesting as a story but what was there in this to hurry the master out of the house as if the devil had been at his heels doctor benjulia's nearest neighbour was a small farmer named gregg he was taking a nap that evening when his wife bounced into the room and said here's the big doctor gone mad and there he was truly at mrs gregg's heels clamouring to have the horse put to in the gig and to be driven to london instantly he said pay yourself what you please and opened his pocket book full of bank notes mr gregg said it seems sir this is a matter of life or death whereupon he looked at mr gregg and considered a little and becoming quiet on a sudden answered yes it is on the road to london he never once spoke except to himself and then only from time to time it seemed judging by what fell from him now and then that he was troubled about a man and a letter he had suspected the man all along but he had nevertheless given him the letter and now it had ended in the letter turning out badly for doctor benjulia himself where he went to in london it was not possible to say mr gregg's horse was not fast enough for him as soon as he could find one he took a cab the shopman of mr barrable the famous publisher of medical works had just put up the shutters and was going downstairs to his tea when he heard a knocking at the shop door the person proved to be a very tall man in a violent hurry to buy mr ovid vere's new book he said by way of apology that he was in that line himself and that his name was benjulia the shopman knew him by reputation and sold him the book he was in such a hurry to read it that he actually began in the shop it was necessary to tell him that business hours were over hearing this he ran out and told the cabman to drive as fast as possible to pall mall the library waiter at doctor benjulia's club found him in the library busy with a book he was quite alone the members at that hour of the evening being generally at dinner or in the smoking room the man whose business it was to attend to the fires went in during the night from time to time and always found him in the same corner it began to get late he finished his reading but it seemed to make no difference there he sat wide awake holding his closed book on his knee seemingly lost in his own thoughts this went on till it was time to close the club they were obliged to disturb him he said nothing and went slowly down into the hall leaving his book behind him it was an awful night raining and sleeting but he took no notice of the weather when they fetched a cab the driver refused to take him to where he lived on such a night as that he only said very well go to the nearest hotel the night porter at the hotel let in a tall gentleman and showed him into one of the bedrooms kept ready for persons arriving late having no luggage he paid the charges beforehand about eight o'clock in the morning he rang for the waiter who observed that his bed had not been slept in all he wanted for breakfast was the strongest coffee that could be made it was not strong enough to please him when he tasted it and he had some brandy put in he paid and was liberal to the waiter and went away the policeman on duty that day whose beat included the streets at the back of fairfield gardens noticed in one of them a tall gentleman walking backwards and forwards and looking from time to time at one particular house when he passed that way again there was the gentleman still patrolling the street and still looking towards the same house the policeman waited a little and watched the place was a respectable lodging house and the stranger was certainly a gentleman though a queer one to look at it was not the policeman's business to interfere on suspicion except in the case of notoriously bad characters so though he did think it odd he went on again between twelve and one o'clock in the afternoon ovid left his lodgings to go to the neighbouring livery stables and choose an open carriage the sun was shining and the air was brisk and dry after the stormy night it was just the day when he might venture to take carmina out for a drive on his way down the street he heard footsteps behind him and felt himself touched on the shoulder he turned and discovered benjulia on the point of speaking resentfully he restrained himself there was something in the wretch's face that struck him with horror benjulia said i won't keep you long i want to know one thing will she live or die her life is safe i hope through your new mode of treatment his eyes and his voice said more than his words ovid instantly knew that he had seen the book and that the book had forestalled him in the discovery to which he had devoted his life was it possible to pity a man whose hardened nature never pitied others all things are possible to a large heart ovid shrank from answering him benjulia spoke again when we met that night at my garden gate he said you told me my life should answer for her life if she died my neglect has not killed her and you have no need to keep your word but i don't get off mr ovid vere without paying the penalty you have taken something from me which was dearer than life i wished to tell you that i have no more to say ovid silently offered his hand benjulia's head drooped in thought the generous protest of the man whom he had injured spoke in that outstretched hand he looked at ovid no he said and walked away leaving the street he went round to fairfield gardens and rang the bell at mr gallilee's door the bell was answered by a polite old woman a stranger to him among the servants is zo in the house he inquired nobody's in the house sir it's to be let if you please as soon as the furniture can be moved do you know where zo is i mean mr gallilee's youngest child i'm sorry to say sir i'm not acquainted with the family he waited at the door apparently hesitating what to do next i'll go upstairs he said suddenly i want to look at the house you needn't go with me i know my way thank you kindly sir he went straight to the schoolroom the repellent melancholy of an uninhabited place had fallen on it already the plain furniture was not worth taking care of it was battered and old and left to dust and neglect there were two common deal writing desks formerly used by the two girls one of them was covered with splashes of ink varied here and there by barbarous caricatures of faces in which dots and strokes represented eyes noses and mouths he knew whose desk this was and opened the cover of it in the recess beneath were soiled tables of figures torn maps and dogs eared writing books the ragged paper cover of one of these last bore on its inner side a grotesquely imperfect inscription my cop book zo he tore off the cover and put it in the breast pocket of his coat i should have liked to tickle her once more he thought as he went down stairs again the polite old woman opened the door curtsying deferentially he gave her half a crown god bless you sir she burst out in a gush of gratitude he checked himself on the point of stepping into the street and looked at her with some curiosity do you believe in god he asked the old woman was even capable of making a confession of faith politely yes sir she said if you have no objection he stepped into the street i wonder whether she is right he thought it doesn't matter i shall soon know the servants were honestly glad to see him when he got home they had taken it in turn to sit up through the night knowing his regular habits and feeling the dread that some accident had happened never before had they seen him so fatigued he dropped helplessly into his chair his gigantic body shook with shivering fits the footman begged him to take some refreshment brandy and raw eggs he said these being brought to him he told them to wait until he rang and locked the door when they went out after waiting until the short winter daylight was at an end the footman ventured to knock and ask if the master wanted lights he replied that he had lit the candles for himself no smell of tobacco smoke came from the room and he had let the day pass without going to the laboratory these were portentous signs the footman said to his fellow servants there's something wrong the women looked at each other in vague terror one of them said hadn't we better give notice to leave and the other whispered a question do you think he's committed a crime towards ten o'clock the bell rang at last immediately afterwards they heard him calling to them from the hall i want you all three up here they went up together the two women anticipating a sight of horror and keeping close to the footman the master was walking quietly backwards and forwards in the room the table had pen and ink on it and was covered with writings he spoke to them in his customary tones there was not the slightest appearance of agitation in his manner i mean to leave this house and go away he began you are dismissed from my service for that reason only take your written characters from the table read them and say if there is anything to complain of there was nothing to complain of on another part of the table there were three little heaps of money a month's wages for each of you he explained in place of a month's warning i wish you good luck one of the women the one who had suggested giving notice to leave began to cry he took no notice of this demonstration and went on i want two of you to do me a favour before we part you will please witness the signature of my will the sensitive servant drew back directly no she said i couldn't do it i never heard the death watch before in winter time i heard it all last night the other two witnessed the signature they observed that the will was a very short one it was impossible not to notice the only legacy left the words crossed the paper just above the signatures and only occupied two lines i leave to zoe youngest daughter of mr john gallilee of fairfield gardens london everything absolutely of which i die possessed excepting the formal introductory phrases and the statement relating to the witnesses both copied from a handy book of law lying open on the table this was the will the female servants were allowed to go downstairs after having been informed that they were to leave the next morning the footman was detained in the dining room i am going to the laboratory the master said and i want a few things carried to the door the big basket for waste paper three times filled with letters and manuscripts the books the medicine chest and the stone jar of oil from the kitchen these the master and the man removed together setting them down at the laboratory door it was a still cold starlight winter's night the intermittent shriek of a railway whistle in the distance was the only sound that disturbed the quiet of the time good night said the master the man returned the salute and walked back to the house closing the front door he was now more firmly persuaded than ever that something was wrong in the hall the women were waiting for him what does it mean they asked keep quiet he said i'm going to see in another minute he was posted at the back of the house behind the edge of the wall looking out from this place he could see the light of the lamps in the laboratory streaming through the open door and the dark figure of the master coming and going as he removed the objects left outside into the building then the door was shut and nothing was visible but the dim glow that found its way to the skylight through the white blind inside he boldly crossed the open space of ground resolved to try what his ears might discover now that his eyes were useless he posted himself at the back of the laboratory close to one of the side walls now and then he heard what had reached his ears when he had been listening on former occasions the faint whining cries of animals these were followed by new sounds three smothered shrieks succeeding each other at irregular intervals made his blood run cold had three death strokes been dealt on some suffering creatures with the same sudden and terrible certainty silence horrible silence was all that answered in the distant railway there was an interval of peace the door was opened again the flood of light streamed out on the darkness suddenly the yellow glow was spotted by the black figures of small swiftly running creatures perhaps cats perhaps rabbits escaping from the laboratory the tall form of the master followed slowly and stood revealed watching the flight of the animals in a moment more the last of the liberated creatures came out a large dog limping as if one of its legs was injured it stopped as it passed the master and tried to fawn on him he threatened it with his hand be off with you like the rest he said the dog slowly crossed the flow of light and was swallowed up in darkness the last of them that could move was gone the death shrieks of the others had told their fate but still there stood the master alone a grand black figure with its head turned up to the stars the minutes followed one another the servant waited and watched him the solitary man had a habit well known to those about him of speaking to himself not a word escaped him now his upturned head never moved the bright wintry heaven held him spellbound at last the change came once more the silence was broken by the scream of the railway whistle he started like a person suddenly roused from deep sleep and went back into the laboratory the last sound then followed the locking and bolting of the door the servant left his hiding place his master's secret was no secret now he hated himself for eating that master's bread and earning that master's money one of the ignorant masses this man mere sentiment had a strange hold on his stupid mind the remembrance of the poor wounded dog companionable and forgiving under cruel injuries cut into his heart like a knife his thought at that moment was an act of treason to the royalty of knowledge i wish to god i could lame him as he has lamed the dog another fanatic another fool oh science be merciful to the fanatics and the fools when he got back to the house the women were still on the look out for him don't speak to me now he said get to your beds and mind this let's be off to morrow morning before he can see us there was no sleep for him when he went to his own bed the remembrance of the dog tormented him the other lesser animals were active capable of enjoying their liberty and finding shelter for themselves where had the maimed creature found a refuge on that bitter night again and again and again the question forced its way into his mind he could endure it no longer cautiously and quickly in dread of his extraordinary conduct being perhaps discovered by the women he dressed himself and opened the house door to look for the dog out of the darkness on the step there rose something dark he put out his hand a persuasive tongue gently licking it pleaded for a word of welcome the crippled animal could only have got to the door in one way the gate which protected the house enclosure must have been left open first giving the dog a refuge in the kitchen the footman rigidly performing his last duties went to close the gate at his first step into the enclosure he stopped panic stricken the starlit sky over the laboratory was veiled in murky red roaring flame and spouting showers of sparks poured through the broken skylight voices from the farm raised the first cry fire fire at the inquest the evidence suggested suspicion of incendiarism and suicide the papers the books the oil betrayed themselves as combustible materials carried into the place for a purpose the medicine chest was known by its use in cases of illness among the servants to contain opium adjourned inquiry elicited that the laboratory was not insured and that the deceased was in comfortable circumstances where were the motives one intelligent man who had drifted into the jury was satisfied with the evidence he held that the desperate wretch had some reason of his own for first poisoning himself and then setting fire to the scene of his labours having a majority of eleven against him the wise juryman consented to a merciful verdict of death by misadventure the hideous remains of what had once been benjulia found christian burial his brethren of the torture table attended the funeral in large numbers vivisection had been beaten on its own field of discovery they honoured the martyr who had fallen in their cause chapter lxiii the life of the new year was still only numbered by weeks when a modest little marriage was celebrated without the knowledge of the neighbours without a crowd in the church and even without a wedding breakfast mr gallilee honoured with the office of giving away the bride drew ovid into a corner before they left the house she still looks delicate poor dear he said do you really consider her to be well again as well as she will ever be ovid answered before i returned to her time had been lost which no skill and no devotion can regain but the prospect has its bright side past events which might have cast their shadow over all her life to come have left no trace in her memory i will make her a happy woman leave the rest to me teresa and mr mool were the witnesses maria and zo were the bridesmaids they had only waited to go to church until one other eagerly expected person joined them there was a general inquiry for miss minerva carmina astonished everybody from the bride groom downwards by announcing that circumstances prevented her best and dearest friend from being present she smiled and blushed as she took ovid's arm when we are man and wife and i am quite sure of you she whispered i will tell you what nobody else must know in the meantime darling if you can give frances the highest place in your estimation next to me you will only do justice to the noblest woman that ever lived she had a little note hidden in her bosom while she said those words it was dated on the morning of her marriage when you return from the honeymoon carmina i shall be the first friend who opens her arms and her heart to you forgive me if i am not with you to day we are all human my dear don't tell your husband it was her last weakness carmina had no excuses to make for an absent guest when the first christening was celebrated on that occasion the happy young mother betrayed a conjugal secret to her dearest friend it was at ovid's suggestion that the infant daughter was called by miss minerva's christian name but when the married pair went away to their happy new life there was a little cloud of sadness which vanished in sunshine thanks to zo polite mr mool bent on making himself agreeable to everybody paid his court to mr gallilee's youngest daughter and who do you mean to marry my little miss when you grow up the lawyer asked with feeble drollery zo looked at him in grave surprise that's all settled she said i've got a man waiting for me oh indeed and who may he be donald that's a very extraordinary child of yours mr mool said to his friend as they walked away together mr gallilee absently agreed has my message been given to my wife he asked mr mool sighed and shook his head messages from her husband are as completely thrown away on her he answered as if she was still in the asylum in justice to yourself consent to an amicable separation and i will arrange it have you seen her i insisted on it before i met her lawyers she declares herself to be an infamously injured woman and upon my honour she proves it from her own point of view 'my husband never came near me in my illness and took my children away by stealth my children were so perfectly ready to be removed from their mother that neither of them had the decency to write me a letter my niece contemplated shamelessly escaping to my son and wrote him a letter vilifying his mother in the most abominable terms and ovid completes the round of ingratitude by marrying the girl who has behaved in this way' i declare to you gallilee that was how she put it 'am i to blame' she said 'for believing that story about my brother's wife it's acknowledged that she gave the man money the rest is a matter of opinion was i wrong to lose my temper and say what i did say to this so called niece of mine yes i was wrong there it's the only case in which there is a fault to find with me but had i no provocation have i not suffered don't try to look as if you pitied me i stand in no need of pity but i owe a duty to my own self respect and that duty compels me to speak plainly i will have nothing more to do with the members of my heartless family the rest of my life is devoted to intellectual society and the ennobling pursuits of science let me hear no more sir of you or your employers' she rose like a queen and bowed me out of the room i declare to you my flesh creeps when i think of her if i leave her now said mr gallilee i leave her in debt give me your word of honour not to mention what i am going to tell you mr mool rejoined if she needs money the kindest man in the world has offered me a blank cheque to fill in for her and his name is ovid vere as the season advanced two social entertainments which offered the most complete contrast to each other were given in london on the same evening mr and mrs ovid vere had a little dinner party to celebrate their return teresa advanced to the dignity of housekeeper insisted on stuffing the tomatoes and cooking the macaroni with her own hand the guests were lord and lady northlake maria and zo miss minerva and mr mool mr gallilee was present as one of the household while he was in london he and his children lived under ovid's roof when they went to scotland mr gallilee had a cottage of his own which he insisted on buying in lord northlake's park he and zo drank too much champagne at dinner the father made a speech and the daughter sang we're gayly yet in another quarter of london there was a party which filled the street with carriages and which was reported in the newspapers the next morning mrs gallilee was at home to science the professors of the civilised universe rallied round their fair friend france italy and germany bewildered the announcing servants with a perfect babel of names and great britain was grandly represented those three superhuman men who had each had a peep behind the veil of creation and discovered the mystery of life attended the party and became centres of three circles the circle that believed in protoplasm the circle that believed in bioplasm and the circle that believed in atomized charges of electricity conducted into the system by the oxygen of respiration lectures and demonstrations went on all through the evening all over the magnificent room engaged for the occasion in one corner a fair philosopher in blue velvet and point lace took the sun in hand facetiously the sun's life my friends begins with a nebulous infancy and a gaseous childhood in another corner a gentleman of shy and retiring manners converted radiant energy into sonorous vibrations themselves converted into sonorous poppings by waiters and champagne bottles at the supper table in the centre of the room the hostess solved the serious problem of diet viewed as a method of assisting tadpoles to develop themselves into frogs with such cheering results that these last lively beings joined the guests on the carpet and gratified intelligent curiosity by explorations on the stairs within the space of one remarkable evening three hundred illustrious people were charmed surprised instructed and amused and when science went home it left a conversazione for once with its stomach well filled at two in the morning mrs gallilee sat down in the empty room and said to the learned friend who lived with her at last i'm a happy woman the end
