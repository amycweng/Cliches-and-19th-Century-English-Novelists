margaret illustration when i was a very young man nothing used to surprise me more than the existence of a very old oneone of those patriarchs who instead of linking the generations each with each include two or three in their protracted span a habit which runs in families as in the case of the old gentleman of our own time whose grandsire once or twice removed it is true but not nearly so often as by rights he should have been gathered the arrows upon flodden field such persons seemed to me little inferior in interest to ghosts whom indeed in appearance they greatly resembled and i was wont to listen to their experiences of the past with the same rapt attention unalloyed by the alarm that i should have paid to a denizen of another world there are it seems to me very few old persons about now absolutely none there used to be plenty three or four times my age and this perhaps renders the memory for she did die at last of my greataunt margaret a thing so rare and precious to me she was born as we her young relatives were wont to say ages and ages ago but as a matter of fact just one age ago that is to say if she had been alive but a few years back she would have been exactly one hundred years old think of it my young friends who are about to be so good in your turn as to give her story your attentionthink of it having been possible that you yourselves should have met this very personage in the flesh though the poor dear had but little of ityou perhaps in your goat carriage upon the kings parade brighton and she in her wheeled chairthe two extremities on wheels of human life to things you have read of as history matters as dead and gone to you if not quite so old as the peloponnesian war she was a living witness she was alive for example though not of an age to take notice of the circumstances when the independence of america was acknowledged by the mother country and when england was beginning to solace herself for that disruption by the acquisition of india if aunt margaret did not know as much about hyder ali as became a contemporary with matters nearer home such as the loss of the royal george with all her crew or nearly so complete she was very conversant i saw it she was used to say with my own eyes and it was only by the strictest crossexamination that you could get her to confess that she was but a child in arms when that catastrophe took place as to politics indeed though we were at war with everybody in those times the absence of special correspondents telegraphs and even newspapers made public matters of much more limited interest than it is nowadays easy to imagine aunt margaret at all events cared almost nothing about them with the exception of the doings of the pressgangan institution of which she always spoke with the liveliest horror on some one however chancing to say in her hearing and by way of corroboration of her views that it was marvellous how men who had been so infamously treated should have been got to fight under the national flag she let fly at him like the broadside of a seventygun frigate and gave him to understand that the sailors of those days had never had their equals on that as on all other subjects she exercised the right of criticism upon the institutions of her time to an unlimited extent but if they were attacked by others she became their defender her chief concern however was with social matters when speaking of which she seemed entirely to forget the age in which she was living it was as though some ancestress in hoop and farthingale had stepped down from her picture and read us a page of the diary she had written overnight she seemed hardly like one of ourselves at all though it was obvious enough that she was of the female gender from the prominence she gave to the topic of costumes she confessed that she preferred the hair undresseda phrase which misled her more youthful hearers who imagined her to be praising a dissolute luxuriance of lovelocks which was very far from her intention on the other hand she lamented the disuse of black satin breeches which she ascribed to the general decay of limb among the male sex there was nothing like your topboots and hessians she would say for morning wear but in the evening every man that had a leg was in her opinion bound to show it i have reason to believe that my aunt margaret was the last person who ever journeyed from london to brighton in a postchaisea mode of travel she was wont to remark justly eulogised by the wisest and best of men and londoners if he had been spared to see a railway locomotive she expressed herself as confident that he would have considered it the direct offspring of the devil and that conjectural opinion of the great lexicographer she herself shared to her dying day like him she was a londoner and took an immense interest not municipal of course but social in the affairs of the great city my dear she often used to say reprovingly when speaking of some event of which i was obliged to confess i had never so much as heard it was the topic of every tongue although she had never been the theme of london gossip herself she had been very closely connected with one who had been and to those who were intimate with her he was the constant subject of her discourse her thoughts dwelt more with him i am sure than with all the other personages together with whom she had been acquainted during her earthly pilgrimage and yet she always thought of him in his adolescence as a very young man he was just your age my dear she was wont to say to me when he became the talk of the town perhaps this circumstance gave him an additional interest in my eyes but certainly her account of this one famous personage was more interesting to me than everything else which aunt margaret had to tell me it has dwelt in my mind for many a year and when this is the case with any story i have generally found that i have been able to interest others in its recital in this particular case however my way is not so plain as usual the story is not my story nor even aunt margarets in its more important details it is common property on the other hand not even the oldest inhabitant has any remembrance of it the hearts that were once wounded to the quick by the occurrences which i am about to describe can be no more pained by any allusion to them they have long been dust no relative to my knowledge is now living of the unfortunate young man whose memoryexecrated by the crowdwas kept so green and fresh watered by her tears by one living soul for nearly eighty years why should i not tell his pitiful story a second question however presents itself at the outset concerning him shall i give or conceal his name i here frankly confess that in its broad details the tale has no novelty to recommend it it is not only true but it has been told the bald bare facts have been put before the public by the youth himself nearly a hundred years since there is the rub to a few persons of culture as the phrase goes nowadays the main incident of his career will be familiar though however cultured it is unlikely they will know how it affected my greataunt margaret but to tens of thousands including ill be bound the upper ten it will be utterly unknown now i have noticed that there is nothing your wellinformed person so much delights in as to make other people aware of his being so indeed the chief use of information in his eyes is not so much to raise oneself above the crowd though a sense of elevation is agreeable as to have the privilege of imparting it to others with a noble air of superiority and selfimportance i will therefore call my hero by such a name as will at once be recognised by the learned whom i shall thus render my intermediariesexponents of the transparent secret to those who are in blissful ignorance of it i will call him william henry erin i must add in justice to myself that the story was not told me in confidence how could it be so when at the very beginning of our intimacy the narrator had already almost reached the extreme limit of human life while i had but just left school it was the similarity of age on my part with that of the person she had in her mind which no doubt in part at least caused her to make me the repository of her longburied sorrow she judged and rightly judged that for that reason i was more likely to sympathise with it indeed whenever she spoke of it i forgot her age as in the case of the pictured grandmamma so felicitously described by mr locker i used to think of her at such times as she looked at seventeen as a bride her rounded form was lean and her silk was bombazine well i wot with her needles she would sit and for hours would she knit would she not ah perishable clay her charms had dropped away one by one yet when she spoke of the lover of her youth there seemed nothing incongruous in her so doing i forgot the long ago in which her tale was placed her talk indeed on those occasions being of those human feelings which are independent of any epoch took little or no colour from the past it seemed to me a story of today and as such i now relate it chapter ii out in the cold a few years ago it would have been almost impossible for modern readers to imagine what a coach journey used to be in the good old times but thanks to certain gilded youths more fortunate than persons of a higher intellectual type who have striven in vain to revive old usages thoroughly worn out the souls of them fumed forth the hearts of them torn out it is not now so difficult any one who has gone by one of our summer coaches for a short trip out of town can picture the rockets and highflyers in which our ancestors took their journeys at the end of the last century those old mailcoaches were in fact their very counterparts for the basket had already made way for the hind seat only instead of our aristocratic driver there was a professional whip who in fair weather came out in scarlet like the guard though in wet and wintertime he was wrapped in heavy drab as though a butterfly should become a grub again the roads were good the milestones in a much better condition than they are at present and the inns at which the passengers stopped for refreshments greatly superior to their successors or rather to their few ghastly survivors all room and no company which still haunt the roadside the highwaymen too were still extant which gave an opportunity to young gentlemen of spirit to assure young female fellowpassengers of their being under safe escort if not of displaying their own courage still after eight hours in a stagecoach most insides felt that they had had enough of it and were glad enough to stretch their legs when the chance offered this feeling was experienced by two out of the three passengers in the london coach tantivy which on a certain afternoon in may at the end of the last century drew up at the white hart in the town of banbury it was their last stopping stage before they arrived at their destinationstratfordonavon and they wished at least two of them did that they had reached it already mr samuel erin the senior and head of the little party was a man of about sixty years of age but looked somewhat older he still wore the attire which had been usual in his youth but was now pronounced oldfashioned a powdered wig of moderate dimensions a plain braided frock coat with waistcoat to match almost as long a hat turned up before and behind and looking like a cross between a cocked hat and the headgear of a modern archdeacon kneebreeches and buckled shoes upon his foreheadtheir ordinary restingplace when he was not engaged in his profession that of a draughtsman or poring over some musty volumereposed on a bed of wrinkles a pair of gold spectacles his eyes which without being very keen were intelligent enough appeared smaller than they really were from a habit he had of puckering their lids engendered by the more delicate work of his calling and also by frequent examination of old mss and rare editions of which he was a connoisseur as he left the coach with slow inelastic step he was followed by his friend frank dennis this gentleman was a much younger man but he too though not so retrograde in attire as his senior paid little attention to the prevailing fashion he wore indeed his own hair but closely cut a pepperandsalt coat and waistcoat and a neckcloth that looked like a towel tied carelessly under his chin though not in his first youth he was still a young man with frank and comely features but an expression habitually thoughtful and a somewhat slow delivery of what he had to say made him appear of maturer years than belonged to him he was an architect by profession but had some private means his tastes were somewhat similar to those of his friend and neighbour erin and he could better afford to indulge them his present expedition was no business of his own but undertaken as he professed that he might enjoy the others society for a week or two in the country it so happened however that mr erin was bringing his niece miss margaret slade with him and to judge by the tenderness of mr denniss glance when it rested on her it is probable that the prospect of her companionship had had some attraction for him last of the three she tripped out of the coach declining with a pretty toss of her head the assistance the younger man would have rendered her in alighting she could trip and toss her head like any fairy no tower of hair like a porters knot set upon end had she her dress though to modern eyes very shortwaisted was not as an annalist of her time has described it drawn exceeding close over stays drawn still closer her movements were light and free her lustrous brown hair fell in natural waves from under a beaver hat turned up on the left side and ornamented with one grey feather a grey silk spencer indicated under pretence of concealingfor it was summer weather and she could not have worn it for warmththe graces of her form her eyes were bright and eager and her pretty lips murmured a sigh of relief as she touched ground at her release from durance how i wish this was stratfordonavon cried she navely that would be wishing that shakespeare had been born at banbury said her uncle in a tone of reproof banbury is it she said then this is where the lady lived who went about with rings on her fingers and bells on her toes and therefore had music wherever she goesi mean went mr dennis smiled and murmured very slowly that other young ladies brought music with them without the instruments of which she spoke or indeed any instruments they had only to open their mouths i am hungry observed miss margaret without any reference to that remark about opening her mouth at allin fact she studiously ignored it mr dennis sighed he was that minority of one who would rather have remained in the coachthat is if miss margaret had done likewise he would not in the least have objected to mr samuel erin getting out a circumstance over which he had no control the fact of his having been born half a century too early prevented his being acquainted with the poem in which mr thomas moore describes the pleasure he felt in travelling in a stagecoach with a fair companion but he had experienced it all the same he was not displeased that there was another stage to come yet if he was satisfied however with the opportunities that had been afforded to him of making himself agreeable to miss margaret on the road he must have been a man thankful for small mercies she had given him very little encouragement his attempts to engage her in conversation had been anything but successful when a young lady wishes to be tender we know that the mere offer to open or shut a coach window for her may lead to volumes of smalltalk but nothing had come of his little politenesses beyond the bare acknowledgment of them even that however was something an i thank you sir from the pretty lips of margaret slade was to mr frank dennis more than the acceptance of plan elevation and section of any proposed townhall from a municipal council it is strange how much harder is the heart of the female than the male under certain circumstances if a young lady obviously endeavours to make herself agreeable to a young gentleman he never repulses her or at least i have never known an instance of it but suppose i hear some fair one inquire he should be engaged to be married to some one else madam i reply to that imaginary questioner it would not make one halfpennyworth of difference if the other young woman was not there you would never guess from his behaviour that she was in existence it must not however be concluded from this observation that miss margaret slade was in love with anybody else she was but seventeen at most an age at which among wellconducted young persons no such idea enters the head nor indeed in her case as one would think had there been any opportunity for its entrance she had been brought up in the country in seclusion and only a few months ago upon the death of mrs erin had been sent for by her uncle to keep house for him his establishment in norfolk street strand was a very simple one and the company he entertained numbered none of these who in the language of the day were called the votaries of cupid no young beaux ever so much as crossed the threshold mr erins visitors were all grave elderly gentlemen more interested in a binding than in a petticoat and preferring some oldworld volume to a maiden in her springtime there was indeed though as the song says it is hardly worth while to put that in a son of mr erins of her own age who dwelt in his fathers house but the young man was out all day engaged in his professional avocationthat of a conveyancers clerk and even when he returned at eve mixed but little with the family it seemed to margaret that his father did not treat him very kindly there had been only one mention of him in the long coach journey from town mr dennis addressing himself as usual to margaret when a chance offered of interrupting mr erins interminable talk upon antiquarian subjects had inquired after her cousin william henry and she had replied with the least rose tint of a blush that he had gone she believed on some business of his employer to bristol a statement which her uncle had corroborated adding drily the boy has asked to have his holiday with us now instead of later in the year so i have told him to come on to stratford he may be useful to me in collecting information upon shakespearean matters the remark scarcely breathed the spirit of a doating parent but then that was not mr erins way your son has made a good choice of locality said mr dennis in his rather ponderous manner it is not every young fellow who would choose stratfordonavon to disport himself in in preference to tunbridge wells for instance his taste for antiquities is certainly most remarkable he will prove a chip of the old block ill warrant he added with a sidelong smile at margaret margaret did not return his smile though she did not frown as her uncle did the fact was though neither margaret nor mr dennis had the faintest idea of it the latter could hardly have paid the old gentleman a more objectionable compliment i do not think he replied coldly after an unpleasant pause that william henry cares much about shakespeare but he has probably asked for his holiday thus early in hopes that by hook or by crook he may get another one later on to this there was no reply from either quarter mr dennis though a goodnatured fellow enough did not feel called upon to defend william henrys want of shakespearean feeling against his parent while miss margaret not only closed her mouth but shut her eyes if she slept to judge by the expression of her face she had pleasant dreams but it is possible she was only pretending to sleep in order to chew the cud of some sweet thought at greater leisure she disagreed with her uncle about the motive that was bringing william henry to stratford but was quite content to accept the factof which she had previously been ignorantwithout debate she herself did not i fear care so much about shakespeare as it behoved mr samuel erins niece to do but from henceforth she looked forward with greater pleasure than she had done to this visit to his birthplace hungry as she had professed herself to be she would no doubt have done justice to the ample if somewhat solid viands that were set before the coach passengers and on which her uncle exercised his knife and fork like a man who knows he will be charged the same whether he eats much or little but for an unlookedfor circumstance hardly had the meal commenced when the cheerful note of the horn announced the approach of a coach from some other quarter the tenants of which presently crowded into the common diningroom among them was a young gentleman who without a glance at beef or pasty at once made up to our party of three his first salutation contrary to the laws of etiquette was made to mr erin hollo said that gentleman unwillingly relinquishing his knife and holding out two fingers to the newcomer what brings you here sir the banbury coach sir i came across country from bristol in the hopes of catching you at this stage which i have fortunately succeeded in doing humph it seems to me you must have come miles out of the way however since you are here you had better setto on the victuals and save your supper at stratford mr dennis shook hands with the young man cordially enough and recommended the meat pie miss margaret just lifted her eyes from her plate and gave him a smile of welcome but at the same time she moved a little towards the top of the table so as to leave a space for him on the other side of her an invitation which he lost no time in accepting a scornful poet whose appetite was considerably jaded has expressed his disgust at seeing women eat but women i have noticed take great pleasure in seeing men for whom they have any regard relish a hearty meal the newcomer ate as only a young gentleman who has travelled for hours on a coachtop can eat and margaret so enjoyed the spectacle that she neglected her own opportunities in that way to watch him the ardour with which you attack that veal willie she whispered slily reminds me of the prodigal son after his diet of husks did you think the manner in which my arrival was welcomed in other respects maggie he inquired bitterly carried out the parable never mind you are out for your holiday remember and must only think of enjoying yourself well i hope you are glad to see me at all events well of course i am its a very unexpected pleasure is it i should have thought you might have guessed that i should have managed to join you somehow i have not your genius for plots and strategies willie it is so great that it sometimes a little alarms me she answered gravely the weak must take up such weapons as lay to their hand he replied drily this conversation carried on as it was in a low tone was drowned by the clatter of knives and forks before the latter had ceased the notes of the horn were once more heard the signal for the resumption of their journey the party rose at once mr erin leading the way he took no notice of his son as he pushed by him but the neglect was more than compensated for by the attention of the female members of the company william henry was a very comely young fellow his complexion dark but not swarthy his eyes keen and bright a profusion of black curling hair was tied by a ribbon under his hat which gave him a somewhat feminine appearance though it was not unusual so to wear it his attire though neat was far from foppisha dark blue coat with a short light waistcoat a neckcloth by no means so large as was worn by many young persons in his station of life and nankeen breeches if it is difficult for us to suppose such a costume becoming it was easy for those who were accustomed to it to think so his figure it was observed as he walked rapidly to overtake his father was especially good i have made inquiries mr erin he said respectfully as the old man placed his foot on the step and find there is plenty of room in the coach you mean on the coach was the dry reply surely a young man like youleaving out of question the ridiculous extravagance of such a proceedingwould never wish to be an inside passenger on an afternoon like this and with a puff half of displeasure half of exhaustion caused by the effort of the ascent the antiquary sank into his seat do you not ride with us inquired mr dennis goodnaturedly as he came up to the door with margaret upon his arm the young mans cheeks flushed with anger you do not know william henry said the girl interposing with a smile he does not care for the nest when he can sit upon the bough it is pleasanter outsidefor some thingsno doubt assented mr dennis as he assisted her into the coach she cast a sympathising glance over her shoulder at william henry as he swung himself up to the hind seat and he returned it with a grateful look she had saved him from a humiliation it was a warm evening as his father had observed but in one sense he had been turned out into the cold and he felt it bitterly chapter iii a recitation there is one spot and only one in all england which can in any general sense be called hallowedsacred to the memory of departed man priests and kings have done their best for other places with small effect here and there as in westminster abbey an attempt has been made to make sacred soil by collecting together the bones of our greatest menwarriors authors divines statesmen but these various elements do not kindly mix the devotion we would pay to our own particular idol is chilled perhaps by the neighbourhood of those with whom we feel no especial sympathy in all cathedrals too there is a certain religious feeling artificial as the light which finds its way through the prophets blazoned on its panes it is difficult in them to feel enthusiasm in other places again exposed to the free air of heaven association is weakened by external influences i at least only know of one place where nature as it were effaces herself and becomes the setting and framework to the epitaph of a dead man it is stratfordonavon there save once a year when shakespeares birthday is commemorated fashion brings but few persons to simulate admiration it is not as at some great funeral where curiosity or official position or other extraneous motive brings men together to do honour to the departed they come like humble friends to pay tribute to one whom they not only admire but revere to this little warwickshire town it is too remote from the places where men congregate to entice the thoughtless crowd nor has it any attractions save its associations with that marvellous mind of which the crowd has but a vague and cold conception it is to my poor thinking a very comfortable sign of the advance of human intelligence that year after year in hundreds and in thousands but not in crowdsfor they arrive alone or in twos or threes togetherthere come from the uttermost parts of our island and even from the ends of the earth more and more pilgrims to this simple shrine in the days of which i write stratford of course had far fewer visitors than at present but those it did have were certainly not inferior in enthusiasm indeed it was a time when shakespeare if not more read than now was certainly more talked about and thought about his plays were much oftener acted the theatre occupied a more intellectual position in society kemble and his majestic sister mrs siddons trod the boards quotations from shakespeare were as common in the mouths of clerks and counterjumpers as are now the most taking rhymes from a favourite burlesque even the paterfamilias who did not hold by stage plays made an exception in honour of the bard of avon in literary circles an incessant war was waging concerning him pamphlet after pamphletattack and rejoinderwas published almost every week by this or that partisan of a phrase or discoverer of a new reading mr samuel erin was in the forefront of this contest and as a rule a stickler for the text he opposed the advocates for change in the same terms which dr johnson used to reformers in politics the devil he was wont to say was the first commentator the famous shakespearean critic malone was the object of his special aversion which was most cordially reciprocated and often had they transfixed one another with pens dipped in gall it was curious since the object of mr erins adoration has taken such pains to instil gentleness and feeling among his fellowcreatures that his disciple should have harboured the sentiments he sometimes expressed and yet it is hardly to be wondered at when one remembers that the advocates of christianity itself have fallen into the same error and from the same cause mr samuel erin was not only a devotee but a fanatic as the coach crossed the river near their journeys end mr dennis broke a long silence by a reference to the beauty of the scenery which his friend had come professionally to illustrate here is a pretty bit of river for your pencil mr erin hush hush rejoined that gentleman reprovingly it is the avon we are on the threshold of his very birthplace it was on the tip of mr denniss tongue who had been thinking of nothing but margaret for the last halfhour to inquire whose birthplacewhich would have lost him the others friendship for ever fortunately he recollected himself and shakespeare just in time and in some trepidation at his narrow escape which his friend took for reverential awe murmured some more suitable reply william henry on the other hand was not so fortunate at the instigation of the guard who had a commission from the innkeeper on the guests he brought him he leant down from the coachtop to inquire which house mr erin meant to patronise suggesting that the party should put up at the stratford arms as being the best accommodation you fool roared the old gentleman we put up at the falcon of course the idea he continued indignantly of our going elsewhere when the opportunity is afforded us of residing under the very roof which once sheltered our immortal bard shakespeare did not live in an inn did he uncle inquired margaret demurely she knew perfectly well that he had not done so but was unwilling to let this outburst against her cousin pass by without some kind of protest well no admitted mr erin but he lived just opposite to it and it is supposedindeed it may be reasonably concludedthat he patronised it for hisahemconvivial entertainments i suppose there is some foundation for the story of the topers and the sippers observed dennis and for the bard being found under the crabtree vino et somno there may be there may be returned the other indifferently but as for shakespeare being beaten even in a contest of potations that is entirely out of the question it was not in the nature of the man if he ran he would run quickest if he jumped he would jump the highest and if he drank he would undoubtedly have drunk deeper than anybody else the falcon inn had no great extent of accommodationit was perhaps too full of association for itbut margaret had a neat chamber enough and since it looked on the guild chapel and grammar school where shakespeare had been educated and on the walls which surrounded the spot where he had spent his latter days the niece of her uncle could hardly have anything to complain of the young men had an attic apiece as to what sort of a room was assigned to mr samuel erin he could not have told you himself for he took no notice of it his head was always out of the window it was his first sight of the shrine of his idol and the very air seemed to be laden with incense from it to think that that long low tenement yonder with the projecting front was the very house in which shakespeare had crept unwillingly to school that his young feet had helped to wear those very stones away and that that ancient archway had echoed his very tones sent a thrill of awe through him such as could only be compared with that felt by some medival beholder of a bit of the true cross but in that case faithand a good deal of ithad been essential to conviction whereas in this the facts were indisputable behind yonder walls too stood the house to which full of honour though not of years he had retired to spend that leisure in old age which he had desiderated more than most men the aim of all is but to crown the life with honour wealth and ease in waning age were the words mr erin repeated to himself with mystic devotion as a peasant mutters a latin prayer he had no poetic gifts himself nor was he even a critic in a high sense but his long application to shakespearean literature had given him some reflected light what he understood of it he understood thoroughly what was too high for his moderate though by no means dwarfish intelligence to grasp or what through intermediate perversion was unintelligible he not only took on trust but accepted as reverentially as did those who were wont to consult her the utterances of the sibyl in literature we have few such fanatics as samuel erin now but in art he has many modern parallelsmen who having once convinced themselves that a painting is by rubens or titian will see in it a hundred merits where there are not half a dozen and even discover beauties in its spots and blemishes while the head of the little party was thus in the seventh heaven of happiness abovestairs the junior members of it had assembled together in the common sittingroom the landlady had inquired what refreshments they would please to have and tea had been ordered rather with a view of putting a stop to her importunities than because after that ample meal at banbury they stood in need of any food if your uncle were here maggie said william henry not perhaps without some remembrance of the snubbing he had just received from the old gentleman and from which he was still smarting he would be ordering sherrie sack or cakes and ale margaret glanced at him reprovingly but said nothing she regretted that he took such little pains to bridge the breach that evidently existed between his father and himself and always discouraged his pert sallies william henry hung his head if he did not find sympathy with his cousin he could he thought find it nowhere frank dennis however came to his rescue he either did not look upon the penniless friendless lad as a real rival or he was very magnanimous and how did you enjoy your trip to bristol he inquired st marys redcliffe is a fine church is it not yes indeed i paid a visit to the turret where the papers were stored to which chatterton had access and from which he drew the rowley poems how interesting exclaimed margaret it was plain by her tone that she wanted to make amends to the young fellow are any of his people still at bristol oh yes his sister lives there a mrs newton i had a great deal of talk with her she told me how angry he was with her on one occasion when she cut up some old deeds and other things he had brought home with him and which she had thought valueless to make into threadpapers he collected them together threadpapers and all and carried them into his own room considering the use the poor young fellow made of them observed dennis gravely she had better have burnt them still they did give him a certain spurious immortality put in margaret pitifully the other was out of his reach surely my dear miss slade you cannot mean that remonstrated dennis gently at all events everybody was very hard upon him just because they were taken in argued margaret if he had acknowledged what they admired so much to have been his own they would have seen nothing in it to admire i think horace walpole behaved like a brute that is very true admitted dennis still the lad was a forger people are not starved to death as he was even for forging rejoined margaret his own people too did not care about him he had no friends poor fellow dennis listened to her with pleasurethough he thought her too lenientbecause she took the side of the oppressed william henry was even more grateful because he secretly compared his own position with that of chattertonfor he too had written poems which nobody thought much ofand guessed that margaret had his own case in her eye amongst other things that mrs newton told me continued william henry was that her brother was very reserved and fond of seclusion on one occasion he was most severely chastised for having absented himself for half a day from home he did not shed a tear but only observed that it was hard indeed to be whipped for reading it was certainly most unfortunate admitted dennis that the boy was amongst persons who did not understand him and who though they were his own flesh and blood treated him with contempt and cruelty added margaret with indignation did this sister of his never give him credit for possessing talent even she thought him odd as a child it seems answered william henry he preferred to be taught his letters from an old blackletter bible rather than from any book of modern type he seems to have had a natural leaning for the line that he took in life in other words you think he was born with a turn for forgery observed dennis drily that is not a very high compliment to him nor indeed to providence either but how else could he have become celebrated argued the young man impatiently is it necessary then my lad to become celebrated inquired dennis smiling i dont say necessary but it must be very nice the same thing may be said of most of our vices answered the other reprovingly frank dennis often spoke the words of wisdom but spoke them cut and dried like proverbs from a copybook he was an excellent fellow but not quite human enough for ordinary use margaret would have liked him better perhaps if he had been a trifle worse the pedagogic tone in which he had spoken to her cousin and his use of the words my lad which as she argued to herself quite wrongly he must know were very offensive to him irritated her a little she felt that william henry had been schooled enough and wanted encouragement did you get any inspiration from the turret of st mary redcliffe she inquired well yes he answered blushing and a blush very well became his handsome face i did perpetrate some mischief ill warrant exclaimed a harsh disdainful voice it was that of mr samuel erin who had entered the room unobserved and what was it you perpetrated sir william henry looked abashed and annoyed margaret though she stood in no little fear of her uncle could hardly restrain her indignation frank dennis as usual interposed with the oil can your son has perhaps only written a poem mr erin which in so young a man can hardly be considered a crime i dont know that if the poemas it probably waswas a bad one if he has committed ithere the old gentlemans face softened as under the influence of the infrequent and homemade joke the grimmest face will dohe has doubtless committed it to memory come sir let us have it now as of all the pleasant moments which mitigate this painful life there are none more charming than those passed in the recital of a poem of our own composition to one pair of loving ears so there are none more embarrassing than those which are occupied in doing the same thing before an unsympathetic audience imagine poor shelley condemned to recite his skylark or keats his nightingale to a vestry meeting that would indeed be bad enough but if the bard himself is conscious that he has no skylark nor nightingale but only a tomtit or yellowhammer to let fly for their edification how much more terrible must be his position poor william henry was in even worse case for one of his audience as he well knew was not only not en rapport with him but antagonistic a hostile critic i once beheld a shivering schoolboy compelled to make an extempore ode to the moon to a circle of his fellowstudents armed with towels knotted at the end to flick him with if his muse should be considered unsatisfactory except that he was not in his nightshirt as my young friend was poor william henrys position was almost as bad and yet he dared not refuse to obey the paternal mandate there are only a very few verses sir he stammered the fewer the better said mr erin he meant it for an encouragement no doubt a sort of so far the court is with you but it had not an encouraging effect upon his son it seemed to him that he had just swallowed a pint of vinegar leave off those damnable faces and begin exclaimed mr erin it was only a quotation from his favourite bard and not an inappropriate one but it did not sound kind it is brutal murmured margaret under her breath and at the same time she cast a glance of ineffable pity at the victim it was like a ray of sunshine upon a chill day at sight of which the bird bursts into song the lines are on chatterton he began by way of prelude comfort and joys for ever fled he neer will warble more ah me the sweetest youth is dead that eer tuned reed before the hand of misery laid him low een hope forsook his brain relentless man contemned his woe to him he sighed in vain oppressed with want in wild despair he cried no more ill live swallowed the draught and died mr samuel erin looked as if he had swallowed a draught one of those recommended to persons suffering from the effects of poison shade of shakespeare he cried do you call that a poem william henry murmured something in mitigation about its being an acrostic the old gentlemans sense of hearing was not acute and led him to imagine he was being reproached for his surliness he turned as red as a turkeycock margaret also flushed to her forehead she too had misunderstood what her cousin had said and the more easily because the words she thought he had used a cross stick were so appropriate but how could he could he be so foolish as thus to give reins to his temper lastly frank dennis became a brilliant scarlet he was half suffocated with suppressed laughter still true to his mission of peacemaker he contrived to splutter out that when a poem was an acrostic such perfection was not to be looked for as when the muse was unfettered oh thats it is it said mr erin grimly ive heard of young men wasting their time and what is worse the time of their employers in many ways but that they should take to writing acrostics seems to me the ne plus ultra of human folly bah give me a dish of tea chapter iv a real enthusiast i am afraid it is rather taken for granted by parents in general as regards any behaviour they may adopt towards their offspring that religion is always upon their own side and yet there is a very noteworthy text about provoking our children to wrath which it is a mistake to ignore wise and reverend signors may well have learnt by experience to take trifling annoyances with equanimity but the amour propre of the young is a tender shoot and very sensitive to rough handling the most sensitive plant of all is the lad with a turn for literature and as a rule parents have the least patience with him when the turn is not a mere taste but a natural gift this does not much matter no true flame was ever put out by the breath of contempt but when it halts midway the youth has a bad time of it he shivers at every sneer without the means of giving it the lie like a dart it strikes to his liver because his armour unlike that of true genius is not arrowproof he knows that he is not the fool that his folk take him for but he has an uneasy consciousness that they are partly right that his powers are not equal to his pretensions this was the case with william henry erin illustration he had a turn for literature and if an uncommon facility for writing indifferent verses is any proof of it even for poetry and he found nobody to admit it not even margaret it is very good willie for a first attempt was the fatal eulogium she once passed upon the most cherished of his poetical productions and his father as we have seen made no scruple of ridiculing his literary efforts if the boys predilection for such matters had interfered with his professional duties it might have been excusable enough but the conveyancers to whom william henry was articled were quite satisfied with him he was very careful and diligent and though he had come to years of indiscretion far from dissipated if he loitered on his way to his employers chambers in the new inn it was to turn over the leaves of some old poem on a bookstall rather than to gaze on the young woman who might be behind it still not being perfection it was natural that he should feel resentment at his fathers harshness and at the slights to which his muse was exposed at his unsympathising hands he had never had any one to sympathise with his poetical aspirations except his friend reginald talbot a fellowclerk of his own age who was also devoted to the muses and talbots praise had its drawbacks first he did not think it worth much and secondly it could not be obtained without reciprocity and it went against william henrys conscience to praise talbots poems well thought the young man as he looked out of his attic window which commanded a distant view of stratford church there lies a man who was as little appreciated at my age as i am and yet he made some noise in the world he too some say was a scriveners clerk he too was called willwhich is at least an interesting coincidence he too fell in love at my age here his reflections ended with a sigh for the parallel extended no further shakespeare had not only wooed butwith a little too much ease indeedhad won whereas margaret slade was far out of his reach he had a shrewd suspicion that mr erin intended her to marry dennis and had brought him down with him to stratford to throw the young people together as he would doubtless express it young people indeed why frank dennis was old enoughwell scarcely to be her father unless he had been unusually precocious but certainly to know better crabbed agethe man was thirty if he was a dayand youth cannot live together it was a most monstrous proposition on the other hand what could he poor william henry do if he could persuade maggie to run away with him tomorrow they must literally run for he had hardly money enough after that bristol trip to pay the first pike out of stratford and far less a postchaise as he thought of his unacknowledged merits and of the many obstacles to his union he grew bitter against the whole scheme of creation if poetic impulse could have projected him fifty years forward he would doubtless have exclaimed with the bard of bon gaultier cussed be the clerk and the parson cussed be the whole concern but not having that vent for his feelings he only loosened his neckcloth a bit and looked moody poor fellow he had but two wishes in the worldto marry margaret and to get into print and both these desires just because he had no money were denied him at that very time margaret at her window was thinking of him she was notshe was certain she was not the idea was quite ridiculousin love with him but thanks to his fathers conduct she felt that pity for him which is akin to love and he was certainly very handsome and very fond of her he had been foolish to come down to stratford when it was clear her uncle didnt want him but it was very nice of him too and since he was there and upon his holidayhis one holiday in the year poor fellowit was cruel to snub him frank dennis didnt snub him that she would say for frank he was a kind honest fellow though rather oldfashioned and just a trifle heavy in hand she wished william henry would talk like him when addressing his father though when addressing her she confessed to herself that she preferred william henrys way it was really distressing to see her uncle and his son together they mixed no better than oil and vinegar she was well pleased to remember that mr jervis the stratford poet was coming that morning to breakfast with them since his presence would prevent anything unseemly moreover he would probably take her uncle and frank dennis away with him to investigate antiquities which would leave william henry and herself to themselves john jervis was but a carpenter in a small way of business but he was much respected in the town and had made himself a name beyond it on account of the interest he took in all shakespearean matters the gentry in the neighbourhood spoke of him as a civil and inoffensive creature but he was corresponded with by men of letters and learning in london his position would have been better than it was had he not been so foolish as to publish a volume of poemsto be paid by subscription this had subjected him to something much worse than criticismto patronage every one who had advanced a few shillings for the appearance of that unfortunate volume became in a sense his master and some of them exacted interest for their investment in advice remonstrance and dictation it was a foolish thing of john jervis to set up his tradenot carpentering but the otherin stratfordonavon in paisley there are i have heard say at this present moment fifty poets all complaining that the world which will give them a monument after their death in the meantime permits them to starve but paisley is a place which is scarcely poetic to begin with whereas to be a local poet in stratford was like setting up a shed for small coal in newcastle the good man had become quite aware of this by this time he was very dissatisfied with his published productions it is a common case what we have in our desk seems as superior to what lies on our table as that which moves in our brain is to what lies in our desk he would have given as much to suppress his little volume as william henry would have given to get his own broadcast over an admiring land and yet there was no question of comparison between them as respected merit john jervis was within certain narrow limits a true poet what he saw he noted what he noted he felt so far he followed his great master he even emitted a modest light of his own which was not reflected he was not a star but he was a glowworm most of us are but worms without the glow every one who came to stratford at that time for shakespeares sakeand no one came for any other reasonwas recommended to apply to john jervis for information on receiving any summons of this nature he put aside his carpenters tools took off his apron and donned his sabbath garb a carpenter in his sunday clothes in these days is a sad sight he represents one branch of his business only that of the undertaker but in the times of which we write it was not so wigs were not yet gone out of fashion in warwickshire but john jervis could not afford what was called the citizens sunday buckle or bob major because it had three tiers of curls he had too much good taste to use the minor bob or hair cap short in the neck to show the stock buckle and stroked away from the face so as to seem like tristram shandy as though the wearer had been skating against the wind he wore his own grey hair and a modest grey suit in which however none but a flippant young fellow like master william henry erin could have likened him to a master baker his face was homely but pleasant and had a certain dignity his manner retiring but not reticent it was his business to answer questions but he did not volunteer information he had indeed a secret contempt for the majority of his clients they had more appetite for the shakespearean husks the few dry details that could be picked up concerning their idol than for the cornwhat manner of man he had been in spirit or how the scenery about his home had affected his writings jervis found mr erin to be no better than his other visitors hungry for facts greedy for particulars and combative he talked of the confession of faith found in the roof of the house in henley street and rubbed his hands notwithstanding that his enemy had since retracted his belief in it over malones credulity an unworthy member of the holy catholic religion indeed it is monstrous incredible that phrase had reference to the father however observed jervis true but that was the art of the forger himself of the old faith no doubt he wished to make our shakespeare a born papist now that he was a good protestant is indubitable id beat him like a dog says sir andrew what for being a puritan returns sir toby what irony you are of my opinion i hope mr jervis i have scarcely formed an opinion upon the matter was the modest reply shakespeare was catholic in one sense but i agree with you that he was not one to be much comforted by the holy sacrifice of the mass as the socalled confession put it i should think not indeed he was not partial to priests when thou liest howling quoted mr erin triumphantly still being a stageplayer i doubt if he was partial to the puritans no such things moved him neither way religious controversies he looked upon as on other quarrels as valour misbegot if he could not see into the future he saw five hundred years ahead of his contemporaries who were burning francis kett for heresy at norwich mr erin was not certain whether kett was a protestant or a catholic on which depended his view of the circumstance so he only shook his head you mean mr jervis said margaret timidly that in shakespeares eyes there were no heretics the man in grey looked at his gentle inquirer and bowed his head assentingly none as i think young lady save those who disbelieved in good that is not established said mr erin argumentatively i am afraid your uncle thinks me a heretic said mr jervis smiling then perceiving that margaret looked interested he told her of the marvellous boyname unknown but whose fame still survivedwho had been shakespeares contemporary at stratford how so the legend ran he had been thought his equal in genius and his future greatness been prophesied with the same confidence but who had died in youth a mute inglorious shakespeare i often picture to myself said the old man dreamily the friendship of those two boys do you think they went out poaching together inquired william henry demurely he was not without humour and was also perhaps a little jealous of the attention margaret paid their visitor poaching exclaimed mr erin angrily how gross and contemptible are your ideas sir still interposed dennis his sense of justice aiding his wish to stand between mr erins wrath and its objectmargarets cousinshakespeare did transgress in that way it is not likely that he strained at a hare if he swallowed a deer no doubt he poached admitted jervis gravely he was very human and did all things that became a boy but i was thinking rather of the companionship of the two boys than their pursuits their talk was not of hares nor of rabbits how one would like to know their boyish confidences what were their ambitions their aspirations their views of life which one was about to leave and in which the other was to fill so large a space in the thoughts of manfor ever it was in this little town they lived and talked together learnt their lessons from one book perhaps in yonder school each without a thought of the others immortality albeit of such different kinds the solemnity of the speakers manner and the genuineness of feeling which his tone displayed had no little effect upon his audience but on each in a different way margarets mind was stirred to its depths by this simple dreampicture and seeing her so the two young men felt a touch of sympathy with it is there any sure foundation to go upon as to this playmate of shakespeares inquired mr erin notebook in handany record any document the visitor shook his head nothing but wherever in the country round shakespeares youth is alluded to this story of his friend is told it is a local legend that is all but it seems to me to have life in it the world outside knows nothing of it it interests itself in shakespeare only and but little in his belongings but with us breathing the air he breathed walking on the same ground he trod things are different we still fancy him amongst us and not alone there is hamnet too we still speak of hamnet it was fortunate for william henry that he repressed the observation that rose to his lips he was about to say you dont mean hamlet do you the same idea i am afraid occurred to mr dennis but for even a briefer space he felt that there must be some mistake somewhere but also that he himself might be making it buried here august the th observed mr erin as though he was reading from the register itself just so continued jervis only a little over two hundred years ago he was eleven years old too young to understand the greatness of him who begat him yet old enough to have an inkling of it once a year or so as it is believed his father came home to stratford fresh from the companionship of the great london wits and poetsjonson beaumont fletcher camden and selden what meetings must those have been with his only son the boy whom he fondly hoped but hoped in vain would inherit the proceeds of his fame i wonder how his mother used to speak of her husband to her children did she excuse to them his long absence his dwelling afar off or did she inveigh against it did she recognise the splendour of his genius or did she only love him or did she not love him let us hope she was not unworthy of him said mr erin his enthusiasm stirred by the others eloquence rising on a stronger wing than usual as a wife she was sorely tried murmured mr jervis i love to think of her less than of hamnet so lowly born in one sense and in the other of such illustrious parentage the news of his fathers growing fame must have reached the boy and the contrast could not fail to have struck him then to have seen that father bending over his little bed to have kissed that noble face and felt himself in his embrace to have known that he was the child whom shakespeares soul loved best in all the world what a sensation what an experience some mementoes of the immortal bard are i hope still to be purchased observed mr erin curtly he had engaged mr jerviss services for practical purposes and began to resent this waste of timewhich was moneyupon sentimental hypothesis shakespeares wife was a topic one could sympathise with there was documentary evidence in existence concerning her but over little hamnets grave there was not even a tombstone mementoes yes there is mulberrywood enough to last some time said mr jervis slily you shall have your pick of them but no mss not that i know of there has been a report however of late that mr williams of clopton house has found some that were removed from new place at the time of the fire great heavens exclaimed mr erin with much excitement what from new place shakespeares own home let us go at once all other things can waitwilliam henry come along with us and bring your little bookyou can stay here with maggie dennis till i come back if he could have dispensed with the presence of john jervis himself he would have been glad to do so for what is true of a feast is also true of treasuretrove the fewer the finders the better the fare chapter v the old settle illustration william henry far from sharing his fathers enthusiasm at any time was on this occasion less than ever inclined to applaud it if clopton house should be found full of shakespearean mss it would not afford him half the pleasure he would have derived from a ttette with his cousin margaret a treat which it seemed was to be thrown away upon frank dennis why didnt mr erin select him to take notes for him from the musty documents a question the folly of which only a high state of irritation could excuse he knew perfectly well that his own dexterity and promptness in copying had caused himself to be chosen for the undesirable task and that knowledge irritated him the more it was only when he could be of some material use to him as in the present instance that his father took the least account of him if he could bring himself to steal one of those precious documents was his bitter reflection and secrete it as some wretched slave secretes a diamond in the mines of golconda then perhaps and then only he might be permitted to marry margaret for a bit of parchment with shakespeares name upon it most certainly for a whole play in his handwriting mr samuel erin it was probable would have bartered fifty nieces and thrown his own soul into the bargain our young friend however was quite aware of what a poet of a later date would have told him that an angry fancy is a poor ware to go to market with so with as good a grace as he could he put on his hat and accompanied mr erin and his cicerone to clopton house which was but a few yards down the street it was a goodsized mansion of great antiquity but had fallen into disrepair and even decay its present tenant mr williams was a farmer in apparently far from prosperous circumstances half of the many chambers were in total darkness the windows having been bricked up to save the window tax and the handsome oldworld furniture was everywhere becoming a prey to the moth and the worm as a matter of fact however these were not evidences of poverty mr williams had enough and to spare of worldly goods only of some of them he did not think so much as other people of more cultivated taste would have done a warwickshire farmer of today would have considered many things as valuable in clopton house which their unappreciative proprietor had relegated to the cockloft it was to that apartment indeed that mr erin was led as soon as the nature of his inquirieswhich he had stated generally and to avoid suspicion of his actual object to be concerning antiquitieswas understood the room was filled with mouldering household goods of remote antiquity chiefly of the time of henry vii in whose reign the proprietor of the house sir hugh clopton had been lord mayor of london among other things for example there was an emblazoned representation on vellum of elizabeth henrys wife as she lay in state in the chapel of the tower where she died in childbirth you may have that if you like said mr williams to his visitor carelessly he was a fat coarse man but very goodnatured for being on vellum it is no use to light the fire with you dont mean to say you light your fire with anything i see here gasped mr erin well no theres nothing much left of that sort of rubbish we made a clean sweep of it all about a fortnight since there were no old mss i hope mss heaps on em they came from new place at the time of the fire you see though heaven knows why any one should have thought them worth saving they were all piled in that little room yonder and as i wanted a place for some young partridges as i am bringing up i burnt the whole lot of em you looked at them first of course to make sure that there was nothing of consequence well of course i did i hope dick williams aint such a fool as to burn law documents no they were mostly poetry and that kind of stuff but did you make certain about the handwriting else my good sir it might have been that of shakespeare himself shakespeare well what of him why there was bundles and bundles with his name wrote upon them it was in this very fireplace i made a regular bonfire of them there was a solitary chair in the little chamber set apart for the partridges into which mr samuel erin dropped as though he had been a partridge himself shot by a sportsman youmadeabonfireofshakespearespoems he said ejaculating the words very slowly and dejectedly like minute guns may heaven have mercy upon your miserable soul i say cried mr williams turning very red what the deuce do you mean by talking to me as if i was left for execution what have i done ive robbed nobody you have robbed everybodythe whole world exclaimed mr erin excitedly in burning those papers you burnt the most precious things on earth a bonfire you call it nero who fiddled while rome was burning was guiltless compared to you you are a disgrace to humanity shakespeare had you in his eye sir when he spoke of a marblehearted fiend mr samuel erin had his favourite bard by heart and was consequently in no want of base comparisons but he stopped a moment for want of breath annoyance and indignation had had the same effect upon mr williams he had never been bullyragged in his own house for nothingexcept by his wifebefore purple and speechless he regarded his antagonist with protruding eyes a human etna on the verge of eruption mr john jervis knew his man up to this point he had taken no part in the controversy but he now seized mr erin by the arm and led him rapidly downstairs their last few steps were accomplished with dangerous velocity for a flying body struck both of them violently on the back this was william henry who unable to escape the wild rush of the bull had described a parabola in the air if theres law in england you shall smart for this roared the infuriated animal over the banisters perhaps i ought to have told you that mr williams was of a hasty disposition observed mr jervis apologetically when they found themselves in the street hasty exclaimed mr erin whose mind was much too occupied with sacrilege to concern himself with assault a more thoughtless and precipitate idiot never breathed the idea of his having burnt those precious papers i suppose after what has happened it would be useless to inquire just now whether any scrap of them has escaped the flames otherwise my son can go back i am sure that wouldnt do interposed mr jervis confidently william henry breathed a sigh of relief the impressions of stratfordonavon seemed to him indelible they had left on him such local colouring as time itself he felt could hardly remove fortunately for his amour propre not a word was said by his father of their reception at clopton house his whole mind was monopolised by the literary disappointment the inconvenience that had happened to his son did not weigh with him a feather the whole party now proceeded to mr jerviss establishment where the remains of the famous mulberry tree were kept in stock mr erin was haunted by the notion that some shakespearean fanatic might step in and buy the whole of it before he could secure some mementoes whereas the birthplace in henley street could wait an idea at which for the life of him the proprietor of the sacred timber could not restrain a dry smile it was the general opinion that enough tobacco stoppers busts and wafer seals had already been sold to account for a whole grove of mulberry trees mr erin was very energetic with his new acquaintance on the road about precautions against fire insurance against it was out of the question of course but when he had possessed himself of what he wanted and the matter was again referred to as they came away it was noticeable that he had not another word to say upon the side of prudence he declaimed against mr williams rashness whispered william henry to margaret but my belief is that he would now set fire to that timber yard without a scruple in order to render his purchases unique maggie held up her finger reprovingly but her laughing eyes belied the gesture both these young people indeed had far too keen a sense of fun to be enthusiasts to mr hart the butcher who at that time occupied the house in henley street as an indirect descendant of the immortal bard through his sister mr erin paid a deference that was almost servile he examined his lineaments in the hopes of detecting a likeness to the chandos portrait with a particularity that much abashed the object of his scrutiny and even tried to get him to accompany him to the church that he might compare his features with those of the bust of the bard in the chancel but it was in the presence of the bust itself that mr erin exhibited himself in the most characteristic fashion standing on what was to him more hallowed ground than any blessed by priests and within a few feet of the ashes of his idol he was nevertheless unable to restrain his indignation against the commentator malone through whose influence the coloured bust had recently been painted white instead of bursting into shakespearean quotation as it was his wont to do on much less provocation he repeated with malicious gusto the epigram to which the act of vandalism in question had given birth stranger to whom this monument is shown invoke the poets curses on malone whose meddling zeal his barbarous taste displays and daubed his tombstone as he marred his plays his rage indeed so rose at the spectacle that for the present he protested that he found himself unable to pursue his investigations within the sacred edifice and proposed that the party should start forthwith to visit anne hathaways cottage at shottery there was at present no more need for mr jerviss services so that gentleman was left behind mr erin and frank dennis led the way by the footpath across the fields that had been pointed out to them and william henry and margaret followed it was a lovely afternoon the trees and grass upon which a slight shower had recently fallen emitted a fragrance inexpressibly fresh all was quiet save for the song of the birds who were giving thanks for the sunshine how different this is from norfolk street murmured margaret it is the same to me answered her companion in a low tone because all that makes life dear to me is where you are when you are not there margaret i have no home you should not talk of your home in that way returned she reprovingly yet you know it is the truth margaret that there is no happiness for me under mr erins roof and that my very presence there is unwelcome to him i wish you would not call your father mr erin she exclaimed reproachfully did you not know then that he was not my father what in her extreme surprise she spoke in so loud a key that it attracted the attention of the pair before them mr erin looked back with a smile shakespeare must have taken this walk a thousand times maggie he observed she nodded and made some suitable reply but for the moment she was thinking of things nearer home she now remembered that she had heard something to the disadvantage of mr erins deceased wife one of those unpleasant remarks concerning some one connected with her which a modest girl hears by accident and endeavours to forget until mr erin had become a widower margaret had never been permitted by her mother to visit norfolk street mrs erin had been a widowa mrs irwynbut she had not become mr erins wife at first because her husband had been alive it was probable then that what william henry had said was true he was mrs erins son but not mr erins though he passed as such this was doubtless the reason why her uncle and he were on such distant terms with one another and why he never called him father on the other hand it was no reason why her uncle should be so harsh with the young man and treat him with such scant consideration some women would have despised the lad for the misfortune of his birth but margaret was incapable of an injustice her knowledge of his unhappy position served to draw him closer to her than before by the blush that in spite of her efforts to repress it spread over her face william henry understood that she gave credit to his statement and by the tones of her voice he felt that it had done him no injury in her eyes it was a matter however which though necessary to be made plain could not be discussed what your uncle says is very true maggie he quietly remarked this must have been shakespeares favourite walk for love never goes by the high road when it can take the footpath the smell of that beanfield the odour of the hay of that very meadow may have come to his nostrils as it comes to ours his heart as he drew nigh to yonder village must have beat as mine beats because he knew his love was near him there is the cottage cried mr erin excitedly pointing in front of him and addressing his niece is it not picturesque with its old timbers and its mossy roof it will make an excellent illustration for your book observed frank dennis the practical it has been illustrated already pretty often returned the other drily or we should not recognise it so easily let us hope its the right one muttered william henry for it will be poor i who will have to suffer for it if it is not fortunately however there was no mistake they stepped across the little brook and stood in the garden with its well and its oldworld flowers before them was the orchard for whispering lovers made and on the right the low vineclad cottage with the settle or courtingseat at its door here shakespeare came to win and woo his wife whatever doubt may be thrown on his connection with any other dwelling that much is certain on the threshold of the cottage mr erin took off his hat not from courtesy for he was not overburdened with politeness but from the same reverence with which he had doffed it at the church he entered without noticing whether he was followed by the others or not a descendant of anne hathaways though not of her name received him fit priest for such a shrine that he had not read a line of shakespeare in no way detracted from his sacred character frank dennis himself not a little moved went in likewise as margaret was following him william henry gently laid his hand upon her wrist and led her to the settle which was very ancient and wormeaten sit here a moment maggie this is the very seat as mr jervis tells me on which shakespeare sat with her who became his wife here on some summer afternoon like this perhaps he told her of his love margaret trembled but sat down it is amazing to think of it she said he must have looked on those same trees and on this very well but he did not look at them maggie said the young man tenderly he looked at the face beside him as i am looking now and i will wager that it was not so fair a face what nonsense you talk willie why do you not give yourself up as youras mr erin doesto the associations of the place they are so interesting its just what i am doing dear maggie it was here they interchanged their vows a different pair indeed though not altogether so superior since to my mind you excel anne hathaway as much as i fall short of her marvellous bridegroom that i am no shakespeare is very true yet it seems to me maggie that when i say i love you even he could have said nothing more true and deep i love you i love you i love youdo you hear me continued the young man passionately you frighten me willie answered maggie in trembling tones and then it is so foolish since you know that even if i saidwhat you would have me sayit could be of no use but you think it you think it that is all i ask urged the other earnestly if matters were not as they are if i got mr erins consent if i had sufficient means to offer you a homenot indeed worthy of you for then it must needs be a palacebut comfort competence you would not say nay dearest maggie my own dear darling maggie give me hope the miserable as shakespeare tells us have no other medicine and i am very very miserable give me hope the light of hope it would be a willofthewisp willie no matter i would bless it if it led me to my grave if i had it i could work i could win fortune even fame perhaps you doubt it try me try me he continued vehemently and if after some time a little little time no harvest comes of it and my brain proves barren why then i will confess myself a dreamer only in the meantime be mine in spirit do not promise yourself to another let us say a year well then six months you can surely wait six months for me maggie it would be six months of delusion willie let it be so a fools paradise but still for me a paradise i have not had so many happy hours that fate should grudge me these i know i am asking a strange thing still i am not like those selfish lovers who being in the same pitiful case with me as to means exact like dogs in the manger vows of eternal fidelity from those whom they will in all probability be never in a position to wed i ask you not for your heart maggie but for the loan of it for six months grace probation if i fail to show myself worthy of youif i fail to make a nameor rather to show the promise of making it within that time then i return the loan i do not say as was doubtless said by him who sat here before me be my wife i only say for six months to come betroth yourself to no other man come maggie frank dennis is not so very pressing it was a dangerous card to play this mention of his rivals name but it won the game dennis was as true as steel but through a modest mistrust of his own meritsa thing that did not trouble william henryhe was a backward lover he had had opportunities of declaring himself which he had neglected thinking of himself too lowlily or that the time was not yet ripe or preferring the hope that lies in doubt to the despair that is begotten of denial and this i think had a little piqued the girl she liked him well enough well enough even to marry him but she liked william henry better and other things being equal would have preferred him for a husband they were not equal but it was possiblejust possible for the moment she had caught from her reputed cousin some of that confidence he felt in his own powersthat they might be made so at all events six months was not a space to delve the parallels in beautys brow and then it was so hard to deny him you shall have your chance willie she murmured though as i have warned you it is a very poor one he drew her nearer to him despite some pretence of resistance and would have touched her cheek with his lips when the cottage door was suddenly thrown open behind them and mr erin appeared with an old chair in his hands which he brandished like a quarterstaff above his head he looked so flushed and excited that william henry thought his audacious proposal had been overheard and that he was about to be separated from his margaret for ever by a violent death it is mine it is mine cried the antiquary triumphantly i have bought anne hathaways chair chapter vi an audacious criticism in the case of crime every person who is concerned in its detection looks very properly to motive the law indeed in its award of punishment disregards it but then as a famous authority and himself in authority namely mr bumble observes the law is a hass where mankind falls into error is in looking for motive in all cases whether criminal or otherwise a very large number of persons are actuated by causes for which motive is far too serious a term they are often moved by sudden impulse nay even by whim or caprice to take very important steps when interrogated after the mischief has been done as to why they did this or that they reply i dont know and are discredited yet as a matter of fact the motive was so slight or rather so momentary for it was probably strong enough while it lasted that they have really forgotten all about it william henry erin of whose character the world subsequently took a very different and erroneous view was essentially a man of impulse he had attributes it is true of another and even of an antagonistic kind he was very punctual and diligent in his habits he was neat and exact in his professional work though a poet his views of life or at all events of his own position in it were practical enough yet he was impatient passionate and impulsive his proposition to margaret slade had been made with such stress and energy that it was no wonder albeit she knew his character better than most people that she thought it founded upon some scheme for the future already formed in his own mind of its genuineness there could be no shadow of doubt but she also took it for granted that he had some ground for expectation which at all events to his own mind seemed solid that within the space of time he had mentioned something would occur to place him in a better social position her impression or rather her apprehension for she did not much believe in his literary talentsa circumstance bythebye which showed that she was by no means over head and ears in love with him was that he trusted to the publication of his poems to place him on the road to prosperity his use of the words fame and fortune certainly seemed to point to that direction and what other road was there open to him whereas as a matter of fact there was not even that poor halfpennyworth of substratum for his hopes circumstancesthe finding himself alone with her he loved on shakespeares courtingseathad of course been the immediate cause of his amazing appeal but they were also the chief cause the knowledge that frank dennis was of the party and could gain her ear at any moment with the certainty of mr erins advocacy to back him had moreover made the young man madly jealous to secure his beloved margaret even for a little while from so dreaded a rival was something gained and then there was the chapter of accidents we know not what a day may bring forth how much less what may happen within six months william henry was but a boy yet how many a grown man trusts to such contingencies in the city twentyfour hours to turn about in is often considered time enough for a total change of fortune it might be added that unless margaret should turn traitress and reveal his secret which was impossible he had nothing to lose and everything to gain by his delay but to do the young man justice that idea had not entered into his mind passion with the bit between her teeth had run away with him as to precocity it must be remembered that he lived in reckless days when men did not wait as they do now till they were fiveandforty years of age to marry by that time with enterprise and luck many a gentleman was in the enjoyment of his third or even his fourth honeymoon still william henry was not unconscious that he had taken an audacious step and felt a genuine sense of relief on finding that mr samuel erin had provided himself in that armchair with a relic and not a weapon this invaluable acquisitionwhich when it was brought to london was placed on a little elevation made on purpose for it in his study with a brass plate at its foot after the manner of chairs in our madam tussauds with the words anne hathaways chair upon ithad the effect of putting its possessor into good humour for the remainder of his stay at stratford a circumstance which had the happiest results for those about him william henry for his part was in the seventh heaven it is not only our virtues which have the power of bestowing happiness upon usat all events for a season shakespeare himself makes a striking observation on that matter in one of his sonnets having spoken plainly enough of certain errors gallantries of which he has repented he adds with an altogether unexpected frankness but by all above these blenches gave my heart another youth he does not put his tongue in his cheek at morality far from it but he rolls the sweet morsel the remembrance of forbidden pleasure under his tongue it is one of the mistakes that our divines fall into to deny to our little peccadilloes any pleasure at all whereas the fact is that the blossom of them is often very fair and fragrant though the fruit is full of ashes and like the goodly apple rotten at the core and thus it was with william henry who without indeed having committed any great enormity had certainly not been justified in obtaining the loan of his cousins love the consciousness of his temporary possession of it made a very happy man of him for a season he made no ungenerous use of his advantage he did not take an ell because he had gained an inch but he hugged himself in that newfound sense of security as one basks in the summer sunshine those days at stratford were the happiest days of his life considering the means by which they were obtained one can hardly apply to them the usual phrase a foretaste of heaven but they were happy days snatched from a life which was fated to hold few such it was perhaps out of gratitude to him whose memory had helped him to this happiness that the young man really began to take an interest in shakespearean matters and this again reacted to his advantage since it gratified mr erin whose goodwill difficult to gain by other means was approached by that channel with extraordinary facility in association with mr jervis the young man ransacked the little town for mementoes of its patron saint and was fortunate enough to discover a few which though of doubtful authenticity were very welcome to the enthusiastic collector if they were not the rose ie actual relics they were near the rose as proximity is counted in such cases no doubt it is the same with more sacred relicsin a deficiency of toenails of any particular saint it must be something though not of course so rapturous to secure a toenail of some saint in the next century as regards shakespeare it is certainly one of the marvels in connection with that marvellous man that not a scrap of the handwriting save his autograph of one who wrote so much ever turns up to reward the pains of the searcher nay there is only one letter extant even of those that were written to hima commonplace request for a loan from the man who afterwards became his soninlaw under which circumstances when one comes to think about it there may be some excuse for the language used by mr samuel erin to that reckless incendiary mr williams of clopton house if to be indifferent as william henry had been suspected of being to the charms of shakespeare was a crime in mr erins eyes it may be easily imagined how he resented the least imputation of any portion of his idol having been composed of clay there were circumstances connected with his union with anne hathaway and also with that little adventure of his with justice shallows deer which were dangerous to allude to in mr erins presence and if the moral qualities of his hero albeit we may have gathered mr erin was himself though protestant by no means puritan could not in safety be called in question any suggestion of weakness in him as a writer was still more unendurable nevertheless even prudent frank dennis contrived to put his foot in it in this very matter and thereby narrowly escaped falling out of mr erins good graces for the term of his natural life it was during an expedition to charlecote the little party having left their vehicle at the gate were walking through the park mr erin wrapped in contemplationendeavouring perhaps to identify the very oak in as you like it where the poor sequestered stag had come to languishwhile the young people a few paces behind were indulging in a little quiet banter upon the forbidden subject of deerstealing i suppose that he did steal that deer observed margaret slily in a hushed whisper there is no doubt of it answered frank he had to fly from stratford to london for that very reason to get out of sir thomass way nay nay put in william henry i am afraid with some slight imitation of his fathers solemn manner when dealing with the sacred topic let us not say steal it was what the wise do call convey we do a good deal of it in new inn ourselves yonder are our velvet friends said mr erin pointing to a herd of deer in the distance the allusion caused some trepidation in his companions as chiming in only too opportunely with their late disloyal remarks and it was much to their relief that mr erin proceeded as was his wont to indulge himself in quotation and indeed my lord the wretched animal heaved forth such groans that their discharge did stretch his leather coat almost to bursting and the big round tears coursed one another down his innocent nose in piteous chase what a graphic picture his innocent nose who but shakespeare would have dared to write his innocent nose very true sir said william henry gravely his innocent nose not a muscle of his face betrayed the drollery within him he certainly possessed some tricks of the actors trade margaret stooped to pluck a daisy an action which sufficed to account for the colour rushing to her cheeks frank dennis whose wits were not of the nimble sort fitted for such sudden emergency felt he was about to suffocate it seemed to him he had no alternative between speechthe act of saying something no matter whatand an explosion with regard to deer shedding tears he observed i have a friend who is a great naturalist who tells me as a matter of fact that they cant do it cant do what inquired mr erin curtly he says that from the peculiar formation of the ducts of the deer or perhaps from the absence of them i know nothing about the matter myself sir put in the unhappy frank precipitately for the antiquary was looking daggers at him you know quite as much about it as your friend then thundered mr erin great heavens that a man like him or you or anybody should venture to pick a hole in one of the noblest descriptions of the language to find faults in shakespeare himself you remind me sir of the sacrilegious fellow in france the other day who gave it as his opinion that if he had been present at the creation he could have suggested improvements but indeed sir it was not my opinion it is quite as bad to quote those of infamous persons as to originate them yourself mr frank dennis had very little of the serpent in him not even its prudence his sense of justice was shocked by this outrageous speech but it is a mere question of fact and science science interrupted the other vehemently that is the argument of the atheist against the scriptures science indeed what is science when compared with the genius of shakespeare he told you sir that deer shed tears and if they dont whydamn their eyesthey ought to illustration science interrupted the antiquary vehemently that is the argument of the atheist against the scriptures the argument was at least conclusive nothing more remained to be said or was said mr erin stalked on like a turkeycock ruffled his idol had been insulted and he felt that he had done well to be angry every deer he saw stimulated his wrath confound the fellow he murmured as he passed the antlered herd it would serve him right if they tossed him it even crossed his mind perhaps that margaret was right after all in receiving denniss attentions so coldly that he was certainly a very pigheaded young man frank dennis too goodnatured as he was was not a little put out for the moment he felt almost as disrespectful towards shakespeare as sydney smiths friend was to the equator but his eye fell on margaret and he put a bridle on his tongue his sense of annoyance soon faded away but with the antiquary it was not so easily effaced this incident was of considerable advantage to william henry and his little plan in a company of three when one of them has fallen out of our favour one naturally rather cottons to the other if it is only to show the offender what he has forfeited by his misconduct and from thenceforward mr erin showed himself at least less severe towards the young man who bore his name nay what was of more consequence the symptoms he had exhibited of favouring frank denniss pretensions to his nieces hand manifestly slackened he no longer troubled himself to throw the young people together on the other hand though of course with no idea that there was risk in it for he both despised him and despised his youth he suffered william henry and margaret to foregather as much as they pleased he still felt so resentful to franks sacrilegious ideas as respected the customs of deer when under emotion that it was distasteful to him to be shut up with him as a companion and in order to mitigate his society he took an inside place for william henry notwithstanding that except in the matter of mss and first editions he had a frugal mind in the coach to town chapter vii a collectors gratitude the effects of a prolonged holiday upon the human mind are various like other things much recommended by the faculty it does not suit every one it is the opinion of an eminent physician of my acquaintance that little comes of it in the way of wholesomeness except sunburn and that when that wears off the supposed convalescent looks as he feelssatiated and jaded to william henry the conveyancers clerk that week or two at stratfordonavon was what the long vacation is to many lawyers he found a great difficulty in setting to work again at his ordinary duties his fellowclerk had left his employers service so that he had his room to himselfa circumstance that became of much more importance than he had at that time any idea ofbut business was slack at mr bingleys office the young fellow had plenty of leisure though among old mortgage deeds and titles to estates it might be thought he had small opportunities of spending it pleasantly under ordinary circumstances this would not however have been the case with him he had been brought up in an atmosphere of antiquity the satisfaction expressed by his father at the acquisition of any ancient rarity had naturally impressed itself upon his mind the only occasions on which he had won his praise had been on his bringing home for his acceptance some old tract or pamphlet from a bookstall and in time he had learnt to have some appreciation of such things for their own sake albeit like some dealer in old china without much reverence his turn for poetry such as it was was due perhaps to the many old romances and poems in mr erins library rather than to any natural bent in that direction a circumstance indeed which was pretty evident from the young poets style for style is easy enough to catch whereas ideas must come of themselves his holiday had grievously unsettled him he had brought back his dream with him but once more face to face with the facts of life he perceived the many obstacles to its realisation the only legitimate road to successthat of daily dutywould never lead thither but there might be a short cut to it through his fathers favour hitherto he had sought this by fits and starts to mitigate his own condition he now resolved to cultivate it unintermittingly and at any sacrifice he consequently devoted all his spare time and by our lady as his father would have said also no little of his employers to the discovery of some precious ms instead of the spectacled and wizened faces which they were wont to see poring over their old wares the bookstallkeepers of the city began to be haunted by that of william henry eager and young they could not understand what his bright eyes came to seek and certainly never dreamed that it was love that had sent him thereto my mind a very touching episode reminding one of the difficult and uncouth tasks to which true knights in the days of romance were put in order to show their worthiness to win those they wooed the lady of his affections however was far from being sanguine of his success she could hardly fail to appreciate his exertions but she refrained from encouraging them my dear willie she said it is painful to me to see you occupied in a search so fruitless it is only too probable that what you seek has absolutely no existence it is like hunting for the elixir of life or the secret of turning base metals into gold but my dear maggie some such literary treasure may exist he answered tenderly and if i can discover it what is the elixir of life to me will be found with it it was impossible to reason with a young man like this and margaret tried to comfort herself with the reflection that his madness had but five months more to run but it was very very difficult her life was now far from being a cheerful one she was not so vain as to take pleasure in a wasted devotion and she bitterly repented of the momentary weakness that had inclined her to feed its flame the house in norfolk street was more frequented by the learned than ever they came to discuss mr erins late visit to the shakespearean shrine just as faithful moslems might come to interview some pious friend who had recently made his pilgrimage to mecca while they talked of relics and signatures her mind reverted to the sweetsmelling old garden at shottery with its settle outside the cottage door frank dennis came as usual and was made welcome by his host if not quite with the same heartiness as of old not a word of love passed his lips and he was even more reserved and silent than of yore but margaret could not conceal from herself what he came for nay his very reticence had a significance for her she had a suspicion that he had noticed some change of manner between herself and her cousin which for the present sealed his lips when he had quite convinced himself that her heart was in anothers keeping she felt that he would go away and that place by the window where he usually sat a little apart from the antiquarian circle would know him no more she pitied him as she pitied willie though in another way she recognised in him some noble qualitiesgentleness modesty a love of truth and justice and a generosity of heart that extended even to a rival if she had not known william henry it might have been possible to her she sometimes thought to have loved frank dennis but this was only when the former was not present at the end of the day when her cousin came in fagged and dispirited and took his place at the suppertable with little notice from any one her whole soul seemed to go forth to meet him in her tender eyes matters thus continued for some weeks till rather suddenly a change took place in william henry in some respects it was not for the better the unrest which his features had hitherto displayed disappeared and was succeeded by an earnest and almost painful gravity once only she had seen such an expressionon the face of a juggler in the street one evening who had thrown knives into the air and caught them as they fell but with it there was a certain newborn hope she recognised it in the looks he stole at her when he thought himself unobserved and in his talk and manner to others especially to mr erin they suggested confidence or at least a purpose that he said nothing of what he had in his mind to her was in itself significant the conclusion she drew was that he was on the track of some discovery which might or might not prove of great importance poor fellow she had too often seen her uncle and his friends led by wildfire of this sort to the brink of disappointment to put much faith in it they were old and used to failures and with a little grunt of disappointment settled their wigs upon their foreheads and started off again at a jogtrot in search of another maresnest whereas to williehe was but seventeenrepulse would seem like ruin one eveningit was a saturday on which day mr erin was accustomed to entertain a few friends of his own way of thinkingwilliam henry made his appearance later than usual the guests had already sat down to table and were in full tide of talk which was not in any way interrupted by his arrival margaret as usual cast a swift furtive glance at him and at once perceived that something had happened his face was pale even paler than usual but his eyes were very bright and restless a peculiar smile played about his mouth he has found something was the thought that flashed at once across her mind even if he had she felt it would not really alter matters and would only tend to nourish false hopes her uncles heart would never soften towards him in the way that he hoped for a compelled expression of approbation an unwilling tribute to his diligence and judgment born of selfcongratulation on the acquisition of some literary treasure would be his reward at best but stillbut stillher heart went pitapat she knew that no good fortune of the ordinary kind could have happened to him mr bingley though he liked the boy could hardly have promised to make him his partner nor indeed if he had would it have mattered much since his business was so small as to require but a single clerk that he had found a publisher for his poems was not less unlikely while the result of such a miracle would be of even less material advantage throughout the meal william henry scarcely touched bit or sup his air to the one observer of it gave the impression of intense but suppressed excitement it was the custom of mr erins company on saturday nights to share after supper a bowl of punch between them and for those who affected tobacco to light up their long days both the drinking and smoking were of a very moderate kind while of songsinging very common at that date there was none there was only one toast given by the host in reverent tones to the memory of the immortal shakespeare and then they began to wrangle over disputed readings on these occasions it was william henrys habit to quietly withdraw and seek margaret in the withdrawingroom as often as not frank dennis did the like when he would petition for a tune on the harpsichord a thing the other never did margarets voice was music enough for him especially in a ttette but on this particular saturday both young men remained with the rest william henry for a reason of his own and dennis out of courtesy to his host who had promised to give his friends that night an antiquarian treat consisting of the exhibition of a rare tract he had recently acquired it was entitled stokes the vaulting master and full of engraved plates to the outsider as destitute of interest as dinnerplates with nothing on them but to this little band of antiquarians as the meat of turtle to an alderman if they didnt say grace afterwards it was because this precious gift had been vouchsafed to another and not to themselves they sighed and murmured to themselves that erin ought to be a happy man having received their compliments with much complacency their host like an old man congratulated upon the possession of a young wife locked the extract in his bookcase and put the key into his pocket which was taken by the rest as a signal for departure when they had all gone save dennis who as a friend of the house was always the last to go william henry drew from his breast pocket a piece of parchment with two seals hanging from it on slips i think sir said he modestly i have something rather curious to show you eh what said mr erin knitting his brow in the depreciating manner peculiar to the examiner of all curios before purchase some old deed or another i suppose then he turned very white and eager and sat down with the document spread out before him it was a note of hand of the usual kind though of ancient date and dealing with a very small sum of money but if it had been a letter from a solicitors office acquainting him with the fact that he had been bequeathed ten thousand pounds it could not have aroused in him greater interest and astonishment it ran as followsone month from the date hereof i doe promyse to paye to my good and worthy friend john hemynge the sum of five pounds and five shillings english moneye as a recompense for his great trouble in settling and doinge much for me at the globe theatre as also for hys trouble in going down for me to stratfordwitness my hand william shakespere september the nynth received of master william shakespeare the sum of five pounds and five shillings good english money this nynth day of october john hemynge this is indeed a most marvellous discovery william henry said mr erin breaking a long silence and regarding his son with a sort of devout amazement such as might have been exhibited by some classic shepherd of old on finding the tityrus he had been treating as a chawbacon was first cousin to apollo you are certainly a most fortunate young manmaggie for maggie learning that the visitors had departed had joined them full of vague expectancy see what your cousin has brought home with him this appeal of mr erin to his niece was significant in many ways it would have been most natural in such a matter to have turned to dennis but for the moment he could not brook incredulity nor even a critical examination of the precious manuscript moreover he had said your cousin a relationship between the two young people to which he had never before alluded it was plain that within the last five minutes william henry had come nearer to the old mans heart than he had been able to get in seventeen years what followed was even still more expressive for it took for granted an intimacy between his son and niece which up to that moment he had studiously ignored did you know anything he added my girl of this surprise which your cousin had in store for us i knew that there was something uncle though not from his lips that is she continued with a faint flush i felt for days that there has been something upon william henrys mind which i judged to be good newswas it not so willie the young man bowed his head the colour came into his face also how she must have watched him and how rightly she had read his thoughts was what he was saying to himself mr erin took no notice of either of them his mind had reverted to the newfound treasure look at it dennis he cried the seals and paper are quite as they should be i have no doubt of its being a genuine deed of the time then the signaturethere are only two others in all the world but i do thinkjust take this microscope his own hand trembled so that he could scarcely hold itthere can be no mistake about it it is without the a but it can be proved that he spelt it indifferently and again the receipt has the a an inconsistency which in the case of a forgery would certainly not have been overlooked there can be no doubt of its being a genuine signature can there that is a matter on which you are infinitely better qualified to judge than i am mr erin was the cautious rejoinder perhaps you had better consult the autograph in johnson and steevenss edition tush do you suppose that i have not every stroke and turn of it in my minds eye reach down the book maggie margaret who knew where to lay her hand upon every book in her uncles library made haste to produce the volume there did not i tell you said mr erin triumphantly look at the w look at the s dennis did look at them very carefully yes he admitted there is no doubt that they are facsimiles facsimiles exclaimed the old man angrily why not frankly say that they are by the same hand at once but that is begging the whole question argued dennis his honest and implastic nature leading him into the selfsame error into which he had fallen at charlecote park it is surely more likely upon the whole that an autograph purporting to be shakespeares should be a facsimile than an original or in other words answered mr erin with a burst of indignation it is more likely that this lad here poor william henry the poor sounded almost like poor dear should have imposed upon us than not oh no oh no interposed margaret earnestly i am sure that mr dennis never meant to suggest that then what the deuce did he mean by his facsimile ejaculated the antiquary with irritation look at the upstrokes look at the downstrokes you have made an accusation against me mr erin said frank dennis speaking under strong emotion which is at once most cruel and undeserved if i thought myself capable of doing an injury to william henry or especially of sowing any suspicion of him in your mind ii would go and drown myself in the river yonder mr erin only said umph in such a tone that it sounded like then go and do it how is it possible that in throwing any doubt upon the genuineness of that document continued the other i should be imputing anything to its finder nor indeed have i cast any doubt on it i know nothing about it then why offer an opinion put in the old man implacably at all events sir i hazarded none as to how the thing came into william henrys possession tut tut replied the antiquary once more reverting to the precious document who cares how he got it the point is that we have it here not only shakespeares handwriting but a most incontestable proof to such as ever doubted it of his honour and punctuality in discharge of his just debts william henry i have been mistaken in you my lad i will honestly confess that i had built no such hopes upon you when i lost my poor samuel a son that died in infancy i never thought to be made happy by anything a boy could do again this is the proudest moment of my lifeto have under my own roof to see with my own eyes to touch with my own fingers the actual handwriting of william shakespeare then with a sigh like one who returns to another something he himself fain would keep as knowing far more how to value it he folded up the document and returned it to william henry nay sir said the lad gently breaking silence for the first time it is yours not mine my pleasure in acquiring itfor to say truth it cost me nothingwould all be lost if you refused to accept it what as a gift no my boy that is impossible i dont mean that you must take cash for it for william henry looked both abashed and disturbed but something that will at least show you that i am not ungrateful for one wild instant the young man believed that like a stage father mr erin was about to place margarets hand in his and dower them with his blessing but he only walked to his bookcase and took from the shelf where it had just been reverently laid stokes the vaulting master and pushed it into his hands but sir you have not heard how i gained possession of the deed exclaimed the astonished recipient of this treasure tomorrow tomorrow answered the antiquary as he left the room with the document hugged to his heart tomorrow will be time enough for details in his heart of hearts he feared lest there should be some flaw in the young mans story which might throw discredit upon the genuineness of his discovery and for that night at least he wished to enjoy his acquisition without the shadow of a doubt chapter viii how to get rid of a company when mr erin had closed the door behind him there was silence among those he had left dennis and margaret naturally looked to william henry for an explanation of so singular a scene but he only turned over the leaves of stokes the vaulting master with an amused expression of countenance this reminds me he observed presently of what one of mr bingleys female clients did the other day she had a favourite cat which one of her toadies used to extol in order to curry favour with her and when she died she left him that as being the richest legacy she could think of her mere money went to a hospital margaret gave him a look which seemed to reproach him for his frivolity and dennis remarked gravely enough i do hope there is no mistake about that deed of yours my lad for i am afraid it would be a terrible blow to your father deed of mine exclaimed the young man indignantly how on earth can i tell whether it is genuine or not that is very true said margaret how can he we must hope for the best now tell us where you found it willie and all about it well its a queer story i promise you and i can only give you my word of honour for the truth of it i should hope that would be enough said margaret confidently it will be enough for you maggie said the young man quietly but i am very doubtful whether it will be sufficient for others since even to myself it would still seem like a dream save for the documentary evidence if that is right as mr erin seems to think all is right and for that you are not responsible put in margaret eagerly just so i know no more about it being shakespeares genuine signature than you do how the thing came into my hands was this way you know the horn tavern in fleet street dennis well of course did i not dine with you ten days ago there nay let us be accurate throughout i dined with you said the young man smiling and that reminds me of what i had forgotten before it was on that very day that i first met my friend did you notice an old gentleman with a flaxen wig dining by himself in the cornerindeed i know you did for we remarked that it was rather early in the day for a man to be drinking port i remember your making the observation answered dennis but i cannot recall the gentleman i did not notice him with any particularity nor i but it seems that he noticed me i took my midday meal there the next day and there he was again we sat at adjoining tables and he entered into conversation with me his manner was at first a little stiff and reticent like that of an old bachelor who lives alone but something i said about childs bank seemed to attract his attention he was not aware that the accounts for the sale of dunkirk had been found among their papers and seemed more astonished that i should know it again it amazed him to find that i knew about chaucers having beaten the franciscan friar in fleet street being ignorant of course of the set of people i have been brought up amongst here it doubtless astonished him that so young a man should take any interest in such matters he said he was but an indifferent antiquary himself from an incurable habit of indolence which had grown upon him during years of seclusion but that his tastes had at one time lain in that direction that he possessed a considerable collection of manuscripts bequeathed to him by a cousin and that if i liked to look in upon him at his chambers in the temple i might perhaps find something worthy of my attention of course i availed myself of this invitation i found my friend in an unusually large set of chambers but which had the appearance of great neglect the rooms he occupied himself were well cared for enough though he informed me that he saw no company but the others were used as lumberrooms they were filled with old books old armour old manuscripts piled up on the floor in the greatest confusion there were heaps of law documents relating to his own affairs which had no better treatment i suppose my new friend saw by the expression of my face that i thought him a very eccentric personage for he suddenly observed i have taken a strong fancy to you young gentleman and i am not easily pleased but there is one thing which you must beware of if you want our friendship to continue i cannot be troubled with questions the man who left me all these things was worried to death by the curiosity of other people where did you get this how did that come into your hands and so on there are some things here my possession of which would be so envied by some people that i should never have a moments peace from their importunities if you should come across any such treasure and should reveal the place where you found it you and i part company let that be thoroughly understood between us of course i promised never to mention his name or address to any one as william henry paused a moment to take breath that will be rather awkward observed dennis gravely of course there was no help for it but your inability to give a reference as to the discovery of the deeds will give rise to suspicion suspicion of what inquired margaret with a flush on her cheek of the authenticity of the document i should rather have said would strengthen suspicion for that there will be objectors to it is certain my cousin has nothing to do with them said margaret surely he is not personally answerable for the genuineness of the deed certainly not answered dennis gently pray go on willie said margaret it was plain that what dennis had said had annoyed her in some way not only was he himself however quite unconscious of the cause of offence but william henry appeared equally in the dark he glanced from one to the other with a puzzled look before he took up his tale i have paid several visits to the templar as i will call him since then and he has been most kind and hospitable as my time is not my own and i can only occasionally leave the office he has lent me a latchkey so that i may enter his chambers when i please and pursue my researches in order as i believe to remove from me any unpleasant sense of obligation he has asked me to catalogue his library for him which is of course a labour of love why my good lad it is evident the old gentleman intends to adopt you and will make you his heir exclaimed dennis though he spoke laughingly margaret thought to herself that such an event was by no means out of the range of possibility her cousin was certainly very attractive had excellent manners and as it happened the somewhat exceptional tastes that were most likely to recommend him to such a patron perhaps the future that willie had proposed to her in the garden at shottery might not turn out so wild a dream after all i think my new friend has done enough for me as it is said william henry modestly in turning over some deeds yesterday i found that document which i brought home tonight mr i mean the templarwas not at home so that i had to wait till i could see him this afternoon you may imagine what a twentyfour hours i passed i noticed as i told my uncle that you had something on your mind said margaret but that has been for some days no doubt it was this making acquaintance with your new friend and the possibilities that might arise from it no doubt i confess i allowed myself to indulge in certain hopes returned the young man with a smile but keeping his eyes fixed on the ground what has happened howeveralways supposing that the document is genuinehas been far beyond my expectations when i met my patron and told him what i had found he was surprised enough but by no means in that state of elation which we have just seen in mr erin the reason of which was i am convinced that he at once made up his mind to give me the thing it is very curious he said my cousin always set great store by those old manuscripts but i did not know there was anything among them so interesting as this perhaps you may find some more at all events since but for you this discovery would certainly not have been made or at least not in my lifetime it is but fair that you should reap the benefit of it this note of hand is yours what a gracious gentleman exclaimed margaret enthusiastically it was not as if he did not know the value of what he was giving away just so i am afraid though i begged him to reconsider the matter that i was not very urgent that he should do so i could not help picturing to myself how mr erin would receive such a treasure and how it might be the meanshere he hesitated a momentofmaking myself more acceptable to him dennis patted the lad on the shoulder approvingly he understood that in his presence it was painful to the young fellow to allude to his fathers habitually cold and unpaternal behaviour what he did not understand was that william henry should resent this friendly encouragement as being the manner of a mature man to a junior margaret for her part attributed her cousins hesitation to another cause she felt that if they had been alone together he would have ended that last sentencehow it might be the means ofin a different way in the end of course continued william henry smiling i took what the gods had given me without much scruple but even if nothing more should come of it i hope i shall never forget the old gentlemans kindness nothing under the circumstances could be more moderate or in better taste than the speakers manner not only was there no exultation such as might easily have been excused in a man so young and moreover so unaccustomed to good fortune but he seemed to have resolutely determined not to encourage himself in expectation and yet there was a confidence in his tone which to one at least of those who listened to him was very significant if it is too much to say that pretty margaret had repented of that promise given to her cousin at anne hathaways cottage she had certainly thought it very unhopeful or rather it would be more correct to say she had abstained from thinking of its possible results at all but that night she could not shut them out from her dreams mr samuel erin would probably have also had his dreamsnot less agreeable though of quite another kindbut unfortunately he never went to sleep like belshazzar he beheld all night a writing on the wall which albeit it was not in modern characters needed in his case no interpreter it was shakespeares autograph it seemed to him to be inscribed everywhere and as though the secret of luminous paint had already been discovered to shine miraculously out of the darkness he came down to the morning meal with a face of unwonted paleness but which when it turned to william henry wore also an unwonted smile he listened to his narration of how he became possessed of the deed with interest but without much comment and yet not a word did he say about the precious document itself his silence however was well understood there would that day be a gathering of his shakespeare friends who would decide upon its genuineness but in the meantime it was clear that he had a firm and cheerful faith in it such as men pray for so often in vain for the first time for years he addressed his conversation almost wholly to his son and even recalled events connected with the young mans childhood on later matters perhaps it was scarcely safe to venture lest memories of a less cheerful kind should be raked up with them do you remember my boy the days when we were wont to spout macbeth together and how you had to hold up the paper knife in your little hand and say is this a dagger that i see before me william henry remembered them very well and said so it was curious enough that shakespeare should be the one common ground they had discovered on which to meet on terms of amity then presently have you heard anything of young talbot lately talbot had been that schoolfellow of william henry already spoken of who was a poetaster like himself more fortunate however in worldly circumstances he had succeeded to a small estate in ireland where he lived save when he occasionally came to london for a week or two for pleasure on one occasion william henry had ventured to bring the young man to norfolk street but he had been received with such scant civility by the master of the house that the visit had not been repeated that mr erin should have given himself the trouble to recall his name spoke volumes of shakespearean autograph thank you sir talbot is to be in town for a few days at the blue bear in the strand i believe i beg if you see him then that you will give him my compliments said mr erin graciously the transformation was quite magical it was as though some humble wight dwelling in the shadow of king bulcinosos displeasure had suddenly become first favourite and instead of receiving buffets had been given his majestys hand to kiss margaret had never liked her uncle so much as in this new character and was indignant with her cousin that he did not respond to his fathers kindness with more enthusiasm if he had behaved so to me willie i should have met him half way she afterwards said reprovingly yes answered the young man gravely because you would have known that he loved you for your own sake then with a gentle sigh he added why dont you meet me half way maggie she did not indeed reply as he would have had her but her tender glance betrayed that if she had not got half way she was on the road to meet him he went away to his work as usual but by no means in his usual frame of mind nor were those he left behind him less moved by his late proceedings than himself before midday the parlour in norfolk street was the reception room of quite a throng of dilettanti some summoned that very morning by mr erins special invitation the newfound deed was handed round among these enthusiasts as a newborn babe heir to millions but about whom there are some doubts as to its legitimacy might be received by a select circle of female gossips while the proprietor like a husband confident in his wifes fidelity regards their investigations with a complacent smile they examined it tenderly but with great caution through spectacles of every description and in silence befitting so momentous an occasion yet by their countenances lit by a certain fearful joy it was easy to see that upon the whole they were satisfiednay gluttedby the inspection illustration the dilettanti well gentlemen inquired mr erin with mock humilitya mere pretence of submission to a possible adverse opinion what say you my dear sir frederick what is your verdict he had appealed to one sir frederick eden a shakespearean critic of no mean distinction and who being the only titled person present might naturally be considered as the foreman of the jury it is my opinion mr erin replied that gentleman with great solemnity that this most interesting document is valid a hushed murmur of corroboration and applause broke from the little throng that is my view also said one and mine and mine added other voices if mr erin had just been elected king of great britain and ireland with the empire of india thrown in by anticipation and was receiving the first act of allegiance from the representatives of the nation he could not have looked more gratified and serene that is certainly the conclusion he observed with modesty which i myself have arrived at then he told how william henry had become possessed of the document a narration which redoubled their interest and excitement sir said sir frederick with emotion i felicitate you on the possession of such a son there were reasons as we know which made this congratulation a mere matter of compliment and up to this time by no means an acceptable one but it was with no little pride and satisfaction that mr erin now acknowledged it he is a good lad he said a discreet and wellordered lad and of course it is very gratifying to me that he has found favour in the eyes of this gentlemanwhoever he may beto whom we are indebted for thisthis manifestation it was a strange word to use but under the circumstances not an inappropriate one to mr samuel erin the occurrence in question seemed indeed little less than a miracle and william henry the instrument through which it had been vouchsafed to his wondering eyes what we have to consider he continued dropping his voice in hushed solemnity is that in all probability other papers connected with the immortal bard may be produced from the same source the company nodded their wigs in unison it was as though in their minds eye a dish of peaches had been placed on the table before them their very mouths watered there is one circumstance said sir frederick who still held the document in his hands rather to his hosts discomfort who well knew what temptation was and had become anxious for the return of his property which i think has hitherto escaped our notice in examining the document we have neglected the seals i have just discovered by close scrutiny that they represent that ancient game the quintin here is the upright beam here is the bar here is the bag the company crowded round most of them with magnifying glasses which gave them the appearance of beetles who with projecting eyes and solemn looks investigate for the first time some new and promising article of food at the top of the seal if i am not mistaken continued sir frederick in pompous tones and with the air of a man without whose intelligence a great discovery would have passed unnoticed you will recognise the ring to unhook which with his lance was the object of the tilter if he failed to accomplish it the bar moving swiftly on its pivot swung round the bag which striking smartly on the tilters back was almost certain of unhorsing him we see itit is here there is no doubt of it gasped the excited company now mark you this is not only curious resumed the knight but corroborative of the genuineness of the document in a very high degree observe the very close analogy which this instrument bears to the name of shakespeare is it not almost certain therefore that this seal belonged to our immortal bard and was always used by him in his legal transactions then rose the hushed amaze of hand and eye for some moments no voice broke the awful silence but presently under deep emotion mr erin spoke a revelation he said always needs an expounder and in our friend sir frederick we have found one thanks to your keen intelligence sir the value of this deed has been placed beyond all question i am very glad to have been of some slight service to the cause of literary discovery returned sir frederick modestly perhaps some other lights may strike me if you will allow me to take the document home with me indeed i will do nothing of the kind put in mr erin precipitately not of course my dear friend that i have the least doubt of your good faith he added in gentler tones but in justice to my sonunhappily absent and to whom it belongsi can hardly suffer the deed to leave my custody perhaps at another timefor his friend was looking anything but pleasedyour request shall be complied with but at present it must be here for the satisfaction of doubters such a person i have reason to believe is among us even now a murmur of indignation arose from all sides they cast at one another such furious glances as the thracian nymphs may have done before tearing orpheus to pieces yes mr dennis continued the host sarcastically addressing the unhappy frank who had hitherto remained unnoticed and quiescent i have reason to believe from the expression of your features when i connect it with certain remarks that fell from you in shottery park the other day that you are our only sceptic if to an assembly of divines in convocation the infidel so often alluded to in the abstract in their discourses from the pulpit had been suddenly presented to them in the concrete they could not have looked at him with a greater horror than that with which the company regarded the young man thus thrust upon their attention indeed indeed mr erin pleaded dennis i have never uttered a syllable that could be construed or even perverted into doubt one may look daggers and yet speak none returned mr erin with severity and that he should thus venture to misquote his favourite bard showed even more than his tone the perturbation of his mind the document however will be left herehere he repeated significantly for your private scrutiny and investigation i only trust that you may find cause to withdraw your aspersions groundless in themselves as they are disparaging to my dear son william henry and offensive to this respectable and learned company about as i see with regret to take their leave if mr erin had suddenly seized a hammer and smote him on the forehead mr dennis could hardly have been more astonished than at this gratuitous onslaught he resolved to wait till the company had dispersed which at that broad hint received from its host it proceeded to do and then demand an explanation mr erin however anticipated him i was somewhat more vehement dennis he said in the remarks that i addressed to you just now than the occasion demanded but the fact is some sort of diversion was imperatively demanded my friends i saw were getting turbulent the discovery of the quintin on the seal was too much for them already excited as they were by the exhibition of this extraordinary document sir frederick in particular under circumstances of such extreme temptation i knew to be capable of any outrage i made youi confess itthe scapegoat by means of which the safety of the precious manuscript has been secured in compensation take it and look at it as long as you like what i said about your incredulity though somewhat justified by the past you must admit was in the main but a pious fraud like any man of intelligence you cannot but revere the document it is yours say for the next five minutes then it goes into my iron case for who shall be true to us as he whose honoured name lies there before you in his own handwriting has observed if we be unsecret to ourselves chapter ix an unwelcome visitor although it may be very true that kings can affect but little the happiness of their subjects the petty kings of every householdfrom paterfamilias the first down to his latest descendantshave a very important influence in that way the difference which a morose or cheerful parent makes in the lives of those beneath their roof is incalculable in the one case the atmosphere of existence is all cloud in the other all sunshine it must be confessed that up to this period the jupiter of the little household in norfolk street had been something of a jupiter pluvius there were storms there were tears and even when it was not so the domestic sky was sullen from the date of the discovery however of that note of hand from william shakespeare to john hemynge the weather cleared moreover matters looked all the brighter by contrast it is one of the many advantages that selfish persons of strong will possess that when they do condescend to be genial people are prone to believe that they always were so or at all events that they have misjudged them in setting them down as churlish so in the orient when the gracious light lifts up his longhid head each under eye doth homage to this new appearing sight and mortal looks adore his majesty mr erins domestics began to acknowledge that their master was not half a bad fellow and his niece to whom however it is but fair to say he had always been kind was quite triumphant over his newfound good nature now willie did i not always tell you so c while frank dennis had reason to believe that he had at last been quite forgiven his heretical doubts as to whether deer could shed tears as easily as their antlers as to william henry himself the strides he had made in mr erins favour thanks to that find of his in the templars chambers was something magical as if he had got sevenleague boots on his father even called him samuel as though he were verily and indeed that son he had lost with all the hopes that were wrapped up in him it must be confessed however that this may have been partly owing to the birth of new hopes william henry indeed though he had twice visited his friend in the temple since that one momentous occasion had found nothing very newor rather very oldthere but on the other hand what mr erin justly thought a great piece of good fortune and one that showed promise of much more had befallen him on looking over his patrons papers he came across a deed of no great antiquity in truth but which to that gentleman himself was especially valuable since it established his right to a certain property that had long been the subject of litigation for this something was certainly due to the young man himself since but for his legal learning and knowledge of the nature of the document he might easily have passed it over as being of no importance it was therefore not so very surprising that the old gentleman in a sudden glow of gratitude for which his mind from its natural leaning towards the young fellow was as it were ready laid had given him a promise that whatever he might henceforth discover among his papers of general interest should by way of recompense for the service he had rendered him become his own gladly as william henry himself doubtless received this mark of his patrons favour his joy could hardly have exceeded that of mr erin when the news was communicated to him it must need be confessed however that his gratitude was not wholly dissociated from a sense of favours to come why my dear lad he cried this note of hand of shakespeares priceless as it is may be yet outdone by what remains to be discovered in this strange treasuretrove of which you speak of the contents of which both as to their nature and value their owner seems to be wholly ignorant there may be for all we know whole letters in shakespeares handwriting copies of his plays a sonnet or two possibly even the skeleton of some play which he never filled in with fleshandblood characters the hint of some divine tragedygracious goodness and mr erin threw up his hands in speechless ecstasy as though a glimpse of heaven had been vouchsafed to him of which it was not lawful for him to discourse further of course it is possible sir returned william henry gravely but for my part i dare not trust myself to think of what may be lying in yonder lumber rooms just now indeed i am giving my attention solely to my patrons library arranging the bookshelves and making out the catalogue after his generous promise i purposely forego the pleasure of investigation lest i should be considered grasping fire interrupted the old man suddenly with tremulous anxiety think of fire you know what happened at clopton house and though of course your patron would never wilfully destroy a scrap of paper with any antiquity about it yet who can guard against accidentcarelessness one spark from a candle and the world may be robbed of we know not what oh my dear lad for the worlds sake if not for mine i pray you lose no time never mind your work ill settle all that with bingley stick to the lumberroomi mean the precious manuscripts dull not device by coldness and delay the eagerness of the old man was in its intensity quite touching no lover entreating his mistress for the momentous monosyllable could have been more earnest or even more passionate william henry himself who throughout the late stirring incidents which promised to affect his future so nearly had kept himself studiously calm and quiet was deeply moved i will do my best sir he replied in agitated tones nothing pleases me better than to give you pleasure that is well said returned the old man graciously margaret looked on with approving eyes supposing even what the young man had so rashly set his heart on should bear no fruitif his dream should not be realisedit was surely well that such friendly relations should be established between him and the man who if not his own flesh and blood was his natural protector it was very satisfactory also to see that willie was responding to mr erins overtures of goodwill as to these last there could be no doubt as to her uncles change of front towards her cousin to whom indeed he had hitherto shown no front at all but had turned his back upon him and that very evening there was another proof of it as the three were sitting down to supper william henry noticed that the table was laid for four under ordinary circumstances he would have taken it for granted that dennis was coming but he knew that the architect was out of town on business he was not yet on such intimate terms with the master of the house as to inquire who was the expected guest and supposed him to be one of the shakespearean literati who were now dropping in at all times presently there was a knock at the door whereat margaret looked at her uncle with a significant smile and her uncle looked at william henry i have got a pleasant surprise for you my lad he said gaily some time agoindeed it was before maggie came to live with usyou had a friend whose companionship i thought was doing you no good and i gave him the cold shoulder it is never too late to own oneself in the wrong he certainly did you no harm and perhaps intended none it is only natural that you should have friends of your own age and that they should be made welcome in your fathers house so as you told me he was in town i sent round a note to him to ask him to drop in tonight to supper before william henry could reply the door opened and the servant announced mr reginald talbot the newcomer was a freshcomplexioned young gentleman of about eighteen or so rather clumsily built for his age with long reddishbrown hair and bold eyes they did not look at all like nearsighted eyes but he wore round his neck what was then called a quizzingglass held by the hand through which he now surveyed the present company his attire if not more fashionable than mr erins guests were wont to wear showed a much greater taste for colours his waistcoat was heavily laced and the buckles on his shoes if as was probable they were not made of real diamonds shone by candlelight as though they had been it is very kind of you mr erin he said pon honour to let me drop in in this way if i had known that there were ladies presenthere he glanced at margaret and bowed like a dancing masteri would have put on more suitable apparel pooh pooh youre smart enough said mr erin in a tone in which contempt and politeness struggled ludicrously for the upper hand this is only my niece margaret slade theres your old friend william henry didnt i say my ladhere he turned to his son and clapped him on the shoulderthat i had got a surprise for you of course mr erin had meant it well just as he had done when he had made him that priceless present of stokes the vaulting master but as in that case it would have seemed to a close observer that he had not exactly hit upon the meed of merit most to william henrys fancy that young gentleman shook hands indeed with the newcomer cordially enough but whether from surprise or some other cause could at first find no better topic to converse upon than the weather i suppose he said you have not been having much more sun where you have come from than we have had sun echoed the other drily i suppose there is not much difference in the weather of norfolk street and that of the strand i have been in london as i wrote to you i should be these ten days and not a hundred yards away if you had cared to come and see me i didnt understand that from your letter stammered william henry i thought i think i can explain this matter mr talbot interposed mr erin satisfactorily as far as william henry is concerned if somewhat to my own disadvantage under a misconception which it is unnecessary to explain i had tacitly forbidden my son to visit you i am sorry for it i hope you will now make up for it by seeing a good deal of one another while you remain in town youre very good im sure said talbot he looked from father to son in a vague and puzzled way and then he looked at margaret through his spyglass the young lady annoyed to be so surveyed cast down her eyes and mr erin with some revival of his old caustic tone inquired do you propose to deprive your friends at home of your society for any length of time a week or two perhaps more returned the other without a shade of annoyance he had evidently taken his hosts remark au srieux i am come up on business of my own he added grandly for as to old docket though my articles are not yet run out i treat him as i please you are in the fortunate position of having a competence of your own i conclude well yes that is i come into it on my majority something in land and also in hand i shall then leave the law and pursue the profession of a man of letters heaven deliver us ejaculated mr erin sir exclaimed the visitor and make us thankful for all its mercies added his host bending over his plate i beg pardon grace muttered mr talbot growing red to the roots of his hair margaret reddened too for it was not usual with her uncle to say grace and william henry reddened also with suppressed laughter he had not given his father credit for so much dexterity and now i daresay william henry you would like a talk with your old friend in your own room observed mr erin you must make mr talbot quite at home here the young gentleman looked as if he would quite as soon have remained in the society of miss margaret who had obviously attracted his admiration while william henry could hardly repress a groan but so broad a hint could scarcely be ignored and the two young men retreated together accordingly i hope william henry is pleased my dear said the old gentleman when he found himself alone with his niece he cannot say that i have not made some little sacrifice but why had he not been to see this fellowi gave him leave nay sir you did not give him leave implicitly you said that if he met mr talbot he was to give him your compliments willie is always so very particular not to overstep your permission in any way mr erin muttered an articulate sound such as a bumblebee makes when imprisoned between two panes of glass it was not exactly hum but it resembled it william henry was now all that he could wish him to be but there had been occasionsthough to be sure there was now no need to think of themwhen he had not been so very careful to obey the paternal commands well i hope he appreciates my little surprise he murmured a man of letters forsooth never never was i so pestered by a popinjay chapter x two poets illustration what on earth is the meaning of all this was the first question that reginald talbot put to his friend when they found themselves alone together of all what returned william henry indifferently here are pipes by the way will you smoke a little tobacco there it is again cried talbot i say once more what is the meaning of it the idea of your respectable father permitting us to smoke under his roof why it was only as it were under protest that he was wont to permit you to breathe then as for me he used to think me something worse than one of the wicked an anomalous emanation from grub street a sort of savage with cash in his pocket whereas his tone to me now is as the honey of hybla what magic has wrought this change in the old curmudgeon well perhaps of late he has got to understand me better and consequently my friends suggested william henry oh that cant be it replied talbot contemptuously i should say if he knew as much about you as i did he would behave worse to you than ever i dont mean anything offensive to you my dear fellow added the speaker for his companions face had grown very troubled on the contrary i compliment you its just those qualities i admire most in you which would least recommend you to his good graces on the other hand if you have a fault in my eyes it is an excess of caution come be frank with me what is the tune which has set this rhinoceros a dancing i have had the good fortune to find an old manuscript which has put my father in high good humour and the young lady your cousin is she too enamoured of old manuscripts well not that i am aware of laughed william henry then i congratulate you was the quick rejoinder it is now obvious to me that she is enamoured of you that her affections were bespoken in some direction from the first was plain from the manner in which she received my advances your advances yes you have heard of the power of the human eye over the brute creation well that is nothing to the effects of this he tapped his spyglass upon the sensibilities of angelic woman i have never known it fail except when their minds are preoccupied with another object i am writing an epic to be entitled the spyglass the views of which though founded on personal experience will be quite novel and that reminds me how often have we not read our poems to one another why have you never come to see me since i have been at the blue boar my dear fellow as you heard my father say began william henry persuasively tut tut i mean your real reason put in the other scornfully we used to meet often enough when the rhinoceros did not dance when he was very far from dancing yet now the fact is my dear fellow interrupted william henry earnestly there is a reason i have reached that point already without a guide observed the other drily the truth is pursued william henry mr reginald talbot took the pipe from his mouth and laughed aloud certainly no diplomatic explanation could have been conducted under greater difficulties some people yearn for fame my dear erin he said to others it is very undesirable to be well known even by a single individual if you imagine i wish to deceive you talbot you are quite wrong said william henry firmly but it is true that i cannot be so frank with you as i could wish i have a secret which is not my own or you may be sure that you should share it listen then he told him the whole story of his acquaintance with the templar and its singular result talbot listened to him with great attention it is very curious he remarked when the narrative was finished and certainly a great stroke of luck but it is like a tale from the arabian nights nay i dont mean on the score of veracity for william henry had flushed crimson but from its parenthetic nature it is a story within a story for if you can stretch your memory so far you began with the intention of telling me why you never came to see your old friend at the blue boar it was because i had no time talbot i have to do my work at the office and also to attend upon my new acquaintance at the temple you must be occupied indeed not a moment in which to say howdyedo goodmorrow there were also my fathers injunctions i thought such a fleeting visit as you speak of would be worse than nothing and would cause you more annoyance than being neglected but now my father and you are friends i will certainly find time to renew the ancient days come that is better now shall i fill up what is wanting in your explanation and make all clear if you please said william henry indifferently though i am not aware that there is anything more yes there is your cousin margaret said talbot with a cunning air you would have braved the anger of the rhinoceros and followed your own inclinationswhich i flatter myself would have led you to come and see mehad his favour been no more important to you than of yore but he holds in his hand another hand of which he has the disposal and therefore it behoves you to be on your best behaviour you have guessed it exclaimed william henry with admiration if i thought you could have sympathised with me as i see you do i should have saved you the trouble of guessing sympathise with you when was son of the muses indifferent to the love wound of his friend have we not always sympathised with one another does any one except yourself admire your poetry as much as i do can i anywhere find a friend more capable of appreciating the higher flights of mine than you i have done a good deal bythebye in that way since i saw you last erin not to mention six cantos of the spyglass i have written oneandtwenty songs some of them may be useful to you if your inspiration has flagged of late for they are all to my mistresswhose name like yours is fortunately in three syllablesa madrigal or two and a number of miscellaneous pieces chiefly satirical tomorrowyou said tomorrow i thinkwe will devote to recitation william henrys countenance fell he had heard mr reginald talbots recitations before they were not extempore but they had one fatal attribute in common with extemporaneous effusionsthere was no knowing where they would end if he had been invited to recite his own poetry that would have been a different thing nothing would be more agreeable to me my dear fellow but how am i to excuse my absence from chambers then ill come to your chambers instead of your coming to me i shall thus have the opportunity of seeing how your muse has progressed we will compare notes together to be sure it is not as if you had your room to yourself theres that disagreeable fellowclerk of yours a most unappreciative and flippant person yes he would spoil everything put in william henry eagerly it is better we should be alone together even for a less time at the blue boar very good then give me as long as you can tomorrow i want your advice for the fact is the business on which i am come up to town is about the publication of my poems the publisher and i cannot agree about terms which seems strange since what we both want is money down perhaps you wouldnt mind my selecting a few of your very bestyou and i could rig out a twin volume together like beaumont and fletcher perhaps observed william henry dubiously he had private and pressing reasons for conciliating mr reginald talbot but to such a monstrous proposition as had just been made to him he felt he could never consent it would be like yoking his pegasus to a dray horse as regarded other matters it was true that talbot and he were old friendsor rather it would be more correct to say that they had for years of boyhood been thrown into one anothers company the bond of schoolfriendship is however soon weakened under the influence of other conditions as hothouse flowers fade and fail in the open air and moreover when angered talbot who piqued himself on his knowledge of human nature had a habit of saying what he thought of his antagonist which was not the less intolerable if it happened to be correct their tastes it was true were similar but involved some rivalry and each perhaps was secretly conscious that the other did not admire his verses so much as he pretended to do with the irish channel between them they would doubtless have continued to get on capitally together but as intimates the path of friendship had pitfalls it must be added that mr reginald talbots arrival in town had taken place at a most inconvenient season and was in a word unwelcome to his former crony that this was not perceived by talbot was not so much owing to the others tact as to his own conceit which was stupendous but fortunately it was not seen perhaps our young friend did not quite believe in the irish gentlemans sympathy with him in respect to margaret and misdoubted his spyglass perhaps he thought him if not too wise too cunning by half at all events he greatly regretted that his brother bard had just now come to london and especially about the remunerative production of his poems which he had reason to believe would be a protracted operation the next afternoon when he paid his promised visit to the blue boar a circumstance occurred which caused him increased annoyance i say my astute young friend were talbots first words delivered in that half morose half bantering way which was habitual to him when ready primed for a quarrel where have you been to these last three hours to the temple did i not tell you that i generally went there in the afternoon as to the exact locality you must perceive the impropriety of my mentioning it even to you still you might speak the truth about other matters why did you not tell me that old bingley had dismissed his second clerk what possible interest could the circumstance have for you only that you allowed me to conclude that he was still there in order that i should not come to new inn very good then you know the reason mr reginald talbot grew very red and his stout frame grew visibly stouter william henry however though more slightly built was not his inferior as he had more than once had the opportunity of discovering either in courage or in the art of selfdefence after behaving in so false a manner to me sir said talbot pointing to a very considerable heap of mss written in parallel lines i shall not read you my poems thank you that is returning good for evil said william henry coolly read them to yourself and not aloud or you will set the cats a caterwauling and with that he clapped his hat on and marched out of his friends apartments it was not one of those quarrels described as the renewal of love it was a deadly feud a woman even if she is not as fair as venus may forgive an imputation on her good looks but a poet conscious of an inferiority to shakespeare does not forgive a slight inflicted on his muse chapter xi the lovelock whether william henrys short method with mr reginald talbot was to be satisfactory or not remains to be seen but for the present it had all the effect intended the inmate of the blue boar confined himself to his own quarters or at all events did not take advantage of the general invitation given to him by mr samuel erin to visit norfolk street nor did that gentleman make any inquiry into the cause of his absence he had done his best to pleasure his son and encourage him in his discoveries but was well content that the popinjay kept away with william henryand this was perhaps even a greater proof of the change in the old man than his more active kindnesseshe was very patient and unimportunate he would cast one look of earnest inquiry on the young fellow as he came home every evening and receiving a shake of the head by way of reply would abstain from further questioning such was his admiration for the nameless inmate of the temple that he respected his wish for silence even as it were at second hand this behaviour was most acceptable to its object and the more so since the reticence mr erin thus observed in his own case he imposed upon his visitors who would have otherwise subjected william henry to the question forte et dure half a dozen times a day he had persuaded himself that if once the mysterious visitor should get to know that a fuss was being made about that note of hand he would withdraw his favours from his protg altogether one evening william henry came home a little earlier than usual and in return to his fathers inquiring look returned a smile full of significance i have found something father he said but you must be content in this case with the examination of it then your friend has gone back from his word replied the old man well it was almost too much to expect that he should have kept to it nay you must not misjudge him father for the very restrictions he has placed upon me mean nothing but kindness the treasure trove is this time for margaret margaret what does he know about margaret well at all events it is in the family this reflection alone would hardly have been sufficient to smooth away disappointment from the old mans brow had it not also struck him that his niece had no great taste for old mss and that a new gown with a fashionable breastknot or some flanders lace would probably be considered an equivalent for the original draft of hamlet come come let us hear about it but if you please sir we must wait for my cousin my patron said maggie maggie exclaimed the old man running out into the little hall and calling up the stairs come down this moment here is a present for you at the unwonted news maggie ran downstairs arranging the last touches of her costume upon the way and arriving in the parlour in the most charming state of flush and fervour entranced with her beauty and conscious of having made another step towards the accomplishment of his hopes william henry devoured her with his eyes it was seldom indeed that he committed such an imprudencein companybut if he had kissed her it is probable under the circumstances mr erin would have made no remark or set it down to shakespearean enthusiasm another ms maggie he cried triumphantly come that is better than fifty presents answered maggie beaming i forgive you for your trick upon me uncle with all my heart but what i have found is for you said william henry firmly just so exclaimed mr erin hurriedly the ms or something of equal worth that you would like vastly better let us see now let us see illustration maggie maggie here is a present for you william henry took out of his pocket an ancient timeworn piece of paper carefully unfolded it and produced from it a lock of brown straight hair i thought you said it was a ms exclaimed mr erin in a tone of extreme disappointment why this is only hair and if i may be allowed to say so not a very good specimen even of that nevertheless sir such as it is it is shakespeares hair shakespeares hair echoed mr erin falling into rather than sitting down on the nearest chair it is impossibleyou are imposing on me william henry turned very white and looked very grave and pained oh uncle how can you say such a thing cried margaret plaintively poor willie i did not mean that my lad of course gasped mr erin i scarcely know what i say it seems too great a thing to be true his hair he eyed it with speechless reverence as it lay in his sons open palm his trembling fingers hovered round it like the wings of a bird round the nest of its little ones but did not venture to touch it where was it found he murmured wrapped up in this paper a letter to anne hathaway which mentions the fact of his sending her the lock and encloses some verses is it possible exclaimed the old man with intense excitement oh happy day read it read it i can see nothing clearly the letter ran as follows dearesste annaas thou haste alwaye founde mee toe my worde moste treue so thou shalt see i have stryctlye kept mye promyse i praye you perfume thys mye poore locke withe thye balmye eyess fore thenne indeede shalle kynges themmeselves love and paye homage toe itte i doe assure thee no rude hand hath knottedde itte thye willys alone hath done the worke adewe sweete love thyne everre wm shakespeare most tender true and precious exclaimed the antiquary ecstatically and now the verses there are but two sir said the young man apologetically is therre in heavenne aught more rare thane thou sweete nymphe of avon fayre is therre onne earthe a manne more treue thanne willy shakespeare is toe you william henry read very well and with much pathos and into the last line he put especial tenderness which did not need the covert glance he shot at her to bring the colour into margarets cheek though deathe with neverre faylinge blowe doth manne and babe alyke bringe lowe yet doth he take naught butte hys due and strikes not willys heart still treue what simplicity what fidelity murmured the antiquary a flawless gem indeed whence did you unearth it i found it where i found the other deed sir amongst my patrons documents i took it of course to him at once he was greatly surprised and interested and fully conscious of the value of the godsend yet he never showed the least sign of regret at the gift he made me of what he was pleased to call the jetsam and flotsam from his collection if i were a younger man he said i think i should have grudged you that lock of hair it is just the sort of present a young fellow should give to the girl he has a respect for a thing that costs nothing yet is exceedingly precious and which speaks of love and fidelity it is too good for any antiquary your patron is mad my lad said mr erin in a tone of cheerful conviction he must be mad to talk like that and indeed he would never give away these things at all if he were in his sober senses the idea of bestowing such an inestimable relic upon a girl why it should rather be preserved in some museum in the custody of trustees to the delight of the whole nation for ever nevertheless sir such was my patrons injunction he asked of me if i knew any pure and comely maiden well brought up and who would understand the value of such a thing i had therefore of course no choice but to mention margaret whereupon he said that the lock of hair was to be hers ill keep it for you maggie in my iron press said mr erin considerately you shall look at itin my presenceas often as you like and then we shall both know that it is safe and sound as for the letter and verses samuel it will be better to put them for the present perhaps in the same repository you may put them where you like sir answered william henry smiling as he always did when addressed by that unwonted name they are yours a good lad an excellent lad murmured the antiquary now let us with all due reverence inspect these treasures this is the very hair i should have looked for as having been the immortal bards just as the engraving by droeshart depicts it in the folio edition brown straight and wiry as steevens terms it i should not call it wiry uncle observed margaret though to be sure it has no curl nor gloss on it it seems to me soft enough to have been a womans hair it is perhaps a trifle silkier and more effeminate than the description would warrant returned the antiquary but that is doubtless due to the mellowing effects of time it may be so far looked upon as corroborative evidence in that connection bythebye let me draw your particular attention to the braid with which the hair is fastened this woven silk is not of todays workmanship i recognise it as being of the same kind used in the reigns of mary and elizabeth for attaching the royal seal to patents a most interesting circumstance and one which were there any doubt of the genuineness of the hair might like the impress of the quintin in the case of the hemynge deed be reasonably adduced as an undesigned coincidence then to think that we have it under his own hand that shakespeares fingers have knotted it read his words once again my son before we put the priceless treasure by i doe assure thee no rude hand hath knottedde itte thye willys alone hath done the worke how tender how touching exclaimed the antiquary we seem to be in his very presence what a privilege has this day been vouchsafed to us my children the two young people glanced at one another involuntarily as the old man addressed them by this title it is probable that mr erin attached no particular meaning to it it may have been only the expression of the measureless content he felt with both of them with his son for what he had brought him and with his niece for the readiness with which she had resigned what he had brought to his own custody but to their ears it had a deep significance as their looks met that of william henry was so full of tender triumph that maggies face became crimson and she cast down her eyes for the first time she began to believe in the possibility of the realisation of the young mans dream notwithstanding what had passed between them she had hitherto felt more like a sister towards him than a lover it was not that she feared to risk the wreck of her own happiness by trusting it to so slight a bark but that while matters were so uncertain a natural and modest instinct prevented her from regarding him as he regarded her there had been a sort of false dawn of love with her but now that her uncle seemed to give such solid ground for hope the sun which had long lain in wait behind those clouds of doubt came out with all the splendour of the morn love arose within her as mr erin reverently placed his treasures in the iron safe william henry stole his arm round margarets waist is there on earthe a manne more treue than willie erin is to you he whispered softly and for the first time she did not reprove him chapter xii a delicate task great as had been mr erins joy when he first looked on shakespeares lovelock and love letter it by no means wore offas our violent delights are apt to doas time went on what was wanting in the way of novelty was made up to him perhapsfor we may be sure margaret did not insist upon her rights in the matterby the sense of possession for what was the position of the man who had in his cupboard some unique pieces of china or even in his coffers the biggest ruby or diamond in the world as compared with his own only as in the latter case he grew not a little nervous for the safety of his unrivalled treasure he was a virtuoso and antiquary himself and therefore recognised the full extent of his danger in his iron press he caused a little well to be sunk in which the lock of hair was placed under glass for the contemplation of the faithful and none was ever permitted to behold it save in his presence even then he did not feel safe but compelled himself to adopt a plan to ensure security which galled him to the quick just as in old times black mail was wont to be given by the rich to leading and powerful robbers as an insurance on their goods so mr samuel erin did not hesitate to offer to the more audacious and formidable of his learned brethren bribes and those of the most precious kind imaginable though every thread taken from shakespeares lock gave him a pang infinitely keener than the drawing out of his own beard with pincers would have done he actually distributed a few of these precious hairs among his friends which they placed reverently in rings and lockets we may be sure that sir frederick eden had a genuine hair or two but it was whispered by the envious who were many that upon applications becoming numerous mr erins favours grew in proportion which as the lock did not diminish could only arise from some other source of supply among the recipients who entertained this doubt or among those who received no such sacred relic at all there were some who had the hardihood to assert that no human hair could have resisted the lapse of time since shakespeares days they even produced a mr collett a hair merchant who came to inspect the lockfrom a distance of several feet howeverand who had the hardihood to express this opinion in the proprietors presence to describe the effect of anger in aged persons especially when accompanied with personal violence is painful to one who like the present writer has a respect for the dignity of human nature so we will draw a veil over what ensued but it is certain that mr collett left norfolk street on that occasion with much precipitationtaking the four steps that led to the front door at a bound he also left his hat behind him which was thrown after him into the street it must be admitted that his objections were as absurd as they were impertinent since it is well known that human hair has survived many centuries of burial indeed when the vault of edward iv who died in was opened at windsor the hair of the head was found flowing and as strong as hair cut from the head of a living person this sir frederick eden privately assured mr erin to be true since he was not only present at the exhumation but had been so fortunate by means of a heavy bribe to the sexton as to get some of the said hair for his private collection partly from reasons that have been suggested but chiefly from william henrys remonstrance upon his patrons accountwho he felt confident would lay an embargo upon all future treasure troves if he should find the report of what had happened to interfere with his own ease and privacymr samuel erin took little pains to circulate the news of his sons second discovery but nevertheless it oozed out and in spite of himself william henry found himself to be in some respects a public character whoever called to see the manuscripts inquired also if the young gentleman was at home to receive from his own lips the ofttold tale of their discovery this was exceedingly irksome to him he would much rather have been reading and talking to his fair cousin and let his father have all the glory of exhibition and explanation to himself but maggie never grudged him to these inquirers she was pleased to find he was so much sought after and took a greater pride in it than even her uncle william henry went to new inn as usual but it was well understood that the time he spent there was of little consequence as compared with his visits to the temple mr erin ever thirsted for new discoveries not only on their own account but because as he justly observed the greater the bulk of them the more probable would their genuineness appear to those inclined to question it the antiquary demands not only treasure but credit and though mr erin himself entertained no doubts he would rather that other people had none just as the gentleman who kept the thousandpound note framed and glazed upon his mantelpiece not content with knowing it was from the bank of england resented the imputation from his friends of its having been issued from the bank of elegance moreover mr erin was secretly troubled at the continued absence of frank dennis he could as we have seen on occasion and even when there was no occasion give him the rough side of his tongue but in his heart he greatly respected him the old man thanks to himself or rather to his temper had few friends the bond that united him to those he possessed was itself a source of rivalry and disagreement but denniss father and himself had been as brothers and after the former died mr erin had allowed the young man some familiarity to which certainly none of his years had been admitted before or since he professed just now to be absent on business but business had never detained him from norfolk street so long before mr erin reproached himself with having driven him away by his harsh behaviour and even went so far as to confess as much to his niece of course it annoyed me wench to see frank so obstinate in his incredulity for that he was incredulous about that note of hand i am certain i can only say that he never breathed a word of doubt to me uncle nor to me yet i know he harboured doubts was the confident reply he stuck to them even after sir frederick found out the quintin on the seals still its only a matter of opinion uncle opinion its what the believers in the scarlet woman call inveterate contumacythey used to burn people for it well but you dont agree with them you know smiled margaret you were always a stickler for the rights of private judgment the antiquary shook his head and pursed his lips the only reply possible to him under the circumstances he could not say but when i mean private judgment i mean the judgment that coincides with my private views perhaps i have been a little hard on him maggie and that is what keeps him away i wish he were back again this confession from the mouth of such a man was pathetic what it conveyed as margaret partly guessed was that in the crowd of flatterers and secret detractors by whom her uncle was surrounded he felt the loss of his honest if somewhat too outspoken friend she felt remorse too as well as compunction for in her heart she suspected that she herself was the cause of franks absence he had doubtless noticed the changed relations between herself and william henry and withdrawn himself but without a word of complaint from her society he recognised the right she had to choose for herself nor did he grudge her the happiness she found in her choice but he could not endure the contemplation of it it was out of the question of course that she should reveal this to mr erin but she was too straightforward to corroborate a view of the matter which she knew to be incorrect i dont think frank is one uncle to take offence at anything you may have said to him about the deed he is too sensiblei mean she added with the haste of one who withdraws his foot from a precipice his nature is too generous to harbour offence you really think that do you returned the old man in a tone of unmistakable relief well in that case just drop him a line and let him know how the matter stands you need not put it upon me at all but say you miss his society here very much as of course you do margaret was greatly embarrassed the task thus proposed to her was almost impossible she had never written to the young man before and to do so now in her peculiar circumstances and for the purpose of asking him to return to town would be very painful to her and might be misleading to him i like mr dennis very much uncle she stammered but just so interrupted the antiquary this scepticism of his as you were about to say is a serious drawback still if i can get over it you can surely make allowance for him moreover when he sees the lock of hair and the love letterand perhaps there may be other discoveries by the time he returnshe must be a very thomas not to believe such proof now if it had been he instead of william henry who had found these precious relics all would have indeed been well i dont think we should grudge poor willie his good fortune sir returned margaret reprovingly she was quicker than ever now to take her cousins part and her uncles tone of regret had touched her to the quick it made it evident to her that his newfound regard for his adopted son was but skindeepor rather manuscriptdeep the pity for him that she had always felt had become a deeper and more tender sentiment and given her more courage to defend him grudge him of course i do not grudge him returned the antiquary fuming i only meant that if frank dennis had william henrys gifts he would be a perfect man you can tell him that if you like for a single instant margaret saw herself telling mr dennis that and felt the colour rise to her very forehead her uncle noticed that there was a hitch somewhere and became naturally impatient at finding his wishes interfered with by the scruples of a slip of a girl well write what you will he continued with irritation only see that it brings him poor margaret she liked frank dennis as she had said very much but as she had only too good reason to believe not so much as he wished her to do what she had to say to him was come to me but not for my sake it was a parallel to the nursery address to the ducks dilly dilly come and be killed only he was not to be killed but tortured what were the use of compliments it was like asking a young gentleman to be best man when he wants to be the bridegroom himself she could thoroughly depend upon willie to avoid all appearance of triumph but there was no getting over the fact that he was franks successful rival though he would never say like the boastful schoolboy to his less fortunate companion do you like cakes then see me eat them yet he had the cake and it was a cake that could not be divided however there was no help for it so she sat down to write her letter it was a very difficult and delicate task she had learnt to call him frank but could she address him so on paper dear mr dennis was too formal and my dear mr dennis was under the circumstances not to be thought of she eventually wrote dear frank how dreadfully familiar it lookedyet a fortnight ago it would have seemed natural enough what delays the wheels of your chariot if it is business i am sure you must have had time to build a cathedral my uncle misses you very muchthis sounded unkind it suggested that no one else regretted his absence so she addedas we all do here with a little sigh she underlined all so as to make it appear that she regretted him only as william henry did no more and no less i hope for my uncles sake you will come back less of an infidel in shakespearean affairs the lock of hair of the discovery of which you have doubtless heard has bythebye thanks to the chivalry of the templar been given to me so you will understand that any aspersion cast upon its genuineness is a personal matter the weather is wetthough it should make no difference to an architect since he can roof himself anywhereso there is no excuse for your lingering in the country for pleasures sake had she dared to say so she might have hinted very prettily that with him the sunshine would return to norfolk street but she was no longer fancy free even as it was sisterly as she had endeavoured to make the tone of her letter she feared she might have given him some involuntary encouragement it was terrible to her to feel so confident as she did that on the receipt of it frank dennis would start for london chapter xiii the profession of faith two days after margarets letter was despatched there was great news from the temple not even on the first day when william henry had won mr erins heart by shakespeares note of hand had the young mans face been so full of promise as when he came in that evening on the former occasion anxiety and doubt had mingled with its expectancy but now it was flushed with triumph the difference of manner with which he produced his new discovery was also noticeable it was not only that he felt as sure of the assent of his audience who were indeed but his uncle and margaret as of his own but he displayed a certain selfconsciousness of his own position he was no longer an unknown lad seeking for the favour of one who should have been his natural protector for he had already won it it was true he was still dependent upon him for the means of livelihood and for something that he prized as highly as existence itself but mr erin had in some sort on the other hand become dependent on him his reputation as a shakespearean collector and critic which was very dear to him had been immensely increased by his sons discoveries the newspapers and magazines were full of his good fortune and even those which disputed the genuineness of his newly acquired possessions made them the subject of continual comment and added fuel to his notoriety if such a metaphor can be used without offence in the case of a gentleman of years and learning mr samuel erin gazed at william henry with much the same air of expectation as a very sagacious old dog regards his young master whom he suspects of having some toothsome morsel in his pocket he has too much respect for his own dignity to beg for it by sitting up on his hind legs or barking but he moves his tail from side to side and his mouth waters the young gentleman did not at first even produce his prize but sat down at table with a cheerful nod that seemed to say i have found it at last and by the sacred bones that rest by avons stream it is worth the finding well willie exclaimed margaret impatiently what is it the young man gravely produced two halfsheets of paper at the sight of it for he knew that it was not the new bath post the antiquarys eyes glistened mr erin began william henry why not call me father samuel put in the old man gently if it was the sense of favours to come that moved him it was at least a deep and genuine sense of them margarets fair face glowed with pleasure i have often heard you say father that you wished above all things to discover what were in reality shakespeares religious convictions the antiquary nodded assent but said nothing the intensity of expectation indeed precluded speech the perspiration came out upon his forehead it distressed you i know to believe it possibleas indeed the language used by the ghost in hamlet would seem to imply that he was of the catholic persuasion in the profession of faith found at stratford spurious put in mr erin mechanically that fool malone believed in it nobody else this was not quite in accordance with fact for many months the whole shakespearean world had admitted its authenticity if it had been true however it would have offended your sense of the fitness of things no doubt still we must take things as they really were even if it should turn out that shakespeare was not so good a protestant as he ought to be the value of a genuine manuscript was not to be depreciated well i have been this day so fortunate as to discover what will put all doubts at rest upon this point shakespeare was a protestant thank heaven murmured mr erin piously if you have done this my son you have advanced the claims of true religion and quickened the steps of civilisation throughout the world margarets eyes opened very wide as well they might but they only beheld william henry she had been wont to rally him upon his vanity and especially upon the hopes he had built upon his poetical gifts yet how much greater a mark was he making in the world than his most sanguine aspirations had imagined and how quiet and unassuming he looked the modest way in which he habitually bore his honours pleased her even more than the honours themselves after all maggie he would say after receiving the congratulations of the dilettanti it is nothing but luck as he straightened out the halfsheets of paper on the table where their homely supper stood untouched and unnoticed he only permitted himself a smile of gratification it is too long he said to read aloud and the old spelling is difficult his uncle drew his chair close to him on one side and margaret did the like on the other so that each could read for themselves their looks were full of eagerness the one was thinking of shakespeare and samuel erin the other of william henryand longo intervalloof william shakespeare the ms which was headed william shakespeares profession of faith ran as follows william shakespeares profession of faith i beynge nowe offe sounde mynde doe hope thatte thys mye wyshe wille att mye deathe bee acceded

probably have done so in any case but his reverence for the matter forbade rapid reading she waited respectfully but also with some little apprehension for the expression of his opinion this is a godsend he exclaimed at last with a sigh that had almost as much relief as satisfaction in it there can be no longer any doubt about shakespeares creed is it not beautiful and full of humility my child yes uncle she knew that the least faultfinding would be resented yet she could not shut out from her tone a certain feeling of disappointment it is hardly however so simple as i should have expected not simple exclaimed the antiquary in amazement i call it the most natural effusion of a sincere piety that it is possible to imagine the diction is solemn and dignified as the subject demands there are indeed some minute particularities of phraseology and the old spelling to one unaccustomed to it may as william henry has observed be a little difficult but of all the accusations you could bring against it that of a want of simplicity my dear maggie is certainly the most frivolous and vexatious i know i am frivolous replied margaret with a sly look at her smiling cousin but certainly did not intend to be vexatious uncle nay nay i was only quoting a legal phrase said mr erin he had gently drawn the two precious mss to himself and placed an elbow on each of them in sign of having taken possession in a case of this kind i need not say that anything in the way of criticism as to ideas or style would be out of place and indeed blasphemous but no one can blame you for seeking in a proper spirit for enlightenment on this or that point margaret looked up at william henry and with a halfroguish and wholly charming smile inquired may i my dear maggie returned the young man laughing outright why of course you may even if you detected the immortal bard in an error it would be no business of mine to defend him i should think not indeed muttered mr erin what i was thinking said margaret was that if you willie or mr talbot who informed us the other night you know that he was a poet had written those lines about spreading her wings over her little brood it would have been considered plagiarism what then inquired mr erin contemptuously it is the peculiar province of a genius such as shakespeares to make everything his own he improves it by addition the idea in question however is taken from the new testament observed maggie to most people this remark which was delivered with a demureness that did the young lady infinite credit would under the circumstances have been rather embarrassing it did not embarrass mr samuel erin in the least what piety it shows what knowledge of the holy scriptures he ejaculated admiringly how appropriate too when we take the subject into considerationa confession of faith true i am not quite sure however whether the substitution of a chicken for a hen is an improvement now there i entirely differ from you exclaimed mr erin just mark the words o cheryshe usse like the sweete chickenne thatte under the coverte offe herre spreadynge wings receyves herre lyttle broode and hoverynge over themme keepes themme harmlesse and in safetye what tenderness there is in that sweete chickenne whereas a hena hen is tough we must understand the expression of course as a general term for the female species of the fowl none to my mind but the most determined and incorrigible caviller can have one word to say against it i have settled that matter i think my dear to your satisfaction and do not suppose that what you say has annoyed me if anything else strikes you pray mention it objections from any sourceprovided only that they are reasonablea word he uttered very significantlywill always have my best attention i welcome them illustration the profession of faith indeed uncle i am not so audacious as to propound objections there was one thing however that seemed to me a little incomprehensible possibly my dear he said with a smile of contemptuous goodnature which seemed to add i am not so rude as to say probably he took his elbows off the ms though he still hovered above it like the chicken while she ran her dainty finger over it taking care however not to touch the paper ah here it is as snowe from the leffee tree now considering that snow falls in winter when the trees are bare dont you think the word should have been leafless an ordinary person would no doubt have written leafless admitted mr erinan ingenious observation enough since in the first place it suggested that an extraordinary genius could have done nothing of the kind and secondly it demanded no rejoinder it gave the antiquary time to cast about him for some line of defence he produced his microscope and examined the word with great intentness but it was leffee and not leafless beyond all doubt it is probable he presently observed that shakespeares minute attention to nature may have caused him when writing these most interesting words to have a particular tree in his mind when indeed we consider the topic on which he was writingdeathwhat is more likely than that his thoughts should have reverted to some churchyard yew now the yew my child is an evergreen here frank denniss wellknown voice was heard in the little hall without he must have started for london therefore on the instant that he received margarets letter her heart had foreboded that it would be so notwithstanding the pains she had taken to make it appear otherwise she knew that it was her wish that had summoned him and that he had been sent for as it were under false pretences much as she esteemed him she would have preferred the appearance of any one else however indifferent such as mr reginald talbot strange to say mr samuel erin though it was at his own express desire that frank dennis had been invited was just at that moment of the same way of thinking as his niece if that little difficulty about the epithet leffee had not occurred all would have been well this new discovery of the confession had it been flawless must needs have converted the most confirmed of sceptics and in his crowning triumph he would have forgiven the young fellow all his former doubts but though to the eye of faith this little flaw was of no consequence it would certainly give occasion not only for the ungodly to blasphemefor that they would do in any casebut to the waverer to cling to his doubts if on the spur of the moment mr erin could have explained the matter to his own satisfaction he would have felt no qualms but he was secretly conscious that that theory of the evergreen tree would not hold water it might satisfy a modest inquirer like margaret but a hardheaded unimaginative fellow like frank dennis would not be so easily convinced as for william henry although frank and he were by no means ill friends it was not likely that he should have been pleased to see this visitor whose presence must needs interrupt the ttette with which he now indulged himself every evening with margaret and though he was no longer jealous of his former rival it was certain that he would much have preferred his room to his company the welcome that was given by all three to the new comer was however cordial enough you are come dennis cried mr erin taking the bull by the horns in the very nick of time william henry has today found a treasure beside which his previous discoveries sink into insignificance a profession of faith by shakespeare written from end to end in his own hand that must indeed be interesting said frank his tone however was without excitement and mechanical his countenance which had been full of friendship though when turned to margaret it had had she thought an expression of gentle melancholy fell as he uttered the words a gravity little short of disapproval seemed to take possession of it hang the fellow murmured mr erin to himself hes beginning to pick holes already it is the most marvellous and conclusive evidence he went on aloud of shakespeares adherence to the protestant faith that heart can desire but theres a word here that we are in doubt about just read the ms and see if anything strikes you as anomalous frank sat down to his task the expression of the faces of the other three would have required the art of hogarth himself to depict them that of margarets was full of sorrow pain for herself and distress for frank and annoyance upon her uncles account how she regretted having made that stupid objection though she had done it with a good motive since she foresaw that it would presently be made by much less friendly critics why could she not have been content to let matters take their own course as willie always was on his brow on the other hand there sat a complete serenity from the very first his attitude with respect to his own discoveries had been one of philosophic indifference nothing ever roused him from it not even when the scepticism of others took the most offensive form he had not he said the learning requisite for the defence of the faith that was in him and moreover it did not concern him to defend it he was merely an instrument the matter in question was in the hands of others this was of course by no means the view which mr erin took he had not only the confidence but the zeal of the convert if he would not himself have gone to the stake in defence of the genuineness of his newfound treasure he would very cheerfully have sent thither all who disputed it he was regarding his friend dennis now as he plodded through the profession with anything but amicable looks but when he marked his eye pass over that weak point in its armour with which we are acquainted without stoppage his brow cleared a little and he gave a sigh of relief well he inquired gently what say you have you found the error or does it seem to you all straight sailing i had really rather not express an opinion said dennis quietly but if you press me i must needs confess that the whole composition strikes me as rather rhapsodical does it then i on my part must needs confess returned the antiquary with laborious politeness that i have the misfortune to disagree with you to this observation the young man answered not a word his face looked very grave and thoughtful like that of a man who is in a doubt about some important course of conduct rather than of a mere literary inquiry nevertheless his words when they did come seemed to concern themselves with the latter topic only i doubt he said whether the word accedehere he pointed to the phrase after my deathe be acceded towas in use in shakespeares time and what if it was not broke in the antiquary impatiently how many words in old times are found in the most correct writers which it would be vain to hunt for in any dictionary words which though destitute of authority or precedent are still justified by analogy and by the principles of the language and who i should like to know used new words with such licence as shakespeare himself as to the matter of fact which you dispute however that can be settled at once the antiquary stepped to his bookcase and took down a volume this is florios dictionary published in see here he added triumphantly accedere to accede or assent to if florio mentions it i suppose shakespeare may have used it your objection young sir is not worthy of the name dennis hung his head he looked like one who has suffered not only defeat but humiliation the criticism offered on the spur of the moment had been in reality advanced by way of protest against the whole document and now that it had failed he was very unwilling to offer anything further in the way of disparagement he had his reasons for absolutely declining to fall in with mr erins views in the matter but it would have given him great distress to quarrel with him unhappily an antiquary the genuineness of whose curios has been disputed is not often a chivalric antagonist it is his habit like the wild indian and the wilder irishman to dance upon his prostrate foe the obstinacy of the commentator resumed mr erin is proverbial and is on some accounts to be excused but the strictures suggested by ignorance and malignity are mere carping but it was yourself sir pleaded dennis who invited criticism i did not volunteer it criticism yes but not carping now there is a word here continued mr erin not sorry to be beforehand with his adversary in pointing out the blot here is the word leffee where one would have expected leafless now we should be really obliged to you if your natural sagacity which is considerable could explain the reason of the substitution i have already given expression to a theory of my own upon the subject but we shall be glad of any new suggestion why is it leafy instead of leafless i should think it was simply because the writer made a mistake observed dennis quietly everybody the speaker included expected an outburst that shakespeare could have made a mistake was an assertion which they all felt would to mr erins ear sound little less than blasphemous to their extreme astonishment he nodded adhesion now that is really very remarkable dennis he exclaimed a new idea and at the same time one with much probability in it he was writing currente calamothere is scarcely a break in the composition you observe from first to lastand it is quite likely that he made this clerical error what is extremely satisfactory is that your theorysupposing it to be the correct one as i think it isputs the genuineness of the document beyond all question for if a forger had written it it is obvious that he would have been very careful to make no such departure from verisimilitude chapter xiv the examiners illustration notwithstanding the powerful motives in connection with its munificent but unknown donor that impelled mr samuel erin to keep the profession of faith a secret confined to his antiquarian friends the thing was obviously impossible it would have been almost as difficult had the tables of the law been verily discovered upon mount sinai to restrict the news to a few members of the religious public the discovery and the discoverer william henry erin became the talk of the town it seemed to margaret impossible that the meritorious though fortunate young fellow could ever become more famous but the possibilities of greatness are infinite his foot as it turned out was only on the first rung of the ladder the modest house in norfolk street became a sort of metropolitan stratfordonavon it was absolutely besieged by the antiquarian and learned world mr malone the commentator indeed who had not been invited publicly announced his intention of not examining the mss lest his visit should give a countenance to them which from the secrecy that was observed relative to their discovery they were not entitled to mr steevens took the same course as did also dr farmer lord orford and the bishops of durham and salisbury the air was thick with their pamphlets and loud with their denunciations but there were more fish than these in the shakespearean seas and quite as big ones who were of a different opinion some of them came to scoff but remained to admire and believe others calm and critical examined and were convinced others again arriving in a reverent spirit were filled with satisfaction and affected even to tears under these circumstances his own good faith being attacked as well as these precious treasures maliciously denounced mr samuel erin took a bold course on a table in his sanctuary side by side with the new discovery was placed another profession of faith in the validity of the ms in question which visitors were invited to sign they were not of course compelled to do it but having expressed their belief in the genuineness of the document it seemed not unreasonable that they should commit it to paper in some cases there were rather humorous scenes antiquaries as a rule are not very eager to permanently endorse with their authority the treasures which are not in their own possession they have been known even to express a cheerful belief in that or this and afterwards when unpleasant evidence turns up to deny that they ever did believe in it and mr erin who knew latin was an admirer of the ancient line litera scripta manet which literally translated means one cant well wriggle out of ones own handwriting as pilgrims did not pay for the privilege of admission to view these sacred relics they were naturally inclined to be civil to their custodians and when sufficiently convinced of the genuineness of what they saw to express themselves with much effusion and enthusiasm as the paper in question was worded very modestly but with extreme distinctness there was no alternative for the impulsive person but to sign it delighted to have seen you mr erin would say as he pressed the hand of his departing guest your unsoughtfor and enthusiastic testimony has been most gratifying to me dont mention it my dear sir it is i who have been delighted it has been a privilege indeed to have set eyes upon so valuable and absolutely authentic a document then just as a matter of form be so good as to add your name to this already lengthy roll of shakespearean critics it will be the very keystone of the edifice of our faith the faces of some of these enthusiasts at this modest and reasonable request would fall from zenith to nadir they could not eat their own words but they looked as if they would like to have eaten mr samuel erin william henry who had a strong sense of humour was sometimes compelled to rush from the room and hide his face bedewed with tears of laughter upon margarets shoulder these paroxysms used rather to distress her oh willie willie how can you be so frivolous she would say on a matter too that is so fraught with good or evil to both of us oh but if you could only see them my darling he would reply so civil so beaming with courtesy and enthusiasm and then all of a suddenlike a sportsman in a small way who boastful of his prowess finds himself face to face with a wild boaralarmed astounded and without the least hope of escape you would laugh too then when they wont sign it is almost even better fun porson was here this morning the great dr porson who knows as much greek as troilus did and certainly can write it better he drank half a bottle of brandy a pint of usquebaugh and all the miscellaneous contents of your uncles spirit case and though he had said but little was taking his leave in what seemed a state of complete good humour and satisfaction when mr erin requested the honour of his signature then he drew himself up as stiff as a pointer at a partridge i thank you sir he said but i never subscribe to anything much less to a profession of faith the disbelieving old heathen i really thought your uncle would have kicked him into the street oh but i am so sorry about dr porson why my darling he was not really kicked you know dont be sorry for porson be sorry for me if i didnt find some amusement in these people i believe i should go mad you have no idea what i suffer from them their examinations and their crossexaminationsfor when they are sceptical they are crossexaminationstheir pomposity and pretence are wellnigh intolerable i dont know whether their patronage or their contempt is the most offensive it was quite true that these investigations were not always a laughing matter to william henry on one occasion there was a regular committee of inquiry composed of what might well be called bigwigs folks of the highest reputation in matters of erudition and most of them in fullbottomed perukes the rev mr warton the commentator was one of them solemn as porson had been and much more sober dr parr the divine and scholar pompous yet affable in ecclesiastical apparel with shovel hat and apron pye the poet laureate combining the air of a man of letters with the importance belonging to a government official and half a dozen other grave and reverend signors the room was specially arranged for their reception mr samuel erin sat at the head of the table in the shakespearean chair that he had purchased at anne hathaways cottage the profession of faith was spread before the learned epicures as though it was something to eat their eyes devoured it william henry had a chair to himself a little removed ready to answer all inquiries it was by far the most serious examination to which he had been subjected but he acquitted himself very well he had nothing he said to tell them but the simple truth as to the genuineness of the document in question he knew nothing and had not even an opinion to offer on the subject these visitors were not mr erins personal friends they did not fall into raptures or affect to do so they were by no means so courteous as the ordinary folks who came from curiosity they had been invited for the special purpose of having their minds satisfied or of coming to an adverse conclusion it was like the star chamber and they did not as it seemed to william henry spare the thumbscrew or the boot after an hour or two of this gentle pressure mr warton observed your testimony young man so far as it goes is satisfactory to us while your behaviour does you great credit yes assented dr parr i think mr erin you have a son of whom you may be justly proud i heard you address him as samuel it is a gratifying coincidence to me that it is also my baptismal name mr erin felt that it would be discourteous as well as embarrassing to undeceive him then mr pye was asked to read the profession of faith which had by this time been fully investigated and discussed aloud which he did in a solemn and sonorous voice with the company reverently upstanding as during divine service then amid a profound silence dr parr delivered himself as follows sir we have very fine passages in our church services and our litany abounds in beauties but here sir is a man who has distanced us all most of the learned company bowed assent and two who were nonconformists murmured hear hear the tears trickled down mr erins cheeks it was the proudest moment so far in the old mans life later on in the day another gratifying circumstance took place a visitor called who either had not received his invitation in time or what was more probable not wishing his personal importance to suffer by comparison with that of others had preferred to come alone his face was fat and puffy and exhibited an unparalleled selfsufficiency he had a sharp nose a double chin and eyebrows superciliously elevated he carried a goldheaded cane in his hands clasped behind him and spoke in a thick slow voice mr erin received him with great respect and submitted his literary treasure for examination with an unwonted humility the investigation was a prolonged and apparently an exhausting one for the visitor called three times as though he had been in a publichouse for hot whisky and water as dr porson had drunk all there was in the case margaret herself who kept the key of the cellar took him in a fresh bottle and curiosity compelled her to remain her presence seemed somewhat to distract the attention of the guest from the precious manuscript no doubt authentic he murmured and devilish pretty antiquity is stamped upon it and the right sort of antiquity suggested mr erin it has the stamp of the time just so i should think twenty years of age at most sir ejaculated his host i mean the usquebaugh explained the visitor twenty years in bottle at leastdid i say at most and plump here margaret was about to beat a retreat when the gentleman rose one moment young lady he said you do not know who i am it will be something to tell your childrens children that james boswell of auchinleck esq here he suited the action to the word chucked you under the chin william henry felt greatly inclined to resent this liberty but mr erin only smiled approval another glass said mr boswell and proceeded with his investigations presently without a word of warning he threw himself on his knees and pressed his lips to the ms i kiss these invaluable relics of our bard he said and thank heaven that i have lived to see them would that my late revered friend the great lexithe great lexicog emotion of various kinds prevented his completion of the sentence and mr erin led him with a gentle violence to the table on which lay the list of signatures to which he added his name though it must be confessed in a handwriting that was rather illegible chapter xv at vauxhall the members of the little household in norfolk street were now in great content that word indeed scarcely describes the state of mind of the head of the house who was literally transported with joy it was difficult to identify the jubilant and triumphant old fellow with the grudging smileless and to say truth somewhat morose individual he had been a few months before his regard for william henry began to be quite troublesome for though he had not the least objection to margaret and his son being alone together he would often interrupt their little interviews from excess of solicitude upon his account that somewhat flippant young gentleman used to compare his parent on these occasions to the sweete chickenne of the shakespearean profession which was always hoverrynge over herre broode and indeed this affectionate anxiety was partly due to a certain apprehension the old gentleman experienced when the goose that laid the golden eggs for him was out of his sight at present however as margaret reminded her cousin there were not enough of themthough so far as they went they had a very material valueto become nest eggs they could not be considered as savings or capital to any appreciable extent they were not indeed theirs at all having been made over to mr erin but for the object the young people had in view that was all one as though they had remained their own if a play of shakespeares or even part of a play should chance to turn up among those treasures of the temple that would indeed be a fortune to them or at all events would procure the antiquarys consent to everything and ensure his favour in perpetuity these ideas occurred to margaret only in the vaguest way nor even in william henrys mind did they take any welldefined shape his nature to do him justice was by no means mercenary and if he could only have called margaret his own he would have been content as to being able to maintain her he had always had a good opinion of his own talents and though the praise with which he was now overwhelmed from so many quarters had of course no reference to them it helped to increase his selfconfidence in this comparative prosperity and being of a disposition that was by no means inclined to triumph over an unsuccessful rival it somewhat distressed him to find frank dennis standing somewhat aloof he visited the house indeed but not so frequently as had been his wont and as regarded william henry at least not upon the same terms he had always been friendly to the younger man under circumstances when it would have been excusable if he had been otherwise but now he avoided him not in any marked manner but certainly with intention if he had avoided margaret also the explanation would have been easy but it was not so he was not indeed on the same terms with that young lady as he had been he did not as of old seek her society his face did not brighten up as it was wont to do when she addressed him but he treated her with a respect which if it was not tender was full of gentleness whereas to william henry he was even cold it was a significant proof of the transformation that had taken place in mr erin that he not only noticed this but in a manner apologised for it to william henry i am sorry to see that dennis and you my lad dont seem to get on together so well as you used to do but you must not mind his being a little jealous at this the young mans face flushed for jealousy had just then with him but one meaning he thought that his father was about to talk with him about margaret but his niece was not in the old mans thoughts at all it is not every one he went on who can bear to see the good fortune of his friends with equanimity especially when it takes the form of such a stroke of luck as in your case what dennis says to himself is why should not i have discovered these mss instead of william henry and not having done so he is a little bit envious of you and is inclined to decry them it is a pity of course but he can do you no more harm by it than he can harm shakespeare by discrediting the work of his hand but the young man was sorry nevertheless and margaret was still more grieved since dennis had tacitly consented to her changed relations with her cousin or at all events had made no opposition to them she thought he might have forgiven him as he had forgiven her it was a subject on which she could not speak to him but occasionally there was something or to her sensitive eye and ear seemed to be something in his tone and manner not resentful but as though he pitied her for her choice which annoyed her exceedingly this feeling was in no way reciprocated it was impossible for margaret to ruffle frank dennis but he rarely came to norfolk street now unless by special invitation it had been proposed by mr erin that they should all four go to vauxhall together upon a certain eveninga very unusual dissipation for except the theatre of which when shakespeare was acted which in those days was very frequently he was a pretty constant patron the antiquary had no love for places of amusementbut frank dennis had declined to accompany them he professed to have a previous engagement which as he went out very little seemed improbable indeed it was understood by the others that he did not wish to go this was a cause of sincere regret to them not excluding william henry for if dennis had come he would have paired off with mr erin and left margaret to himself the expedition however was looked forward to with pleasure by both the young people even as it was it had the charm of novelty for them for william henry was almost as great a stranger to what had now begun to be called life in london as his cousin the little trip to the place by water was itself delightful while the gardens with the coloured lamps and music and gaily dressed company seemed to them like a dream of paradise mr samuel erin was not indeed a very good cicerone to such a spot for folks of their age though he would have been invaluable to some distinguished foreigner with a thirst for information he reminded them or rather informed them for they knew very little about it how for more than a century the place had been the resort of all the wit and rank and gallantry of the town how addison had taken sir roger de coverley there and goldsmith the chinese philosopher and swift had gone in person to hear the nightingale and how much more attractive it was than its rival ranelagh of which nevertheless as walpole humorously writes lord chesterfield was so fond that he ordered all his letters to be directed thither it was with difficulty the old gentleman was persuaded not to take them away from the radiant scene to a neighbouring street to see the lodgings where the poet philips had breathed his last and by way of reprisal for their preference for such gauds and tinsel he quoted to them after dr johnson xerxes remark about his army that it was sad to think that of all that brilliant crowd not one would be alive a hundred years hence the scriptures themselves admit that there is a time to laugh and a time to play and these literary reminiscences and much more these didactic reflections were felt by the young people to be a good deal out of place if mr erin could have been induced to visit the lodgings of mr philips by himself or to meditate on the future alone and in the maze then indeed they would have applauded him but as it was his company was a trifle triste illustration vauxhall gardens they were presently relieved from it however in a wholly unexpected manner they had explored the walks promenaded the area and listened to the band to their hearts content and had just sat down in one of the arbours to a modest supper when who should pass by with his hat on one side and an air of studied indifference to the commonplace allurements around him but mr reginald talbot his few weeks residence in london had effected a revolution in him which nevertheless could scarcely be called a reform from an inhabitant of connemara or some other outoftheway spot he had become a citizen of the world but the dissipations of the town had not improved his appearance his face though still full had lost its colour and he had a lacklustre look which so ably seconded his attempts at languor that it almost rendered him idiotic william henry drew involuntarily back in the box to avoid recognition but mr talbots eye roving everywhere though with a somewhat fishlike expression in search of female beauty had already been attracted by margarets pretty face he did not quite recognise it probably owing to the doubtful aid he derived from his spyglass but it was evident that he was struggling with a reminiscence why surely that is our young friend talbot is it not samuel exclaimed mr erin with effusion and he held out his hand to the young man at once not because he was glad to see him far from it but because he thought he was making a friend of his son welcome william henry however was well convinced that talbot was no longer his friend a circumstance that had not hitherto distressed him indeed he had by no means regretted their little tiff since it had been the means of keeping talbot away from norfolk street but now that they had met again he had reasons for wishing that they had not quarrelled the very cordiality with which the other addressed him aroused his apprehensions for he knew that it was feigned he would much rather indeed have seen him as on the occasion when he had last met her make advances to margaret herself of her he was sure no dandy whether metropolitan or provincial could he knew ever rival him in her affections but this fellow smarting from the slight that had been put upon his muse might injure him in other ways he knew from experience mr reginald talbot was capable of being what at school was termed nasty ie malignant it has been said of the great marlborough that whenever he permitted himself a noble phrase it was a sure sign that he was about to commit a baseness and similarly the fact of mr talbots being upon his best behaviour was a symptom dangerous to his friends on the present occasion he was studiously genteel his manner to margaretvery different from that he generally adopted towards the fair sexwas distantly polite while to mr samuel erin he was respectful to servility what especially marked the abnormal condition of his mind and showed his feelings to be under severe restraint was that he never alluded to his own poetical genius in speaking to william henry the subject might well indeed have been avoided as a painful one but that he should exercise this reticence with respect to the antiquaryto whom on a previous occasion it will be remembered he had mentioned within the first five minutes that he was a man of letterswas something portentous he did not indeed talk much but he did what was a thousand times more difficult to himhe held his tongue and listened this circumstance joined to his demure behaviour caused mr samuel erin to take a much more favourable view of his sons friend than that he had originally entertained and finding him deeply interested in the country of his birth and in its early history related to him at considerable length the story of the disruption of the knight templars and the escape of the survivors to ireland of which he happened to have an account in black letter which he hoped as he said at no distant date to have the pleasure of showing mr talbot under his own roof this naturally led on to some conversation respecting the labours of mr erin in the shakespearean field concerning which the young man paid him several compliments wherein what was wanted in appropriateness for the young gentleman laboured under the disadvantage of knowing nothing whatever of the subject was more than compensated for by their impassioned warmth then by an easy gradation they fell to talking on the newfound manuscripts it amazed mr erin to find that talbot had not yet seen the profession of faith i have been out of town sir he replied for falsehood to this son of erin was as natural as mothers milk and laid on like water on the perpetual supply system and have not had the opportunity of seeing it though as you may well imagine i have heard of little else and that reminds me that i have a favour to ask of you there is an old friend of mine or rather of my late fathers mr albany wallis mr erin frowned i have heard of the gentleman he put in stiffly and in a sense i know him i trust you know nothing to his disadvantage sir said talbot with humility i can only say that he has always spoken to me of yourself and of your extraordinary erudition and attainments with the greatest regard and consideration indeed returned the other still drily but with some relaxation of stiffness in his tone i am only acquainted with mr wallis myself by hearsay and judging him by the company he keepsfor he is known to be a friend of one malone of whom in christian charity i will say no more than that he is a fellow whose shallow pretence and pompous ignorance would disgrace the name of charlatani have certainly hitherto had but a bad opinion of him of that sir he is aware said talbot and it troubles him just now exceedingly the sense of your illwill has prevented him although a near neighbour from calling in norfolk street and knowing that i was a friend of your sons he has earnestly entreated me in case i had the opportunity to beg permission for him to pay you a visit from twelve to one sir the shakespearean manuscripts are open to the inspection of all comers said mr erin with a grand air we invite investigation and even criticism any time of course you choose to appoint will suit my friend said talbot but as he led me to understand he has a matter of importance connected with the manuscripts to communicate to you and somewhat of a private nature then let him come tomorrow evening when we shall be alone perhaps he would like to see william henry i think he would sir returned talbot and as he spoke he put his hand up to his mouth to conceal a demoniacal grin such as one sees on a gargoyle carved by the piety of some monkish architect ill bring him tomorrow during all this time william henry and margaret in the opposite corner of the arbour had carried on a smothered conversation with one another on quite a different subject or rather as the manner of young people is under similar circumstances on no subject at all it was enough to them that their hands met under the table and their hearts met under the rose the scene they looked upon was not more bright than their hopes nor the music they listened to more in tune than their tender fancies when mr erin pulled out his watch and pronounced it time to set out for home it seemed to them that they had only just arrived as for mr reginald talbot for the last hour or so they had been totally unconscious of his presence but when he took his leave of them which he did with much politeness there was something of suppressed triumph in his voice that aroused william henrys suspicions a shudder involuntarily seized him he felt like a merrymaker at a festival who suddenly looks up into the sky and perceives instead of sunshine the ragged rims of thunder brooding low chapter xvi a bombshell it was significant of the sensitiveness of mr erins feelings in regard to his newfound treasures though it by no means indicated any want of soundness in his faith that he ignored as much as possible all attacks upon their authenticity this by no means involved his shutting his eyes to them indeed he had privately procured and read all that had been written about the mss even to that terrible letter of lord charlemont to malone in which he had said i am only sorry that steevens the rival commentator is not the proprietor of them in order as he meant that they might have had the additional pleasure derived from private enmity of exposing them the sensations the antiquary endured from these things were something like those of regulus rolling down a hill in his barrel stuck full of nails and knives but he could not resist the temptation of reading them any more than a patient with hayfever in his eyes can resist rubbing them i have known young authors afflicted with the same mad desire of perusing all the disagreeable criticisms they can lay their hands on but these things were much more than criticisms they were personal imputations of the vilest kind which at the same time no law of libel could touch they ate into the poor antiquarys heart but he never talked about them if he had perhaps they would have been made more tolerable by the sympathy of his friends and the arguments of his partisans but except to himself he ignored them he did not even mention to william henry that one mr albany wallis whom he had reason to believe was little better than an infidel was coming to norfolk street by permission to examine the shakespeare papers it weighed upon his own mind nevertheless and he actually regretted that frank dennis chanced to drop in that afternoonloyal though he knew him to be in all other matterslest in his lukewarm faith if faith it could be called at all he should let fall anything to encourage the sceptic thus it came to pass that when the servant announced mr reginald talbot and mr albany wallis it was only mr erin himself who felt no astonishment william henry was amazed for though he had parted from his quondam friend on the previous evening on what were outwardly good terms there had been no pretence of a renewal of friendship between them their meeting at vauxhall had as we know been accidental and talbot had not dropped a hint of renewing his visits to norfolk street the young man had a smiling but scarcely a genial air his manner was constrained a thing which being contrary to his habit sat very ill upon him and he addressed himself solely to his host for which indeed his errand was a sufficient excuse permit me sir to introduce to you my friend mr albany wallis a gentleman like yourself well versed in shakespearean lore mr walliss name is not unknown to me answered the antiquary coldly i have the pleasure of speaking to the late mr garricks man of business have i not the visitor a thin grey man with sharp intelligent features by no means devoid of kindliness bowed courteously i had that honour he replied gravely i have also been acquainted all my life with many who take an interest in the drama especially the shakespearean drama that some of them differ from you mr erin on the subject on which i have called today i am of course aware but believe me i come in no unfriendly spirit i take it for granted that you and i are equally interested in the establishment of the truth it is to be hoped so returned the antiquary with dignity you would like i conclude to see the profession well no sir not immediately you have other documents as i am informed in one of which i am more particularly concerned very good margaret this is your affair it seems said the antiquary smiling it was a relief to his mind that the profession at least was not about to be impugned here is the key of the chest bring out the shakespeare letter and verses with the lock of hair for a moment or two mr wallis remained silent his eyes followed margaret as she rose to obey her uncles request with a curious look of gentle commiseration in them i did not know that this young lady had anything to do with these discoveries he answered nor has she sir the hair and the verses have become in a manner her own property that iserunder my trusteeship but they were disinterred from a mass of ancient materials by my son here william henry mr wallis turned his face on the young gentleman thus alluded to much as a policeman flashes his darklantern on a suspected stranger there was no commiseration in it now it was a keen and even a hostile glance i see but besides the reputed epistle to anne hathaway there was i think a note of hand purporting to be written to shakespeare from john hemynge i dont know as to reputed and purporting sir returned the antiquary stiffly which are adjectives not usually applied to documents professedly genuine at all events under the roof of their possessor you are right i beg your pardon mr erin put in the visitor apologetically one has no right to prejudge a case of which one has only heard an exparte statement it is however that particular document which i ask to look at a gentleman upon whose word i can rely has seen it and assures me that the signature of john hemynge appended to the receipt isnot to mince mattersa forgery the antiquary started to his feet do you come here to insult me sir he inquired angrily no mr erin far from it returned the other firmly no one would be better pleased both on your own account and on that of those belonging to youhere his eye lit once more on margaret who had flushed to her foreheadif i should find my informant mistaken but the fact is i possess a deed with the authentic and undoubted signature of john hemynge which my friend who has seen both of them assures me is wholly different from that attached to this newfound document assertion however as you may reasonably reply is out of place in this matter the question is merely one of comparison have you any objection to my applying that test most certainly not sir margaret this gentleman wishes to see the note of hand margaret brought it from the iron safe and gave it to mr wallis her face still retained some trace of indignation and her eyes met those of the visitor with resolution and even defiance if there is fraud here he said to himself this girl has nothing to do with it the behaviour of mr erin had also impressed him favourably with that of william henry he was not so satisfied it seemed to him to have too much sangfroid but then as he frankly confessed to himself he had been prejudiced against him mr wallis was a man accustomed to thread the labyrinth of the mind in matters more important or at all events more serious than literary investigation and had a very observant eye and the conclusion he came to was that if there was one person in the present company more guilty than another as regards the shakespearean fabrications as malone had called them it was mr frank dennis he had not indeed uttered one word but when the girl had approached the safe there had been unmistakable signs of trouble in his face while at this moment when as he mr wallis knew and as the other must needs suspect a damning proof of the worthlessness of one of these vaunted discoveries was about to be produced he exhibited an anxiety and apprehension which to do them justice were absent from the rest this is a mortgage deed executed by john hemynge observed mr wallis drawing a document from his pocket concerning the genuineness of which there is no dispute it was found among the papers of the featherstonehaugh family to whom the nation is indebted through my late client david garrick for the shakespeare mortgage now in the british museum if the signature of yonder deed tallies with it well and good i shall believe me be pleased to find it so but if it does not do so there can be no question as to which is the spurious one he threw the mortgage on the table and stood with an air if not of indifference of one who has no personal concern in the matter on hand while mr erin compared the two signatures with minuteness presently he beckoned to his son in an agitated manner your eyes are better than mine he said what do you make of this william henry just glanced at the two documents in a perfunctory manner as though he had been asked to witness some signature of a client of his employer and quietly answered they are very dissimilar whichever is the wrong one it can hardly be called an imitation for it has not a letter in common with the other there is no question young man as to which is the wrong one remarked mr wallis severely and as to imitation it is clear enough that such a deception however clumsily has been seriously attempted the only doubt we have to clear up is who is the forger mr walliss glance flashed for an instant upon frank dennis he was standing apart with his hand over the lower part of his features and his eyes fixed on the ground he looked like one upon whom a blow long expected has at last fallen it was strange thought mr wallis that talbot who had seemed so convinced of the younger erins guilt had had not a word to say about this other fellow his own impressionone of those sudden convictions to which men of his stamp are especially liable but which they would be the last to call inspirationswas that the affair was a conspiracy in which these two young men were alone concerned and that its moving spirit was dennis suddenly the silence was broken by margarets clear tones mr wallis himself has not examined the deeds she said there is no need young lady since your uncle and cousin have already admitted the discrepancy returned the visitor i am only following the example of that gentleman yonderhere he indicated frank dennis with his forefingerin taking the matter for granted frank removed his hand from his mouth showing a face ghastly pale and quietly answered i am no judge of these things but if i had made such a charge as you have done sir i think as miss slade suggests that i should give myself the trouble of seeing with my own eyes whether it was substantiated nay said margaret quickly i spoke not of any charge if i thought that mr wallis was making any personal accusation i should not have addressed him at all but really young lady protested mr wallis there must be something wrong somewhere you know i should rather think there was observed mr reginald talbot with a snigger and who the devil asked your opinion inquired mr erin with the eager shrillness of a steam boiler which has just discovered its safetyvalve he did not forget that it was to this young gentlemans good offices that he was indebted for this unsatisfactory state of things well i thought it was a matter of criticism murmured the young irishman that was the very reason sir you should have held your tongue was the uncompromising reply i really dont know observed william henry who had been idly turning over the leaves of the mortgage deed during this discussion why any bitterness should be imported into this discussion we are all equally interested as mr wallis has remarked in the establishment of the truth and i for my part have nothing to fear from it i am in no way responsible as he must be aware for the genuineness of the documents in question but only for their discovery what has happened today is no doubt as disagreeable as it is unlooked for but it is no fault of mine the only course open to me is i suppose to go to my friend in the temple and acquaint him with what has happened perhaps he may have some explanation to offer upon the subject i should very much like to hear it said mr wallis with a dry smile mr reginald talbot also began to smilealoud but he caught mr frank denniss eye which had so unmistakably menacing an expression in it that the snigger perished in its birth shall i go father inquired william henry for the antiquary sat like one in a dream turning over the note of hand once so precious to him but which had now become waste paper yes go we will wait here till you come back he answered the words dropped from his lips like lead chapter xvii the mares nest a great poet has sung of a certain teaparty as sitting all silent and all damned which is going pretty far as a description of social cheerlessness but they were at tea and had presumably bread and butter and possibly even muffins before them whereas the little party in norfolk street who sat awaiting the return of william henry from his problematical patron for mr albany wallis for one did not believe in his existence had not even such material comforts to mitigate their embarrassment and ennui on the table there were only the two deeds and one of them was in all probability a forgery mr erin sat drumming his fingers upon it and endeavouring to hide the anxiety which consumed hima most depressing spectacle the company too were on anything but good terms with one another or with themselves mr albany wallis was a just but kindhearted man he knew he was right but he was equally certain that he was uncomfortable margarets beauty had touched him and her indignation however undeserved distressed him he felt convinced that she at least was innocent of any confederation with the evildoers whoever they were now that he had once put hand to the plough there was no possibility of drawing back he must needs lay the whole conspiracy bare but in his heart he cursed the officious malignity of reginald talbot who had set him to work on so unpleasant a task it was plain that that young gentleman knew how it was all to end he lay back in his chair tapping his boot with his cane and with a grin on his face such as a cheshire cat might wear who feels a mouse well under her claw to mr wallis it seemed equally clear that mr frank dennis also knew he sat very pale and quiet but with a face expectant of ill every now and then he stole a glance at margaret full of ineffable shame and sorrow as for her she looked neither to the right nor to the left but always at the door her ears were on the stretch for william henrys return from the moment that his departing footstep died away in her face alone was to be seen unshaken confidence a womans faithso often wasted as mr wallis thought to himself upon false and worthless objects presently mr erin glanced at her and seeming to gather comfort from her calmness observed i am sorry to detain you mr wallis but i think it better for both our sakes that you should remain here till this matter has one way or another been settled it will convince you at all events that there is no collusion a very proper arrangement sir and one that does you infinite credit returned the other courteously one word from your sons friendthat is if as i believe he must needs give up his casewill be all that is necessary so that we shall not have to wait long the gentleman may not be at home suggested margaret true answered mr wallis with a bow in his heart he thought that the gentleman was not at all likely to be at home but there was nothing in his tone that implied it perhaps said mr erin in order to pass the time you would like to examine the other shakespearean documents in my possession there was a world of significance had the other only known it in the manner in which the antiquary thus expressed himself the idea of looking at these treasures in order to pass the time would an hour ago have seemed to him little short of blasphemy as you please sir returned mr wallis indifferently though you will pardon me for saying that if the note of hand turns out to beathat is unauthentic it will destroy the credibility of all the rest it will affect it no doubt admitted the antiquary on the other hand observed margaret in her clear tones if the evidence should be the other way it will proportionately strengthen their claims illustration a very cheerless proceeding undoubtedly replied mr wallis he could offer that modicum of encouragement with perfect safety and he was well pleased to have the opportunity of doing so believe me young lady he went on with earnest gentleness that it would give me the sincerest gratification to find your confidence justified by the result then he sat down indifferenteyed but with a pretence of interest to the profession that mr erin had spread out upon the table it was a cheerless proceeding the very exhibitor himself it was plain had but little heart for the performance instead of expatiating with an unction that might well have been called extreme on the precious revelation he only put in a word or two if he had apprehensions such as he had never before experienced of a visitors criticism they were however unfounded mr wallis perhaps did not think it worth while to make objections since a few more minutes at most must needs see the imposture out it would have been like quarrelling with a man upon his deathbed he even allowed that the document was interesting though as he made the observation to margaret and not to her uncle it is probable that it rather expressed his wish to please her than his real sentiments his position was somewhat similar to that of eloise when taking the veil yet then to those dread altars as i drew not on the cross my eyes were fixed but you not grace nor zeal love only was my call for though of course the old lawyer was not in love with margaret he had a much greater admiration for her than for the sacred relic still in spite of himself habit induced him to give some considerable attention to the document even if it was a forgery it was curious and at all events anything was better than sitting with his hands before him watching those uncomfortable faces that of mr samuel erin was at present particularly so for his visitors eye was travelling towards the leaffee tree a weak point which he felt under the circumstances in a very ill condition to defend when suddenly there was a knock at the door there is willie cried margaret starting to her feet she felt assured since so short a time had elapsed that he had found his friend of the temple at home but what was the news he had brought with him one glance at the young fellow as he entered the room was sufficient for her it was good news the eye of love is an auger that can pierce the heart if not the soul but to the other members of the party william henrys face told nothing it did not indeed wear the expression of defeat but still less did it exhibit triumph or exultation it had the same quiet almost indifferent air that it habitually wore when the shakespearean discoveries were under discussion but the pallor which anxiety had caused in it when he left the house upon his apparently hopeless errand was gone with a quiet smile he drew forth a paper from his pocket and handed it to mr wallis you are quite right sir he said and yet you have not put my friend in the wrong it is the case of the chameleon what is this asked mr wallis a question which having unfolded the paper he proceeded to answer himself in tones of the greatest amazement why this is john hemynge over againthe real john hemynge and yet i suppose not more real than the other said william henry quietly the simple explanation is that there were two of them two of them exclaimed mr erin looking much like the gay french mousquetaire only not gay when he saw the ghost of his victim on one side of his bed and her twin sister in the flesh on the other this paper i see is an account of some theatrical disbursements observed mr wallis biting his lips in much perplexity that reminds me that the note of hand was upon a similar subject you dont mean to tell me that these hemynges were not only both of the same name but of the same callingactors i tell you nothing sir of my own knowledge answered william henry drily for i know nothing about the matter i went to my patron with the story you bade me tell him that you possessed an authentic signature of shakespeares friend hemynge that it was altogether different from the one appended to the note of hand i had found in his keeping and that therefore the latter was a forgery he only smiled and said how very like a commentator then he opened a little chest filled with theatrical memoranda there is nothing here of much value he said for i have examined them but as it happens there is something to put the gentlemans mind at rest as to any question of fraud then he gave me this paper the signature of which he bade me to ask you to compare with that on your mortgage deed it is identical is it not it certainly appears to be so admitted mr wallis well according to my patrons account there were in shakespeares time two john hemynges the oneyour john hemyngeconnected with shakespeares own theatre the globe the other whose receipt is appended to the note of hand the manager of the curtain theatre the former it seems was called the tall john hemynge the latter the short if you care to know more about them i am instructed to say that my friend is prepared to give you every information as his eye fell upon the lawyers chapfallen face william henry could not deny himself a smile of triumph but as regarded his uncle and margaret mr wallis observed that the young fellow did not so much as even glance at thema circumstance which the lawyer attributed to a very natural cause it was not they but he who had doubted of his good faith so that in their case he had nothing to exult over he felt very much abashed and disconcerted nor was his embarrassment decreased when margaret thus addressed him you will not forget mr wallis she said gravely what was said just now of the change which would take place in your opinion of us in case this matter should not turn out so unfavourably as you expected nay pardon me young lady returned the lawyer gallantly i have never harboured any opinion of you otherwise than favourable my observation referred to these other documents which indeed i frankly confess i am now prepared to consider in a much less prejudiced light for the present i must take my leave but in the meantime let me express my thanks to you mr erin for the kind reception i have met with and to withdraw without reserve any expression i may have let fall which may be construed into a reflection upon your good faith or upon that of any member of your family for a moment it occurred to mr erin that here was an opportunity for snatching an ally from the enemys camp by getting mr albany wallis to add his name to the list of believers but on the whole he decided not to do so upon the ground of the danger of the experiment if miss margaret slade however had asked mr wallis the favour it is doubtful whether he would not have acceded to her request he felt such a brute at having given her distress of mind by his unmannerly suspicions that he would have made almost any sacrifice in reparation of them he retired with a profusion of bows and excuses while mr reginald talbot followed in silence at his heels like a whipped dog who professing to find a hare in her form has only found a mares nest chapter xviii whatever happens i shall love you willie it was not till his visitors had gone that their host seemed to become fully conscious of the gravity of their errand while the mind is clouded with doubt it is impossible for it to entertain any emotion very acutely but now that the accusation of the literary lawyer had been shown to be groundless mr erin became at once alive to its great wickedness and impertinence the man must have been madstark staring mad he exclaimed to have come here and upon the ground of that trumpery deed of his to have made such abominable imputations i know that malone is burning to see my manuscripts though he has not the honesty to confess it and i should not wonder if he had sent that fellow here as a spy nay i am sure mr wallis was no spy said margaret well at all events instead of reporting all is barren as was hoped continued the antiquary he will have to speak of milk and honey upon my life i believe i could have got him to sign our profession of faith if i had only pressed it for by nature however warped by evil communications he struck me as an honest man not only honest but kind uncle observed margaret gently he was very civil to you i noticed returned her uncle grimly i am sure you could have got him to sign what a thorn it would have been in that scoundrels side if one of his lieutenants could have been seduced so far from his allegiance when mr erin said that scoundrel he always meant malone it was not necessary for himas in the case of the gentleman who had married three times and was wont to observe when i say my wife i mean my first wifeto explain whom he meant i dont blame mr wallis at all said margaret he came upon a disagreeable errand in the interests of truth and has frankly acknowledged himself to be in the wrong the person i do feel indignant against is that horrid mr talbot the man of letters as he called himself remarked mr erin contemptuously he never even asked to look at the manuscripts i dont believe he can read what do you think of your young friend now he inquired turning to william henry well sir i think he has made a fool of himself and knows it you are much too goodnatured willie observed margaret indignantly i am sure frank you agree with me that mr talbots conduct has been most treacherous and malignant dennis had not opened his lips since william henrys return he had watched for it with at least as much anxiety as the rest but the refutation of what had been alleged seemed to have given him rather relief than satisfaction he was too good a fellow to wish any disgrace to happen even to a rival but as margaret read his behaviour he could hardly exult in that rivals victory which could but result in mr erins having greater confidence in the young fellow than ever and consequently in the bettering of his chance of gaining his cousins hand yes said dennis quietly william henry has made the great mistake of allowing an irishman of low type to be on familiar terms with him the men of that nation when they are of sterling nature are among the best as they are undoubtedly among the most agreeable men in the world but there are a great many counterfeitsmen who like talbot under the mask of bonhomie conceal a morose and malignant disposition they belong in fact to the same class of their fellowcountrymen who shoot men from behind a hedge quite true observed mr erin approvingly i have never heard that type of manto which malone for one belongsso graphically described i do hope willie you will have nothing more to do with him said margaret earnestly you may depend upon it he will have nothing more to do with me answered the young fellow laughing he already knows what i thought of his verses indeed it was my telling him my honest opinion of them which has so set him against me and now he knows what i think of himself well said my lad said the antiquary rubbing his hands and smiling with the consciousness of triumph one need not fear any malice when we are conscious of no illdoing on our own part my good dennis you look so exceedingly glum that if one didnt know you one would think that you had not that cause for confidence as regards what we were just talking of that irish gentleman observed dennis sententiously i have no confidence in him at all there is always reason to fear a man who carries a knife under his waistcoat pooh pooh dennis you take such sombre views of everything at all events put in margaret gently frank is not alarmed upon his own account gad thats true observed the antiquary drily he takes care to let us know that these matters are no concern of his if all these wonderful discoveries that have been vouchsafed to us these last few months should turn out to be so much waste paper i dont think he would sleep a wink the worse for it dennis coloured to his temples but said nothing perhaps he was conscious of shortcoming in shakespearean enthusiasm or was aware that he had not shown much exultation over the recent rout of the enemy margaret thought he might have said a word or two in selfdefence but what she deemed to be the cause of his silencenamely that the whole subject of the discoveries was distasteful to him as being associated as it certainly was with william henrys success in another matterwas also an excuse for him and she pitied him with all her heart to have defended him in his presence to mr erin would she felt have been a cruel kindness since it might have suggested a feeling more tender than pity but a certain remorseit was almost an act of penancecompelled her to speak of the matter afterwards to william henry my uncle is very hard upon poor frank she said about these manuscripts i am sure that anything that concerns us concerns him but he cannot be expected to feel exactly as we do in the matter no i suppose not said william henry well of course not it is his way to take things more philosophically than other people i am sure he looked pleased enough when you confuted mr wallis pleased but surprised returned the other drily oh willie that is ungenerous of you i am only stating a fact his face did not i admit exhibit disappointment but it expressed extreme astonishment i dont think as mr erin does about these things but i think a man should stick to his friends especially in the presence of those by whom their honesty is called in question mr wallis noticed it i promise you there was surely no harm in frank looking astonished even if he did said margaret then in a more tender tone as though she had done enough for friendship she added i confess however i was not looking at him i was looking at you willie how marvellously you kept command of yourself even when things seemed to be at the worst now confess dear did you not really know that you would find that document or something like it when you went off to the temple what makes you say that he inquired quickly well only because i seemed to read it in your face oh willie you dont know what i went through while you were away for though as you often say it is no affair of yours whether the manuscripts are genuine or not yet she hesitated she evidently found it difficult to put her thought into words you mean that the question is one that after all seriously affects us he put in gently well yes because you and i are one perhaps it was the presence of that scheming mr talbot which made you look so but the matter seemed somehow to affect you personally your own honour appeared to be almost called in question he shook his head but she went on and that is why your parting look though you didnt look at me willie gave me courage to face them i felt that you would come back to clear yourself and to triumph over them of course i did not know how it would be effected but i had faithor perhaps added the girl dropping her voice it was love yes it was love said the young man fondling her hand in his own and speaking in the same low tones while he gazed thoughtfully before him love is better than faith for it endures what we no longer believe in we despise but what we have once loved we love always there was silence between them for a littlethe lovers silence which is more golden far than that of which philosophy speaks then he addressed her with a lighter air and were you really pleased he said when i brought the deed back and made that old curmudgeon look so foolish nay he was no curmudgeon willie and i felt as much for him as i could afford to feel but your bringing such good news was delightful it showed that what others prize so highly such as this man hemynges signature was for you quite a commonplace possession it almost seemed that you have only to hold up your finger and beckon to her as it were and good luck comes to you then the good luck i have had and the estimation in which it has caused me to be held by others makes you happy margaret of course it makes me proud and pleased she answered earnestly how can it be otherwise when you are the talk of the town but what gives me the greatest pleasure of all is to see that it has not spoilt you willie that you take it all so quietly and prudently which shows that you deserve these gifts of fortune she has more in store for me yet he answered confidently i feel iti am sure of it maggie but my dear willie are you not talked about enough already and you but a lad of seventeen you must be a glutton a very glutton for fame i am he answered vehemently for fame but not for notoriety only i wish to be thought well of on my own accountnot as the mere channel of anothers thoughts i have stuff within me which the world shall sooner or later recognisei swear it margaret looked at him with amazement she had hitherto had no great opinion of his talents as we know but now either his enthusiasm carried her away with it or what was more probable the atmosphere of love which surrounded him made him appear larger than of old in her minds eye she already beheld him a second dryden that monarch of letters of whom she had so often heard her uncle speak but you will always be the same to me willie she murmured timidly her humility perhaps touched him for at her words he became strangely agitated and his face grew pale to the very lips nay he said i must ask that of you whatever happens will you never cease to love me whatever happens willie she answered softly i shall love you more and more end of the first volume london printed by spottiswoode and co newstreet square and parliament street one of the pleasantest books that has appeared for some time pall mall gazette third edition with a portrait crown vo s some literary recollections by james payn author of by proxy c some extracts from notices by the press the athenumto say that mr payn is seen at his best in the book is as much as to say that it is remarkably pleasant reading the stories it contains are not all new but old and new the stories are well told and then the spirit of the book is eminently generous and gay in brief his book is one of those which like that of maxim du camp if for somewhat different reasons leave a good taste in the mouth for that reason if for no other it should have readers in abundance the saturday reviewin a season of biographies and reminiscences mr payns recollections have several peculiarities of their own first they are shortwe wish they were longer again mr payns memories are all good natured thirdly mr payns memories have nothing to do with politics mr payns recollections are quite full of anecdotes of authors editors publishers yea even of publishers readers and are everywhere buoyant and attractive with humour and good humour the timesmr james payns reminiscences do not constitute anything like a regular autobiography but may be described as a number of very amusing and goodnatured anecdotes and sketches of literary people connected by their reference to his own life but hardly pretending to form a whole of any kind though its form may be called irregular it is really the most convenient that could have been chosen the daily newsno one who takes up this book of mr payns and who has not previously read the substance of it in the cornhill magazine will be inclined to put it down until he has finished it the ignorant person may read it without being made to feel ashamed and the most painfully tender susceptibilities will not be unduly harassed but it is a prevalent and perhaps a wellfounded notion that the number of people who desire to be amused is increasing yet daily to them we can cordially recommend some literary recollections the standardthis is a very pleasant volume of gossipy talk of the literary celebrities with whom mr payn has in the course of a long career as author and editor come in contact and the only fault there is to found with it is its brevity few readers will lay down the volume without a feeling of regret that its author has kept it within such comparatively narrow dimensions the graphicthere is not a dull page in the book anecdotes jests epigrams and odd bits of character and personal experience abound it is safe to predict for these entertaining pages one of the successes of the publishing season which has just opened the worldone would have to be in a very melancholy mood indeed not to like these recollections so full they are of good stories good spirits and good sense and even in such a mood it could not be but cheering and refreshing to read with what generous admiration mr payn speaks of his great contemporaries dickens thackeray trollope and the rest vanity fairmr payn has been steadily writing for more than thirty years but his later work is fresher and more full of fun and elasticity than that which he did in his youth the book is a most wise and charming one not a page is without a good story or a piece of delightfully funny writing then the kindness and tenderness of every chapter puts the reader in good humour mr payn is a man of the world but he has never become cynical and to read his graceful memories gives all the effect of a chat with a
