concerning the nature of the leopard i like this good mans account of leopards and find it more pertinent to my matter than you might think milo was a carthusian monk abbot of the cloister of saint maryofthepine by poictiers it was his distinction to be the lifelong friend of a man whose friendships were few certainly it may be said of him that he knew as much of leopards as any one of his time and nation and that his knowledge was better grounded your leopard he writes is alleged in the books to be offspring of the lioness and the pard and his name if the realists have any truth on their side establishes the fact but i think he should be called leolupe which is to say got by lion out of bitchwolf since two essences burn in him as well as two sorts this is the nature of the leopard it is a spotted beast having two souls a bright soul and a dark soul it is black and golden slim and strong cat and dog hunger drives a dog to hunt so the leopard passion the cat so the leopard a cat is sufficient unto himself and a leopard is so but a dog hangs on a mans nod and a leopard can so be beguiled a leopard is sleek as a cat and pleased by stroking like a cat he will scratch his friend on occasion yet again he has a dogs intrepidity knows no fear is singlepurposed not to be called off longanimous but the cat in him makes him wary tempts him to treacherous dealing keeps him apart from counsels advises him to keep his own so the leopard is a lonely beast this is interesting and may be true but mark him as he goes on i knew the man my dear master and a great king who brought the leopards into the shield of england more proper to do it than his father being more the thing he signified of him therefore torn by two natures cast in two moulds sport of two fates the hymned and reviled the loved and loathed spendthrift and a miser king and a beggar the bond and the free god and man of king richard yeaandnay so made so called and by that unmade i thus prepare my account so far the abbot with much learning and no little verbosity casts his net he has the weakness of his age you observe and must begin at the beginning but this is not our custom something of time is behind us we are conscious of a world replete and may assume that we have digested part of it milo indeed like all candid chroniclers has his value he is excellent upon himself a good relish with your meal however as we are concerned with king richard you shall dip into his bag for refreshment but must leave the victualling to me chapter i of count richard and the fires by night i choose to record how richard count of poictou rode all through one smouldering night to see jehane saintpol a last time it had so been named by the lady but he rode in his hottest mood of nay to that yet careless of first or last so he could see her again nominally to remit his masters sins though actually as he thought to pay for his own the abbot milo bore him company if company you can call it which left the good man in pitchy dark some hundred yards behind the way which was long led over saint andrews plain the bleakest stretch of the norman march the pace being richards was furious a pounding gallop the prize richards again showed fitfully and afar a twinkling point of light count richard knew it for jehanes torch and saw no other spark but milo faintly curious on the ladys account was more concerned with the throbbing glow which now and again shuddered in the northern sky nature had no lamps that night and made no sign by cry of nightbird or rustle of scared beast there was no wind no rain no dew she offered nothing but heat dark and dense oppression topping the ridge of sand where was the fosse des noyees place of shameful death the solitary torch showed a steady beam and there also ahead could be seen on the northern horizon that rim of throbbing light god pity the poor said count richard and scourged forward god pity me said gasping milo i believe my stomach is in my head so at last they crossed the pebbly ford and found the pines then cantered up the path of light which streamed from the dark tower as core of this they saw the lady stand with a torch above her head when they drew rein she did not move her face moonshaped was as pale as a moon her loose hair catching light framed it with gold she was all white against the dark seemed to loom in it taller than she was or could have been she was jehane saintpol jehane of the fair girdle so called by her lovers and friends to whom for a matter of two years this hotcoloured tallest and coldest of the angevins had been light of the world the check upon their greeting was the most curious part of a curious business that one should have travelled and the other watched so long and neither urge the end of desire the count sat still upon his horse so for dutys sake did the aching abbot the girl stood still in the entryway holding up her dripping torch then child child cried the count how is it with thee his voice trembled and so did he she looked at him slow to answer though the hand upon her bosom swayed up and down do you see the fires she said they have been there six nights he was watching them then through the pinewoods how they shot into the sky great ribbons of light flickered fainted out again glowed steadily as if gathering volume again leaped again died ebbing and flowing like a tide of fire the king will be at louviers said richard he gave a short laugh well he shall light us to bed heart of a man i am sick of all this let me in she stood aside and he rode boldly into the tower stooping as he passed her to touch her cheek she looked up quickly then let in the abbot who with much ceremony came bowing his horse led by the bridle she shut the door behind them and drove home the great bolts servants came tumbling out to take the horses and do their duty count eustace a brother of jehanes got up from the hearth where he had been asleep on a bearskin rubbed his eyes gulped a yawn knelt and was kissed by richard jehane stood apart mistress of herself as it seemed but conscious perhaps that she was being watched so she was in the bustle of salutation the abbot milo found eyes to see what manner of sulky beautiful girl this was he watched shrewdly and has described her for us with the meticulous particularity of his time and temper he runs over her parts like a virtuoso the iris of her eyes for instance was wet grey but ringed with black and shot with yellow giving so the effect of hot green her mouth was of an extraordinary dark red colour very firm in texture closegrained like the darker sort of strawberries says he the upper lip had the sulky curve she looked discontented and had reason to be under such a scrutiny of the microscope her hair was colour of raw silk eyebrows set rather high face a thinnish oval complexion like a pink roses neck thinnish again feet hands long and nervous good working members etc etc none of this helps very much too detailed but he noticed how tall she was and how slim save for a very beautiful bosom too full for dians he tells us whom else she resembled how she was straight as a birchtree how in walking it seemed as if her skirts clung about her knees there was an air of mingled surprise and defiance about her she was a silent girl fronted like juno he appears to cry shaped like hebe and like demeter in stature sullen with most but with one most sweetly apt she looked watchful but was really timid looked cold but was secretly afire i knew soon enough how her case stood how hope and doubt strove in her and choked her to silence i guessed how within those reticent members swift love ran like wine but because of this proud brave mask of hers i was slow to understand her worth god help me i thought her a thing of snow he records her dress at this time remarkable if becoming it was all white and cut wedgeshaped in front very deep but an undervest of crimson crossed the v in the midst and saved her modesty and his her hair which was long was plaited in two plaits with seedpearls brought round her neck like a scarf and the two ends joined between her breasts thus defining a great beauty of hers and making a gold collar to her gown round her smooth throat was a little chain with a red jewel on her head another jewel a carbuncle set in a flower with three herons plumes falling back from it she had a broad belt of gold and sapphire stones and slippers of vair oh a fine straight maid says milo in conclusion golden and delicate with strangely shaded eyes they knew her as jehane of the fair girdle the brother count eustace as they called him to distinguish him from an elder brother eudo count of saintpol was a blunt copy of his sister redder than she was lighter in the hair much lighter in the eyes he seemed an affectionate youth and clung to the great count richard like ivy to a tree richard gave him the sort of scornful affection one has for a little dog between patting and slapping but clearly wanted to be rid of him no reference was made to the journey much was taken for granted eustace talked of his hawks richard ate and drank jehane sat up stiffly looking into the fire milo watched her between his mouthfuls the moment supper was done up jumps richard and claps hands on the two shoulders of young eustace to bed to bed my falconer it grows late cries he eustace pushed his chair back rose kissed the counts hand and his sisters forehead saluted milo and went out humming a tune milo withdrew the servants bowed themselves away richard stood up a looselimbed young giant and narrowed his eyes nest thee nest thee my bird he said low and jehanes lips parted slowly she left her stool by the fire but quickened as she went and at last ran tumbling into his arms his right hand embraced her his left at her chin held her face at discretion like a woman she reproached him for what she dearly loved lord lord how shall i serve the cup and platter if you hold me so fast thou art my cup thou art my supper thin fare poor soul she said but was glad of his foolishness later they sat by the hearth jehane on richards knee but doubtfully his being troubled by many things he had no retrospects nor afterthoughts he tried to coax her into pliancy it was the fires in the north that distressed her richard made light of them dear he said the king my father is come up with a host to drive the count his son to bed now the count his son is master of a good bed to which he will presently go but it is not the bed of the king his father that as you know is of french make neither good norman nor good angevin nor seethed in the english mists by saint maclou and the astonishing works he did i should be bad norman and worse angevin and less english than i am if i loved the french he tried to draw her in but she rather strained away from him elbowed her knee and rested her chin upon her hand she looked gravely down to the whitening logs where the ashes were gaining on the red my lord loves not the french she said but he loves honour he is the kings son loving his father by my soul i do not he assured her with perfect truth then he caught her round the waist and turned her bodily to face him after he had kissed her well he began to speak more seriously jehane he said i have thought all this stifling night upon the heath homing to her i am seeking my best my best you are all i have in the world if honour is in my hand do i not owe it to you or shall a man use women like dogs to play with them in idle moods toss them bones under the table afterwards kick them out of doors child you know me better what he cried out with his head very high shall a man not choose his own wife no said jehane ready for him no richard unless the people shall choose their own king god chooses the king says richard or so we choose to believe then god must appoint the wife jehane said and tried to get free but this could not be allowed as she knew she was gentle with him reasoning the king your father is an old man richard old men love their way god knows he is old and passionate and indifferent wicked said richard and kissed jehane look my girl there were four of us henry and me and geoffrey and john whom he sought to drive in team by a sop today and a stick tomorrow a good way done by a judging hand what then i will tell you how the team served the teamster henry gave sop for sop and it was found well might he not give stick for stick he thought so god rest him he is dead of that there was much simplicity in henry i got no sop at all why should i have stick then i saw no reason but i took what came if i cried out it is a more harmless vent than many let me alone geoffrey i think was a villain god help him if he can he is dead too he took sop and gave stick ungentle in geoffrey but he paid for it he was a crossbred dog with much of the devil in him he bit himself and died barking last there is john i desire to speak reasonably of john but he is too snug he gets all sop this is not fair he should have some stick that we may judge what mettle he has there my jehane you have the four of us a fretful team whereof one has rushed his hills and broken his heart and one kicking his yokefellows squealing playing the jade has broken his back and one poor richard does collarwork and gets whip and one young master john eases his neck and is cajoled with so then so then boy then comes pretty jehane to the ear of the collarhorse whispering good richard get thee to stall but not here stable thee snug with the king of france his sister hey laughed richard what a word for a chosen bride he pinched her cheek and looked gaily at her triumphant in his own eloquence he was most dangerous when that devil was awake so she dared not look at him back eagerly and low she replied yes richard yes yes my king the king must have the kings sister and jehane go back to the byre eagles do not mate with buzzards hereupon he snatched her up altogether and hid her face in his breast never never never he swore to the rafters as god lives and reigns so live thou and so reign queen of me my picardy rose she tried no more that night fearing that his love so keenedged might make his will ride rough the watchfires at louviers trembled and streamed up in the north there was no need for candles in the dark tower they rose up early to a fair dawn the cloudwrack was blown off leaving the sky a lake of burnt yellow pure sweet and cool thus the world entered upon the summer of saint luke to a newrisen sun to thin mists stealing off the moor to wet flowers hearted anew to blue air and hope left for those who would go gleaning while eustace saintpol was snoring abed and the abbot milo at his sursum corda richard had jehane by the hand come forth my love we have the broad day before us and an empty kingdom to roam in come my red rose let me set you among the flowers what could she do but harbour up her thoughts he took her afield where flowers made the earth still a singingplace and gathered of these to deck her bosom and hair of the harebells he made knots the groundcolour of her eyes but autumn loves the yellow so she was stuck with gold like a princess she sat enthroned by his command this young girl in a high place with downcast eyes and a face all firecolour while he worshipped her to his fancy i believe he had no afterthought but she saw the dun smoke of the fires at louviers and knew they would make the night shudder again yet her sweetness patience staid courtesy humility never failed her out of the deep wells of her soul she drew them forth in a stream richard adored queen jehane queen jehane he cried out with his arms straightly round herwas ever man in the world blest so high since god said behold thy mother and so art thou mother to me o bride bride and queen as thou shalt be this was great invention she put her hand upon his head my richard my richard yeaandnay she said as if pitying his wild heart the nickname jarred never call me that he told her leave that to bertran de born a fools word to the fool who made it if i could if i could thought jehane and sighed there were tears in her eyes also as she remembered what generosity in him must be frozen up and what glory of her own but she did not falter in what she had to do while he too exalted to be pitied began to sing a southern song al entrada del tems clair eya when their hair commingled in their love when they were close together there was little distinguishing between them he was more her pair than eustace her bloodbrother in stature and shape in hue and tincture of gold jehane you know but not richard of him son of a king heir of a king if you wish some bodily sign i will say shortly that he was a very tall young man highcoloured and calm in the face straightnosed blueeyed spare of flesh lithe swift in movement he was at once bold and sleek eager and cold as icean odd combination but not more odd than the blend of norman dog and angevin cat which had made him so furtive he was not yet seeming to crouch for a spring not savage yet primed for savagery not cruel yet quick on the affront and on the watch for it he was neither a rogue nor a madman and yet he was as cunning as the one and as heedless as the other if that is a possible thing he was arrogant but his smile veiled the fault you saw it best in a sleepy look he had his blemishes were many his weaknesses two he trusted to his own force too much and despised everybody else in the world not that he thought them knaves he was certain they were fools and so most of them were no doubt but not all the first flush of him moved your admiration great height great colour the red and the yellow his beard which ran jutting to a point and gave his jaw the clubbed look of a big cats his shut mouth and cold considering eyes the eager set of his head his soft padding motionsa leopard a hunting leopard quick to strike but quick to change purpose this then was richard yeaandnay whom all women loved and very few men these require to be trusted before they love and full trust richard gave to no man because he could not believe him worth it women are more generous givers expecting not again here was jehane saintpol a girl of twoandtwenty to his twoandthirty well born well formed greatly desired among her peers who having let her soul be stolen was prepared to cut it out of herself for his sake who took it and let it die she was the creature of his love in and out by now the work of his hands god had given her a magnificent body but richard had made it glow god had made her soul a fair room but his love had filled it with light decked it with flowers and such artful furniture he in fact as she very well knew had given her the grace to deal queenly with herself she knew that she would have strength to deny him having learned the hardihood to give him her soul fate had carried her too young into the arms of the most glorious prince in the world her brother eudo the count built castles on that in his head now she was to tumble them down her younger brother eustace loved this splendid richard now she was to hurt him what was to become of herself mercy upon her i believe she never thought of that his honour was her necessity the watchfires in the north told her the hour was at hand the old king was come up with a host to drive his son to bed richard must go and she woo him out son of a king heir of a king he must go to the king his father and he knew he must go two days maddening delight two nights biting of nails miserable entreaty from jehane grown newly pinched and grey in the face and he owned it he said to her the last night when i saw you first my queen of snows in the tribune at vezelay when the knights rode by for the melee the green light from your eyes shot me and wounded i cried out that maid or none she bowed her head but he went on when they throned you queen of them all because you were so proud and still and had such a high untroubled head and when your sleeve was in my helm and my heart in your lap and men fallen to my spear were sent to kneel before youwhat caused your cheek to burn and your eyes to shine so bright she hid her face homage of the knights the love of me he cried and then ah jehane of the fair girdle when i took you from the pastures of gisors when i taught you love and learned from your young mouth what love might be i was made man but now you ask me to become dog and he swore yet again he could never leave her but she smiled proudly being in pain nay my lord but the man in you is awake and not to leave you you shall go because you are the kings son and i shall pray for the new king so she beat him and had him weeping terribly his face in her lap she wept no more but dryeyed kissed him and drylipped went to bed he said yea that time records the abbot milo but i never knew then what she paid for it that was later he went next morning and she saw him go chapter ii how the fair jehane bestowed herself betimes is best for an ugly business your man of spirit will always rush what he loathes but yet must do count richard of poictou having made up his mind and confessed himself overnight must leave with the first cock of the morning yet must take the sacrament before it was grey in the east he did so fully armed in mail with his red surcoat of leopards upon him his sword girt his spurs strapped on outside the chapel in the weeping mirk a squire held his shield another his helm a groom walked his horse milo the abbot was celebrant a snuffling boy served the count knelt before the houselcloth haloed by the light of two thin candles hardly had the priest begun his introibo when jehane saintpol who had been awake all night stole in with a hood on her head and holding herself very stiffly knelt on the floor she joined her hands and stuck them up before her so that the tips of her fingers pointing upwards as her thoughts would fly were nearly level with her chin thus frozen in prayer she remained throughout the office nor did she relax when at the elevation of the host richard bowed himself to the earth it seemed as if she too bearing between her hands her own heart was lifting it up for sacrifice and for worship the count was communicated he was a very religious man who would sooner have gone without his sword than his saviour upon any affairs jehane saw him fed without a twitch of the lips she was in a great mood a rapt and pillared saint but when mass was over and his thanksgiving to make she got up and hid herself away from him in the shades there she lurked darkling and he lunging out swept with his swords point the very edge of her gown she did not hear him go for he trod like a cat but she felt him touch her with the sword and shuddered once or twice he went out of the courtyard at a gallop while the abbot was reciting his own thanksgiving jehane came out of her corner minded to speak with him so much he divined needing not the beckoning look she sent him from her guarded eyes he sat himself down by the altar of saint remy and she knelt beside him well my daughter says milo i think it is well she took him up the abbot milo a redfaced wateryeyed old man rheumy and weathered well then opened his mouth and spake such wisdom as he knew he held up his forefinger like a claw and used it as if describing signs and wonders in the air hearken madame jehane he said i say that you have done well and will maintain it that great prince whom i love like my own son is not for you nor for another no no he is married already he hoped to startle her the old rhetorician but he failed jehane was too dreary he is married my daughter he repeated and to whom why to himself that man from the birth has been a lonely soul he can never wed as you understand it you think him your lover believe me he is not he is his own lover he is called he has a destiny and what is that you ask me she did not but rhetoric bade him suppose it salem is his destiny salem is his bride the elect lady in bonds he will not wed madame alois of france nor you nor any virgin in christendom until that spiritual wedlock is consummate i should not love him as i do if i did not believe it for why shall i call my own son apostate he is signed with the cross a married man by our saviour he leaned back in his chair peering down at her to see how she took it she took it stilly and turned him a marble stormpurged face a pair of eyes which seemed all black what shall i do to be safe her voice sounded worn safe my child he wondered bless me is not the cross safety not with him father this was perfectly true though tainted with scandal he thought the abbot who was trained to blink all such facts had to learn that this girl blinked none true to his guidance he blinked go home to your brother my daughter go home to saintpollamarche at the worst remember that there are always two arks for a woman in floodtime a convent and a bed i shall never choose a convent said jehane i think said the abbot that you are perfectly wise i suppose the alternative struck a sudden terror into her for the abbot abruptly records in his book that here her spirit seemed to flit out of her and she began to tremble very much and in vain to contend with tears i had her all dissolved at my feet within a few moments she was very young and seemed lost come come he said you have shown yourself a brave girl these two days it is not every maid can sacrifice herself for a count of poictou the eldest son of a king come come let us have no more of this he hoped no doubt to brace her by a roughness which was far from his nature and it is possible that he succeeded in heading off a mutiny of the nerves she was not violent under her despair but went on crying very miserably saying oh what shall i do what shall i do god knoweth says the abbot this was a bad case but i had a good thought for it he began to speak of richard of what he had done and what would live to do they say that the strain of the fiend is in that race my dear he told her they say that geoffrey greygown had intercourse with a demon and certain it is that in richard as in all his brothers that stinging grain lives in the blood for testimony look at their cognisance of leopards and advise yourself whether any house in christendom ever took that device but had known familiarly the devil in some shape and look again at the deeds of these princes what turned the young king to riot and death and geoffrey to rapine and death what else will turn john sansterre to treachery and death or our tall richard to violence and death nothing else nothing else but before he dies you shall see him glorious he is glorious already said jehane wiping her eyes keep him so then said the abbot testily who did not love to have his periods truncated if i go back to saintpol said jehane i shall fall in with gilles de gurdun who has sworn to have me well replied the abbot why should he not does he receive the assurance of your brother the count jehane shook her head no no my brother wished me to be my lord richards but gilles needs no assurance he will buy my marriage from the king of france he is very sufficient hath he substance hath he lands is he noble then jehane he hath knighthood a church fiefoh enough god forgive me if i did amiss writes the abbot here but seeing her in a melting mood dewy soft and adorable i kissed that beautiful person and she left the chapel of saint remy somewhat comforted not only so but the same day she left the dark tower with her brother count eustace and rode towards gisors and saintpollamarche nothing she could do could be shamefully done because of her silence and the high head upon which she carried it yet the count of saintpol when he heard her story sitting bulky in his chair like a stalled red bull did his best to put shame upon her that so he might cover his own bitterness it was eustace a generous ardent youth in those days who saved her from most of eudos wrath by drawing it upon himself the count of saintpol swore a great oath by the teeth of god jehane he roared i see how it is he hath made thee a piece of ruin and now runs wasting elsewhere you shall never say that of my sister my lord cries eustace very red in the face nor yet of the greatest knight in the world why you egg says the count what have you to do in this tell me the rights of it before you put me in the wrong is my house to be the sport of anjou is that long son of pirates and the devil to batten on our pastures tread underfoot bruise and blacken rout as he will break hedge and away by my fathers soul eustace i shall see her righted he turned to the still girl you tell me that you sent him away where did you send him where did he go he went to the king of england at louviers and to the camp said jehane the king sent for him i sent him not who is there beside the king of england madame alois of france is there the count of saintpol put his tongue in his cheek oho he said oho that is how it stands so she is to be cuckoo hey he sat square and intent for a moment or two working his mouth like a man who chews a straw then he slapped his big hand on his knee and rose up if i cannot spike this wheel of vice trust me never by my soul a plot indeed oh horrible horrible thief he turned gnashing upon his brother now eustace what do you say to your greatest knight in the world and what now of your sister hey little fool do you not catch the measure of it now two honey years of jehane saintpol gossamer pledges of mouth and mouth of stealing fingers kiss and clasp but for the french kings daughterpish the thing of naught they have made herthe sacrament of marriage the treaty the dowryfee oh heaven and earth eustace answer me if you can all three were moved in their several ways the count red and blinking eustace red and trembling jehane white as a cloth trembling also but very silent the word was with the younger man i know nothing of all this upon my word my lord he said confused i love count richard i love my sister there may have been that which had i loved but one i had condemned in the other i know not buthe saw jehanes marble face and lifted his hand upby my hope i will never believe it in love they came together my lord in love says jehane they have parted i have heard little of madame alois but my thought is that kings and the sons of kings may marry kings daughters yet not in the way of love the count fumed you are a fool i see and therefore not to my purpose i must talk with men stay you here eustace and watch over her till i return let none get at her on your dear life there are those whosniffing rogues climbers boilers of their potskeep them out eustace keep them out as for youhe turned hectoring to the proud girlas for you mistress keep the house you are not in the market you are spoilt goods you shall go where you should be i am still lord of these lands there shall be no rebellion here keep the house i say i return ere many days he stamped out of the hall they heard him next rating the grooms at the gate saintpol was a great house a noble house no doubt of it its counts drew no limits in the way of pedigree but built themselves a fair temple in that kind with the twelfth apostle himself for head of the corner so far as estate went seeing their country was fruitful compact snugly bounded between france and normandy owing fealty to the first they might have been sovereign counts like the house of blois like that of aquitaine like that even of anjou which from nothing had risen to be so high more by marriage by robbery on that great plan where it ceases to be robbery and is called warfare by treaty and nice use of the balances there was no reason why kingship should not have been theirs or in their blood kingship even now was not far off they called the marquess of montferrat cousin and he it was understood intended to be throned at jerusalem the emperor himself might call and once being in liquor did call count eudo of saintpol cousin for the fact was so you must understand that in the gaul of that day things were in this ticklish state that a man as they say was worth the scope of his sword reiver yesterday warrior tomorrow yesterday wearing a hemp collar today a counts belt and tomorrow may be a kings crown you climbed in various ways by the field by the board by the bed a handsome daughter was nearly worth a stout son count eudo reckoned himself stout enough and reckoned eustace was so but the beauty of jehane that stately maid who might uphold a cornice that still wonder of ivory and gold was an emblement which he the tenant meant to profit by and so for an hour two years by the clock he saw his profit fair the infatuation of the girl for this man or that man was nothing but the infatuation of the great count of poictou for her set eudos heart ablaze god willing saint maclou assisting he might live to call jehane my lady queen he shut his ears to report there were those who called richard a rake and others who called him yeaandnay that was bertran de borns name for him and all paris knew it he shut his eyes to richards galling unconcern with himself and his dignity dignity of saintpol he would wait for his dignity he shut his mind to jehanes blown fame to the threatenings of his dreadful norman neighbour henry the old king who had had an archbishop poleaxed like a steer he dared the anger of his suzerain in whose hands lay jehanes marriage a heady gambler he staked the fortunes of his house upon this clinging of a girl to a wild prince and now to tell himself that he deserved what he had got was but to feed his rage again he swore by gods teeth that he would have his way and when he left his castle of saintpollamarche it was for paris the head of his house under the emperor henry was there conrad of montferrat trying to negotiate the crown of jerusalem there must be a conference before the house of saintpol could be let to fall surely the marquess would never allow it he must spike the wheel was not alois of france within the degrees she was sister to the french king well but what was richards mother she had been wife to louis wife to alois father was this decency what would the pope sayan italian was the marquess conrad an italian for nothing was our cousin the emperor of no account king of the romans the pope italian the marquess italian the emperor on his throne and god in his heaveneh eh there should be a conference of these high powers so and with such whirl of question and answer did the count of saintpol beat out to paris but jehane remained at saintpollamarche praying much going little abroad seeing few persons then came since rumour is a gadabout sir gilles de gurdun as she knew he would and knelt before her and kissed her hand gilles was a squareshouldered thickset youth of the black norman sort ruddy strongjawed smalleyed low in the brow bulletheaded he was no taller than she looked shorter and had nothing to say he had loved her since the time when she was an overgrown girl of twelve years and he a squire about her fathers house learning mannishness the king of england had dubbed him a knight but she had made him a man she knew him to be a good one as dull as a mudflat but honest wholesome and of decent estate in a moment when he was come again she saw that he was a long lover who would treat her well god help me and him also she thought it may be that i shall need him before long chapter iii in what harbour they found the old lion at evreux across the heath count richard found his company the viscount adhemar of limoges called for the present the good viscount the count of perigord sir gaston of bearn who really loved him the bishop of castres and the monk of montauban a singingbird some dozen of knights with their esquires pages and menatarms he waited two days there for abbot milo to come up with last news of jehane then at the head of sixty spears he rode fleetly over the marshes towards louviers after his first you are well met my lords he had said very little showing a cold humour after a colloquy with milo which he had before he left his bed he said nothing at all alone as became one of his race he rode ahead of his force not even the chirping monk who remembered his brother henry and often sighed for him cared to risk a shot from his strong eyes they were like blue stones full of the cold glitter of their fire it was at times like this when a man stands naked confronting his purpose that one saw the hag riding on the back of anjou he was not thinking of it now but the truth is that there had hardly been a time in his short life when he had not been his fathers open enemy he could have told you that it had not been always his fault though he would never have told you but i say that what he a youth of thirty had made of his inheritance was as nothing to that elders wasting of his in moments of hot rage richard knew this and justified himself but the melting hour came again when he heaped all reproach upon himself believing that but for such and such he might have loved this rooted terrible old man who assuredly loved not him richard was neither mule nor jade he was open to persuasion on two sides compunction was one you could touch him on the heart and bring him weeping to his knees affection was another if he loved the petitioner he yielded handsomely now this time it was jehane and not his conscience which had sent him to louviers first of all jehane had pleaded the sepulchre his old father filial obedience and he had laughed at the sweet fool but when she grown wiser urged him to pleasure her by treading on the heart she had given him he could not deny her he was converted not convinced so he rode alone three hundred yards from his lieges reasoning out how he could preserve his honour and yet yield the more he thought the less he liked it but all the more he felt necessity at his throat and as always with him when he thought he seemed as if turned to stone one way or another milo tells us every man of the house of anjou had his unapproachable side so accustomed were they to the fortresslife a broad plain watered by many rivers showed the towers of louviers and red roofs cinctured by the greatest of them short of the walls were the ranked white tents columned smoke waggons with men and horses as purposeless little and busy as a swarm of bees in the midst of this array was a red pavilion with a standard at the side too heavy for the wind all was set in the clear sunless air of an autumn day in normandy the hour one short of noon richard reined up for his company on a little hill the powers of england my lords he said pointing with his hand all stayed beside him gaston of bearn tweaked his black beard let us be done with the business richard said this knight before the irons can get out what cried the count shall a father smite his son no one answered in a moment he was ashamed of himself before god he said i mean no impiety i will do what i have undertaken as gently as may be come gentlemen he rode on the camp was defended by fosse and bridge at the barbican all the aquitanians except richard dismounted and all stayed about him while a herald went forward to tell the king who was come in the king knew very well who it was but chose not to know it he kept the herald long enough to make his visitors chafe then sent word that the count of poictou would be received but alone claiming his right to ride in richard followed the heralds at a foots pace alone ungreeted by any at the mount of the standard he got off his horse found the ushers of the kings door and went swiftly to the entry of the pavilion which they held open for him as though like some forest beast he saw his prey there in the entry he stiffened suddenly and stiffly went down on his two knees midway of the great tent square and rugged before him with working jaws and restless little fired eyes sat the old king his father hands on knees between them a long bare sword beside him was his son john thin and flushed and about a circle of peers two bishops in purple a pockmarked monk of cluny bohun grantmesnil drago de merlou and a few more on the ground was a secretary biting his pen the king looked his best on a throne for his upper part was his best it was at least the mannish part with scanty red hair much rubbed into disorder a seamed red face blotched and shining with a square jaw awry the neck and shoulders of a bull with gnarled gross hands at the end of arms long out of measure a cruel mouth and a nose like a birds beakhis features seemed to have been hacked coarsely out of wood and as coarsely painted but what might have passed by such means for a man was transformed by his burning eyes with their fuel of pain into the similitude of a fallen angel the devil of anjou sat eating king henrys eyes and you saw him at his meal it gave the man the look of a wild boar easing his tusks against a tree horrible yet content to be abhorred splendid because so strong and lonely but the prospect was not comfortable little as he knew of his father richard could make no mistake here the old king was in a picksome mood fretted by rage angry that his son should kneel there more than angry that he had not knelt before the play began like a farce the king affected not to see him let him kneel on richard did kneel on as stiff as a rod the king talked with obscene jocosity every snap betraying his humour to prince john he scandalised even his bishops he abashed even his barons he infinitely degraded himself yet seemed to wallow in disgrace so richards gorge a tender organ rose to hear him god what wast thou about to let such a hog be made he muttered loud enough for at least three people to hear the king heard it and was pleased the prince heard it and with a scared eye perceived that bohun had heard it the king went grating on john fidgeted bohun greatly daring whispered in his masters ear the king replied with a roar which all the camp might have heard ha sacred face let him kneel bohun that is a new custom for him useful science for a man of his trade all men of the sword come to it sooner or latersooner or later by god hereupon richard very deliberately rose to his feet and stepped forward to the throne his great height was a crowning abomination the king blinked up at him showing his tushes what now sir he said later for me sire if kneeling is to be done by soldiers said richard the king controlled himself by swallowing and yet richard he said dry as dust and yet richard you have knelt to the french lad soon enough to my liegelord sire yes it is true he is not your liegelord man roared the king i am your liegelord by heaven i gave and i can take away heed me now fair sire says richard observe that i have knelt to you i am not here for any other reason and least of all to try conclusions of the voice i have come out of my lands with my company to give you obedience be sure that they on their part will pay you proper honour as i do if you will let them you come from lands i have given you as henry came as geoffrey came to defy me said the old man trembling in his chair what is your obedience worth when i have measured theirs henrys obedience geoffreys obedience pish man what words you use he got up and stamped about the tent like an irritable dwarf crooklegged and longarmed pricked maddened at every point and you tell me of your men your lands your company good men all a fair company by the rood of grace tell me now richard have you raimon of toulouse in that company have you beziers no sire said richard looking serenely down at the working face nor ever will have snarled the king have you the knight of bearn i have sire ill company richard it is a whitefaced lying beast with a most goatish beard have you your singing monk i have sire shameful company have you adhemar of limoges yes sire silly company leave him with his women have you your abbot milo yes sick company his head sank into his breast he found himself suddenly tired even of reviling and had to sit down again richard felt a tide of pity looking down at the huddled old man he held out his hand let us not quarrel father he said but that brought up the kings head like a call to arms a last question richard have you dared bring here bertran de born he was on his feet again for the reply and the two men faced each other everybody knew how serious the question was it sobered the count but drove the pity out of him dare is not a word for anjou sire he replied picking his phrases but bertran is not with me before the old man could break again into savagery he went on to his main purpose sire short speeches are best you seek to draw my illhumours but you shall not draw them as son and servant of your grace i came in and so will go out as a son i have knelt to the king my father as servant i am ready to obey him let that marriage designed in the cradle by the french king and you go on i will do my part if madame alois will do hers richard folded his arms the king sat down again a queer exchange of glances had passed between his father and brother at the mention of that ladys name richard who saw it got the feeling of some secret between them the feeling of being in a trap but he said nothing the king began his old harping attend to me now richard he said with much work of the eyebrows if that illgotten beast bertran had been of your meinie our last words had been said beast he is a toothed snake that crawled into my boys bed and bit passion into him lord jesus if ever again i meet bertran help thou me to redden his face but as it is i am content rest you here with me if so rough a lodging may content your nobility as for madame alois she shall be sent for but i think i will not meet your bevy of joglars from the south i have a proud stomach o these days i doubt pastry from languedoc would turn me sour and liking monks little enough as it is your throstlecock of montauban might cause me to blaspheme see them entertained drago or better let them entertain each otherwith singing games holy god go you bohunand he turnedfetch in madame alois bohun went through a curtain behind him and the king sat in thought biting his thumbs madame alois of france came out of the inner tent a slinking thin girl with the white and tragic face of the fool in a comedy set in black hair richard thought she was mad by the way she stared about her from one man to another but he went down on his knee in a moment prince john turned stiff the old king bent his brows to watch richard the lady who was dressed in black and looked to be half fainting shrank in an odd way towards the wall as if to avoid a whip too long in england poor soul richard thought but why did she come from the kings tent it was not a cheerful meeting nor did the king show any desire to make it better when by roundabout and furtive ways madame alois at last stood drooping by his chair he began to talk to her in english a language unknown to richard though familiar enough he saw to his father and brother it seems to be his graces desire to make me ridiculous he went on to say to himself what a deadlevel of grim words in english it appears you do not talk you stab with the tongue in truth there was no conversation the king or the prince spoke and madame alois moistened her lips she looked nowhere but at the old tyrant not at his eyes but above them at his forehead and with a trepitant gaze like a watched hares the king has her in thrall soul and body richard considered then his knee began to ache and he released it fair sire he began in his own tongue madame alois gave a start and ha richard says the king art thou still there man where else my lord asked the son the father looked at alois deign to recognise in this baron madame he said my son the count of poictou let him salute madame that which he has sought from so far and with such humility pardieu your white hand alois the strange girl quivered then put her hand out richard kissing it found it horribly cold lady he said i pray we may be better acquainted but i must tell you that i have no english let me hope that in this good land you may recover your french he got no answer from the lady but by heaven he made his father angry we hope richard that you will teach madame better things than that sniffed the old man nosing about for battle i pray that i may teach her no worse my lord replied the other you will perhaps allow that for a daughter of france the tongue may have its uses as english count for the son of england cried his father or for his wife by the mass if he is fit to have one of that sire we must talk at your graces leisure said richard slowly jesus he asked himself will he put me to a block of ice what is the matter with this woman the king put an end to his questions by dismissing madame alois breaking up the assembly and himself retiring he was dreadfully fatigued quite white and breathless richard saw him follow the lady through the inner curtain and again was uncomfortably suspicious but when his brother john made to slip in also he thought there must be an end of it he tapped the young man on the shoulder brother a word with you says he and john came twittering back the two were alone in the tent this johnsansterre landlos lackland so they variously called himwas a timid copy of his brother a wrynecked reedy richard with a sniff not so tall yet more spare with blue eyes more pallid than his brothers and protruding where richards were inset the difference lay more in degree than kind richard was of heroic build but a wellknit wellshaped hero in john the arms were too long the head too small the brow too narrow richards eyes were perhaps too wide apart no doubt johns were too near together richard twitched his fingers when he was moved john bit his cheek richard stooped from the neck john from the shoulders when richard threw up his head you saw the lion john at bay reminded you of a wolf in a corner john snarled at such times richard breathed through his nose john showed his teeth when he was crossed richard when he was merry so many thousand points of unlikeness might be named all small the lord knows here are enough the angevin catanddog nature was fairly divided between these two richard had the sufficiency of the cat john the dependence of a dog john had the cats secretiveness richard the dogs dash at heart john was a thief he feared and hated his brother so when richard said brother a word with you john tried to disguise apprehension in disgust the result was a very sick smile willingly dear brother and the more so he began but richard cut him short what under the light of the sky is the matter with that lady he asked him john had been preparing for that he raised his eyebrows and splayed out both his hands can you ask eh our lord emotiona stranger in a strange landan access of the shudderswho knows women so long from francedreadful of her brotherdreadful of youso many things a silly mindah my brother richard checked him testily put a point put a point you drown me in phrases your explanations explain nothing one more word what in the devils name is she doing in there he had a short way john began to stammer a second fathera tender guardian pish said count richard and turned to leave the pavilion prince john slipped through the curtains and at that moment richard heard a little fretful cry within not the cry of mortal lady what under heaven have they got in there this family he asked himself shrugging he went out into the fresh air the abbot notes that his lord and master came running into his quarters and tumbled upon me like a lover who finds his mistress after many days milo milo milo he began to cry three times over as if the name helped him thou wilt live to see a puddock upon the throne of england thus he strangely said chapter iv how jehane stroked what alois had made fierce when the count of saintpol came to paris he found the going very delicate for it is a delicate matter to confer in a kings capital with a kings allies how best to throw obstacles in that kings way as a matter of fact he found that he could do little or nothing in the business king philip was in great feather concerning his sisters arrival the heralds were preparing to go out to meet her nicholas deu and the baron of quercy were to accompany them king philip thought saintpol the very man to make a third but this did not suit the count at all he sought out his kinsman the marquess of montferrat a heavy italian who gave him very little comfort all he could suggest was that his good cousin would do better to help him to the certain throne of jerusalem what do you want with more than one king in a family asked the marquess saintpol grew rather dry as he assured him that one king would suffice and that anjou was nearer than jerusalem he went on to hint at various strange speculations rife concerning the history of madame alois if you want garbage eudo said montferrat to this come not to me but i know a rat who might be of service the name of your rat marquess it is all i ask bertran de born who else said montferrat now bertran de born was the thorn in the flesh of anjou a rankling addition to their state whom they were never without saintpol knew his value very well and decided to go down to see the man in his own country so he would have gone no doubt had not his sovereign judged otherwise saintpol received commands to accompany the heralds to louviers so had to content himself with a messenger to the trobador and a letter which announced the extreme happiness of the great count of poictou this he knew would draw the poisonbag the frenchmen arrived at louviers none too soon as well mix fire and ice as poictevin with norman or angevin with angevin the princes stalked about with claws out of velvet the nobles bickered fiercely and the menatarms did after their kind there was open fighting gaston of bearn picked a quarrel with john botetort and they fought it out with daggers in the fosse then count richard took one of his brothers goshawks and would not give it up over the long body of that bird half a score noblemen engaged with swords the count of poictou himself accounted for six and ended by pommelling his brother into a red jelly there was a week or more of this during which the old king hunted like a madman all day and revelled in gloomy vices all night richard saw little of him and little of the lady of france she a pale shade flitted dismally out when evoked by the king dismally in again at a nod from him whenever she did appear prince john hovered about looking tormented afterwards the pockmarked cluniac might be heard lecturing her on theology and the souls business in passionless monologue it was very far from gay as for her richard believed her melancholy mad he himself grew fretful irritable most quarrelsome thus it was that he first plundered and then punched his brother after that prince john disappeared for a little to nurse his sores and richard got within fair speaking distance of madame alois in fact she sent for him late one night when the king as he knew was away munching the ashes of charred pleasure in some stews or other he obeyed the summons with a halfshrug they received him with consternation the distracted lady was in a chair hugging herself the cluniac stood by a mortified emblem a scared woman or two fled behind the throne madame alois when she saw who the visitor was began to shake oh oh she said in a whisper have you come to murder me my lord why madame richard made haste to say i would serve you any other way but that and supposed i had the right but i came because you sent for me she passed her hand once or twice over her face as if to brush cobwebs away one of the women made a piteous appeal of the eyes to richard who took no notice of it the monk said something to himself in a low voice then to the count madame is overwrought my lord yes you rascal thought richard your work aloud he said i hope her grace will give you leave to retire sir madame hereupon waved her people away and went on waving long after they had gone thus she was alone with her future lord there was the wreck of fine beauty about her drawn race beauty of the blackandwhite sheeted sort but she looked as if she walked with ghosts richard was very gentle with her he drew near saying i grieve to see you thus madame but she stopped him with a question they seek to have you marry me he smiled our masters desire it madame are you very sure of that i am here he explained because i am so sure and you desire i madame he said quickly and shortly desire two thingsthe good of my country and your good if i desire anything else god knows it is to keep my promise what is your promise madame said richard i bear the cross on my shoulder as you see why she said fearfully regarding it that is gods work she began to walk about the room quickly and to talk to herself he could not catch properly what she said religion came into it and a question of time now it should be done now it should be done and then hear o thou shepherd of israel and then with a wild look into richards facethat was a strange thing to do to a lady they can never lay that to me afterwards she began to wring her hands with a cry of fie poison poison poison looking at richard all the time this poor lady he told himself is possessed by a devil therefore no wife for me who have devil enough and to spare what ails you madame he asked her tell me your grief and upon my life i will amend it if i can you cannot she said nothing can mend it then with leavehe went to the curtainsi will call your graces people our discussions can be later there is time enough she would have stopped him had she dared or had the force but literally she was spent there was just time to get the women in before she tumbled richard in his perplexity determined to wrangle out the matter with the king on the morrow cost what it might so he did and to his high surprise the king reasoned instead of railing madame alois he said was weakly unwholesome indeed in his opinion she wanted what all young women want a husband she was too much given to the cloister she had visions she was feared to use the discipline she ate nothing was more often on her knees than on her feet all this my son said king henry you shall correct at your discretion humours vapours qualms fantasiespouf you can blow them away with a kiss have you tried it no too cold nay but you should and so on and so on that day none too soon the french ambassadors arrived and richard saw the count of saintpol among them he had never liked the count of saintpol or perhaps it would be truer to say that he disliked him more than ordinary but he belonged to had even a tinge of jehane some of her secret fragrance hung about him he walked in some ray of her glory it seemed to richard bothered sick fretted a little disconcerted as he was now that the count of saintpol had an air which none other of this people had he greeted him therefore with more than usual affability very much to saintpols concern richard observed this and suddenly remembered that he was doing the man what the man must certainly believe to be a cruel wrong mort de dieu what am i about his heart cried i ought to be ashamed to look this fellow in the face and here i am making a brother of him saintpol he said immediately i should like to speak with you i owe you that your graces servant said eudo with a stiff reverence when and where you will follow me said richard as soon as you have done with all this foppery in about an hours time he was obeyed after his fashion he took a straight plunge saintpol he said i think you know where my heart is whether here or elsewhere i desire you to understand that in this case i am acting against my own will and judgment the frankness of this lordly creature was unmistakable even to saintpol hey sire he began spluttering honesty in arms with rage richard took him up if you doubt that as you have my leave to do i am ready to convince you i will ride with you wherever you choose and place myself at your discretion subject to this mind you that the award is final once more i will do it will you abide by that will you come with me saintpol cursed his fate here he was tied to the french girl my lord he said i cannot obey you my duty is to take madame to paris that is my masters command well said richard then i shall go alone once more i shall go i am sick to death of this business my lord richard cried saintpol i am no man to command you yet i say go i know not what has passed between your grace and my sister jehane but this i know very well it will be a strange thinghe laughed not pleasantlya strange thing i say if you cannot bend that arbiter to your own way of thinking richard looked at him coldly if i could do that my friend he said i should not suffer arbitration at all the proposition was not mine my lord urged saintpol it could not be sir richard said sharply i proposed it myself because i consider that a lady has the right to dispose of her own person she loved me once i believe that she is yours at this hour sire that is what i propose to find out said richard enough what news have they in paris saintpol could not help himself he was bursting with a budget he had received from the south they greatly admire a sirvente of bertran de borns sire what is the stuff of the sirvente it is a scandalous subject sire he calls it the sirvente of kings and speaks much evil of your order richard laughed i will warrant him to do that better than any man alive and allow him some reason for it i think i will go to see bertran ha sire said saintpol with meaning he will tell you many things some good and some not so good be sure he will said richard that is bertrans way he would trust no one with his present reflections and seek no outside strength against his present temptations he had always had his way it had seemed to come to him by right by the droit de seigneur the natural law which puts the necks of fools under the heels of strong men no need to consider of all that he knew that the thing desired lay to his hand he could make jehane his again if he would and neither king of england nor king of france nor council of westminster nor diet of the empire could stop himif he would but that he felt now was just what he would not to beat her down with torrents of lovecries to have her trembling cowed drummed out of her wits by her own heartbeats to compel to dominate to tame when her young pride and young strength were the things most beautiful in her never by the cross of christ that i suppose is as near to true love as a man can get to reverence in a girl that which holds her apart richard got so near precisely because he was less lover than poet you may doubt if you choose with abbot milo whether he had love in him i doubt but certainly he was a poet he saw jehane all glorious and gave thanks for the sight he felt to touch heaven when he neared her but he did not covet her possession at the moment perhaps he felt that he did possess her it is a poets way so little at any rate did he covet that having made up his mind what he would do he sent gaston of bearn to saintpollamarche with a letter for jehane in which he said in two days i shall see you for the last or for all time as you willand then possessed himself in patience the appointed number of hours gaston of bearn romantic figure in those grey latitudes pale blackeyed freakishly bearded dressed in bright green rode his way singing announced himself to the lady as the child of love and when he saw her kissed her foot starry wonder of the north he said kneeling i bring fuel to your ineffable fires our king of lovers and lover among kings is all at your feet sighing in this paper he seemed to talk in capitals with a flourish handed her the scroll he had the gratification to see her clap a hand to her side directly she touched it but no more she perused it with unwavering eyes in a stiff head farewell sir she said then i will prepare for my lord and i lady said gaston in consequence of a vow i have vowed my saint will await his coming in the forest neither sleeping nor eating until he has his enormous desires farewell lady he went out backwards to keep his promise the brown woodland was gay with him for a day and a night for he sang nearly all the time with unflagging spirits but jehane spent part of the interval in the chapel with her hands crossed upon her fine bosom the god in her heart fought with him on the altar she said no prayers but when she left the place she sent a messenger for gilles de gurdun the bluntnosed norman knight who loved her so much that he said nothing about it this gurdun pricking through the woods came upon gaston of bearn dazzling as a spring tree and singing like an inspired machine he pulled up at the wonderful sight and scowled it is the proper norman greeting gaston treated him as part of the landscape like the rest of it mournful but provocative of song give you goodday beau sire said gilles gaston waved his hand and went on singing at the top of his voice then gilles who was pressed tried to pass and gaston folded his arms ha beef said he none pass here but the brave out parrot quoth gilles and plunged through the wood because of gastons vow there was no blood shed at the moment but he had hopes that he might be released in time there goes a dead man was therefore his comment before he resumed but jehane when she heard the horse ran out to meet his rider her face was alight come in come in she said and took him by the hand he followed her with a beating heart neither daring nor knowing how to say anything she led him into the little dark chapel gilles gilles she said panting do you love me gilles he was hoarse could hardly speak for the crack in his throat o god he said under his breath o god jehane how i love you here because of a certain flicker in her eyes he made forward but she put out her two hands the length of her arms and fenced him off no no gilles not yet pain sharpened her voice listen first to me i do not love you but i am frightened some one is coming you must be here to help me i give myself to youi will be yoursi mustthere is no other way she stopped you could have heard the thudding of her heart give then said gilles with a croak and took her she felt herself engulfed in a sea of fire but set her teeth and endured the burning of that death the poor fellow did but kiss her once or twice and kissed no closer than the angevin but the grace is one that goes by favour gilles nevertheless took primer seisin and was content afterwards hand in hand trembling each the possessed and the possessing they stood before the twinkling lamp which hinted at the son of god and waited what must happen in about half an hours time jehane heard the long padding tread she knew so well and took a deep breath next gilles heard something one comes who comes he said whispering richard of anjou i need you now do you want me to gilles honestly thought he was to kill the count she undeceived him soon to kill richard gilles nay man he is not for your killing she gave a short laugh not very pleasant for her lover to hear but gilles for all that put hand to hilt the count of poictou stooped at the entry and saw them together it wanted but that to blow the embers something tigerish surged in him some gust of jealousy some arrogant tide in the blood not all clean he moved forward like a wind and caught the girl up in his arms lifted her off her feet smothered her cry my jehane my jehane who dares gilles touched him on the shoulder and he turned like lightning with jehane held fast his breath came quick and short through his nose gilles believed his last hour at hand but made the most of it what now dog thus the lean richard set down the lady my lord said doughty gilles she is promised to me heart of god what is this he held back his head like a snake that he might see what he would strike at is it true girl jehane looked up from his shoulder where she had been hiding her face she could not speak but she nodded it is true thou art promised i am promised my lord said jehane let me go he put her down at once between himself and gurdun gurdun went to take up her hand again but at a look from richard forbore the count went on with his interrogatories outwardly as calm as a field of snow in whose name art thou promised to this knight jehane in thy brothers no lord in my own am i nothing she began to cry oh oh she wailed you are everything everything in the world he turned away from her and stood facing the altar with folded arms considering gilles had the wit to be silent the girl fought for breath richard in fact was touched to the heart and capable of any sacrifice which could seem the equivalent of this he must always lead even in magnanimity but it was a better thing than emulation moved him now when he next turned with a calm true face to jehane there was not a shred of the angevin in him all was burnt away what is the name of this knight jehane she told him gilles de gurdun then he said come hither de gurdun and gilles knelt down before the son of his overlord jehane would have knelt to him too but that he held her by the hand and would not suffer it now gilles listen to what i shall tell you said richard there is no lady in the world more noble than this one and no man living who means more faithfully by her than i i will do her will this day and that speedily lest the devil be served are you a true man gilles lord said gurdun i try to be so your father made me a knight i have loved this lady since she was twelve years old are you a man of substance my friend we have a good fief my lord my father holds of the church of rouen and the church of the duke i serve with a hundred spears where i may a routier if nothing better offer if i give you jehane what do you give me thanks my good lord and faith and long service get up gilles said richard gilles kissed his knee and rose richard put jehanes hand into his and held the two together god serve me as i shall serve you gilles if any harm come of this he said shrewdly with words that whistled in the air and as gilles looked him squarely in the face richard ran an eye over him gilles was found honest richard kissed jehane on the forehead and went out without a look back at the edge of the wood he found gaston of bearn sucking his fingers there went by here said the gay youth a black knight with a face of a raw meat colour and the most villainous scowl ever you saw i consider him to be dead already i have given him something which should cure him of the scowl and justify his colour answered him the count moreover i have given him the chance of eternal life then with a cryoh gaston let us get to the south see the sun fleck the roads smell the oranges let us get to the south man it seems i have entertained an angel and now that i have given her wings and now that she is gone i know how much i love her speed gaston we will go to the south see bertran and make some songs of good women and men in want pardieu said gaston i am with you richard for i am in want i have eaten nothing for two days so they rode out of the woods of saintpollamarche and richard began to sing songs of jehane the fairgirdled never truly her lover until he might love her no more chapter v how bertran de born and count richard strove in a tenzon daylong and nightlong he sang of her being now in the poetic mood highly exalted out of himself the country took tints of jehane her shape her fine nobility the thrust hills of the vexin were her breasts the woods being hot gold her russet hair in still green water he read the secrets of her eyes in the milk of october dawns her calm brows had been dipped the level light of the beauce so beneficent yet so austere figured her soul fairgirdled was touraine by vienne and loire fairgirdled jehane who wore virgin candour about her loins and over her heart a shield of blue ice as far southwards as tours the dithyrambic prevailed richard was untiring in the hunt for analogues thence on to poictiers where the country being his own was perhaps more familiar indeed while he was climbing the grey peaks of montagrier with his goal almost in sight he turned scholiast and glossed his former raptures you are not to tell me gaston he declared that my jehane has been untrue she was never more wholly mine than when she gave herself to that other never loved me more dearly such power is given to women to lead this world it is the power of the word who cut himself off and made us his butchers in pure love i shall do my part i shall wed the french girl who in my transports will never guess that in reality jehane will be in my arms tears filled his eyes for we shall be wedded in the sight of heaven he said sighing deus cried gaston here such marriages may be more to the taste of heaven than of men richard man is a creature of sense he hath a spiritual part said richard so rarely hidden that only the thin fingers of a girl may get in to touch it then being touched he knows that it is quick let me alone i am not all mud nor all devil i shall do my duty marry the french girl and love my golden jehane until i die that is the saying of a poet and king at once said gaston and really believed it so they came at dusk to autafort a rock castle on the confines of perigord held by bertran de born it looked and was a robbers hold although it had a poet for castellan its walls merely prolonged the precipices on which they were founded its towers but lifted the mountain spurs more sharply to the sky it dominated two watersheds was accessible only on one side and then by a ridgeway from it the valley roads and rockstrewn hillsides could be seen for many leagues long before richard was at the gate the lord of autafort had had warning and had peered down upon his suzerain at his clambering the crows shall have richard before richard me said bertran de born so he had his bridge pulled up and portcullis let down and autafort showed a bald face to the newcomers gaston grinned hospitality of aquitaine hospitality of your duchy richard by my head said the count if i sleep under the stars i sleep at autafort this night but hear me charm this plotter he called at the top of his voice ha bertran come you down man the surrounding hills echoed his cries the jackdaws wheeled about the turrets but presently came one and put his eye to the grille richard saw him is that you then bertran he shouted there was no answer but the spyer was heard breathing hard at his vent come out of your earth red fox richard chid him show your grievous snout to the hills do your snuffling abroad to the clear sky i have whipped off the hounds my father is not here will you let starve your liegelord at this the bolts were drawn the bridge went down with a clatter and bertran de born came outa fine stout man all in a pother with a red perplexed face angry eyes hair and beard cut in blocks a body too big for his clothesa man of hot blood fumes and rages richard at sight of him this unquiet sniffer of offences this whirled about with stratagems threw back his head and laughed long and loud o thou plotter of thine own disease o rider of nightmares what harm can i do thee not believe me a tithe of thy desert come thou here straightly master bertran and take what i shall give thee by god lord richard said bertran and boggled horribly but the better man waited and in the end he came up sideways richard swung from his horse took his host by the shoulders shook him well and kissed him on both cheeks spinner of mischief red robber singer of the thoughts of god he said i swear i love thee through it all bertran though i should do better to wring thy neck now give us food and drink and clean beds for gaston at least is a dead man without them afterwards we will sing songs come in come in richard said bertran de born for a day or two richard was bathed in golden calm hugging his darling thought full of jehane fearful to share her often he remembered it in later life it held a place and commanded a mood which no hour of his wildest possession could outvie the mountain air still but latently nimble the great mountains themselves dreaming in the sunlight the sailing birds hinted a peace to his soul whither his last conquest of his baser part assured him he might soar now he could guess thought he that quality in love which it borrows from god and shares with the angels ministers of god the steady burning of a flame keen and hard so on an afternoon of weather serene beyond all belief of the north mild tired softly radiant still as a summer noon as he sat with bertran in a courtyard where were lemontrees and a fountain and above the old white walls and above the strutting pigeons a square of blue he began to speak of his affairs of what he had done and of what was to do bertrans was a grudging spirit you shall hear the abbot milo upon that matter anon than whom there are few better qualified to speak he grudged richard everythinghis beauty his knit and graceful body his brain like a sword his past exploits his present content what it was contented him he knew not altogether though a letter from saintpol had in part advised him but he was sure he had wherewithal to discontent him foh a juicy orange indeed he said to himself but i can wring him dry if richard hugged one thought bertran hugged another and took it to bed with him o nights now therefore when richard spoke of jehane bertran said nothing waiting his time but when he went on to madame alois and his duty which really coloured all the former thought bertran made a grimace rascal says richard shamming rough why do you make faces at me bertran began jerking about like the lid of a boiling pot and presently sends a boy for his viol at this when it came he snatched and set to plucking a chord here and a chord there grinning fearfully all the time a tenzon a tenzon beau sire cries he now a tenzon between you and me let it be so says richard have at you i sing of the calm day of the sweets of true love accorded says the other and i sing of the sours of false love do you set the mode prince of blood royal as you are richard took the viol without afterthought and struck a few chords a great tenderness was in his heart he saw duty and himself hand in hand walking a long road by night two large stars beaconed the way these were jehanes eyes a watcher or two stole into the upper gallery leaned on the parapet and listened for both men were renowned singers richard began to sing of greeneyed jehane who wore the gold girdle whose hair was red gold his song was li dous consire quem don amors soven but i english it thus that gentle thought which love will give sometimes is like a plait of silk and gold and so is this song of mine to be wherein you shall find a red deep cry which cometh from the heart and a thin blue cry which is the cry of what is virgin in my soul and a golden long cry the cry of the king and a cry clear as crystal and colder than a white moon and that is the cry of jehane bertran trembling snatched at the viol mine to sing richard mine to sing ha love me no more cantar d amors non voilh he began your strands are warped and will not accord for love will warp any song it turneth the heart of a man black and the soul it eateth up at fourteen goes the virgin first awallowing and soon the king croaks like a hog a plait love is a fetter of hot iron so my song shall be ironcruel like the bidding of jehane say now shall i set the song the lovecry is the cry of a man who drags his way with his side torn and the colour of it is dry red like old blood and the sound thereof maketh the hearers ache so it quavers and shrills for it cries only two things sorrow and shame he misconceived his adversary who thought to quell him by such vapours richard took the viol bertran it is well seen that thou art pinched and have a torn side but ask of thy itching fingers who graved the wound dry thou art bertran for thy trough is dry the husks prick thy gums but there is no other meat well may the hearers ears go aching for thy cry man proceedeth from thy aching belly but now i will set the song again and tell thee of a lady girdled with fine gold beneath the girdle beats a red heart but her spirit is like a spire of blue smoke that comes from a fire indeed but strains up to heaven warmed by that fire like that smoke i fly up and so i lie among the stars with jehane bertrans jaw was at work mashing his tongue ah richard is it so with thee wait now while i strike a blow he made the viol scream what if i twist the song awry and give thee good cause to limp the sorrowful way what if for my aching belly i give thee an aching heart eh if my fingers scratch my side there are worse talons at thine watch for the lions claw richard which tears not flesh but honour and gives more pain than any knife pain he is king of pain mend that then face sorrow and shame ending with a snap he grinned more knowledge out of his red eyes than he pronounced with his mouth his terrible excitement the labour and sweat of it set richards brows knitting he stretched out his hand for the viol slowly and his eyes were cold on bertran and never off him for a moment as he sang to this enemy and judged him while he sang the note was changed the lion is a royal beast a king whose son am i we maul not each other in anjou save when the jackal from the south cometh snarling between then when we see the unclean beast saith one faugh is this your friend and the other thou dost ill to say so then the blood may flow and the jackal get a meal but here there is none to come licking blood the prize is the white roe of france fed on the french lilies and now in safe harbour she shall lie by the leopard and the lion rule the forest in peace because of the peace about him and like a harvest moon above us clear of the trees will be jehane listen richard i will be clearer yet came from between bertrans teeth he fairly ground them together having the viol he struck but one note upon it with such rudeness that the string broke he threw the thing away and sang without it leaning his hands on his knees and craning forward that he might spit the words this is the bite of the song she is forsworn harbour she kept harbour too long she is mangled she is torn touch not the lions prey leopard you go hunting too latefor all but sorrow and shame richard stretched not his hand again his jaw dropped and most of the strong colour died down in his face turned to stone stiff and immovable he sat staring at the singer while bertran biting his lip still grinning and twitching with his late effort watched him give me the truth thou his voice was like an old mans hollow as god is in heaven that is the truth richard said bertran de born the counts head went up as when a hound yelps to the sky laughter ensued barking laughternot mirth not grief disguised but mockery the worst of all one on the gallery nudged his fellow that other shrugged him off richard stretched his long arms his clenched fists to the dumb sky have i bent the knee to good issues or not have i abased my head o clement prince o judge in israel o father of kings hear now a parable of the prodigal father i have sinned against heaven and before thee and thou art no more worthy to be called my father o glutton o filching dog by the torch of the gospel count richard what i sang is true said bertran still tensely grinning and now also wringing at his hangnails richard checked by the voice turned blazing upon him why thou schoolboy rhymester that is the only merit thou hast and that not thine own thy japes are nought thy tragics the mewing of cats but thy news fellow thy news is too rich matter for thy sewer of a throat tragic no it is worse it is comic o heaven heed you now in his bitter shame he began pantomiming with his fingershere are two persons father by the grace of god son by the grace of the father saith father son thou art sprung from kings take this woman that is sprung from kings for i have no further use for her anon cometh a white rag thinly from the inner tentmark her provenance son kneeleth down wilt thou have my son cony saith father yea dear heart saith she tis my counterpart mark you saith father better than nothing at all saith she benevolent father supplekneed son convenient lady here is agreement and thus it ends again he laughed outright at the steelblue face of the sky then jumped in a flash from his seat to the throat of bertran bertran tumbled backwards with a strangled cry and richard pegged him to the ground thou yapping cur bertran he grated thou sick dog of my kennel if this snarl of thine goes true thou hast done a service to me and mine thou knowest not of there is little to do before i am the richest man in christendom why dull rogue thou hast set me free he looked up exulting from his work at the mans throat to shout this word but if it is not true bertranhe shook him like a ratif it is not true i return o bertran and tear this false gullet out of its case and with thy speckled heart feed the crows of perigord bertran had foam on his lips but richard showed him no mercy as it is bertran he went on with his teeth on edge i am minded to finish thee but that i need something from thee i think i should do it tell me now whence came thy news tell me bertran or thou art in hell in a moment he had to let him up to win from him after a time that his informant was the count of saintpol little matter that this was untrue the bringing in of his name set wild alarums clanging in richards head it was only too likely to have been saintpols doing there was obvious reason but by the same token saintpol might be a liar he saw that he must by all means find saintpol and find him at once he began to shout for gaston to horse to horse gaston the court rang with his voice to the clamour he made which might betoken murder arson pillage or the sin against the holy ghost out came the vassals in a swarm to horse to horse bearnais where out of hell is gaston of bearn the devil of anjou was loose in autafort that day gaston came delicately last drawing his beard through his fist to see bertran de born lie helpless in a lemonbush hard by the wall richard quite beyond himself exploded with his story and so was sobered while gaston made his comments he instead of listening made comments of his own dear lord richard said gaston reasonably if you do not know bertran by this time it is a strange thing and a pitiful thing for it shows you without any wit he was appointed it would seem to be the thorn in your rosebed of anjou what has he done since he was let be made but set you all by the ears what did he do by the young king but miserably what by geoffrey is there a man in the world he hates more than the old king yes there is one you take a token the last time they two met was in this very castle and then the king your father kissed him and forgiving him henrys death gave him back his autafort and bertran too gave a kiss that love might abound judas judas and what did judas next dear richard let us think awhile but not here let us go to limoges and think with the viscount but let us by all means kill bertran de born first during this speech which had much to recommend it richard as i have told you did his thinking by himself he always cooled as suddenly as he boiled over and now warily regarding the right hand and the left of this monstrous fable he saw that though saintpol might have played fox in it another must have played goat he could not fail to remember louviers and certain horrid mysteries which had offended him then with only vague disgust as for matters which were outside his own care now they all took shape satyric like hideous heads thrust out of the dark to loll their tongues at him to the shock of his first dismay succeeded the onset of rage white and cold and deadly as a night frost eh but he would meet his teeth in some throat but he would go slowly to work clear the ground and stalk his prey the leopard devises creeping death he made up his mind gaston he sent to the south to angoulesme to perigord to auvergne to cahors the horn must be heard at the head of every brown valley the armed men shadow every white road he himself went to his city of poietiers bertran de born saw him go and rubbed his hair till it stood like reeds shaken by the wind whether he loved mischief or not and some say he breathed it whether he had a grudge against anjou not yet assuaged whether he was in league with prince john or had indeed thought to do prince richard a service let philosophers experts of mankind determine if he had a turn for dramatics he had certainly indulged it now and given himself strong meat for a new sirvente of kings at least he was very busy after richards departure himself preparing for a long journey to the south chapter vi fruits of the tenzon the back of saintpol and the front of montferrat count richard found time while he was at poietiers awaiting the aquitanian levies to write six letters to jehane saintpol of these some with their bearers fell by the wayside as luck would have it jehane received but two the first and the last the first said i am in the way of liberty but by a red road have hopes of me jehane was long in answering one may picture the poor soul taking the dear and wicked thing into the little chapel laying it on the altarstone warm from her vest restoring it after office done to that haven whence she must banish its writer fortified she replied with alas my lord the way of liberty leads not to me nor can i serve you otherwise than in bonds i pray you make my yoke no heavieryour servant in little ease jehane this wistful unhappy letter gave him heartache he could scarcely keep himself at home yet he must being as yet sure of nothing he replied in a second and third a fourth and a fifth letter which never reached her the last was sent when he had begun what he thought fit to do at tours saying i make war but the cause is righteous never misjudge me jehane there were many reasons why she should not answer this returning to his deeds at poietiers i pick up the story from the abbot milo whom he found there the count you may judge kept his own counsel milo was his confessor but at this time richard was not in a confessing humour therefore milo had to gather scandal as he could there was very little difficulty about this in the city of tours he writes in those middle days of advent it appears that rumour still gadding was adrift with names almost too high for the writing there were many there who had no business the count of blois for instance the baron of chateaudun the fighting bishop of durham i fear a hireling shepherd geoffrey talebot hugh of saintcirc one reason of this was that king henry was in england not yet come to an agreement with the french king nor likely to it if what we heard was true yea or a tenth part of it god forbid that i should write what these ears heard but this i will say it was i who told the shocking tale to my lord richard adding also this hint that his former friend was involved in it eudo count of saintpol if you will believe me not the tale of iniquity moved him but he received it with shut mouth and eyes fixed upon mine but at the name of the count of saintpol he took a breath at the mention of his part in the business he took a deep breath and when he heard that this man was yet at tours he got up from his chair and struck the table with his closed fist knowing him as i did i considered that the weather looked black for saintpol next day count richard moved his hosts out of the fields by poietiers to the very borders of his country and calling a halt at saintgilles and making snug against alarms himself with my lord gaston of bearn with the dauphin of auvergne also and the viscount of beziers crossed the march into touraine and so came to tours about a week before christmas the weather being bright and frosty it seems he did not take the abbot with him for the rest of the good mans record is full of morality a certain sign that facts failed him there may have been reasons at any rate the count went into tours in a trenchant humour with ears keen and wide for all shreds of report and he got enough and to spare in the wet marketplace on the flags of the great churchyard by the pillars of the nave in the hall in the chambers in the inngalleries wherever men met or women whispered in each others necks there flew the names of alois king philips sister and of king henry count richards father richard made short work short and dry it was in midhall in the bishops palace one day after dinner that he met and stopped the count of saintpol what now beau sire says the count out of breath richards eyes were alight this says he that you lie in your throat count eudo looked about him and everywhere saw the faces of men risen from the board intent on him strange words beau sire says he very white richard raised his voice till the metal rang in it but not strange doing i think on your part this has been going on how long saintpol was stung ah it becomes you very ill to reproach me my lord i think it becomes me excellently said richard you have lied for a vile purpose you have disgraced your name you seek to drive me by slander whither i may not go in honour you lie like a broker you are a shameful liar no man could stand this from another however great that other and saintpol was not a coward he looked up at his adversary still white but steady how then he asked him how then if i lie not count of poictou and how if you know that i lie not then said richard you use insult which is worse saintpol took off his glove of mail and flung it with a clatter on the floor since it has come to this my lord richard spiked the glove with his sword tossed it to the hammerbeams of the roof and caught it as it fell it shall come nearer count i take it thus he finished the others phrase then stalked out of the bishops house it was then and there that he wrote to jehane that sixth letter which she received i make war but the cause is righteous never misjudge me jehane the end of it was a combat a outrance in the meads by the loire with all tours on the walls to behold it richard was quite frank about the part he proposed to himself the man must die he told the dauphin of auvergne even though he have spoken the truth as to that i am not sure i am not yet informed but he is not fit to live on any ground by these slanders of his he has disgraced the name and outraged the honour of the most lovely lady in the world whose truest misfortune is to be his sister by the same token i must punish him for the dignity of the lady i am at present designed to wed she is always the daughter of his liegelord whathe threw his head upis not a daughter of france worth a broken back tudieu yes says the dauphin but it is a stoutish back richard it is a back which ranks high kings clap it familiarly conrad of montferrat calls it a cousins back the emperor has embraced it at an easter fair i would as soon break conrads back as his dauphin believe me richard replied but conrad has said nothing and there is another reason i have thought myself of a reason against it the dauphin said quickly yet with a flutter of timidity this mans name is saintpol richard grew bleak in a moment that he said is why i shall kill him he seeks to drive us to marriage injurious beast his name is pandarus then he left the dauphin and shut himself up until the day of battle they had formed lists in the loire meads a red pavilion with leopards upon it for the count of poictou a blue pavilion streaked with basilisks in silver for the count of saintpol the crowd was very great for the city was full of people in the tribune the king of englands throne was left empty save for a drawn sword but one sat beside it as arbiter for the day of life and death and that was prince john richards brother by richard summoned from paris and most unwillingly there bishop hugh of durham sat next him and marvelled to see the sweat glisten on his forehead on a day when all the world else felt the north wind to their bones are you suffering dear lord eh bishop hugh bishop hugh this is a mad day for me by god thought hugh of durham and so it might prove my man they blew trumpets and at the second sounding saintpol the challenger rode out on a big grey horse himself in a hauberk of chain mail with a coif of the same and a casque wherein three grey herons feathers this was the badge of the house jehane wore herons feathers he had a blue surcoat and blue housings for his horse behind him esquire of honour rode the young amadeus of savoy carrying his banner a white basilisk on a blue field saintpol was a burly man bearing his honours squarely on breast and back they sounded for the count of poictou who came presently out of his tent and lightly swung himself into the saddlea feat open to very few men armed in mail as he came cantering down the long lists no man could fail to mark the size and splendid ease he had but some said he is younger by five years than saintpol and not so stout a man he had a red plume above his leopard crest a white surcoat over his hauberk with three red leopards upon it his shield was of the same blazon so also the housings of his horse the dauphin of auvergne carried his banner the two men came together saluted with ceremony then turned with spears uplift to the tribune the throned sword the sweating prince beside it this one now rose up and caught at his chair to give the signal oh richard of anjou do thou on the body of saintpol what thy faith requires of thee and do thou eudo uphold the right thou hast in the name of god in trinity and of our lady the bishop of tours blessed them both and the issue they wheeled apart and the battle began it was short three careers long at the first shock richard unhorsed his man at the second he unhelmed him with a deep fleshfurrow in the cheek at the third he drove down horse and man together and broke the counts back saintpol never moved again the moment it was over in the silence of all prince john came down from the tribune and fell upon richards neck oh dearest brother cried he what should i have done if the worst had befallen you i cannot bear to think of it oh brother richard said very quietly i think you would have borne it very well you would have married madame alois and paid for a mass or two for me out of the dowry this raking shot was heard by everybody john grew red as fire why what do you mean richard he stammered and richard are my words so encumbered think them over get them by heart so doing be pleased to ride with me to paris at this the colour left johns face ah to paris he looked as if he saw death under a bush that is where we must go said richard so soon as we have prayed for that poor blind worm on the ground who now haply sees wherein he has offended conrad of montferrat cousin of this dead is there richard said the other with intention but richard laughed in a very good hour we shall find him i have to give him news of his cousin saintpol what is he there for it is in the matter of the kingdom of jerusalem he seeks sibylla and that crown and is like to get them i think not john i think not we will fill his head with other thoughts we will set it wanting mine your chance is a fair one yet brother prince john laughed but not comfortably your tongue bites richard pooh says richard what else are you worth i save my teeth and went his ways in paris richard repaired to the tower of his kinsman the count of angoulesme but his brother to the abbey of saintgermain the poictevin herald bore word to king philipaugustus on richards part prince john as i suppose bore his own word whither he had most need for it to go it is believed that he contrived to see madame alois in private and if that great purple cape that held him in talk for nearly an hour by a windy corner of the preauxclercs did not cover the back of montferrat then gossip is a liar richard for his part took no account of john and his shifts a wave of disgust for the creeping youth had filled the stronger man and having got him into paris there seemed nothing better to do with him than to let him alone but that sensitive gorge of richards was one of his worst enemies if he did not mean to hold the snake in the stick he had better not have cleft the stick as for john and his writhing i am only half concerned with them but let me tell you this whatever he did or did not sprang not from hatred of this or that man but from fear or from love of his own belly every prince of the house of anjou loved inordinately some member of himself some a noble member nobly and others basely a base member if john loved his belly richard loved his royal head but enough to be done with all this richard was summoned to the french king hotfoot within a day or two of his coming went immediately with his chaplain anselm and other one or two and was immediately received he had in fact obeyed in such haste that he found two in the audiencechamber instead of one with philip of france was conrad of montferrat a large pale ruminating italian full of bluster and thick blood the french king was a youth just the age of jehane of the thin sharp blackandwhite mould into which had run the dregs of capet he was smoothfaced like a girl and had no need to shave his lips were very thin set crooked in his face so far as he was boy he loved and admired richard so far as he was capet he distrusted him with all the rest of the world richard knelt to his suzerain and was by him caught up and kissed philip made him sit at his side on the throne this put montferrat who was standing sadly out of countenance for he considered himself as perhaps he was the superior of any man uncrowned it seems that some news had drifted in on the west wind richard oh richard the king began half whimsical and half vexed what have you been doing in touraine fair sire answered richard i have been doing what will i fear give pain to our cousin montferrat i have been breaking the back of the count of saintpol at this the marquess suffused with dark blood till he was colour of lead broke out pointing his finger as well as his words as the bilgewater jets from a ketch when the hold is surcharged so did the marquess jet his expletives ha sire ha king of france now give me leave to break this brigands back who robs and reviles in one breath touch of the gospel is it to be borne foaming with rage he lunged forward a step or two his hand upon his long sword richard slowly got up from the throne and stood his full height marquess you use words i will not hear king philip broke infair lords sweet lords but richard put his hand up having a kingly way with him which even kings observed dear sirehis voice was level and coollet me say my whole mind before the marquess recovers his the count of saintpol for beastly reasons spoke in my hearing either true things or false things concerning madame alois if they were true i was ready to die if they were false i hope he was believing them false i had punished one man for them before but he had them from saintpol therefore i called saintpol a liar and other proper things this gave him occasion to save his credit at the risk of his back he broke the one and i the other now i will hear the marquess the marquess tugged at his sword and i count of poictou but king philip held out his sceptre he too very much a king and we count of poictou he said command you by your loyalty to tell us what saintpol dared say of our sister dame alois although his thin boys voice quavered he seemed the more royal for the human weakness richard was greatly moved thawed in a moment god forgive me philip but i cannot tell thee pity broke up his tones the young king almost whimpered oh richard what is this but richard turned away his face it was now the chance of the great italian now listen king philip he said grim and square and listen you count of poictou whose account is to be quieted presently of this business i happen to know something if it serve not your honour i cannot help it it serves my murdered cousins honourtherefore listen richards head was up peace hound he said and the marquess snarled like an old dog but philip with a quivering lip put out his hand till it touched richards shoulder i must hear it richard he said richard put his arm round the lads neck so the marquess told his story at the end of it richard dared look down into philips marred eyes then he kissed his forehead and oh philip says he let him who is hardy enough to tell this tale believe it and let us who hear it do as we must but now you understand why i made an end of saintpol and why by heaven and earth i will make an end of this brass pot he turned upon montferrat with his teeth bare conrad conrad conrad he cried terribly mark your goings about this slippery world for if when i get you alone i do not send you quick into hell may i go down myself beyond redemption of the church that you will surely do my lord says the marquess of montferrat greatly disturbed if i get you there also i shall be reasonably entertained for a short time richard answered already cooled and ashamed of his heat then king philip dismissed the marquess and as soon as he was rid of him jumped into richards arms and cried his heart away richard who was fond of the youth comforted him as well as he was able but on one point was a rock he would not hear the word marriage until he had seen the lady oh richard marry her quick marry her quick so we can face the world the young king had blubbered thinking that course the simplest answer to the affront upon his house it did not seem so simple to the count or rather it seemed too simple by half in his private mind he knew perfectly well that he could not marry madame alois so for that matter did king philip by this time i must see alois philip i must see her alone was all richard had to say and really it could not be gainsaid he went to her after proper warning and saw the truth the moment he had view of her then also he knew that he had really seen it before that white furtive creeping girl from whose loose hair peered out a pair of haunted eyes that drooped thing backing against the wall feeling for it flat against it with open shocked mouth astare but seeing nothing the whole truth flared before him monstrously naked he loathed the sight of her but had to speak her smoothly princess he said and came forward to touch her hand but she slipped away from him crouching to the wall the torment of breath in her bosom was bad to see touch me not count of poictou she whispered the words and then moaned o god what will become of me madame said richard rather dry god may answer your question since he knows all things but certainly i cannot unless you first tell me what has hitherto become of you she steadied herself by the wall her palms flat upon it and leaned her body forward like one who searches in a dark place then shaking her head she let it fall to her breast is there any sorrow like my sorrow says she to herself as though he had not been there richard grew stern so asked in his agony the son of high god he reproved her if you dare ask him that in his own words your sorrow must be deep she said it is most deep but his said richard was bitter shame she said and mine is bitter but his was undeserved he spoke scorn so then she lifted up her head and with eyes most piteous searched his face but mine richard she said but mine is deserved the hearing is pertinent said richard as a son and man affianced it touches me pretty close out of the hot and desperate struggle for breath sounds came from her but no words but she ran forward blindly and kneeling caught him by the knees he could not but find pity in his heart for the witless poor wretch who seemed to be fighting not with regret nor for need of his pity but with some maggot in the brain which drove her deeper into the fiery centre of the storm richard did what he could a religious man himself he pointed her to the christ on the wall but she waved it out of sight shook her wild hair back and clung to him still asking some unguessed mercy with her eyes and sobbing breath god help this tormented soul for i cannot he prayed and said aloud i will call your women let me go so he tried to undo her hands but she clenched her teeth together and held on with frenzy whining grunting like some pounded animal dumbly they strove together for a little panting space of time ah but you shall let me go he said then much distressed and forcibly unknotted her mad hands she fell back upon her heels and looked up at him such hopeless grinning misery he had never seen on a face before he was certain now that she was out of her wits yet once again she brushed her hands over her face as he had seen her do before like one who sweeps gossamers away on autumn mornings and though she was all in a shiver and shake with the fever she had she found her voice at last ah thanks ah my thanks o christ my saviour she sighed o sweet saviour christ now i will tell him all the truth if he had listened to her then it had been well for him but he did not the struggle had fretted him likewise if she was mad he was maddened he got angry where he should have been most patient the truth by heaven he snapped ah if i have not had enough of this truth and so he left her shuddering as he went down the long corridor he heard shriek after shriek and then the scurrying of many feet turning he saw carried lights women running the sounds were muffled they had her safe richard went to his house over the river and slept for ten hours chapter vii of the crackling of thorns under pots just as no two pots will boil alike so with men they seethe in trouble with a difference with one the grief is taken inly this was richards kind the french king was feverish the marquess explosive john of england all eyes and alarms so richards remedy for trouble was action philips counsel the marquesss a glut of hatred and johns plotting the consequence is that in the present vexed state of things richard threw off his discontent with his bedclothes and at once took the lead of the others because it could be done at once he declared open war against the king his father despatching heralds with the cartel the same day he gave king philip to understand that the french power might be for him or against him as seemed fitting but that no power in heaven or on earth would engage him to marry dame alois king philip still clinging to his friend made a treaty of alliance with him against henry of england that done sealed and delivered richard sent for his brother john brother he said i have declared war against my father and philip is to be of our party in his name and my own i am to tell you that one of two things you must do you may stay in our lands or leave them but if you stay you must sign our treaty of alliance too definite for john all this he asked for time and richard gave him till nightfall at dusk he sent for him again john chose to stay in paris then richard thought he would go home to poictou the moment his back was turned began various closetings of the magnates left behind with which i mean to fatigue the reader as little as possible one such chamberbusiness i must record to paris in the black february weather came pelting the young count eustace now by his brothers death count of saintpol misfortune they say makes of one a man or a saint of eustace saintpol it had made a man after his homage done this youth still kneeling his hands still between philips hands looked fixedly into his sovereigns face and a boon fair sire he said a boon to your new man what now saintpol asked king philip sire he said my sisters marriage is in you i beg you to give her to messire gilles de gurdun a good knight of normandy that is a poor marriage for her saintpol said the king considering and a poor marriage for me by saint mary why should i enrich the king of england with whom i am at war you must give me reason for that i will give you this reason said young saintpol it is because that devil who slew my brother will have her else king philip said why i can give her to one who will hold her fast your gurdun is a norman you say well but count richard in a little while will have him under his hand and how are you served then i doubt sire replied saintpol moreover there is this if it please you to hear it when the count of poictou repudiated as he most villainously did my sister he himself gave her to gurdun but i fear him lest seeing her any others he should take her again what is this man asked king philip sire he writes letters to my sister that he is a free man and she keeps them by her and often reads them in secret so she was caught but lately by my lady aunt reading one in bed the kings brow grew very black for though he knew that richard would never marry madame he did not choose but resented that any other should know it at this moment montferrat came in and stood by his kinsman ah sire said he in those bloodhound tones of his give us leave to deal in this business with free hands what would you do in it marquess asked the king fretfully kill him by god said the marquess and young saintpol added give us his life o lord king king philip thought he was fresh from making a treaty with richard but that was in a war of requital only and would be ended so soon as the last drop had been drained from the old king what would follow the war he was by this time cooler towards richard very much vexed at what he had just heard he could not help remembering that marriage with alois would have been the proper reply to scandalous report should he be able when the war was done to squeeze richard into marriage or an equivalent in lands he wondered he doubted greatly on the other hand if he and richard could crush old henry and saintpol afterwards bruise richardwhy what was philip but a gainer chewing the fringe of his mantle as he considered this and thatif i give madame jehane in marriage to your gurdun he said dubiously what will gurdun do saintpol named the sum a fair one but what part will he take in the quarrel asked the king he will take my part as he is bound sire pest cried philip let us get at it what is this part of yours the part of him who has a bloodfeud my lord said young saintpol and the marquess said that is my part also have it according to your desires my lords then said king philip i give you this marriage make it as speedily as may be but let not count richard have news until it is done there is a fire i tell you hidden in that tall man remember this too saintpol you shall not make war on the side of england against richard for that will be against me your feud must wait its turn for this present i have an account to settle in which poictou is on my side marquess you likewise are in my debt see to it that you give my enemies no advantage the marquess and his cousin gave their words holding up the hilts of their swords before their faces richard in his city of poictiers was calmly forwarding his plans his first act since he now considered himself perfectly free had been to send gaston of bearn with letters to saintpollamarche his second seeing no reason why he should wait for king philip or any possible ally to cross the frontier of touraine in force he took castle after castle in that rich land clearing the way for the investiture of tours which was his first great objective i leave him at this employment and follow gaston on his way to the north it was early in march when that young man started squally dusty weather but perfect trobador as he was the nature of his errand warmed him he composed a whole nosegay of scented songs in honour of richard and the crocushaired lady of the march who wore the broad girdle riding as he did through the realm of france by chateaudun chartres and pontoise he narrowly missed eustace of saintpol who was galloping the opposite way upon an errand dead opposed to his own gaston would have fought him of course but would have been killed to a certainty for saintpol rode as became his lordship with a company and the other was alone he was spared any such mischance however and arrived in the highest spirits with an alba song of the dawn for what he supposed to be jehanes window it shows what an eye he had for a ladys chamber that he was very nearly right a lady did put her head out not jehane but a rockfaced matron of vast proportions with grey hair plastered to her cheeks behold behold the dawn my tender heart breathed gaston out you cockerel said the old lady and gaston wooed her in vain it appeared that she was an aunt sworn to the service of the count and had jehane safe in a tower under lock and key gaston retired into the woods to meditate there he wrote five identic notes to the prisoner the first he gave to a boy whom he found birdsnesting take a turtles nest sweet boy said gaston to my lady jehane say it is firstfruits of the year and win a silver piece beware of an old lady with a jaw like a flatiron the second he gave to a woodman tying billets for the castle ovens the third a maid put in her placket and he taught her the fourth by heart in a manner quite his own and very much to her taste with the fifth he was most adroit he demanded an interview with the duenna whose name was dame gudule she accorded gaston spilled his very soul out before her he knelt to her he kissed her large velvet feet the lady was touched i mean literally for gaston as he stooped fitted his fifth note into the braid of her ample skirt the only one to arrive was the boys in the birds nest the boy wanted his silver piece and got it so jehane had another note to cherish but she had to answer it first it said vera copia ma mye i set on to the burden you gave me but it failed of breaking my back i have punished some of the wicked and have some still to punish when this is done i shall come to you wait for me i regret your brothers death he deserved it the fight was fair learn of me from gastonrichard of anjou her answer was leaping in her heart she led the boy to the window look down boy and tell me what you can see dame said the boy i see the moat and ducks on it look again dear and tell me what you see i see an old fish on his back he is dead jehane laughed quietly he has been there many days tell the knight who sent you to stand thereabout looking up tell him not to be there at any hour save that of mass or vespers will you do this dear boy certain sure said the boy jehane gave him money and a kiss then fastened herself to the window gaston excelled in pantomime every day for a week he saw jehane at her window and enacted many strange plays he showed her the old king stormy in his tent the meagre white unrest of alois the outburst at autafort and bertran de born with his tongue out the meeting at tours the battle the death of the count her brother he was admirable on richards lovedesires there could be no doubt at all about them pricked by his feats in this sort jehane overcame her reserve and turned her members into marionettes she puffed her cheeks hung her head scowled upwards there was gilles de gurdun to the life she looped finger and thumb of the right hand and pierced them with the ring finger ohe her fate gaston in reply to this drew his sword and ran a cypresstree through the body jehane shook a sorrowful head but he waved all such denials away with a hand so expressive that jehane broke the window and leaned her body out gaston uttered a cheerful cry have no fear lovely prisoner if that is his intention he is gone i kill him it is arranged my brother eustace is in paris says jehane in a low but carrying voice to get my marriage from the king again i say fear nothing gaston cried but jehane strained out as far as she could you must go away from here the window is broken now and they will find me out take a message to my lord if he is free indeed he knows me his in life or death i seek to do him service wed or unwed what is that to me i am still jehane your name is red heart and golden rose and loiale amye farewell star of the north said gaston on his knees i seek this gurdun of yours he found him after some days perilous prowling of the norman march gilles had received the summons of his duke to be vi et armis at rouen a little later gaston might have met him in the field of broad battle but such delay was not to his mind he met him instead in a woodland glade near gisors alone by a great chance sword on thigh beef thou diest said the bearnais peaking his beard gilles made no reply that can be written for what letters can shape a norman grunt perhaps wauch comes nearest they fought on horseback with swords from noon to sunset and having hacked one another out of the similitude of men there was nothing left them to do but swoon side by side on the sodden leaves in the morning gaston unclogging one eye perceived that his enemy had gone no matter said the spent hero to himself i will wait till he comes back and have at him again he waited an unconscionable time a month in fact during which he delighted to watch the shy oncoming of a northern spring so different from the sudden flooding of the south he found the woodsorrel he measured the crosiers of the brake and saw the blue mist of the hyacinth carpet the glades all this charmed him quite until he learned by hazard that the sieur de gurdun was to be married to dame jehane saintpol on palm sunday in the church of saint sulpice of gisors god ha mercy he thought with a stab at the heart there is merely time he rode south on the winds wings chapter viii how they held richard off from his fathers throat long before the pink flush on the almond announced the earth a bride on all gaulish roads had been heard the tramp of armed men the ring of steel on steel this new war splintered gaul aquitaine held for richard who though he had quelled and afterwards governed that great duchy with an iron whip had made himself respected there so the count of provence sent him a company the count of toulouse and dauphin of auvergne each brought a company from perigord from bertram count of roussillon from bearn and for reasons from the wise king of navarre came pikemen and slingers and longbowmen and knights with their esquires and bannerbearers the duke of burgundy and count of champagne came from the east to fill the battles of king philip in the west the countess of brittany sent about the wartorch all the extremes of gaul were in arms against the red old angevin who sat at her heart who was now still snarling in england and sending message after secret message to his son john that same john alone in paris headed no spears partly because he had none of his own partly because he dared not declare himself openly he had taken a side driven by his vehement brother for the first time in his life he had put pen to parchment god knew he thought that was committal enough so he stayed in paris shifting his body about to get comfort as the winds veered nobody inquired of him least of all his brother richard who beyond requiring his signature cared little what he did with his person this was characteristic of richard he would drive a man into a high place and then forget him reminded of his neglect he would shrug and say yes but he is a fool insufficient answer he did not see or did not choose to see that there are two sorts of fools stranded on his peak one man might be fool enough to stop there another to try a descent prince john no fool either was of this second quality how he tried to get down and where else he tried to go will be made clear in time you and i must go to the war in the west war showed count richard entered into his birthright as a strategist he was superb the best of his time what his eye took in his mind snapped uplike a steel gin and his eye was the true soldiers eye comprehending by signs investing with life what was tongueless else over great stretches of barren countrythat limitless land of francehe could see massed men on the move creeping forward in snaky columns spread fanwise from clump to woody clump here camping snugly under the hill there lining the river bluffs with winged death checked here helped there by a moraineas well as you or i may foresee the conduct of a chessboard he omitted nothing judged times and seasons reckoned defences at their worth knew all the fordable places by the lie of the land timed cavalry and infantry to rendezvous forestalled communications provided not only for his own base but against the enemys all this of course without maps and very much against the systems of his neighbours it was thus he had outwitted the heady barons of aquitaine when little more than a lad and had turned the hill forts into deathtraps against their tenants he had the secret of swift marching by night of delivering assault upon assault so that while you staggered under one blow you received another full he could be as patient as death that inchmeal stalker of his prey he could be as ruthless as the sea and incredibly generous upon occasion to the men he led he was a father known and beloved as such it was as a ruler they found him too lonely to be loved in war he was the very footboys friend personally when the battles joined he was rash to a fault but so blithe so ready and so gracefully strong that to think of wounds upon so bright a surface was an impiety no one did think of them he seemed to play with danger as a cat with whirling leaves i have seen him milo writes somewhere ride into a serry of knights singing throwing up and catching again his great sword gaynpayn then all of a sudden stiffen as with a gush of sap in his veins dart his head forward gather his horse together under him and fling into the midst of them like a tiger into a herd of bulls one saw nothing but tossing steel yet richard ever emerged red but scatheless on the further side upon this man the brunt of war fell naturally having begun he did not hold his hand by the beginning of february he had laid his plans by the end of it he had taken saumur cut angers off from tours and turned all the valley of the loire into a scorched cinderbed in the early days of march he sat down before tours with his siegeengines petraries mangonels and towers and daily battered at the walls with intent to reduce it before the war was really afloat the city of saint martin was doomed no help from anjou could save it for none could come that way meantime the king his father had landed at honfleur assembled his normans at rouen and was working his way warily down through the duchy feeling for the french on his left and for the bretons on his right he never found the french they were far south of him pushing through orleans to join richard at le mans but the countess of brittanys men under hugh of dinan were sacking avranches when old henry heard the bad news from touraine that country and maine were as the apple of his eye yet he dared not leave avranches fated behind him all he could do was to send william the marshal with a small force into anjou while he himself spread out westward to give hugh of dinan battle and save avranches if that might be so it was that king philip slipped in between him and le mans by this time richard was master of tours and himself on the way to le mans nosing the air for william the marshal this was in the beginning of april then on one and the same day he risked all he had won for the sake of a girls proud face and nearly lost his life into the bargain he had to cross the river aune above la fleche that river a sluggish but deep little stream moves placidly among osiers on its way to swell the loire on either side the watermeadows stretch for threequarters of a mile low chalkhills fringed at the top are ramparts to the sleepy valley creeping along the eastern spurs at dawn richard came in touch with his enemy william the marshal and his force of normans and english these had crossed the bridge at la fleche and came pricking now up the valley to save le mans heading them boldly richard threw out his archers like a waterspray over the flats and while these checked the advance and had the van in confusion thundered down the slopes with his knights caught the marshal on the flank smote him hip and thigh and swept the core of his army into the river the marshals battle was thus destroyed but the wedge had made too clean a cleft front and rear joined up and held so richard found himself in danger the viscount of beziers who led the rearguard engaged the enemy and pushed them slowly back towards the aune richard wheeled his men and charged to take them in the rear his horse stumbling on the rotten ground fell badly and threw him there were cries hola count richard is down and some stayed to rescue and some pushed on william the marshal on a white horse came suddenly upon him as he lay mort de dieu shrilled this good soldier and threw up his spear arm gods feet marshal kill one or other of us said richard lightly he was pinned down by his struggling beast i leave you to the devil my lord richard said the marshal and drove his spear into the horses chest the beasts deathplunge freed his master richard jumped up even on foot his head was level with the riders shield have at you now he cried but the marshal shook his head and rode after his flying men the day was with poictou le mans must fall it fell but not yet nor did richard see it fall gaston of bearn joined his master the next day hasten hasten fair lord he cried out as soon as he saw him richard looked as if he had never known the word what news of normandy gaston the english are through richard the country swarms with them they hold avranches and now are moving south they are too late said richard tell me what message you have from the fairgirdled wed or unwed she is yours but she is kept in a tower until palm sunday then they bring her out and marry her to what remains of a black normandy pig not very much remains but they tell me enough for the purpose spine of god said richard examining his fingernails swear by his heart rather my count gaston said for you have a red heart in your keeping eh eh what a beautiful person is there she leaned her body out of the windowwhat a shape that girdle confines bowered roses dian and the nymphs bosomed familiars of old pan and what emerald fires what molten hair the words came shortly from her and brokenly as if her carved lips disdained such coarse uses richard her words were so take a message to my lord quoth she i am his in life or death i seek to do him service wed or unwed what is that to me i am still jehane thus shebut i well well my sword spake for me when i carved that beefbone bare the bearnais pulled his goatee and looked at the ends of it for split hairs but richard sat very still do you know gaston whom you have seen he said presently in a trembling whisper perfectly well said the other i have seen a pale flower ripe for the sun you have seen the countess of poictou gaston said richard and took to his prayers through these means for the time he was held off his fathers throat but for jehane and her urgent affairs these two had grappled at le mans as it was not richards hand was to fire the cradlecity which had seen king henry at the breast before nightfall he had made his dispositions for a very risky business he set aside the viscount of beziers bertram count of roussillon gaston of bearn to go with him not because they were the best men by any means but so that he might leave the best men in charge these were certainly the dauphin the viscount of limoges and the count of angoulesme each of whom he had proved as an enemy in his day gentlemen he said to these three i am about to go upon a journey of you i shall require a little attention certain patience exact obedience it will be necessary that you be before the walls of le mans in three days invest them my lords keep up your communications and wait for the french king give no battle offer no provocation let hunger do your affair i know where the king of england is and shall be with you before him he went on to be more precise but i omit the details it was difficult for them to go wrong but if the truth is to be known he was in a mood which made him careless about that he was free he was going on insensate adventure but he saw his road before him once again like a long avenue of light which jehane made for him with a torch uplifted before it was day armed from head to foot in chain mail with a plain shield and a doublebladed norman axe in his saddlebucket he and his three companions set out on their journey they rode leisurely with loose reins and much turning in the saddle to talk as if for a meet of the hounds now was that vernal season of the year when winds are boon the gentle rain never far off the stars in heaven like the flowers on earth washed momently to a freshness which urges men to be pure riding day and night through the green breadth of france though he had been plucked from the roaring pit of war richard i know went with a single aim before himto see jehane again nothing else in his heart i say whatever purpose may have lurked in his mind in heart he went clean single in desire chanting the canticles of mary and the virgin saints it was so he had been seethed in wicked doings from his boyhoodi give him you no better than he was wild work in poictou the scour of hot blood devils work in touraine riotous work in paris tyrannous in aquitaine he had been blown upon by every ill report hatred against blood blasphemy against gods appointment violence clamour scandal against charitable dealing all these were laid to his name he had behind him a file of dead ancestors cutthroats and worse he had faced unnameable sin and not blenched laughed where he should have wept promised and broken his promise to be short he had been a creature of his house and time too young acquainted with pride and too proud himself to deny it but now with eyes alight like a boys because his heart was uplift he was riding between the newbudded woods the melodies of a singingboy on his lips and swaying before his hearts eye the figure of a tall girl with green eyes and a sulky beautiful mouth lord what is man cried the psalmist in dejection lord what is man not cry we who know more of him his traverse took him four days and nights he rested at la ferte at nogentlerotrou outside dreux and at rosny here he stayed a day the vigil of the feast of palms he had it in his mind not to see jehane again until the very moment when he might lose her chapter ix wild work in the church of gisors when in march the chase is up and the hunting wind searches out the fallow places of the earth love also comes questing desire is awake man seeks maid and maid seeks to be sought if man or maid have loved already the case is worse we hear love crying but cannot tell where he is how or with what honesty to let him in all those ranging days jehanewhether in bed cuddling her letters or at the window of her tower watching with brimmed eyes the pairing of the birdsshowed a proud front of sufferance while inly her heart played a wild tune not a crying girl nor one capable of any easy utterance she could do no more than stand still and wonder why she was most glad when most wretched she ought to have felt the taint to love the man who had slain her brother she might have known despair she did neither she sat or stood or lay in her bed and pressed to her heart with both hands the words that said never doubt me jehane or ma mye i shall come to you when he came as he surely would he would find her a wifeah let him come let him come in his time so only she saw him again march went out in dusty squalls and april came in to the sound of the young lambs bleat willowpalm was golden in the hedges when the king of englands men filled normandy and gilles de gurdun having been healed of his wounds rode towards rouen at the head of his levy he went not without an understanding with saintpol that he should have his sister on palm sunday in the church of gisors they could not marry at saintpollamarche because gilles was on his service and might not win so far nor could they have married before he went because of his illtreatment at the hands of the bearnais of this gilles had made light he got worse than he gave he told saintpol i left him dead in the wood would you see jehane gilles saintpol had asked him before he went out she is in her turret as meek as a mouse time enough for that said gilles quietly she loves me not but i eustace love her so hot that i have fear of myself i think i will not see her as you will said saintpol farewell in gisors then a walled town trembling like a captive at the knees of a huge castle there was a long grey church which called saint sulpice lord it stood in a little square midway between the south gate and the citadel a narrow oblong place where they held the cattle market on tuesdays flagged and planted with pollardlimes the west door of saint sulpice resting on a stepped foundation formed a solemn end to this humble space and the great gable flanked by turrets threatened the huddled tenements of the craftsmen on this morning of palm sunday the shaven crowns of the limes were budded gold and pink the sky a fair seablue over gisors with a scurrying fleece of clouds like foam the poplars about the meadows were in their first flush all the quicksets veiled in green the town was early afoot for the wedding party of the sieur de gurdun was to come in and gurdun belonged to the archbishop and the archbishop to the duke the bride also was reported unwilling which added zest to the public appetite for her known beauty some knew for truth that she was the castoff mistress of a very great man driven into gurduns arms to dispose of scandal and of her eh the minion said certain sniggering old women to whom this was told shell not find so soft a lap at gurdun but others said gurdun is the dukes and will one day be the dukes sons what will sieur gilles do then with his straining wife you cannot keep your hawk on the cadge for everah nor hood her for ever and so on all this points to some public excitement the town gate was opened full early the booths about it did a great trade at a quarter before seven sir gilles de gurdun rode in with his father on his right hand the prior of rouen on his left and half a dozen of his kindred fair and solid men all they were lightly armed clothed in soft leather without shields or any heavy warfurniture old gurdun a squarely built redfaced man like his son but with a bush of white hair all about his face and eyebrows like curved snowdrifts the prior old gurduns brothers son with a big nose long and pendulous gilles brother bartholomew and others whom it would be tedious to mention gilles himself looked well knit for the business in hand all the old women agreed that he would make a masterful husband they stabled their horses in the innyard and went into the church porch to await the brides party a trumpet at the gate announced her coming she rode on a little ambling horse beside her brother saintpol with them were the portentous old lady dame gudule william des barres a very fine french knight nicholas deu and a young boy called eloy de montluc a cousin of jehanes to bear her train the gossips at the gate called her a wooden bride others said she was like a doll a big doll and others that they read in her eyes the scorn of death she took no notice of anything or anybody but looked straight before her and followed where she was led this was straightway into the church by her brother who had her by the hand and seemed in a great hurry the marriage was to be made in the lady chapel behind the high altar twenty minutes later yet or maybe a little less there was another surging to the gate about the arrival of four knights who came posting in spattered with mud and the sweat and lather of their horses they were quite unknown to the people of gisors but seen for great men as indeed they were richard of anjou was the first of them a young man of inches incredible to gisors he had a face like king arthurs of britain says one a red face a tawny beard eyes like stones behind him were three abreast roussillon a grim dark heavyeyed man bearded like a turk beziers sanguine and looselimbed a man with a sharp tongue gaston of bearn airy hunter of fine phrases looking now like the prince of a fairytale with roving eyes all ascare for adventure the warders of the gate received them with a flourish they knew nothing of them but were certain of their degree by preconcerted action they separated there roussillon and beziers sat like statues within the gate one on each side of the way actually upon the bridge and so remained the admired of all the booths gaston like a yeomanpricker in this hunting of the roe went with richard to the edge of the covert that is to the steps of saint sulpice and stood there holding his masters horse what remained to be done was done with extreme swiftness richard alone craning his head forward stooping a little swaying his scabbarded sword in his hand went with long soft strides into the church at the entry he kneeled on one knee and looked about him from under his brows three or four masses were proceeding out of the semidarkness shone the little twinkling lights and illuminated faintly the kneeling people a priests vestment a silver chalice but here was neither marriage nor jehane he got up presently and padded down the nave kneeling to every altar as he went many an eye followed him as he pushed on and past the curtain of the ambulatory they guessed him for the wedding and so god knows he was in the shadow of a great pillar he stopped short and again went down on his knee from here he could see the business in train he saw jehane at prayer in green and white kneeling at her faldstool like a painted lady on an altar tomb he just saw the pure curve of her cheek the coiled masses of her hair which seemed to burn it all the world with the lords thereof was at his feet but this treasure which he had held and put away was denied him by his own act she was denied he had said yea when nay had been the voice of heart and head of honour and love and reason at once and now close up against her he knew that he was to forbid his own grant he knew it i say but until he saw her there he had not clearly known it go on i will show you the deeps of the man for good or bad not lust of flesh but of dominion ravened in him this woman this jehane saintpol this hothaired slip of a girl was his the leopard had laid his paw upon her shoulder the mark was still there he could not suffer any other beast of the forest to touch that which he had printed with his own mark for himself twiform is the leopard twinatured was richard of anjou dog and cat now here was all cat not the wolfs lust but the lions jealous rage spurred him to the act he could see this beautiful thing of flesh without any longing to lick or tear he could have seen the frail soul of it but halfborn sink back into the earth out of sight he could have killed jehane or made her as his mother to him but he could not see one other get that which was his his by all heaven she was when gurdun squared himself and puffed his cheeks and stood up when jehane touched by saintpol on the shoulder shivered and left staring and stood up in turn swaying a little and held out her thin hand when the priest had the ring on his book and the two hands the red and the white trembled to the touchrichard rose from his knee and stole forward with his long soft crouching stride so softly he trod that the priest old and bleareyed as he was saw him first the others had heard nothing with jehanes hand in his own the priest stopped and blinked who was this prowler afoot when all else were on their knees his jaw dropped you saw that he was toothless inarticulate sounds crackling and dry came from his throat richard had stopped too tense quivering for a spring the priest gave a prodigious sniff turned to his book looked up again the crouching man was still therebut imminent wine of jesus said the priest and dropped jehanes hand then she turned she gave a short cry the whole assembly started and huddled together as the mailed man made his spring it was done in a flash from his crouched attitude he went as it seemed at one bound that same shock drove gilles de gurdun back among his people and the same found jehane caged in a hoop of steel so he affronting and she caught up stood together for a moment with one mailed hand he held her fast under the armpit with the other he held a fidgety sword his head was thrown back through glimmering eyelids he watched themas one who says what nextbreathing short through his nose it was the attitude of the snatching lion sudden arrogant shockingly swift a gross deed done in a flash which was its wonderful beauty while the company was panting at the shockfor barely a minutehe stood thus and jehane quiet under so fierce a hold leaned not upon him but stood her own feet fairly her calm brows upon a level with his chin shameful if it was at that moment of rude conquest she had no shame and he no thought of shame nor was there much time for thought at all gurdun cried on the name of god and started forward at the same instant saintpol made a rush and with him des barres richard with jehane held close went backwards on the way he had come in his long arm and long sword kept his distance he worked them like a scythe none tackled him there though they followed him up as dogs a boar in the forest but old gurdun the father ran round the other way to hold the west door richard having gained the nave and open country as it were went swiftly down it carrying jehane with ease he found the strenuous old man before the door out of my way de gurdun he cried in a high singing voice or i shall do that which i shall be sorry for bloody thief shouted old gurdun add murder to the rest richard stretched his sword arm stiffly and swept him aside he tumbled back the crowd received himpriests choristers peasants knights all huddled together baying like dogs count richard strode down the steps alavi alavia sang gaston this is a swift marriage richard cooler than circumstances warranted set jehane on his saddle vaulted up behind her and as his pursuers were tumbling down the steps cantered over the flags into the street roussillon and beziers holding the bridge saw him come he has snatched his sabine woman said beziers humph said roussillon now for beastly war richard rode straight between them at a handgallop gaston followed close cheering his beast like a maniac then the iron pair turned inwards and rode out together taking the way he led them the way of the dark tower the wonder of gisors was all dismay when it was learned who this tall stranger was the count of poictou had ridden into his fathers country and robbed his fathers man of his wife we are ruled by devils in normandy then there was no immediate pursuit saintpol knew where to find him but as he told william des barres it was useless to go there without some force chapter x nightwork by the dark tower i chronicle wild doings in this place and have no time for the sweets of love long denied but strange as the bridal had been so the nuptials were strange one like the other played to a steel undertone when richard had his jehane at first he could not enjoy her he rode away with her like a storm the way was long the pace furious not a word had passed between them at least not a reasoned word once or twice at first he leaned forward over her shoulder and set his cheek to her glowing cheek then she as if swayed by a tide strained back to him and felt his kisses hot and eager his few and pelting words my brideat lastmy bride and the pressure of his hand upon her heart that hand knows what tune the heart drummed out mostly she sat up before him stiff as a sapling with eyes and ears wide for any hint of pursuit but he felt her tremble and knew she would be glad of him yet after all they had six burning days for a honeymoon days which made those three who with them held the tower wonder how such a match could continue richards love rushed through him like a river in flood that brims its banks and carries down bridges by its turbid mass but hers was like the sea unresting ebbing flowing without aim or sure direction as is usual with reserved persons jehanes transports far from assuaging tormented her or seemed a torment she loved uneasily by hot and cold fits now melting now dry now fierce in demand next passionate in refusal to snatch of love succeeded repulsion of love she would fling herself headlong into richards arms and sob there feverish then as suddenly struggle for release as one who longs to hide herself and finding that refused lie motionless like a woman of wax whether embraced or not out of touch with him she was desperate she could not bear that but sought unknown to him to have hold of some part of himthe edge of his tunic the tip of his sword his glovesomething she must have without it she sat quivering throbbing all over looking at him from under her brows and biting her dumb lips if at such a time as this some other addressed her the word as to free her from her anguish one would sometimes do she would perhaps answer him yes or no but nothing more usually she would shake her head impatiently as if all the world and its affairs like a cloud of flies were buzzing about her shutting out sound or sight of her richard love like this so deep outwardly still inwardly ravening because insatiable is a dreadful thing no one who saw jehane with richard in those days could hope for the poor girls happiness as for him he was more expansive not at all tortured by love master of that as of everything else he teased her after the first day pinched her ear held her by the chin he used his strange powers against her stole up on his noiseless feet caught her hands behind her held her fast and pulled her back to be kissed once he lifted her up a sure prisoner to the top shelf of a cupboard whence there was no escape but by the way she had gone she stayed there quite silent and when he opened the cupboard doors was found in the same tremulous expectant state her eyes still fixed upon him neither he nor she publicly at least discussed the past the present or future but it was known that he meant to make her his countess as soon as he could reach poictiers to the onlookers at any rate to one of them it seemed that this could never be and that she knew very well that the hours of this sharp sweet piercing intercourse were numbered how could it last how could she find either reason or courage to hope it it seemed to beziers on the watch that she was awaiting the end already one is fretted to a rag by waiting so jehane dared not lose a moment of richard yet could enjoy not one knowing that she must soon lose all those six clear days of theirs had been wiselier spent upon the west road but richards desire outmastered every thought having snatched jehane from the very horns of the altar he must hold her make her his irrevocably at the first breathing place dealing with any but normans he had never had his six days but the norman people as abbot milo says slimeblooded slowbellies are withal great eaters of beef which breeds in them as well as a heaviness of motion a certain slumbrous rage very dangerous to mankind they crop grief after grief chewing the cud of grievance for when they are full of it they disgorge and regorge the abhorred sum and have stuff for their spleens for many a year even more than this smouldering nursed hate they love a punctilio they walk by forms whether the road is to a ladys heart or an enemys throat and so saintpol found and so des barres frenchmen both and fiery young men who shook their fists in the faces of the gurduns and the dust of such blockish hospitallers off their feet when they saw the course affairs were to run gilles de gurdun if you will believe it with the advice of his father and the countenance of his young brother bartholomew would not budge an inch towards the recovery of his wife or her ravishers punishment until he had drawn out his injury fair on parchment this he then proposed to carry to his duke old king henry thus said the swart youth i shall be within the law of my land and gain the engines of the law on my side he seemed to think this important with your accursed scruples cried saintpol smiting the table you will gain nothing else within your countrys law blockhead why my sister is within the counts country by this time oh leave him leave him eustace said des barres and come with me we shall meet him in the fair way yet you and i together so the frenchmen rode away and gilles with his father and his parchments and his square forehead went to evreux where king henry then was kneeling before their duke expounding their gravamens as if they were suing out a writ of mort dancestor they very soon found out that he was no more a norman than saintpol the old king made short work of their ut predictum ests and quaesumus igiturs good sirs says he knitting his brows where is this lord who has done you so much injury my lord they report he has her in his strong tower on the plain of saintandre some ten leagues from here then cries the old king smoke him out you fools what a badger draw the thief then gilles the elder flattened his lips together and afterwards pursed them lord he said that we dare not do without your express commandment why why snaps the king if i give it you my solemn fools young gilles stood up a weighty youth lord duke he said this lord is the count of poictou your son it had been a fine sight for sinful men to see the eyes of the old king strike fire at this word his speech they tell me was terrible glutted with rage ha god he spluttered cracking his fingers so my richard is the badger ha so then i have him ha if i do not draw him myself by the face it is said that longespee a son of his by madame rosamund and geoffrey another bastard with bohun and de lacy and some more tried to hinder him in this design wherein said they he set out to be a second thyestes but they might as well have bandied words with destiny war is war said the foaming old man whether with a son or a grandmother you make it shall my enemy range the field and i sit at home and lap caudle that is not the way of my house he would by all means go that night and called for volunteers his english barons to their credit flatly refused either to entrap the son of their master or to abandon the city at a time so critical what sire cried they are private resentments like threadworms to fret the dams of the state the floods are out my lord king and brimming at the sluices be advised therefore no wearer of the cap of anjou was ever advised yet i can hear in fancy the gnashing of the old lions fangs in fancy see the foam he churned at the corners of his mouth he went out with such men as he could gather in his haste nineteen of them in all there were old gilles and young gilles with their men eight of the kings own choosing namely drago de merlou armand taillefer the count of ponthieu fulk perceforest fulk doilly gilbert fitzreinfrid ponce the bastard of caen and a butcher called rolf to whom the king mocking all chivalry gave the gilt spurs before he started he did not wear them long the nineteenth was that great king bad man and worse father henry curtmantle himself it was a very dark night without moon or stars a hot and still night wherein a man weatherwise might smell the rain the going upon the moor was none too good in a good light yet they tell me that the old king went spurring over brush and scrub over tufted roots through ridge and hollow with as much cheer as if the hunt was up in venvil wood and himself a young man when his followers besought him to take heed all he would do was snap his fingers the reins dangling loose and cry to the empty night hue brock hue as if he was baiting a badger this badger was the heir to his crown and dignity in the dark tower they heard him coming three miles away roussillon was on the battlements and came down to report horsemen on the plain lights out said richard and gave jehane a kiss as he set her down they blew out all the lights and stood two to each door no one spoke any more jehane sat by the darkened fire with a torch in her hand ready to light it when she was bid thus when the normans drew near they found the tower true to its name without a glimmer of light let alone for that said the king whose grating voice they heard above all the others very soon we will have a fire he sent some of his men to gather brushwood ling and dead bracken meantime he began to beat at the door with his axe crying like a madman richard richard thou graceless wretch come out of thy hold presently a little windowcasement opened above him gaston of bearn poked out his head beau sire he says what entertainment is this for the count your son no son of mine by the face cried the king let that woman i have caged at home answer for him who defies me for ever let me in thou sickly dog gaston said beau sire you shall come in if you will and if you come in peace says the king i will come in by god and as i will foul request king said gaston and shut the window have it as you will it shall be foul by and by the king shouted to the night he bid them fire the place to be short they heaped a woodstack before the door and set it ablaze the crackling the tossed flames the leaping light made the king drunk he and his companions began capering about the fire with linked arms hounding each other on with the cries of countrymen who draw a badgerloo loo vixen slip in lass hue brock hue hue and similar gross noises until for very shame gilles and his kindred drew apart saying to each other we have let all hell loose legion and his minions so the two companies the grievous and the aggrieved were separate and richard seeing this state of the case took roussillon and beziers out by the other door got behind the dancers attacked suddenly and drove three of them into the fire there says the chronicler the butcher sir rolf got a taste of his everlasting torments there fitzreinfrid lay and charred there ponce of caen ill born made a foul smoke as became him turning to go in again the three were confronted with the norman segregates great work ensued by the light of the fire gilles the elder was slain with an axe and if with an axe then richard slew him for he alone was so armed gilles the younger was wounded in the thigh but that was roussillons work his brother bartholomew was killed by the same terrific hitter beziers lost a finger of his sword hand and indeed the three barely got in with their lives the old king set up howling like a wolf in famine at this loss what comforted him was that the fire had eaten up the southern door and disclosed the entry of the towerjehane holding up a torch and before her gaston richard and bertram of roussillon their shields hiding their breasts lords said richard we await your leisures none cared to attack there was the fire to cross and in that narrow entry three desperate blades what could the old king do he threatened hell and death he cursed his son more dreadfully and you may take it with far less reason than almighty god cursed sodom and gomorrah cities of the plain but richard made no answer and when quite beside himself the old man leaped the fire and came hideously on to the swords the points dropped at his sons direction almost crying the king turned to his followers taillefer will you see me dishonoured where is ponthieu where is drago so at last they all attacked together coming on with their shields before them in a phalanx this was a device that needs must fail they could not drive a wedge where they could not get in the point the three defending shields were locked in the entry two men fell at the first assault and richards terrible axe crashed into perceforests skull and scattered his brains wide red and breathless work as it was it was not long adoing the king was dismayed at the killing of perceforest and dared risk no more lives at such long odds fire the other door drago he said grimly well have the place down upon them the normans were set to engage the three while others went to find fuel the viscount of beziers had had his hand dressed by jehane and was now able to take his turn it was by a ruse of his that richard got away without a life lost with jehane to help him he got the horses trapped and housed now richard he said listen to my proposals i am going to open the north door and make away before they fire it i shall have half of them after me as i reckon but whereas i shall have a good start on a fresh horse i doubt not of escape do you manage the rest there will be three of you richard approved go raimon he said we will join you on the edge of the plain this was done jehane when beziers was ready flung open the door out he shot like a bolt and she shut it behind him the old king got wind of him spurred off with five or six at his heels such as happened to be mounted richard fell back from the entry got out his horse and came forward as he came he stooped and picked up jehane who with a quick nestling movement settled into his shield arm roussillon and gaston in like manner got their horses then at a signal they drove out of the tower into the midst of the normans there was a wild scuffle richard got a side blow on the knee but in return he caught drago de merlou under the armpit and wellnigh cut him in half taillefer and gilles de gurdun set upon him together and one of them wounded him in the shoulder but taillefer got more than he gave for he fell almost as he delivered his blow and broke his jaw against a rock as for gurdun richard hurtled full into him bore him backwards and threw him also jehane safe in arms he rode over him where he lay but lastly pounding through the tussocks in the faint grey light he met his father charging full upon him intent to cut him off avoid me father he cried out by god said the king i will not i am for you traitorous beast they came together and richard heard the old mans breath roaring like a foundered horses he held his sword arm out stiffly to parry the blow the kings sword shivered and fell harmless as richard shot by him turning as he rode to be sure he had done him no more hurt he saw the wicked grey face of his father cursing him beyond redemption and that was the last living sight of it he had they got clean away without the loss of a man of theirs reached the lands of the count of perche and there found a company of sixty knights come out to look for richard with them he rode down through maine to le mans which had fallen and now held the french king richards triumphant humour carried him strange lengths as they came near to the gates of le mans now he said they shall see me like a pious knight bear my holy banner before me he made jehane stand up in the saddle in front of him he held her there firmly by one long arm so he rode in the midst of his knights through the thronged streets to the church of saintjulien jehane saintpol pillared before him like a saint the french king made much of him and to jehane was respectful prince john was there the duke of burgundy the dauphin of auvergne all the great men to richard was given the bishops house jehane stayed with the canonesses of premonstre but he saw her every day chapter xi of prophecy and jehane in the perilous bed well may the respectable abbot milo despond over this affair hear him and conceive how he shook his head o too great power of princes he writes lodged in a room too frail o wagging bladder that serves as cushion for a crown o swayed by idle breath seeming god that yet is a man man driven by windy passion that has yet to ape the gods estate because richard craved this french girl therefore he must take her as it were from the lap of her mother because he taught her his nobility which is the mere wind in a princes nose she taught him nobility again then because a prince must not be less noble than his nobles but always primus inter pares he seeing her nobly disposed gave her over to a man of her own choosing and immediately after unable to bear it that a common person should have what he had touched took her away again doing slaughter to get her to say nothing of outrage in the church last of all as you are now to hear thinking that too much handling was dishonour to the thin vessel of her body touched on the generous spot he made bad worse he added folly to force he made a marriage where none could be he made immortal enmities blocked up appointed roads and set himself to walk others with a clog on his leg better far had she been a wanton of no account a piece of dalliance a pastime a common delight she was very much other than that dame jehane was a good girl a noble girl a handsome girl of inches and bright blood but by the lord god of israel who died on the tree these virtues cost her dear all this we may take it is true the pity is that the thing promised so fair those who had not known jehane before were astonished at her capacity discretion and dignity she had a part to play at le mans where richard kept his easter which would have taxed a wiser head she moved warily a poor thing of gauze amid those great lights king philip had a tender nose a very whiff of offence might have drawn blood prince john had a shrewd eye and an evil way of using it he stroked women but they seldom liked it and never found good come of it the duke of burgundy ate and drank too much he resembled a sponge when empty too rough a customer when full too juicy it was on one of the days when he was very full that tilting at the ring he won or said he won forty pounds of richard empty he claimed them but richard discerned a rasp in his manner of asking and laughed at him the duke of burgundy took this ill he was never quite the same to richard again but he made great friends with prince john with all these and with their courtiers who took complexion from their masters jehane had to hold the fair way as a mistress who was to be a wife the veiled familiarity with which she was treated was always preaching to her how dare she be a countess who was of so little account already the poor girl felt herself doomed beforehand what kings mistress had ever been his wife and how could she be richards wife betrothed to gilles de gurdun richard was much afield in these days making military dispositions against his coming absence in poictou she saw him rarely but in return she saw his peers and had to keep her head high among the women of the french court and so she did until one day as she was walking back from mass with her ladies she saw her brother saintpol on horseback him and william des barres timidly she would have slipped by but saintpol saw her reined up his horse in the middle of the street and stared at her as if she had been less than nothing to him she felt her knees fail her she grew vividly red but she kept her way after this terrible meeting she dared not leave the convent of course she was quite safe saintpol could not do anything against the conqueror of touraine the ally of his master but she felt tainted and had thoughts not for the first time of taking the veil one woman had already taken it she heard much concerning madame alois from the canonesses how she had a little cell at fontevrault among the nuns there how she shivered with cold in the hottest sun how she shrieked o nights how chattered to herself and how she used a cruel discipline all these things working upon jehanes mind made her love an agony many and many a time when her royal lover came to visit her she clung to him with tears imploring him to cast her off again but the more she bewailed the more he pursued his end in truth he was master by this time and utterly misconceived her nothing she might say or do could stay him from his intent which was to wed and afterwards crown her countess of poictou this was to be done at pentecost as the only reparation he could make her not even what befell on the way to poictiers for this very thing could alter him again he misread her or was too full of what he read in himself to read her at all they left le mans a fortnight before pentecost with a great train of lords and ladies richard looking like a young god with the light of easy mastery shining in his eyes she poor girl might have been going to the gallowsand before the end of the journey would thankfully have gone there and no wonder listen to this midway between chatelherault and poictiers is a sandy waste covered with scrub of juniper and wild plum which contrives a living by some means between great bare rocks it is a disconsolate place believed to be the abode of devils and other damned spirits now as they were riding over this desert picking their way among the boulders at the discretion of their animals it so happened that richard and jehane were in front by some forty paces riding so presently jehane gave a short gasping cry and almost fell off her horse she pointed with her hand and look look look she said in a dry whisper there at a little distance from them was a leper who sat scratching himself on a rock ride on ride on my heart said richard but she no no he is coming we must wait her voice was full of despair the leper came jumping from rock to rock a horrible thing of rags and sores with a loose lower jaw which his disease had fretted to dislocation he stood in their mid path in full sun and plucking at his disastrous eyes peered upon the gay company by this time all the riders were clustered together before him and he fingered them out one after anotherrichard whom he called the red count gaston beziers auvergne limoges mercadet but at jehane he pointed long and in a voice between a croak and a clatter he had no palate said thrice hail thou she replied faintly god be good to thee brother he kept his finger still upon her as he spoke again every one heard his words beware he said the counts cap and the counts bed for so sure as thou liest in either thou art wife of a dead man and of his killer jehane reeled and richard held her up begone thou miserable he cried in his high voice lest i pity thee no more but the leper was capering away over the rocks hopping and flapping his arms like an old raven at a safe distance he squatted down and watched them his chin on his bare knees this frightened jehane so much that in the refectory of a convent where they stayed the night she could hardly see her victual for tears nor eat it for choking grief she exhausted herself by entreaties milo says that she was heard crying out at richard night after night conjur ing him by christ on the cross and mary at the foot of the cross not to turn love into a stabbing blade but all to no purpose he soothed and petted her he redoubled her honours he compelled her to love him and the more she agonised the more he was confident he would right her very definitely and with unexampled profusion he provided for her household and estate as soon as he was at home kings daughters were among her honourable women at least counts daughters daughters of viscounts and castellans she had lady saill of ventadorn lady elis of montfort lady tibors lady maent lady beatrix all fully as noble and two of them certainly more beautiful than she lady saill and lady elis were the most lovely women of aquitaine saill with a face like a flame elis clear and cold as spring water in the high rocks he gave her a chancellor of her seal a steward of the household a bishop for chaplain viscount ebles of ventadorn was her champion and bertran de born who had been doing secret mischief in the south as you will learn by and by if you will believe it bertran de born was forgiven and made her trobador it was at a great court of love which richard caused to be held in the orchards outside poictiers with pavilions and a chastel damors that bertran came in and was forgiven for the sake of his great singing on a white silk tribune before the castle sat jehane in a red gown upon her golden head a circlet of dull silver with the leaves and thorns which made up the coronet of a countess richard bade sound the silver trumpets and his herald proclaim her three times to the north to the east and to the south as the most puissant and peerless princess madame jehane by the grace of god countess of poictou duchess of aquitaine consort of our illustrious dread lord monsire richard count and duke of the same himself gloriously attired in a bliaut of white velvet and gold with a purple cloak over his shoulder sustained in a tenzon with the chief trobadors of languedoc that she was the most pleasant lovely lady now on earth or ever known there since the days of madame dido queen of carthage and madame cleopatra empress of babylonunfortunate examples both as some thought minstrels and poets of the greatest contended with him saill had her champion in guillem of cabestaing elis in girault of borneilh the dauphin of auvergne sang of tibors and peire vidal of lady maent towards the end came sideways in that dishevelled red fox whom nothing shamed bertran de born himself looked askance at the count puffed out his cheeks to give himself assurance and began to sing of jehane in a way that brought tears to richards eyes it was bertran who dubbed her with the name she ever afterwards went by throughout poictou and the south the name of bel vezer richard at the end clipped him in his arms and with one arm still round his wicked neck led him to the tribune where jehane sat blushing take him into your favour lady bel vezer he said to her whatever his heart may be he hath a golden tongue jehane stooping lent him her cheek and bertran fairly kissed her whom he had sought to undo then turning fired with her favour he let his shrill voice go spiring to heaven in her praise for these feats bertran was appointed to her household as i have said he made no secret of his love for her but sang of her night and day and delighted richards generous heart but indeed jehane won the favour of most if she was not so beautiful as saill she was more courteous if not so pious as elis more the woman for that there were many misled by her petulant lips and watchful eyes to call her sulky these did not judge her silence favourably they thought her cold and so she was to all but one their eyes might have told them what she was to him and how when they met in love to kiss or cling their two souls burned together and if she made a sweet lover she promised to be a rare countess her judgment was never at fault she was noble and her sedate gravity showed her to be so she was no talker and had great command over herself but she was more pale than by ordinary and her eyes were burning bright the truth was she was in a fever of apprehension restless doomed miserable devouringly in love yet dreading to be loved so more and more evidently in pain she walked her part through the blare of festival as pentecost drew nigh upon that day to quote the mellifluous abbot upon that day when in leaping tongues the spirit of god sat upon the heads of the holy apostles and gave letters to the unlettered and to the speechless its own nature count richard wedded dame jehane and afterwards crowned her countess with his own hands they put her crying bitterly into the counts bed in the castle of poictiers on the evening of the same feast weeping also but at a later day i saw her crowned again at angers with the counts cap of anjou so to right her and himself count richard did both the greatest wrong of all much more pageantry followed the marriage i admire milos account he held a tournament after this when the count and the party of the castle maintained the field against all corners there was great jousting for six days i assure you for i saw the whole of it no english knights were there nor any from anjou but a few french without king philips goodwill many gascons and men of toulouse and the limousin some from over the mountains from navarre and santiago and castile there also came the count of champagne with his friends king sancho of navarre was excessively friendly with a gift of six white stallions all housed for dame jehane nobody knew why or wherefore at the time except bertran de born o thief unrepentant countess jehane with her ladies being set in a great balcony of red and white roses herself all in rosecoloured silk with a chaplet of purple flowers the first day came count richard in green armour and a surcoat of the same embroidered with a naked man a branch of yellow broom in his helm none held up against him that day the duke of burgundy fell and brake his collarbone the second day he drove into the melee suddenly when there was a great press of spears all in red with a flaming sun on his breast he sat a bloodhorse of spain bright chestnut colour and housed in red then i tell you we saw horses and men sunder their loves the third day pedro de vaqueiras a knight from santiago encountered him in his silver armour when he rode a horse white as the holy ghost by a chance blow the spaniard bore him back on to the crupper there was a great shout the count is down look to the castle poictou dame jehane turned colour of ash for she remembered the lepers prophecy and knew that de vaqueiras loved her but richard recovered himself quickly crying have at you again don pedro so they brought fresh spears and down went de vaqueiras on his back his horse upon him to be plain not hector raging over the field with shouts for achilles nor flamboyant achilles spying after hector nor hannibal at cannae roland in the woody pass of roncesvalles nor the admired lancelot nor tristram dreadful in the cornish islenot one of these heroes was more gloriously mighty than count richard like the warhorse of job the prophet and afflicted man he stamped with his foot and said among the captains ha ha his nostrils scented the battle from very far off he set on like the quarrell of a bow and gathering force as he went came rocking into his adversary like galley against galley with all this he was gentle had a pleasant laugh it was good to be struck down by such a man if it ever can be good he bore away opposition as he bore away the knights if one half of this were true and no man in steel could withstand him how could circumstance how could she this slim and frightened girl mad indeed with love and pride quite beside herself she forgot for once her tremors and qualms on the last day she fell panting upon his breast and he a great lover kissed her before them all and lifted her high in his hands oyez my lords he cried with a mighty voice is this a lovely wife i have won or not they answered him with a shout he took her a progress about his country afterwards from poictiers they went to limoges thence westward to angoulesme and south to perigueux to bazas to cahors agen even to dax which is close to the country of the king of navarre wherever he led her she was hailed with joy young girls met her with flowers in their hands wise men came kneeling offering the keys of their towns the youth sang songs below her balcony the matrons made much of her and asked her searching questions they saw in her a very superb and handsome duchess jehane of the fair girdle now acclaimed in the soft syllables of aquitaine as bel vezer when they were at dax the wise king of navarre sent ambassadors beseeching from them a visit to his city of pampluna but richard would not go then they came back to poictiers and shocking news this was of the death of king henry of england the old lion dead milo is bold to say in his sin chapter xii how they bayed the old lion i must report what happened to the king of england when like a falcon foiled in his stoop he found himself outpaced and outgeneralled on the moor shaken off by those he sought to entrap baited by the badger he hoped to draw he took on something not to be shaken off namely death and had drawn from him what he would ill spare namely the breath of his nostrils to have done with all this eloquence he caught a chill which working on a body shattered by rages and bad living smouldered in hima sloweating fever which bit him to the bones charred and shrivelled him up in the clutches of this crawling disease he joined his forces with those of his marshal and marched to the relief of le mans where the french king was taking his ease philip fired the place when he heard of his approach so henry got near enough to see the sky throbbing with red light and over all a cloud of smoke blacker than his own despair it is said that he had a fit of hard sobbing when he saw this dreadful sight he would not suffer the host to approach the burning city but took to his bed turned his face to the tentwall and refused alike housel and meat news and of the worst came fast the french were at chateaudun the countess of brittanys men were threatening anjou from the north all touraine with saumur and a chain of border castles were subject to richard his son these things he heard without moving from his bed or opening his eyes after a week of this misery two of his lords the marshal namely and bishop hugh of durham came to his bedside and told him sire here are come ambassadors from france speaking of a peace how shall it be as you will said the king only let me sleep he spoke drowsily as if not really awake but it is thought that he was more watchful than he chose to appear they held a hasty conference geoffrey his bastard the marshal the bishop these and the french ambassadors on the kings part they made but one request and geoffrey made that the king was dying let him be taken down to his castle of chinon not die in the fields like an old hunting dog this was allowed he took no sort of notice let them do what they would with him slept incessantly all the way to chinon they brought him the parchments sealed with his great seal and he quite broken set his hand to them without so much as a curse on the robbery done his kingdom but as the bearers were going out on tiptoe he suddenly sat up in bed hugh he grumbled bishop hugh come thou here the bishop turned back eagerly for those two had loved each other in their way and knelt by his bed read me the signatures to these damned things said the king and hugh rejoiced that he was better yet feared to make him worse ah dear sire he began to say but read man said the old king jerking his foot under the bedclothes so hugh the bishop began to read them over and the sick man listened with a shaky head for by now the fever was running high philip the august king of the franks says the bishop and a dogs name the old king muttered in his throat sanchez catholic king of navarre says hugh and name of an owl king henry to the same groundbass he treated the themes of the illustrious duke of burgundy henry count of champagne and others of the french party with these the bishop would have stopped but the king would have the whole nay hugh he saidand his teeth chattered as if it had been bitter coldout with the name of my beloved son so you shall see what joyful agreement there is in my house the bishop read the name of richard count of poictou and the king grunted his traitor from the womb as he had often done before who follows richard he asked oh our lady is he not enough sire said the bishop in fear the old king sat bolt upright and steadied his head on his knees read he said again i cannot read cried hugh with a groan the king said you are a fool give me the parchment he pored over it with dim eyes almost out of his keeping searching for the names at the top so he found what he had dreadedjohn count of mortain shaking fearfully he began to point at the wall as if he saw the man before him jesu count by me king by me and judas by me now god let me serve thee as thou deservest thou hast taken away all my sons now then the devil may have my soul for thou shalt never have it the deathrattle was heard in his throat and hugh sprang forward to help him he was still stiffly upright still looking though with filmy eyes at the wall still trying to shape in words his wicked vaunts no words came from him his jaw dropped before his strong old body they brought him the sacrament his soul rejected ittoo clean food hugh and others about him all in a sweat got him down at last they anointed him and said a few prayers for they were in a desperate hurry when it came to the end it was near midnight when he died and at that hour they terribly report the wind sprang up and howled about the turrets of chinon as if all hell was out hunting for that which he had promised them but if the truth must be told he had never kept his promises and there is no reason to suppose that he kept that one either milo adds so died this great puissant and terrible king cursing his children cursed in them as they in him all power was given over to him from his birth save one only power over himself he was indeed a slave more wretched than those hinds glebae ascriptitii whom at a distance he ruled in his lands he was slave of his baser parts with god he was always at war and with gods elect what of blessed thomas let thomas answer on the last day i deny him none of his properties he was openhanded openminded as bold as a lion but his vices ate him up peace be with the man he was a mighty king he left a wife in prison two sons in arms against him and many bastards as soon as he was dead his people came about like flies and despoiled the castle of chinon the bed where he lay smiling grimly as if death had made him a cynic his very body of the rings on its fingers the gold circlet the christ round his neck such flagrancy was the penalty of death who had made himself too cheap in those days nor were there any left with him who might have said honour my dead father or dead master william the marshal had gone to rouen afraid of richard geoffrey was half way to angers after treasure the bishop of durham for purposes had hastened off to poictiers to be the first to hail the new king all that remained faithful in that den of thieves were a couple of poor girls with whom the old sinner had lately had to do seeing he was left naked on his bed one of thesenicolete her name was from harfleurtouched the other on the shoulderkentish mall they called herand said they have robbed our master of so much as a shirt to be buried in what shall we do mall said if we are found with him we shall be hanged sure enough yet the old man was kind to me and to me he was kind said nicolete god wot then they looked at each other well said nicolete and mall what you do i will do so they kissed together knowing it was a gallows matter and went in to the dead body of the king they washed it tenderly and anointed it composed the hands and shut down the horrible sightless eyes then put upon it the only shirt they could find which being a boys was a very short one afterwards came the chancellor stephen of turon called up in a great hurry from a merrymaking with one or two others and took some order in the affair the chancellor knew perfectly well that king henry had desired to be buried in the church of the nuns at fontevrault there had been an old prophecy that he should lie veiled among the veiled women which had pleased him very much though it had often been his way to scoff at it but no one dared move him without the order of the new king whoever that might happen to be who could tell when anjou was claiming a crown messengers therefore were sent out hotfoot to count richard at poictiers and to count john who was supposed to be in paris he however was at tours with the french king and got the news first it caught him in the wind so to put it alain a canon of tours came before him kneeling and told him lord christ alain what shall we do says he as white as a cheesecloth they fell talking of this or that that might or might never be done when in burst king philip saintpol des barres and the purplefaced duke of burgundy king philip ran up to john and clapped him on the back king john king john of england screamed the young man like a witch in the air then burgundy began his grumble of thunder i stand for you by god i am for you man but saintpol knelt and touched his knee sire do me right and i become your man so said des barres also count john looked about him and wrung his hands heh my lords heh sirs what shall i do now he was liquid fear and desire frittered his heart to water they held a great debate all talking at once except the subject of the bother he could only bite his nails and look out of the window to them then came creeping alois of france deadly pale habited in the grey weeds of a nun how she got in i know not but they parted this way and that before her and so she came very close to john in his chair and touched him on the shoulder what now traitor she said hoarsely whom next the sister betrayed the father and now the brother and king john shook no no alois no no he said in a whisper go to bed we think not of it but she still stood looking at him with a wry smile on that face of hers pinched with grief and old before its time saintpol stamped his foot whom shall we trust in anjou he said to des barres des barres shrugged the duke of burgundy grumbled something about dd women and king philip ordered his sister to bed they got her out of the room after a painful scene and fell to wrangling again trying to screw some resolution into the white prince whom they all intended to use as a catspaw about eight oclock in the morningthey still at itcame a shatter of hoofs in the courtyard which made count john jump in his skin a herald was announced reeking he stood and stood covered in the presence of so much majesty speak sir said king philip and uncover before france you dog said young saintpol the herald kept his cap where it was i speak from england to the english this is the command of my master richard king of the english duke of normandy count of anjou bid our brother the illustrious count of mortain attend us at fontevrault with all speed for the obsequies of the king our father and those who owe him obedience let them come also there was low murmuring in the chamber which grew in volume until at last burgundy thundered out england is here cut down that man but the herald stood his ground and no one drew a sword john dismissed him with a few smooth words but he could not get rid of his friends so easily nor could they succeed with him if montferrat had been there they might have screwed him to the pitch montferrat had a clear course any king of england who would help him to the throne of jerusalem was the king of england he would serve but philip would not commit himself and burgundy waited on philip as for saintpol he was nothing but a sword or two and an unquenchable grudge and forbidding in the background stood alois with reproach in her sunken eyes the end of it was that count john after a while rode out towards fontevrault with all the pomp he could muster thither also it is clear went madame alois i was with my master says milo in his book when they brought him the news he was not long home from the south had been hawking in the meadows all day and was now in great fettle sitting familiarly among his intimates jehane on his knee bertran de born was in there singing some free song and the gentle viscount of beziers and lady elis of montfort who sat on a cushion and played with dame jehanes hand and gaston of bearn and i think lady tibors of vezelay then came the usher suddenly into the room with his wand and by the door fell upon one knee a sort of state which count richard had always disliked it made him testy well gaucelm well he said on your two legs my man if you are to please me lord king gaucelm began then stopped my lord bayed at him oy deus he said in our tongue below his breath and jehane slid off his knee and on to her own so fell kneeling the whole company till gaston of bearn more mad than most sprang up shouting hail king of the english and better hail count of anjou we all began on that cry but he stopped us with a poignant look god have mercy on me i am very wicked he said and covered up his face no one spoke jehane bent herself far down and kissed his foot then he sent for the heralds and in burst hugh puiset bishop of durham with his flaming face outstripping all the others and decency at once by this time king richard had recovered himself he heard the tale without moving a feature and gave a few short commands the first was that the body of the dead king should be carried splendidly to fontevrault and the next that a pall should be set up in his private chapel here at poictiers and tall candles set lighted about it so soon as this was done he left the chamber all standing and went alone to the chapel he spent the night there on his knees himself only with a few priests he neither sent for countess jehane nor did she presume to seek him her women tell me that she prayed all night before a christ in her bedchamber and well she might with a queens crown in fair view in two or three days time king richard pressed out very early for fontevrault i went with him and so did hugh of durham the bishop of poictiers and the dauphin of auvergne these with the chancellor of poictou the household servants and guards were all we had with us the countess was to be ready upon word from him to go with her ladies and the court whithersoever he should appoint bertran de born went away in the night and king richard never saw him again but i shall have to speak of his last tenzon and his last sirvente of kings by heaven before he went king richard kissed the countess jehane twice in the great hall farewell my queen he said plainly and as some think but not i deliberately god be thy good friend i shall see thee before many days if the man was changed already she was not at all changed she was very grave but not crying and put up her face for his kisses as meek as any baby she said nothing at all but stood palely at the door with her women as king richard rode over the bridge for my part he concludes when i consider the youth and fierce untutored blood of this noblest of his race or when i remember their terrible names tortulf forester and ingelger fulke the black and fulke the red and geoffrey greygown and geoffrey the fair and that old henry the wickedest of all their deeds also how father warred upon his sons and sons conspired against their fathers how they hated righteousness and loved iniquity and spurned monks and priests and revelled in the shambles they had made then i say to myself good milo how wouldst thou have received thy calling to be king and sovereign count wouldst thou have said as count john said lord christ alain what shall we do or rather god have mercy i am very wicked it is true that count john was not called to those estates and that king richard was but i choose sooner to think that each was confronted with his dead father and not the emptied throne in which case count john thought of his safety and king richard of his sin such musing is a windy business suitable to old men but i suppose that you who read are very young chapter xiii how they met at fontevrault communing with himself as he rode alone over the broomy downs king richard reined up shortly and sent back a messenger for milo the abbot so milo flogged his old mule directly he was level with his master that master spoke in a quiet voice like one who is prepared for the worst milo what should a man do who has slain his own father is repentance possible for such a one milo looked up first at the blue sky then about at the earth all green and gold he wrinkled close his eyes and let the sun play upon his face the air was soft the turf springy underfoot he found it good to be there sire he said it is a hard matter yet there have been worse griefs than that in the world name one my friend says the king whose eyes were fixed on the edge of the hill milo said there was a father my lord king richard who slew his own son that the world might be the better that was a terrible grief i suppose the king was silent for a few paces then he asked and was the world much the better beau sire replied milo not very much but that was not gods fault for it had and still has the chance of being the better for it and do you dare milo said the king turning him a stern face set my horrible offence beside the divine sacrifice not so my lord king said milo at large but i draw this distinction you are not so guilty as you suppose for in this world the father maketh the son both in the way of nature and of precept in heaven it is otherwise there the son was from the beginning coeternal with the father begotten but not made in the divine case there was pure sacrifice and no guilt at all in the earthly case there was much guilt but as yet no sacrifice that guilt was mine milo said richard with a sob lord i think not answered the old priest you are what your fathers have made you but now mark me well in doing sacrifice you can be very greatly otherwise then if no more guilt be upon you than hangs by the misfortunes of tainted man you can please almighty god by doing what you only among men can do wholesome sacrifice why what sacrifice shall i do says the king milo stood up in his stirrups greatly exalted in the spirit my lord he said behold it is for two years that you have borne the sign of that sacrifice upon you but yet have done nothing of it during these years gods chosen seat hath lain dishonoured become the washpot of the heathen the holy tree stock beyond price rod of grace figure of freedom is in bonds the sepulchre is ensepulchred antichrist reigns lord lordhere the abbot shook his lifted fingerhow long shall this be you ask me of sin and sacrifice behold the way king richard jerked his head then his horses get back milo and leave me he said curtly struck in the spurs and galloped away over the grey down the cavalcade halted at thouars and lay the night in a convent of the order of savigny king richard kept himself to himself ate little spoke less he prayed out the night or most of it kneeling in his shirt in the sanctuary with his bare sword held before him like a cross next morning he called up his household by the first cock had them out on the road before the sun and pushed forward with such haste that it was one hour short of noon when they saw the great church of the nuns of fontevrault like a pile of dim rock in their way at a miles distance from the walls the king got off his horse and bid his squires strip him he ungirt his sword took off helm and circlet cloak blazoned surcoat the girdle of his county beggared so of all emblems of his grace clad only in hauberk of steel bareheaded without weapon and on foot he walked among his mounted men into the little town of fontevrault that which he could not do off his sovereign inches sovereign eye gait of mastery prevailed over all other robbery of his estate the people bent their knees as he passed not a fewwomen with babies in their shawls lads and girlscaught at his hand or hauberks edge to kiss it and get the virtue out of him that is known to reside in a king when he came within sight of the church he knelt and let his head sink down to his breast but his grief seemed to strike inwards like a frost he stiffened and got up and went forward no one would have guessed him a penitent then who saw him mount the broad steps to meet his brother before the shut doors of the abbey was count john very splendid in a purple cloak his crown of a count upon his yellow hair he stood like a king among his peers but flushed and restless twiddling his fingers as kings do not twiddle theirs irresolution kept him where he was until richard had topped the first flight of steps but then he came down to meet him in too much of a hurry tripping blundering the degrees nodding and poking his head with hands stretched out and body bent like his who supplicates what he does not deserve hail king of england o hail he said wheedling royally vested royally above yet grovelling there to the prince below him king richard stopped with his foot on the next step and let the count come down how lies he were his first words the others face grew fearful eh i know not he said shuddering i have not seen him now he must have been in fontevrault for a day or more why not asked richard and john stretched out his arms again oh brother i waited for you he cried then added lower i could not face him alone this was perfectly evident or he would never have said it pish said king richard that is no way to mend matters but it is written they shall look on him whom they pierced come you in he mounted the steps to his brothers level and men saw that he was nearly a hand taller though john was a fine tall man with you richard with youbut never without you said john in a hush rolling his eyes about richard taking no notice bid them set open the doors this was done the chill taint of the dark of wax and damp and death came out john shivered but king richard left him to shiver and passed out of the sun into the echoing nave lightly and fiercely he went in like a brave man who is fretful until he meets his dangers face and john caught at his wrist and went tiptoe after him all the rest poictevins and frenchmen together followed in a pack then the two bishops vested at the far end of the church beyond the great rood they saw the candles flare about a bier before that was a little white altar with a priest saying his mass in a whisper the high altar was all dark and behind a screen in the north transept the nuns were singing the office for the dead king richard pushed on quickly the others trooping behind there in the midst of all this chilly state grim and sourfaced as he had always been but now as unconcerned as all the dead are lay the empty majesty of england careless as it seemed of the full majesty and dead anjou a stranger to the living it was not so altogether if we are to believe those who saw it the hatred of the dead is a fearful thing of that which followed be god the only judge and i not even the reporter milo saw it and milo who got some comfort out of it at last shall tell you the tale for i know says he that in the end the hidden things are to be made plain and even so things which then i guessed darkly have since been opened out to my understanding behold he goes on i tell you a mystery lightly and adventuring came king richard to his dead father and count john dragging behind him like a load of care reverently he knelt him down beside the bier prayed for a little then looking up touched the grey old face before god i say it was the act of a boy but slowly slowly we who watched quaking saw a black stream well at the nostril of the dead and slowly drag a snakes way down the jaw a sight to shake those fraught with godand what to men in their trespasses but while all the others fell back gasping or whispering their prayers scarce knowing what i was or did save that i loved king richard i whipt forward with a handkerchief to cover the horror out of sight this i would have done though all had seen it the king had seen it and that whitehearted traitor count had seen it and sprung away with a wail o christ o christ the king stood up and with his lifted hand stopped me in the pious act all held their breaths i saw the priest at the altar peer round the corner his mouth making a ring king richard was very pale and serious he began to talk to his father while the count lay cowering on the pavement thou thinkest me thy slayer father he said pointing at me the murdersign well i am content to take it for be thou sure of this that if that last war between us was rightfully begun it was rightfully ended and of righteousness i think i am as good a judge as ever thou wert thy work is done and mine is to do if i may be as kingly as thou wert i shall please thee yet and if i fail in that i shall never blame thee father now abbot milo he concluded cover the face so i did and count john got up to his knees again and looked at his brother this was not the end madame alois of france came into the church through the nuns door dressed all in grey with a great grey hood on her head and after her women in the same habit she came hastily with a quick shuffling motion of the feet as if she was gliding and by the bier she stood still questing with her eyes from side to side like a hunted thing king richard she saw for he was standing up but still she looked about and about now count john was kneeling in the shadow so she saw him last but once meeting his deplorable eyes with her own she never left go again whatever she did and it was much or whatever said and her mouth was pregnant was with a fixed gaze on him being on the other side of the bier from him she watched she put her arms over the dead body as a priest at mass broods upon the host he is making and looking shrewdly at the count if the dead could speak john she said if the dead could speak how think you it would report concerning you and me ha madame says count john shaking like a leafy tree what is this madame alois removed my handkerchief the horror was still there he did me kindness she said looking wistfully at the empty face he tried to serve me this way and that way she stroked it then looked again at the count but then you came john and you he loved above all how have you served him john my bonny lad eh saviour she looked up on higheh saviour if the dead could speak no more than the dead could john speak but king richard answered her madame he said the dead hath spoken and i have answered it that is the kingly office i think to stand before god for the people let no other speak all is said no no richard said madame alois all is not nearly said so sure as i live in torment you will rue it if you do not listen to me now madame replied the king i shall not listen i require your silence if i have it in me i command it i know what i have done you know nothing said the lady beginning to tremble you are a fool may be said king richard with a little shrug but i am a king in fontevrault the count of mortain began to wag his head about and pluck at the morse of his cope air air he gasped i strangle i suffocate they carried him out of church to his lodging and there bled him once more king richard said madame will you hear the truth from me the king turned fiercely saying madame i will hear nothing from you my purpose is to take the cross here in this church and to set about our lords business as soon as may be i urge you therefore to depart and if you have time to consider your souls healthas i consider mine and my kingdoms she began to cry being overwrought with this terrible affair o richard she said forgive me my trespasses i am most wretched he stepped forward and across the dead man kissed her on the forehead god knows i forgive thee alois he said so then she went away with her people and no long time afterwards took as i believe the whole vow in the convent of fontevrault thus milo records a scene too high for me when they had buried the old king richard sent letters to his brother of france reminding him of what they had both undertaken to do namely to redeem the sepulchre and set up again in jerusalem the true cross as for me he wrote i do most earnestly purpose to set about that business as soon as i may and i require of you sire and my brother to witness my resumption of the cross in this church of fontevrault upon the feast of monsire saint john baptist next coming let them also who are in your allegiance the illustrious duke of burgundy conrad marquess of montferrat and my cousin count henry be of your party and sharers with you in the new vow this done he went to chinon to secure his fathers treasure and then made preparations for his coronation as count of anjou and for jehanes coronation when she got his word that she was to meet him at angers by a certain day there was no thought of disobedience the pouting mouth meant no mutiny it meant sickening fear in angers they crown the count of anjou with the red cap and put upon his feet the red shoes that would make richard the red count indeed whose cap and bed the leper had bid her beware beware she might but how avoid she knew richard by this time for master a year ago she had subjugated him in the dark tower but since then he had handled her moulded her had but to nod and she served his will with what heart of lead she came come she did to await him in black angers steep and hardy little city of slate and the meeting of the two brought tears to many eyes she fell at his feet clasped his knees could not speak nor cease from looking up and he tall and kingly stoops lifts her holds her upon his breast strokes her face kisses her eyes and sorrowful mouth child he says art thou glad of me asking as lovers love best to do the things they know best already o richard o richard was all she could say poor fond wretch however we go not by the sense of a brides language but by the passion that breaks it up every agony of selfreproach of fear of him of mistrust of lurking fate lay in those sobbed words o richard o richard when he had her alone at night and she had found her voice she began to woo him and softly to beguile him with a hand to his chin judging it a propitious time while one of his held her head all the arts of woman were hers that night but his were the new purposes of a man he had had a rude shock was full of the sense of his sin that grim old mocking face grey among the candleflames was plain across the bedchamber where they lay to himself he made oath that he would sin no more no no a king he would do kingly to her clasped close in his arms he gave kisses and sweet words alas she wanted not the sugar of his tongue she would have had him bitter though it cost her dear lying there lulled but not convinced her sobs grew weaker she cried herself to sleep and he kissed her sleeping in the cathedral church of his fathers he did on by the hands of the archbishop the red cap and girdle and shoes of anjou there he held up the leopard shield for all to see there also upon the bent head of jehaneshe kneeling before himhe laid for a little while the same cap then in its room a circlet of golden leaves if he was sovereign count girt with the sword then she was countess of anjou before her grudging world what more was she wife of a dead man and his killer the words stayed by her and tinged the whole of her life chapter xiv of what king richard said to the bowing rood and what jehane to king richard miracles as a plain man i hold to be the peculiar of the church this chapter must be milos on that ground if there were no other but there is one strong other milo set the tune which caused king richard to dance and a very good tune it isaccording to milo therefore let him speak the office of abbot he writes is a solemn great office being no less than that of spiritual father to a family of men consecrate as it is written abba father yet not on that account should vainglory puff the cheeks of a pious man god knows that i am no boaster he therefore will not misjudge me as certain others have done when i record in this place for positive cause and reason good the exorbitant honours i received on the day of my lord saint john baptist in this year of thankful redemption eleven hundred and eightynine forsooth i myself this milo of saint maryofthepine was chosen to preach in the church of the nuns of fontevrault before a congregation thus composedtwo kings one crowned one legate a latere a reigning duke him of burgundy i mean five cinctured counts twice three bishops abbots without number jehane countess of anjou and wife to the king of england the countess of roussillon the two countesses of angoulesme the old and the young lady elis of montfort reputed the most witty lady in languedoc thirteen pronounced poets and the hairdresser of the king of franceto name no more that sermon of minei shame not to report itwas found worthy the inscription in the register of fontevrault and in the initial letter thereof garlanded in gold work very beautiful to be seen is the likeness of myself vested with a mitre on my head all done by that ingenious craftsman and faithful christian man aristarchus of byzantium suspirante deo there the curious may consult it as indeed they do i hope i know the demands of history upon proportion better than to write it all here briefly then a second peter i stood up before that crowned assembly and was bold what i said is pharaoh but a noise how else is father abraham but dusty in his cave duke lot hath a monument less durable than his wicked wifes and as for noe that great admiral the waters of oblivion have him whom the waters of god might not drown conquered lies unconquered agamemnon how else lies julius caesar nabuchodonosor eater of grass what is he kings pass and their royal seat gathereth a little dust anon with a besom of feathers cometh time the chamberlain and scareth to his hidingplace the lizard on the wall think soberly o ye kings how your crowns are but yellow metal and your purple robes the food of moths and the sceptres of your power no better than hedgetwigs for the driving of rats round about your crystal orbs scurry the fleas at play in the nighttime in a little while the joints of your legs will grapple the degrees of your thrones with no more zest than an old bargemans his greasy poop at this king philip said tush and fidgeted in his chair he might have put me out of countenance but that i saw king richard clasp his knee and smile into the rafters and knew by the peaking of his beard that i had pleased him thus by precept by trope and flower of speech i gaufred the edges of my discourse then turning eastward with a cry i grasped the pulpit firmly with one hand the while i raised the other sorrow i said is more enduring than the pride of life my lords and to renounce than to heap riches behold the king of sorrows behold the man beggared ai ai my lords is there to be no end to his sorrows or shall he be stripped for ever yesterday he put off life itself and today ye bid him do away with the price of life yesterday he hung upon the tree and today ye hear it said down with the tree let mahomet kindle his hearth with it let us be done say you with dead lords and wooden stocks we are kings and our stocks golden it is well said my lords after the fashion this world holds honourable but i ask did job fear god for nought but i say consider the maccabees all your broad lands are not worth the rent of that little garden enclosed where among ranked lilies sat mary singing god rest thee babe i am thy mother and daughter you wag the head and an enemy dieth you say come up and some wretch getteth title to make others wretched but no power of life and member no fountain of earthly honour no great breath nor acclamation of trumpets nor bearing of swords naked nor chrism nor broad seal nor homage nor fealty done is worth that doom of the lord to a man saying i was naked christ is naked and ye clothed me i was anhungered christ is hungry and ye gave me meat i was in prison so is christ and ye visited me therefore again i say unto you kings by the spirit of the lord which is in me let us now go even unto bethlehem awake do on your panoplies shake your sceptres over the armied earth so hierusalem that bride among brides that exalted virgin that elect lady crowned with stars shall sit no longer wasted in the brothel of the heathen amen i said and a great silence fell on all the length and breadth of the church king richard sat up stiff as a tree staring at the holy rood as though he had a vision of something at work king philip of france moody was watching his greater brother count john of mortain had his head sunk to his breastbone his thin hands not at rest but one finger picking ever at another even the duke of burgundy the burly eater was moved as could be seen by the working of his cheekbones two nuns were carried out for dead all this i saw between my hands as i knelt in prayer but much more i saw it seems that i had called down testimony from on high i saw countess jehane halfrisen from her seat white in the face openmouthed gaping at the cross saviour the rood the rood she cried out choking then fell back and lay quite still many rose to their feet some dropped to their knees all looked we saw the great painted christ on the rood stoop his head forward thrice at the first and second times amid cries of wonder men looked to see whither he bent his head but at the third time all with one consent fell upon their faces except only richard king of england he indeed rose up and stood to his full height i saw his blue eyes shine like sapphires as he began to speak to the christ though he spoke measuredly and low you could mark the exultation singing behind his tones ah now my lord god said he i perceive that thou hast singled me out of all these peers for a work of thine which is a thing so glorious for me that if i glory in it i am justified since the work is glorious i take it upon me my lord and shall not falter in it nor be slow enough said thou askest not words of me now let me go that the work may begin after which very devoutly kneeling he signed to the archbishop of tours who sat in the sedilia of the sanctuary to affix the cross to his shoulder which was done and afterwards to most of the company then presentto king philip to the duke of burgundy to henry count of champagne bertram count of roussillon and raymond count of toulouse to many bishops also to james davesnes william des barres and to eustace count of saintpol the brother of countess jehane but count john took no cross nor did geoffrey the bastard of anjou afterwards i believe these two worked the french king into a fury because richard should have taken upon him the chief place in this miraculous adventure the duke of burgundy was not at all pleased either but everybody else knew that it was to king richard the holy rood had pointed and he knew it himself and events proved it so but that night after supper he and king philip kissed each other and swore brotherhood on their swordhilts before all the peers i am not one to deny generous moments to that politic prince this i consider to have been one evoked certainly by the nobility of king richard that appointed champions exaltation still burned in him he was fiercely excited his eyes were bright with fever of fire hey philip he laughed now you and i must cross the sea and you a bad sailor philip tis so indeed richard says king philip looking rather foolish king richard clapped him on the shoulder a stout heart my philip he says is betokened by your high stomach that shall stand us in a good stead in palestine then it was that king philip kissed him and him king richard again he was in great heart that day full to the neck with hope and adventure i would like to see the man or woman to have denied him anything at times like these he was i do not seek to disguise it a frank lover non omnia possumus omnes if any man think he must have been galahad the bloodless knight because he had been singled out by the questing rood he knows little how high ventures foment rich blood lancelot he never was to love broadcast but tristram rather lover of one woman hope pride knowledge of his force ran tingling in him perhaps he saw her fairer than any woman could have been perhaps he saw her rosy through his sanguine eyes he clipped her in his arms in full hall that night in a way that made her rosy enough not that she denied him good heaven who was she to do that there as he had her close upon his breast he kissed her a dozen times and jehane wilt thou fare with me to england he asked her fondly or must i leave thee peaking here my countess of anjou she would have had her own answer ready to that good soul but that the leper gave her another in a low urgent voice she answered ah sweet lord i must never leave thee nowas if to ask was there need so he went on talking to her lover talk teasing talk to see what she would say and all the while jehane stood very near him with her face held between his two hands as closely as wine is held by a cup to whatever he chose to say and in whatever fashion whether strokingly as to a beloved child or gruffly in sport as one speaks to a pet dog she replied in very meek manner eyeing him intently yea richard or nay richard agreeing with him always this he observed they call me yeaandnay dear girl he said and thou hast learned it of them but i warn thee jehane ma mie i am in a mood of yea this night therefore deny me not lord i shall never deny thee says jehane red as a rose and reason enough i remembered the words for while she said them it is certain she was praying how best she might make herself a liar like saint peter pretty matters on the faith i profess and if a man who is king of men may not play with his young wife i know not who may play with her that is my answer to king philip augustus who fretted and chafed at this harmless performance as for saintpol who ground his teeth over it i would have a different answer for him i have given milo his full tether but there are things to say which he knew nothing about richard was changed for all his wild mood of that night nor was jehane slow to perceive it perhaps indeed she was too quick with her wit oversharpened by her uneasy conscience but that night she saw or thought she saw this in richard that whereas the righting of her had been his only concern before the day of the bowing rood now he had another concern and the next day when at dawn he left her and was with his council until dinner she knew it for sure after dinner which he scarcely ate he rose and visited king philip with him the legate and the archbishops he remained till late at night day succeeded day in this manner the french king the duke and their trains went to paris then came guy of lusignan king and no king of jerusalem for help richard promised him his not because he liked him any better than the marquess who kept him out but because guys title seemed to him a good one at bottom richard was as deliberate as a pair of scales and just now was acting the perfect king the very touchstone of justice through all this time of great doings jehane stayed quaking at home sitting strangely among her womena countess who knew she was none a queen by nature who dreaded to be queen by law yet one thing she dreaded more she was in a horrible pass wife of a dead man and his killer why what should she do she dared not go on playing wife to the champion of heaven and yet she dared not leave him lest she should be snatched into the arms of his assassin on which horn should she impale her poor heart she tried to wring prayers out of it she tried to moisten her aching eyes with the dew of tears slowly by agony of effort she approached her bosom to the steel one night richard came to her and she drove herself to speak he came and she fenced him off richard o richard touch me not god on the cross what is this touch me not touch me never but never leave me o my pale rose o fairgirdled she stood up white as her gown transfigured very serious i am not thy wife richard i am no mans wife no but i am thy slave bound to thee by a curse held from thee by thy high calling i dare not leave thee my richard nor dare stay by thee so close lest ruin come of it richard watched her frowning he was much moved but thought of what she said ruin jehane ruin ruin of thy venture my knight of god ah chosen elect comrade of the rood gossip of jesus christ duke dedicate she was hued like flame as the great thoughts leaped in her ah my christian king it is so little a thing i ask of thee to set me apart what am i to thee whose bride is the virgin city the holy place what is jehane a poor thing handed about to vex heaven or be a stumblingblock in the way of the cross put me away richard let me go have done with me sweet lord and then swiftly she ran and clasped his knees but ask me not to leave theeno but i dare not indeed her tears streamed freely now when richard with a cry snatched her up she lay weeping like a lost child in his arms he laid her on the bed worn frail by the strife she had endured she had no strength to open her eyes but moved her lips to thank him for his pains at first she turned her head from side to side seeking a cool place on the pillow later she fell into a heavy drugged sleep he watched her till it was nearly light brooding over her unconscious face no thoughts of a king were his i think but once more he lapped them in that young girls bosom and let them sway ebb and flow with it on the flow great with her theme he saw her inspired standing with her torch of flame to point his road a splintry way leads to the cross where even kings consecrate must tear their feet if he knew himself as at such naked hours he must he knew whither his heart was set he was to lead the armies of christendom because no other man could do it had he any other pure and stern desire but that none if he could win back the sepulchre new plant the holy cross set a christian king on the throne below golgotha keep word with god who had bowed to him from the rood give the heathen sword for sword and hold the armed world like a spear in his hand to shake as he shookgod of all power and might was this not worthy his heart his heart and jehanes the flowing bosom ebbed and drained him of all but pity he saw her like a dead flower wan bruised thrown away robbery he had stolen her by force he clenched his two hands about his knee and shook himself to and fro thief damned thief had he made her amends he groaned not yet should she not be crowned she prayed that she might not be she meant that all her soul came sobbing to her lips as she prayed him he could not deny her that prayer if she would not mount his throne she should nothe was king but that other bidding touch me not she said he looked at her sleeping her bosom filled and lifted his hand god have no mercy on him if he denied her that either so take thou god my hearts desire if i give her not hers then he stooped and kissed her forehead she opened her eyes and smiled feebly half awake he was not a man i say it again at the mercy of womens lure milo was right he was tristram not galahad nor lancelot a man of cold appetite a man whose head was master touched rarely and then stirred only to certain deeps so far as he could love woman born he loved jehane saw her exceedingly lovely loved her proud remote spirit her nobility her sobriety he saw her bodily perfections too how splendid a person how sumptuous in hue and light admiring taking glory in these yet he required the sting of another mans hand upon her to seize her for himself for purposes of policy for ends which seemed to him good he could have lived with jehane as a brother with a sister one thing provided let no other man touch now this policy was imperative this end god said was good jehane implored with tears christ called from the cross so king richard fell upon his knees and kissed the girls forehead when he left her that morning he sought out milo and confessed his sins shriven he arose to do what remained in the west before he could be crowned in rouen and crowned in westminster chapter xv last tenzon of bertran de born i wish to be done with bertran de born that lagging fox but the dogs of my art must make a backward cast if they are to kill him in the open i beg the reader then to remember that when richard left him halfthrottled in his own house and when he had recovered wind enough to stir his gall he made preparations for a long journey to the south in that scandal concerning alois of france he believed he had stuff which might wreck count richard more disastrously than count richard could wreck him he hoped to raise the south and thither he went his own dungfly buzzing over the offal he had blown and the first point he headed for was pampluna across the pyrenees it is folly to dig into the mind of a man diseased by malice better treat such like sour ground burn with lime or let god burn and abide the event in faith if of all men in the world bertran hated richard of anjou it was not because richard had misused him but because he had used him too lightly richard offended with bertran gave him a flick on the ear and sent him to the devil with his japes he did no more because he valued him no more he thought him a perverse rascal glorious poet illconditioned vassal untimely parasite of his fathers realm he knew he had caused endless mischief but he could not hate such a cork on a waterspray now it fretted bertran to white heat that he should be despised by a great man it seemed that at last he could do him considerable harm he could embroil him with two kings france and england and induce a third to harass him from the south so he crossed the mountains and went into navarre over those stony ridges and bare fields don sancho was king the seventh of his name and he kept his state in the city of pampluna reputed the wisest prince of his day it is certain that he had need to be so such neighbours as he had west of him was santiago south of him castile these two urgent kings edging as it were on the same bench with him made his seat a shifty comfort no sooner had he warmed himself a place than he was hoist to a cold one in front of him over against the sun he saw philip of france pinched to the same degree between england and burgundy eager to stretch his extremities since he could not broaden his sides don sancho had no call to love france but he feared england greatlythe horrible old brindled lion and richard offspring of the lion and the pard richard the leopard who made more songs and fought more quarrels out than any christian prince here were quodlibets for don sanchos logic in appearance he was a pale vexed man with anxious eyes and a thin beard at which in his troubles he plucked as often as he could afford the hairs next to his bleached lands he loved minstrels and physicians averrhoes was often at his court so were guillem of cabestaing and peire vidal he knew and went so far as to love bertran de born perhaps he was not too good a christian certainly he was a very hungry one and kings with the rest of the world are to be judged by their necessities not their professions so much will suffice i hope concerning don sancho the wise in those days which saw count richards back turned on autafort and saintpols broken at tours bertran de born came to pampluna asking to be received by the king of navarre don sancho was glad to see him now bertran says he you shall give me news of poets and the food of poets all the talk here is of bad debts oy sire says bertran what can i tell you the land is in flames the women have streaked faces far and wide travels the torch of war i am sorry to hear it says king sancho and trust that you have not brought one of those torches with you bertran shook his head interruptions worried him for he lived maddeningly like a man that has a drumming in his ear sire he said there is a new strife between the count of poictou yeaandnay and the french king on this account the count repudiates madame alois now why does he do that bertran cried king sancho opening his eyes wide sire it is because he pretends that his father the old king has done him dishonour says the count madame alois might be my stepmother never my wife deus said the king bertran is this the truth that was a question for which bertran was fully prepared he always had it put and always gave the same answer as i am a christian sire he said the gospel is no truer to which king sancho replied i do most devoutly believe in the holy gospel whatever any arabian may say to the contrary but is it for this pray that you propose to light candles of war in navarre ah said bertran with his hand scratching in his vest i light no candles my lord but i counsel you to light them phew said king sancho and stuck his arms out on whose account bertran on whose account bertran replied savagely on account of dame alois slandered of her brother france deceived in his hope of the english king strangely accused of his son john a hopeful prince benjamin of a second israel and of queen eleanor of england of whose kindred your grace is deus oy deus cried king sancho pale with amazement and are all these thrones in arms lighting candles against count richard it is so indeed sire says bertran and king sancho frowned with this commentthere seems little chivalry here take it as you will next he inquired where was the count of poictou bertran was ready he rages his lands sire like a leopard caged now and again he raids the marches harries france or anjou and withdraws and the king his father bertran where is he far off i hope he said bertran is in normandy with a host seeking the head of his son richard on a charger the great man that he is cried don sancho bertran could not contain himself great or not he is to pay his debts the old rascal stag is rotten with fever i suppose don sancho was not called wise for nothing at any rate he sat for a while considering the man before him then he asked where was king philip sire replied bertran he is in his city of paris comforting dame alois and assembling his estates for count richards flank and prince john oh sire he has friends he waits watch for him presently king sancho frowned his forehead into furrows and allowed himself a hair or two of his beard we will think of it bertran he said presently yes we will think of it after our own fashion god rest you bertran pray go refresh yourself so he dismissed him when he was alone he went on frowning and between whiles tapped his teeth with his beardcomb he knew that bertran had not come lying for nothing to pampluna he must find out on whose account he was lying and upon what rock of truth if any at all he had built up his lies was it because he hated the father or because he hated the son or because he served prince john let that alone for a moment this story of alois it must be he thought either true or false but was no invention of bertrans whichever it was king philip would make war upon king henry not upon richard since wanting timber you cut at the trunk not at the branches he believed bertran so far that the count of poictou was in his country and king henry with a host in his war between philip and the count was a foolishness peace between the count and king henry was another don sancho believed since he believed in god that old king henry was at deaths door and he saw above all things that if the scandal was reasonably founded there would be a bachelor prince spoiling for wedlock on all grounds therefore he decided to write privily to his kinswoman queen eleanor of england and so he did to a very different tune from that imagined by bertran the letter which follows madame sister and aunt he wrote this day has brought tidings to my private ear whereat in part i mourn with you and rejoice in part as a wise physician who hearing of some great lover in the article of death knows that he has both the wit and the remedy to work his cure madame with a hand upon my heart i may certify the flow of my blood for the causes serious and horrific which have led to strife between your exalted lord and most dear consort in christ jesus my lord henry the pious king of england whom god assoil and his august neighbour of france but madame sister and aunt it is no less my comfort to affirm that the estate of your noble son the count of poictou no less moves my anguish what madame so fierce a youth and so strenuous widowed of his hopeful bed the face of paris with the fate of menelaus the sweet accomplishments of king david chief of trobadors and the ignominy of the husband of bathsheba you see that my eloquence burns me up and verily madame sister and aunt the hot coal of the wrath of your son has touched my mouth so that at the last i speak with my tongue i ask myself madame why do not the virgins of christendom arise and offer their unrifled zones to his noble fingers sister and aunt there is one at least in navarre who so arises i offer my child berengere called by trobadors because of her chaste seclusion frozen heart to be thawed in the sun of your son i offer moreover my great fiefs of oliocastro cingovilas monte negro and sierra alba as far as agreda and a dowry also of marks in gold of byzance to be numbered by three bishops one each of our choosing and the third to be chosen by our lord and ghostly father the pope and i offer to you madame sister and aunt the devotion of a brother and nephew the right hand of concord and the kiss of peace i pray god daily to preserve your celsitudefrom our court of pampluna etc under the privy signet of the king himselfsanchius navarrensium rex sapiens pater patriae pius catholicus this done and means taken for sure despatch he sends for the virgin in question and embracing her with one arm holds her close to his knee my child he says you are to be wedded to the greatest prince now on life the pattern of chivalry the mirror of manly beauty heir to a great throne what do you say to this the virgin kept her eyes down a very faint flush of rose troubled her cheek i am in your hands sire she said whereupon don sancho enfolded her you are in my arms dear child he testified your lord will be king of england duke of normandy and aquitaine count of anjou poictou and maine and lord of some island in the western sea whose name i have forgotten he is also the subject of prophecy which as the arabians know very well declares that he will rule such an empire as alexander never saw nor the mighty charles dreamed of does this please you my child he is a very great lord said berengere and will be a great king i hope to serve him faithfully by saint james and so you shall cried the happy don sancho go my child and say your prayers you will have something to pray about at last she was the only daughter he had left exorbitantly loved a little creature too much brocaded to move cold as snow pious as a virgin enclosed with small regular features like a fairy queens she had a narrow mind and small heart for meeting tribulation which indeed she seemed never likely to know sometimes being in her robes of state crusted with gems crowned coifed ringed she looked like nothing so much as a stiff dollgoddess set in glass over an altar it was thus she showed her best when with fixed eyes and a frigid smile she stood above the court an unapproachable glittering star set in the clear sky of a night to give men hopes of an ordered heaven it was thus bertran de born had seen her when for a time his hot and wrong heart was at rest and he could look on a creature of this world without desire to mar it half in mockery half in love he called her frozen heart later on you remember he called jehane bel vezer he was the nicknamer of europe in his day so now or almost so he saw her new come from her fathers sidea little flushed but very much the great small lady ma dame berengere of navarre the sun shines upon my frozen heart said bertran she gave him her hand to kiss no heart of yours am i bertran she said but chosen for a king a king lady whom then she answered a king to be my lord richard of poictou he clacked his tongue on his palate and bolted this pill as best he could bad was best he saw himself made newly so great a fool that he dared not think of it if he had known at that time of richards dealing with jehane saintpol you may be sure he would have squirted some venom but he knew nothing at all about it and as to the other affair even he dared not speak a great lord a hot lord a very strenuous lord he said in jerks it was all there was to say he is a prince who might claim a ladys love i suppose said berengere with considering looks ho ho and so he has cried bertran i assure your grace he is no novice many he has claimed and many have claimed him shall i number them i beg that you will not she said stiffening herself so bertran grinned his rage but he had one thing to say this much i will tell you princess the name i give him is yeaandnay beware of it he is ever of two minds hot head and cold heart flaming heart and chilled head he will be for god and the enemy of god will expect heaven and tamper with hell with rage he will go up laughing come down ho he will be for you and against you eager slow a wooer a scorner a singer of madrigals ah and a croaker afterwards there is no stability in him neither length of love nor of hate no bottom little faith berengere rose you vex yourself bertran and me also she said it is ill talking between a prince and his friend am i not your friend then my lady he asked her with bitterness you cannot be the friend of a prince bertran said berengere calmly his muttered o god the true word sufficed him for thought all his road from navarre he went as you know already to poictiers where richard was making festival with jehane but when unhappy liar he found out the truth it came too late to be of service to his designs don sancho he learned was beforehand with him even there fully informed of the outrage at gisors and the marriage at poictiers with very clear views of the worth of each performance bertran gnashing his teeth took up the service of the man he loathed gnashing his teeth he let richard kiss him in the lists and shower favours upon him when presents of stallions came from navarre he began to see what don sancho was about any meeting of richard and that profound schemer would have been bertrans ruin so when richard was king he judged it time to be off now here says abbot milo dealing with the same topics i make an end of bertran de born who did enough mischief in his life to give three kings wretchednessthe young king henry and the old king henry and the new king richard if he was not the thorn of anjou whose thorn was he some time afterwards he died alone and miserable having seen as he thought all his plots miscarry the object of his hatred do the better for his evil designs and the object of his love the better without them he was cast off his peers were at the holy war his enemy on a throne there had arisen a generation which shrugged at his eld and remained one which still thought him a misgoverned youth great poet he was great thief and a silly fool so theres an end of him let him be chapter xvi conversation in england of jehane the fair it was in the gules of august we read that king richard set out for his duchy and kingdom on horseback riding alone splendid in red and gold countess jehane in a litter his true brother and his halfbrother his bishops his chancellor and his friends with him each according to his degree they went by alencon lisieux and pont leveque to rouen and there they found the queenmother an unquenchable spirit one of richards first acts had been to free her from the fortress in which for ten years or more the old king had kept her there were no prisontraces upon her when she met her son and fixed her sons mistress with a calculating eye a lowbrowed swarthy woman heavily built with the wreck of great beauty upon her having fingers like the talons of a bird and a trapmouth it was not hard to see that into the rocky mortice where richard had been cast there went some grains of flint from her she had slow deliberate movements of the body but a darting mind she was a most passionate woman but frugal of her passion eking it out to cover long designs whether she loved or hatedand she could glow with either lust until she seemed incandescentshe went slowly to work the quicker she saw the slower she was reducing sight into possession with all this like her son richard she was capable of strong revulsions thus she had loved then hated king henry thus she was to spurn then to cling to jehane at rouen she did her best to crush the young girl to the pavement with her intolerable flatlidded eyes when jehane saw her stand on the steps of the church amidst the pomp of normandy and englandthree archbishops by her william marshal william longchamp the earls the baronage the knights heralds blowers of trumpets when at her example all this glory of church and state bent the knee to richard of anjou and he kneeling in turn kissed his mothers hand then rose and to the others gave his to be kissed when he vowed to her pledged to her known of her more secretly than of any passed through the blare of horns alone into the soaring navejehane shivered and crossed herself faltered a little and might have fallen her king was doing by her as she had prayed him but the scrutiny of the queenmother had been a dry gloss to the text she had been able to bear her forsaking with a purer heart but for the narrow eyes that witnessed it and gleamed one of her ladies magdalene coucy put an arm about her so countess jehane stiffened and jerked up her head and after that walked with no more faltering if she had seen as milo saw gilles de gurdun glowering at her from a corner it might have gone hard with her but she did not they crowned richard duke of normandy and to him came all the barons of the duchy one by one to do him homage and first the archbishop of rouen in whose allegiance was that same sir gilles but gilles knew very well that there could be no fealty from him to this robber of a duke gilles had seen jehane and when he could bear the sight no more for fear his eyes should bleed he went and walked about the streets to cool his head he swore by all the saints in the calendar of rouenand these are manythat he would close this account let him be torn apart by horses he would kill the man who had stolen his wife and killed his father and brother were he duke king or emperor of the west meantime in the church that goldenhaired duke set high on the throne of normandy received between his hands the hands of the normans and in a stall of the choir jehane prayed fervently for him with her arms enfolding her bosom gilles was seen again at harfleur when the king embarked for england he had a hood over his head but milo knew him by the little steady eyes and bar of black above when the great painted sails bellied to the offshore wind and the dragonstandard of england pointed the seaway northward into the haze milo saw gilles standing on the mole a little apart from his friends watching the galley which took jehane out of reach if milo found the normans like ginger in the mouth it is not to be supposed that the english suited him any better he calls them fogstewed says that they ate too much and were as proud of that as of everything else they did luckily he had very little to do with them though not much less perhaps than his master dry facts content him how the king disembarked at southampton and took horse how he rode through forests to winchester how there he was met by the bishop heard mass in the minster and departed for guildford thence again how through wood and heath they came to westminster and a fair church set in meadows by a broad streamto tell this rapidly contents him but once in london the story begins to concentrate it is clear there was danger for jehane king richard it seems caused her to be lodged in a place of nuns over the river in a place which is called in english lamehithe this was quite true danger there was as richard saw who knew his mother but he did not then know how quick with danger the times were the queenmother had upon her the letter of don sancho the wise and to her the politics of europe were an open book one holy war succeeded another and one king but what king that might be depended neither upon holiness nor war so much as on the way each was used marriage with navarre might push anjou across the mountains the holy war might lift it across the sea who was the yellowhaired king of the west whom they of the east foretold if not her goodly son should god be thwarted by a she hesitated not for a word but i hesitate if the queenmother was afraid of anything in the world it was of the devil in the race she had mothered it had thwarted her in their father but it cowed her in her sons most of all i think in richard she feared it because richard could be so cold a flamy devil as in young henry or a brimstone devil as in geoffrey of brittany or a spitfire devil as was johnswith these she could cope her lord had had them all but in richard she was shy of the bleak isolation the selfsufficing the hard chill core she dreaded it yet it drew her she was tempted to beat vainly at it for the passions sake and so in this case she dared to do she would cheerfully have killed the minion but she dared the king first when she opened to him the matter of don sanchos letter none knew better than richard that the matter might have been good yet he would have nothing to say to it madame his words were this is an idle letter if not impertinent don sancho knows very well that i am married already eh sire eh richard said the queenmother then he knows more than i i think not madame the king replied since i have this moment informed you the queen swallowed this then said this wife of yours richard who is not duchess of normandy will not be queen i doubt richards face grew haggard for the moment he looked old such again is the fact madame but the queen began richard looked at her so she ended there afterwards she talked with the archbishop of canterbury with the marshal with longchamp of ely and her son john all these worthies were pulling different ways each trying to get the rope to himself with that rope john hoped to hang his brother yet dearest madame he said richard cannot marry in navarre even if he were willing once he has been betrothed and has broken plight once he saw his mistress betrothed and broke her plight now he is wedded or says that he is suppose that you get him to break this wedlock will you give him another woman to deceive there is no more faithless beast in the world than richard your words prove that there is one at least said the queenmother with heat you speak very ill my son said john and he does very ill by the bread william marshal interposed i have seen much of the countess of anjou madame said this honest gentleman let me tell your grace that she is a most exalted lady he would have said more had the queenmother endured it but she cried out upon him anjou who dares put her up there madame said william it was my lord the king the queen fumed then the archbishop said she is nobly born of the house of saintpol i understand that she has a clear mind more cried the marshal she has a clear heart if she had nothing clear about her i have that which would bleach her white enough said the queenmother and longchamp who had said nothing at all grinned in the event the queen one day took to her barge crossed the river and confronted the girl who stood between england and navarre jehane who was sitting with her ladies at needlework was not so scared as they were like the nymphs of the hunting maid they all clustered about her showing the queenmother how tall she was and how nobly figured she flushed a little and breathed a little faster but making her reverence she recovered herself and stood with that curious look on her face half surprise half discontent which made men call her the sulky fair so the queenmother read the look no pouting with me mistress she said send these women away it is with you i have to deal do we deal singly madame said jehane then my ladies shall seek for yours the comforts of a discomfortable lodging i am sorry i have no better the queenmother nodded her people out of the room so she and jehane were left alone together mistress said the queenmother what is this between you and my son playing and kissing are to be left below the degrees of a throne let there be no more of it do you dare are you so hardy in the eyes as to look up to a kingly seat or measure your head for a kings crown jehane had plenty of spirit which a very little of this sort of talk would have fanned into a flame but she had irony too madame alas she said with a hint of shrugging if i have worn the counts cap i know the measure of my head the queenmother took her by the wrist my girl said she you know very well that you are no countess at all in my sons right but are what one of your nurture should not be and you shall understand that i am a plaindealer in such affairs when they concern this realm and have bled little heifers like you whiter than veal and as cold as most of the dead and will do it again if need be jehane did not flinch nor turn her eyes from considering her whitening wrist oh madame she says you will never bleed me i am quite sure of that alas it would be well if you could without offence why whom should i offend then the queen said sniffingyour ladyship a greater said jehane you think the king would be offended madame jehane said he could be offended but so would you be the queenmother tightened hold i am not easily offended mistress she said and smiled rather bleakly jehane also smiled but with patience not trying to get free her wrist my blood would offend you you dare not bleed me death in life the queen cried is there any but the king to stop me now madame jehane answered there is the spoken word against you the spirit of prophecy then her jailer saw that jehanes eyes were green and very steady this checked her who speaks who prophesies jehane told her the leper in a desert place saying beware the counts cap and the counts bed for so sure as thou liest in either thou art wife of a dead man and of his killer the queenmother a very religious woman took this saying soberly she dropped jehanes wrist stared at and about her looked up looked down then said tell me more of this my girl hey madame said jehane i will gladly tell you the whole the saying of the leper was very dreadful to me for i thought here is a man punished by god indeed but so near death as to be likely familiar with the secrets of death such a one cannot be a liar nor would he speak idly who has so little time left to pray in therefore i urged my lord richard by his good love for me to forgo his purpose of wedding me in poictiers but he would not listen but said that as he had stolen me from my betrothed it comported not with his honour to dishonour me so he wedded me and fulfilled both terms of the lepers prophecy then i saw myself in peril and was not at all comforted by the advice of certain nuns which was that although i had lain in the counts bed i had not lain but had knelt in the counts cap and that therefore the terms were not fulfilled i thought that foolishness and still think so but this is my own thought i have never rightly been in either as the leper intended for i do not think the marriage a good one if i am no wife then god pity me i have done a great sin but i am no countess of anjou so i give the prophet the lie on the other hand if i am put away by my lord the king that he may make a good marriage i shall be claimed again by the man to whom i was betrothed before and so the doom be in danger of fulfilment for look now madame the leper said wife of a dead man and his killer and there is none so sure to kill the king as sir gilles de gurdun alas alas madame to what a strait am i come who sought no ones hurt i have considered night and day what it were best to do since the king at my prayer left me and now my judgment is this i must be with the king though not the kings mie because so surely as he sends me away so surely will gilles de gurdun have me she stopped out of breath feeling some shame to have spoken so much the queenmother came to her at once with her hands out by my soul jehane she said you are a good woman never leave my son i never mean to leave him said jehane that is my punishment and i think his also his punishment my child why madame said jehane you think that the king must wed yes yes and to wed he must put me away yes yes child therefore although he loves me he may never have his dear desire and although i love him i may give him no comfort yet we can never leave each other for fear of the lepers prophecy but he must always long and i grieve that i think is punishment for a man and woman the queenmother sobbed terrible punishment for a little pleasant sin yet i doubtshe said politic through allyet i doubt my son being a fierce lover will have his way with thee jehane shook her head no means she said drawing in her breath no means madame i have his life to think of here pitying herself she turned away her face the queenmother came suddenly and kissed her they cried together jehane and the flinty old shrew of aquitaine a pact was made and sealed with kisses between these two women who loved king richard that jehane should do her best to further the navarrese match circumstance was her friend in this pious robbery of herself richard who stood so deep engaged in honour to god almighty could get no money busy as he was with one shift after another to redeem his credit busy also pushing on his coronation he yet continued to see his mistress most days either walking with her in the garden of the nuns house where she lodged or sitting by her within doors at these snatched moments there was a beautiful equality between them the girl no longer subject to the man the man more master of himself for being less master of her as often as not he sat on the floor at her feet while she worked at those agelong tapestries which her generation loved leaning his head back to her knee he would so lie and search her face and wonder to himself what the world to come could have more fair to show than this calm treasurer of lovely flesh this was at the time her chief glory that with all her richesfragrant allure soft warmth the delicacy nice luxury of her every part the glow the tincture the throbbing fireshe could keep a strong hand upon herself sway herself modestly have so much and give so little be so apt for a bridal and yet without a sigh play the nun if she being devirginate through me can cry herself virgin againthen cannot i by the king of heaven this was richards daythought a very mannish thought for women do not consider their own beauties so closely see no divinity in themselves and find a man to be a glorious fool to think one of them more desirable than another he never spoke this thought but worshipped her silently for the most part and she reading the homage of his upturned face steeled herself against the sweet flattery held her peace and in her fierce proud mind made endless plots against his in silence their souls conversed upon a theme never mentioned between them his restless quest of her face taught him much disposed him she with all the good guile of women to her hand waited judging the time then one day as they sat together in a window she suddenly slipped away from his hand dropped to her knees and began to pray for a while he let her alone finding the act as lovely as she but presently he stooped his face till it almost touched her cheek and tell me thy prayer dear heart let me pray also he whispered i pray for my lord the king she said let me pray but as he insisted urging leaning to her she drew her head back and lifted to his view her face blanched with pure patience o king christ she prayed take from my soiled hand this sacrifice she prayed to christ but looked at richard he dared speak for christ what sacrifice my child i give thee the hero who has lain upon my breast i give thee the marriagebed the cap of the count i give thee the kisses the clinging together the vows the long bliss where none may speak i give thee the language of love the strife the aftercalm the assurance the hope and the promise but i keep lord the memory of love as a hostage of thine king richard breathless now looked in her face it was that of a mild angel steadfast grave hued like fire acquainted with grief o godfraught o saint in the battle o dipped in the flame jehane jehane jehane quicken me so he cried in anguish of spirit quicken thee richard she said nay but thou art quick my king the cross hath made thee quick thou hast given more than i i will give all by thy direction he said for i know that thou wilt save my honour trust me there said jehane and let him kiss her cheek she got a great hold upon him by these means quick with the holy ghost or not there was no doubting the quickness of his mind here jehanes wit had not played her false he read her whole meaning she never let go the footing she had gained but in all her commerce with him walked a saint a maid ravished only by a great thought visibly to him she stood symbol of belief sacramental the fire on the altar the fine shy spirit of love lurking like a rockflower at the crosss foot and so this fire with which she led him like the torch she had held up to show him his earlier way lifted her and so she became indeed what she signified she stood very near the queenmother when richard was crowned and anointed king of the english unearthly pure with eyes like stars robed in dull red crowned herself with silver all those about her marking the respect which the old queen paid her scarce dared lift their eyes to her face the tall king stripped to the shirt was anointed then robed then crowned afterwards sat with orb and sceptre to receive homage jehane came in her turn to kneel before him but her work had been done that icy stream in the blood which is cause and proof at once of the kingly isolation was doubly in richard first of that name he beheld her kneeling at his knee knew her and knew her not she with her cold lips kissed his cold hand that day had love by her own desire been frozen and that which was to awaken it was itself numb in sleep on the third of september they crowned him king and found that he was to be king indeed on the same day the citizens of london killed all the jews they could find and richard banished his brother john from his dominions in england and france for three years and three days chapter xvii frozen heart and red heart cahors i suppose that the present relations of king richard and the countess of poictou as she chose to call herself now were as singular as could subsist between a strong man and beautiful woman both in love i am not to extenuate or explain but say once for all to the curious that she was never again to him nor had been since that day at fontevrault what a sister might not have been yet with all that it was evident to the world at large that he was a lover and she mistress of his mind not only implicitly so as witnessed their long intercourse of the eyes their quick glances stealthy watching of each other the little tender acts as the giving or receiving of a flower the brooding silences the praying at the same time or place but explicitly he pronounced himself her knight all his songs were of her he wrote to her many times a day and she answered his letters by her page and kept the latest of them always within her vest over against her heart she allowed herself more scope than he trusting herself further it is known that she treasured discarded things of his and went so far as to wear she the fairgirdled a studded belt of his made to fit her she was never without this rude monument of her former grace but this was the sumtotal of their bodily intercourse apart from speech of their spiritual ecstasies i have no warrant to speak though i believe these were very innocent she would not dare nor he care to indulge in so laxative a joy he conversed with her freely upon all affairs of moment there was no constraint on either side he was even merry in her company and astonishingly frank singular man the navarrese marriage was a common subject of their talk she spoke of it with serious mockery and he with mock seriousness from richard it was countess jehane when the chalkfaced spaniard reigns you must mend your manners and she might say beau sire madame berengere will never like your songs unless you sing of her all this served the girls private ends gradually and gradually she led him to see that thing as fixed she did it as it were on tiptoe for she knew what a shyer he was but luckily for her schemes the queenmother trusted her to the bottom said nothing and allowed nothing to be said meantime the affairs of the crusade conspired with jehane to drive richard once more to church if he got little money in england where abbeys were rich in corn but poor in pelf and the barons had been so prompt to rob each other that they could not be robbed by the kinghe got less in gaul eaten up by war for a hundred years you cannot bleed a stuck pig as king richard found england was empty of money he got men enough from one motive or another every english knight was willing to rifle the east he had ships enough but of what use ships and men if there was no food for them nor money to buy it he tried to borrow he tried to beg he tried what in a less glorious cause a plain man would call stealing king richard came not of a squeamish race and would have sold anything to any buyer pawned his crown or taken another mans to get the worth of a companys pay out of it fines escheats reliefs forfeitures wardships marriageshe heaped exaction on exaction with mighty little result when his mind was set he was inexorable insatiable without scruple what he got only sharpened his appetite for more king tancred of sicily owed the dowry of richards sister joan he swore he would wring that out of him to the last doit he offered the city of london to the highest bidder and lamented the slaughter of the jews when the tenders were few here was a position to be in his englishmen lay rotting in southampton town his ships in southampton water his normans and poictevins were overripe he as dry as an unpinched pear he saw to his infinite vexation his honour again in pawn and no means of redeeming it jehane with tears in her voice plied the navarrese marriage with more passion than she would ever have allowed herself to urge her own richard said he would think of it now i have him halfway jehane told the queenmother he was driven the other half by his banished brother john prince john bundled out of the country within a week of the coronation went to paris and a pocketful of mischief in which to put his hand king philip who should have been preparing for the east was listening to counsels much more to his liking conrad of montferrat was there with large white fingers explaining on the table and a large white face set as lightly as a mousetrap his italian mind with that strange capacity for subserving business with passion had a task of election here the marquess knew that richard would sooner help the devil than him to jerusalem not only on this account but on every conceivable account did he hate richard if he could embroil the two leaders of the crusade there was his affair philip would need him in paris also was saintpol fizzling with mischief and behind him whereever he went stalked gilles de gurdun murder in his heart the massive norman was a fine foil to the count they were the two poles of hatred the duke of burgundy was not there but conrad knew that he could be counted richard owed him so he said forty pounds besides richard had called him a spongeand it was true there lastly was des barres that fine frenchman ready to hate anybody who was not french and most ready to hate richard who had broken up the gisors wedding and put singlehanded all the guests to shame now this was a company after prince johns own heart standing next to the english throne he was an excellent footstool he felt the delicate position he was flattered at every turn the marquess found him most useful not only because he was on better terms with philip than himself could hope to be but because he understood him better john knew that there were two tender spots in that moody king and he knew which was the tenderer pardieu so conrads gross finger guided by johns probed the raw of philips selfesteem and found a rankling wound very proud flesh oh intolerable affront to the house of capet that a tall angevin robber should take up and throw away a daughter of france and then whistle you to a war in the east prince john you perceive knew where to rub in the salt the storm broke when king richard was again at chinon king philip sent messengerswilliam des barres the bishop of beauvais and stephen of meauxabout the homage due to him for normandy and all the french fiefs so far well king richard was very urbane as bland as such an incisive dealer could be he would do homage for normandy anjou and the rest on such and such a day but he added quietly i attach the condition that it be done at vezelay when i am there with my army for the east and he with his army the ambassadors demurred talking among themselves richard sat on immovable his hands on his knees presently the bishop of beauvais better soldier than priest stood out from his fellows and made this remarkable speech beau sire our lord the august king takes it very ill that you have so long delayed the marriage agreed upon solemnly between your grace and madame alois his sister therefore milo who was present says that he saw his master narrow his eyes so much that he seemed to have none at all but sockets and blank balls in them like statues the bishop of beauvais apparently did not observe it therefore he went on orotund our lord the king desires that the marriage may be celebrated before he sets out for acre and the blessed work in those parts other matters there are for settlement such as the title of the most illustrious marquess of montferrat to the holy throne in which my master is persuaded your grace will conform to his desires this and other matters a many the king got up too many matters bishop of beauvais he said for my appetite which is poor just now there is no debate say this to your master i pay homage where it is due if by his own act he prove that it is not due i will not be blamed as to the marquess i will never get a kingdom for him and i marvel that king philip can make no better choice than of a man whose only title is rape and can get no better ally than the slanderer of his sister and upon the subject of that unhappy lady i tell you this upon the holy gospels that i will marry king philip himself before i will marry her and so much he very well knows i am upon the point to depart in the fulfilment of my vows let your master please himself he is a bad sailor he tells me am i to think him a bad soldier and if so in such a cause what sort of a christian what sort of a king am i to think him the bishop his diplomacy at an end grew very red he had nothing to say des barres must needs put in his word bethink you fair sire he says the marquess is of my kindred oh i do think des barres the king answered him and i am very sorry for you but i am not answerable for the trespasses of your ancestry des barres glared about him as if he hoped to find a reply among the joists my lord he began again it is laid in charge upon us to speak the mind of france our master is greatly put about in his sisters affair and not he only but his allies with him among whom sire you must be pleased to reckon my lord john of mortain he had done better to leave john out richards eyes burnt him and his voice cut let my brother john have her who knows her rights and wrongs as for you des barres take back to your master your windy conversation and this also that i allow no man to dictate marriages to me so said he broke up the audience and would see no more of the ambassadors they in two or three days departed with what grace they had in them the immediate effect of this you may perhaps expect was to drive richard all the road to navarre he was profoundly offended so much so that not jehane herself dared speak to him as he always did when his heart mastered his head he acted now alone and at once in the heart we choose to seat rage of all sorts the purest and the most base the most fervent and the most cold it so happened that there was business for our king in gascony congenial business guillem de chisi a vassal of his had been robbing pilgrims so guillem was to be hanged richard went swiftfoot to cahors hanged guillem in front of his own gatehouse then wrote letters to pampluna inviting king sancho to a conference upon many affairs touching almighty god and ourselves thus he put it and king sancho needed no accents to the vowels the wise man set out with a great train his virgin with him the day of his expectation king richard heard mass in a most unchristian frame of mind there was no sursum corda for him but he knelt like a stone image inert and cold from breast to backbone said nothing moved not how differently do men and women stand at the gate of sorrows not far off him knelt countess jehane who in her hands again it may be said held up her bleeding heart the luxury of this strange sacrifice made the girl glow like a fire opal she was in a fierce ecstasy her lips parted eyes halfshut she breathed short she panted there is no moralising over these things love is a hearty feeder and thrives on a fastday as well as on a gaudy by fasting come visions tremors swoonings and such like dainty perversions of sense but part of jehanes exaltation you must know came of another spur she had a sure and certain hope she knew what she knew though no other even guessed it with that to carry she could lift up her head no woman in the world need grudge the usurper of place while she may go on carrying her title below the heart more of this presently two hours before noon in that clear october weather over the brown hills came a company of knights on white destriers with their pennons flying and white cloaks over their mail the outriders of navarre they were met in the meadow of the charterhouse and escorted to their quarters which were on the right of the kings pavilion that same pavilion was of purple silk worked over with gold leopards the size of life it had two standards beside it the dragon of the english the leopards of anjou the pavilion of king sancho was of green silk with silver emblemsa heart a castle a stag saint george saint michael saint james the great and saint martin with his split cloaka shining place before whose door stood twenty ladies in white their hair let loose to receive madame berengere and minister to her chief among these was countess jehane king richard was not in his own pavilion but would greet his brother king in the hail of the citadel so in due time after three soundings on the silver trumpets and much curious ceremony of bread and salt came don sancho the wise in a meinie of his peers very noble on a roan horse and dame berengere his daughter in a winecoloured litter with her ladies about her on ambling palfreys the colour of burnt grass when they took this little princess out of her silken cage the first face she looked for and the first she saw was that of jehane saintpol who received her courteously jehane always wore sumptuous clothing being aware no doubt that her person justified the display for this time she had dressed herself in silver brocade let her bosom go bare and brought the strong golden plaits round about in her favourite fashion upon her head she had a coronet of silver flowers in her neck a blue jewel all the colour she had lay in her hue of faint rose in her hair like corn in the sun in her eyes of green in her deep red lips but her height free build and liberal curves marked her out of a bevy that glowed in a more southern fashion she had to stoop overmuch to kiss berengeres hand and this made the little spaniard bite her lip berengere herself was like a bell in a stiff dress of crimson sewn with great pearls in leaf and scrollwork from the waist upwards she was the handle of the bell this immoderation of her clothes the fright she was inso nervous at first that she could hardly standbecame her very ill she was quite white in the face with solemn black eyes glazed and expressionless her little hands stuck out from her sides like a puppets handsome as no doubt she was she looked a doll beside the tall jehane who could have dandled her comfortably on her knee she spoke no language but her own and that not the langue doc but a blurred dialect of it rougher even than gascon conversation was very difficult on these terms at first the princess was shy then when she grew curious and forgot her qualms jehane was shy berengere fingered the jewel in the others neck turned it about wanted to know whence it had come whose gift it was etc etc jehane blushed to report it the gift of a friend whereupon the princess looked her up and down in a way that made her hot all over but when it came to the time of meeting king richard berengeres nervous fears came crowding back the poor little creature began to shake clung to jehane how tall is the king how tall is he taller than you she asked looking up at the picard girl oh yes madame he is taller than i they say he is cruel did youdo you think him cruel madame no no he is a poet they say has he made many songs of me jehane murmured her doubts exquisitely confused fifty poets continued nestling berengere have made songs of me there is a wreath of songs they call me frozen heart do you know why they say i am too proud to love a poet but if the poet is a king i have a certain fear just now i think i will she took jehanes armno no she drew away you are too talli will never take your armi am ashamed i beg you to go before me lead the way so jehane went first of all the ladies who led the queen to the king king richard who himself loved to go splendidly sat upon his throne in the citadel looking like a statue of gold and ivory upon his head was a crown of gold he had a long tunic of white velvet round his shoulders a great cope of figured gold brocade work of genoa and very curious his face and hands were paler than their wont was his eyes frosty blue like a winter sea that is made bright not warm by the sun he sat up stiffly hands on knees and all about him stood the lords and prelates of the most sumptuous court in the west king sancho the wise was ready to stoop all his wisdom and burden of years before such superb state as this but the moment his procession entered the hall richard went down from his dais to meet it kissed him on the cheek asked how he did and set the careworn man at his ease as for berengere he took from her of both cheeks held her small hand spoke in her own language honourable and cheerful words drove a little colour into her face screwed a word or two out of her afterwards there was high mass sung by the archbishop of auch and a great banquet served in the cloistergarth of the charterhouse under a red canopy because the hail of the citadel was too small at this feast king richard played a great partcheerful easy of approach making phrases like swords giving and taking the talk without any advantage of his rank his jokes had a bite in them as when he said of bertran that the best proof of the excellence of his verses was that he had undoubtedly made them himself or of averrhoes the arabian physician and infidel philosopher that the man equalised his harms by poisoning with his drugs the bodies of those whose minds had been tainted by his heresies but he was the first to set the laugh against himself and had a flash of dame berengeres fine teeth before he had been ten minutes at table after dinner the kings and their ministers went into debate and then it seemed that richard had got up from his meat perverse he would only talk of one thing namely sixty thousand gold besants on this he harped maddeningly with calculations of how much victual the sum would buy of the weight in ounces of its content in sacks in a barn of the mileage of the coins set edge to edge and so on and so on don sancho sat winking and fidgeting in his chair and talked of his illustrious daughter milled edges they should have these besants says king richard whereof allowing say three hundred and fifty to a piece we have a surprising total ofhere he figured on the table and king sancho pursued his drift until richard brought his hand slamming downof oneandtwenty million ridges of gold upon the treasure he concluded with a waggish look agreement was as hard as to prolong parallels to a point yet this went on for some two hours until worn frail by such futilities the navarrese chancellor plumply asked his brother of england if king richard would marry marry cried he when they brought him down the question yes i am all for marrying i will marry oneandtwenty million milled edges our saviour they reported to king sancho the substance of these words and asked him if such and such would be the dowry of his lady daughter ask king richard if he will have her with that in hand and the territories demarked said don sancho this was done richard grew grave made no more jokes he turned to milo who happened to be near him where is the little lady he asked him milo looked out of the window my lord he said she is in the orchard at this moment and i think the countess is with her richard blenched as if he had been struck with a whip collecting himself he turned and looked down through the window to the leafy orchard below he looked long and saw as milo had seen the two girls the tall and the little the crimson and the white standing near together in the shade jehane had her head bent for berengere had hold of the jewel in her bosom then berengere put her arms round the others neck and leaned her head where the jewel lay jehane stooped her head lower and lower cheek touched cheek at this king richard turned about despair set hard was on his face he said in a dry voice tell the king i will do it in the tedious negotiations of the next few days it was arranged that the princess should await the queenmother at bayonne and sail with her and the fleet to sicily there king richard would meet and marry her what had passed between her and jehane in the orchard who knows they kissed at parting but jehane neither told richard nor did he ask her why berengere had lain her cheek upon her bosom or why herself had stooped so low her head womens ways so red heart made her sacrifice and frozen heart suffered the sun and he they called later lionheart went out to fight saladin and less open foes than he book ii the book of nay chapter i the chaffer called mategrifon differing from the mantuan as much in sort as degree i sing less the arms than the man less the panoply of some christian king offended than the heart of one in its urgent private transports less treaties than the agony of treating less personages than persons the actors rather than the scene arms pass like the fashion of them today or tomorrow they will be gone but men live their secret springs what they have always been how the two kings then smeared over their strifes at vezelay how john of mortain was left biting his nails and alois weeping at the foot of a cross how christian armies like dusty snakes dragged their lengths down the white shores of rhone and how some took ship at marseilles and some saved their stomachs at the cost of their shoes of king richards royal galley trenchemer a red ship with a red bridge and the dragon at the mast of the shields that made her bulwarks terrible of who went adventurous and who remained of a fleet that lay upon the waters like a flock of seagullscountless now at rest now beating the sea into spumy wrath of what way they made qualms they suffered prayers they said in their extremity vows they made and afterwards broke thoughts they had and afterwards were ashamed ofof these and all such things i must be silent if i am to make a good end to my history it shall be enough for you that the red ship held king richard and king richard his own thoughts and that never far from him in a ship called li chastel orgoilous sat jehane with certain women of hers nursing her hope and a new and fearful wonder she had prayer sits well in women and agelong watching one imagines that jehane never left the poop through those long white days those burning nights but could always be seen or felt a still figure sitting apart elbow on knee chin in handlike a norn reading fate in the starred web of the night in the dark watches when the ships lay drifting under the stars or lurched forward as the surges drove them on and the tinkling of the water against the side was all the sound some womans voice not jehanes would be heard singing faint and far off some little shrill and winding prayer saincte catherine vela la nuict qui gagne they would hear and hang upon the cadence at such times richard stretched upon his lionskin would raise himself and lift up his face to the immense and with his noble voice make the darkness tremble as he sang domna dels angels regina domna roza ses espina domna joves enfantina domna estela marina de las autras plus luzens but so soon as his voice filled the night the womans faltered and died and he holding on for a stave or more would stop on a note that had a wailing fall and the lapping of the waves or cry of hidden birds take up the rule again this did not often obtain mostly he watched out the night sleeping little talking none but revolving in his mind the great deeds to do by day he was master of the fleet an admirable seaman who knowing nothing of ships business before he embarked dared not confess so much to himself richard must be leader if he was to be undertaker at all so he led his fleet from his first hour with it and brought it safely into the roadstead they made messina prosperously a white city cooped within walls with turrets and belfries and shining domes stooping sharply to the violet sea king philip with his legions was to have come by land as far as genoa and was not expected yet awhile nor was there any sign of the queenmother of berengere or of the convoy from navarre a landing was made in the early morning before the sicilians were well awake richards army was in camp the camp entrenched and a most salutary gallows set up just outside it with a thief upon it as a warning to his brothers of sicily so far good the next thing was an embassy to king tancred the sicilian king which demanded the person of queen joan richards sister her dowry a golden table twelve foot long a silk tent and a hundred galleys fitted out for two years this despatched richard entertained himself with his hawks and dogs and with short excursions into calabria on one of these he went to visit the saintly abbot joachim at once prophet and philosopher and man of cool sense and on another to kill wild boars when he came back in october from the second of these he found matters going rather ill king tancred avoided seeing him sent no tables nor ships nor dowry he did send queen joan and queen joans bed moreover because she had been queen of sicily he sent a sack of gold coins for her entertainment but he did not propose to go any further richard seeing what sort of courses his plans were likely to take crossed once more into calabria attacked a fortified town which the sicilians had settled turned the settlers out and established his sister there with jehane her shipload of ladies and a strong garrison then he returned to messina certainly he saw his camp there could be of no long tenure the grifons as they called the inhabitants were about it like hornets not a day passed without the murder of some man of his or an ambush which cost him a score thieving was a courtesy raiding an amenity in a grifon it appeared richard hoping yet for the dowry and a peaceful departing had laid a strict command that no harm should be done to any one of them unless he should be caught bloodyhanded well and good writes milo but this meant to say that no man might scratch himself for fear he should kill a louse nature could not endure such a direction so richard then whose own temper was none of the longest let himself go fell upon a party of these brigands put half to the sword and hanged the other half in rows before the landward gate of messina you will say that this did not advance his treaty with king tancred but in a sense it did when the messenians came out of their gates to attack him in open field it was found and reported by gaston of bearn who drove them in with loss that william des barres and the count of saintpol had been with them each heading a company of knights richard flew into a royal and an angevin rage he swore by gods back that he would bring the walls flat and so he did this is the work of that little pale devil of france then he said a likely beginning by my soul now let me see if i can bring two kings to reason at once he used the argument of the long arm bringing up his engines from the ships he pounded the walls of messina to such purpose that he could have walked in barefoot in two or three places king tancred came in person to sue for peace but richard wanted more than dowry by this time the peace you shall have he said is the peace of god which passeth understanding and for which i take it you are not yet ready unless you bring hither with you philip of france this the unfortunate tancred really could not do but he did bring proxies of philips saintpol came des barres and the bishop of beauvais with his russet soldiers face king richard sat considering these worthy men ah now saintpol you are playing a good part in this christian adventure i think he broke out after a time saintpol squared his jaw if i had caught you in your late sally my friend richard went on i should have hanged you on a tree knight or no knight why fool do you think your shameful brother worth so much treachery with him before your eyes can you do no better i hope so get you back and tell king philip this he and i are vowed to honesty but if he breaks faith again i have that in me which shall break him as for you bishop of beauvaisone saw the old warpriest blinki know nothing of your part in this business and am willing to think charitably if you an old man have any of the grace of god left in you bestow some of it on your master teach him to serve god as you serve him beauvais i will try to be content with that he turned to des barres the finest soldier of the three william he said more gently for he really liked the man i hope to meet you in a better field and side by side but if face to face again william and he lifted his hand beware of me none of them had a word to say but with troubled faces left the presence which shows to some mens thinking that richards strength lay in his cause that was not the opinion of des barres nor is it mine meeting them afterwards when he made a pact of friendship and alliance with tancred and renewed that which he had had with philip he showed them a perfectly open countenance nevertheless he took possession of messina as he had said he would and built a great tower upon the wall which he called mategrifon then he sent for his sister and jehane and kept a royal christmas in the conquered city trouble was not over there were constant strifes between nation and nation man and man winter storms delayed the queenmother richard fretted and fumed at the wasting of his force but saw not the worst of the matter if vice was eating his army jealousy was eating philips sour little heart and rage that of saintpol saintpol with gurdun to back him had determined to kill the english king with them went or was ready to go des barres he was not such a steady hater by any means some men seek temptation others fall under it des barres was of this kind of temptation there was a plenty since richard was the most fearless of men when he had forgiven an injury it did not exist for him any more he was glad to see des barres glad to play talk grumble or swear with hima most excellent enemy one day idling home from a hawking match he got tilting with the frenchman with reeds for lances neither seemed in earnest until richards horse slipped on a loose stone and threw him this was near the gate you should have seen the change in des barres hue hue passavant he yelled possessed with the devil of destruction and came pounding at richard as if he would ride over him at the battlecry a swarm of fellowsfrenchmen and brabanterscame out and about with pikes richard was on his feet by that time perfectly advised what was astir he was alone but he had a sword this he drew and took a stride or two towards des barres who had pulled up short of him and was panting the pikemen who might have hacked him to pieces paused for another word a second of time passed without it and richard knew he was safe he went up to des barres learn des barres he said that i allow no cries about my head save those for saint george sire said des barres i am no man of yours it is truly said replied richard but i will dub you one and he smote him with the flat of his sword across the cheek the blood leapt after the sword soul of a virgin cried des barres white as cloth except for the broad weal on his face your soul against mine graceless dog said the king another word and i pull you down just then who should come riding out of the gate but gilles de gurdun armed capapie here my lord said des barres clearing his throat comes a gentleman who has sought your grace with better cause than mine who is your gentleman richard asked him it is de gurdun sire a norman knight whose name should be familiar i know him perfectly said richard he turned to one of the bystanders saying fetch that gentleman to me the man ran nimbly to meet de gurdun des barres watching narrowly saw gilles start saw him look almost saw the bracing of his nerves what exactly followed was curious gilles moved his horse forward slowly king richard standing in leather doublet and plumed cap waited for him his arms folded des barres on horseback an enemy the bystanders tattered savage highfed men enemies also in front the most implacable enemy of all when de gurdun was within spearreach he stopped his horse and sat looking at the king richard returned the look it was an eyeing match soon over gurdun swung off the horse threw the rein to a soldier and tried footing it the steady duel of the eyes continued until gilles was actually within swords distance here he stopped once more finally gave a queer little grunt and went down on one knee des barres sighed as he eased his heart the tension had been terrible richard said de gurdun stand up and answer me you seek my life as i understand is it so sir gilles began to stammer no man has loved the lawno knight ever loved lady and so on but richard cut him short answer me man he said in a voice which was nearly as dry as his fathers do you wish for my life king said gilles his great emotion lending him dignity if i do is it a strange matter you have had my fathers and brothers you have mine in your hand you corrupted and then stole my beloved are these no griefs richard grew impatient he could never bear waiting do you wish my life he asked again gilles was overwrought by god on high but i do wish it he cried out almost whimpering king richard threw down his sword take it then you fool he said you talk too much a silence fell upon the party so profound that the cicala in the dry hedge shrilled to pierce the ear richard stood like a stock with des barres gaping at him gurdun was all of a tremble but swung his sword about in his swordhand after a while he took a deep breath a fumbling step forward and des barres leaning out over the saddle caught him by the surcoat drop that man des barres said richard without moving his eyes from the norman des barres obeyed and as the silence resumed gilles began twitching his sword again when a lizard rustled in the grass a man started as if shot gilles gave over first threw his sword away with a sob god ha mercy i cannot i cannot he fretted and stood blinking the tears from his eyes richard picked up his weapon and returned it to him you are brave enough my friend he said for better work go and do better in syria there is no better work for me sir said gurdun unless you can justify yourself i never justify myself said richard give me my sword de gurdun gave it him richard sheathed it went to his horse mounted rode away at walking pace nobody moved till he was out of sight then said des barres with a high oath i could serve that king if he would let me god damn him said gilles de gurdun for his part it was near the end of january when they sighted over sea the painted sails of the queen mothers galley her fleet anchored in the roads and the lady came ashore she had two interviews one with her son one with jehane but she did not choose to see her daughter queen joan a very handsome free lady marriage cried king richard when this was broached this is no time to talk of marriage i have waited six months and now the lady must wait a while other six if needs be we leave this accursed island in two days between my friends and my enemies i have fought the length and breadth of it twice over am i to spend my whole host killing christians a little more inactivity good mother and i shall be in league with the soldan against philip bring the lady to acre and i will marry her there no no richard said the queenmother i am needed in england i cannot come then let joan take her said the king the queenmother knowing him very well tried him no further she sent for jehane and held her close in talk for nearly an hour never leave my son jehane was the string she harped on never leave him for good or ill weather mated or unmated never leave him never in life madame said jehane then bit her lip lest she should utter what her mind was full of but the queenmother had no eyes pray for him she said and jehane i pray hourly madame then the queen kissed her on both cheeks and in such kindness they parted chapter ii of what jehane looked for and what berengere had milo the abbot writes when the spring airs moving warmly over the earth ruffled the surface of the deep and that to a tune so winning that there was no thought of the treachery below we took to the ships and steered a course southeast by south this was in the quindenes of easter the two queens if i may call them so of whom one had been and one hoped to be of that estate joan and berengere went in a great ship which they call a dromond a heavytimbered ship carrying a crowd of sail with them by request of madame berengere went countess jehane not by any request of her own the king himself led her aboard and by the hand into the state pavilion on the poop madame he said to his affianced i bring you your desired mate use her as you would use me for if i have a friend upon earth it is she oh sire says berengere i am acquainted with this lady she has nothing to fear from me queen joan said nothing being afraid of her brother so madame jehane kissed the hands of the pair of queens meekly kneeling to each in turn and so far as i know she did them faithful service through all the mischances of a voyage whereon every woman and every other man was horribly sick having made the pharos in favourable weather and kept mount gibello and the wild calabrian coast upon our lee as is fitting we stood out for the straight course over the immense waste of water now was no more land to be seen at either hand but the sky fitted close upon the edges of the sea like a dome of glass on a mans forehead there was neither cover from the sun nor hidingplace from the prying concourse of the stars the wind came searchingly the waters stirred beneath it or being driven heaped themselves up into towers of ruin the cordage flacked the strong ribs creaked like a beast overburdened the whole ship groaned wallowing in a seatrough without breath to climb so we endured for many days a straggling host of men ordinarily capable powerless now beneath that dumb tyrant the sky where else could be our refuge we all looked to king richardby day to his royal ensign by night to the great wax candle which he always had lighted and stuck in a lantern his commands were shouted from ship to ship over two miles or more of sea if any strayed or dropped behind we layto that he might come up but very often after a days idle rolling we knew that the sea had claimed some boatload of our poor souls and went on the galleys kept touch with the dromonds enclosing them as it were within the cusps of a new moon and so driving them forward to see this light of our kings moving now fast now slow now up now down restlessly over the field of the night was to remember the god of the israelites who for their sakes and ours became a pillar of fire at that season and transformed himself into a tall cloud in the daytime busy as it was this point of light it only figured the unresting spirit of the king careful of all these children of his ordering the hosts of the lord storms drove us at length on to the island of crete where minos once had his kingly habitation and his wife died of pleasure again they drove us more unfortunately out of our course upon the inhospitable coasts of rhodes where the salt wind suffers no trees to live nor safe anchorage to be nor shelter from the ravage of the sea in this vexed place there was no sign of land but a long line of surf beating upon a rocky shore the mist of spray and blown sand spars of drowned ships innumerable anxious flocks of birds here was no roadstead for us yet here but for the signal providence of heaven we had likely all have perished as many did perish miserably failing at once of purpose the sacraments of christ and reasonable beds the fleet was scattered wide no ship could see his neighbour we called on the king on the saviour on the father of all but deep answered to deep and the prayer of so many christians as it appeared skilled little to change the eternal purposes of god then one inspired among us climbed up to the masthead having in his teeth a piece of the true cross set in a silver heart and called aloud to the wild weather save lord we perish as was said of old by very sacred persons to which palpable truth so urgently declared an answer was vouchsafed not indeed according to our full desires yet doubtless level with our deserts the wind veered to the north and though it abated nothing of its force preserved us from the teeth of the rocks before it now under bare poles without need of oars we drove to the southward and while a little light still endured descried a great mountainous and naked coast rising out of the heaped waters which we knew to be the land of cyprus off the western face of this dark shore in a little shelter at last we layto and tossed all night next day in fairer weather hoisting sail we made a good haven defended by stout seawalls a mole and two lighthouses these were of a city called limasol upon my galley at least there was one who sang lauda sion whose tune before had been adhaesit pavimento when he rested tired eyes upon the clustered spires of a white city smokeless and asleep in the early morning light so far without weariness i hope milo may have conducted the reader in relation to the sea you may take him for an expert in the terrors he describes not so in cyprus war tempts him to prolixity to classical allusion even to hexameters of astonishingly loose joints every stroke of his heros swordarm seems to him of weight no doubt it was once but not in a chronicle of this sort where the cypriote gests must take a lowly place among others fair and foul of this kingerrant let me put milo on the shelf for a little and abridge i tell you then that the emperor of cyprus by name isaac was a thinfaced man with high cheekbones a greek of the greeks he undervalued what he had never seen precisely for that reason when heralds went up to nikosia to announce the comingin of king richard isaac mumbled his lips prutt he said i am the emperor what have i to do with your kings richard showed him that with one king he had plenty to do by assaulting limasol and putting armies to flight in the plains about nikosia shall i sing the battle of the fifty against five thousand tell how king richard with precisely half a hundred knights came cantering against the sun and a host as gay and debonair as to a driving of stags they say that he himself led the charge covered in a wonderful silken surcoat colour of a bullfinchs breast and wrought upon in black and white heraldry they say that at the sight of the pensils aflutter at the sound of the huntinghorns the grifons let fly a shaft apiece then threw down their bows and scattered but the knights caught them isaac was on a hill to watch the battle who is that marvellous tall knight who seems to be swimming among my horse splendour it is rikardos king of the west they told him reputed a fierce swimmer he drowns he drowns cried the emperor as the red plumes were whelmed in black nay but he dives rather majesty he heard the deathshouts he saw white faces turned his way then the mass was cleft asunder blown off and dispersed like the sparks from a smithy the thing was of little moment in a time of much there was no fighting left in the cypriotes after that sunny mornings work nikosia fell and the emperor isaac in silver chains heard from his prisonhouse the shouts which welcomed the emperor richard these things were accomplished by the first week in may then came guy of lusignan with bad news of acre and worse of himself philip was before the town montferrat with him montferrat had the archdukes of austria as well as french support with these worthies and the ravished wife of old king baldwin for titledeed he claimed the throne of jerusalem and king guy of lusignan but for the name of the thing was of no account at all guy said that the siege of acre was a foppery king philip was ill or thought he was montferrat was treating with saladin the french knights openly visited the saracen women and the duke of burgundy got drunk what else could he get poor fool asked richard then said but i promise you this montferrat shall never be king of jerusalem while i livenot because i love you my friend but because i love the law i shall come as soon as i can to acre when i have done here the things which must be done he meant his marriage little madame berengere was lodged as became her in the emperors palace at limasol having with her queen joan of sicily and among her women the young fair lady jehane none too fair poor girl by this time berengere herself who was not very intelligent remarked her and gave her the cold shoulder as day swallowed up day and richard at his affairs gave her no thought or at least no sign jehanes condition became an abominable eyesore to the queendesignate so queen joan plucked up her courage age to the point and seeking out her brother let him know that she had tidings for his private ear i do not admit that i have such an ear said richard it is no part of a kings baggage yet by all means name your tidings my sister dear sire said joan it appears that you have sown a seed and must look before long for the harvest the king laughed god knows i have sown enough seeds but mostly they come up tares i am apt to find my harvesting is of little worth what now sister beau sire says the queen i know not how you will take it your bonamy the picardy lady is with child and not so far from her time neither my sister berengere is greatly offended king richard began to tremble but whether from the ague which was never long out of him or from joy or from trouble who knows oh sister he said oh sister are you very sure of this i was sure of it replied the lady the moment i saw her in the autumn at messina but now your question is not worth the asking the king abruptly left his sister and went over to the queens side of the palace berengere was sitting upon a balcony all her ladies with her but jehane a little apart when the king was announced all rose to their feet he looked neither right nor left of him but fixedly at jehane with a high bright flush upon his sharp face and fever sparks in his eyes to these signals jehane because of her great exaltation flew the answering flags richard touched berengeres hand with the hair on his lip to jehane he said come ma mye and led her out of the balcony this was not as it should have been but richard used to his way took it and richard moved could move bigger mountains than those of ceremony he lunged forward along the corridors jehane following as she might led by the hand but not against her will no doubt she was with child no doubt she was glorious on that account she was a very proud girl alone those two who had loved so fondly gazed each at the work wrought upon the other without a word said the king all luminous with love and she all dewy if soul spoke to soul ever in this world said richards soul o vase that bearest the pledge of my love and hers o strong wine that brimmest in my cup he came forward and embraced her with his arm he felt her heart beat he guessed her pride he felt her thrill he knew his own defeat he felt her so strong and salient under his handso strong so fullbudded so hopeful of fruitthat despair of her loss seized him again terrible rage he sickened while in her the warm blood leaped he wanted everything she nothing in the world he the king of men was the bond she the castoff minion she this jehane saintpol was the free so god making war upon the great rights the balances of this world but he was extraordinarily gentle with her he gripped himself and throttled the animal close gaining grace as he went his heart throve upon its own blood balm was shed on his burning face he sucked peace as it fell then he too discerned the god near by to him too came with beating wings the pure young love that best of all which hath no needs save them of spending his voice was hushed to a boys murmur jehane ma mye is it true i am the mother of a son she said give god the glory but she said he hath given it to me her face was turned to where god might be richard looking down kissed her on the mouth tremblingly they kissed and long not as young lovers but as spouse and spouse drinking their common joy after a while his present troubles came thronging back and he said bitterly ah child thou art widowed of me while yet we both live yet it was in thy power to be mother of a king said she leaning her head on his breast every woman that beareth a child is mother of a king but not every womans child hath a king to his father thus it is with me richard who am doubly blessed ah god he cried poignantly concerned ah god jehane see what trammels i have enmeshed us in thee in one net and me in another so that neither can i help thee being roped down to this work nor thou thyself trapped by my fault how shall i do lo my sin my sin i cried yea and now cometh god and nay king richard he saith the sin is mine and the burden of the sin is thine is this a horrible thing jehane smiled up in his face and dost thou think it richard a burden so grievous she said to be mother of thy son dost thou think that the world can be harsh to me after that or that in the life to come there will be no remembrance to make the long days sweet she looked very proudly upon him smiling all the time she put her hands up and crowned his head with them oh my dear life my pride and my master said jehane let all come to me that must come now i am rich above all my desires and my lowliness has been of no account with god now let me go blessing his name he would not let her go but still looked earnestly down at her struggling with himself against himself i must be married jehane says he presently and she in a good hour my lord it is an accursed hour he said nothing but ill can come of it lord said she thou art vowed to this work i know it very well he replied but a man does as he can you my king richard do as you will said jehane so he kissed her and let her go among the multitudinous affairs now heaped upon himbusiness of his new empire and his old business of guys business of the war business of marriagehe set first and foremost this business of jehanes he removed her from the queens house gave her house and household of her own it was in limasol a pleasant place overlooking the sea and the ships a square white house set deep in myrtle woods and oleanders once more the countess of poictou had her seneschal chaplain ladies of honour that done he fixed saint pancras day for his marriage had the ships got out furnished and appointed for sea the night before saint pancras he sent for abbot milo in a hurry milo found him walking about his room taking long carefully accurate strides from flagstone to flagstone he continued this feverish devotion for some minutes after his confessors comingin and seeing him deep in thought the good man stood patient by the doorway so presently richard seemed aware of him stopped in mid walk and looking at him said milo continence is i suppose of all virtues the most excellent milo prepared to expatiate undoubtedly sire it is so because of all virtues the least comfortable saint chrysostom indeed goes so far as to declare but richard broke in and therefore milo it is urged upon the clergy by the ordinances of many honourable popes and patriarchs distinguo sire said milo distinguo there are other reasons it is written so run that ye may obtain now no man can run after the prize we seek if he carrieth a woman on his back and that for two reasons first because she is so much dead weight and second because a woman is so made that if her bearer did achieve the reward she would immediately claim a share in it but that is no part of the divine plan as i understand it let us talk of the laity milo said the king abstractedly if one of them set up for a runner should he not be a virgin lord replied the abbot if he can but that is not so convenient how not so asked king richard my lord milo said if all the laity were virgins there would soon be no laity at all and then there would be no priestsa state of affairs not provided for by the holy church moreover the laity have a kingdom in this world but the religious not of this world now this world is too excellent a good place not to be peopled and god hath appointed a pleasant way said the king a way of sorrow and shame not so sire said milo but a way of honour and if i rejoice that the same way is before your grace i am not alone in happiness a kings business said richard is to govern himself wisely having paid his debts and his people wisely it may be that he should get heirs if none are but if heirs there be then what is his business with more why should his son be better king than his brother for example lord milo admonished a king who is sure of himself will make sure of his issue that too is a kings business said richard moodily who is sure of himself he turned away his head bidding milo a good night as the abbot made his reverence he added i am to be married tomorrow i devoutly hope so said the good man and then your grace will have a surer hope than in your graces brother get you to bed milo richard said and let me be alone married he was so far as the church could provide in the basilica of limasol with the bishop of salisbury to celebrate vassals of his and allies great lords of three realms bishops and noble knights filled the church and saw the rites done high above them afterwards before the altar he sat crowned and vested in purple holding in his right hand the sceptre of his power and the orb of his dominion in his left hand then berengere daughter of navarre kneeling before him was by him thrice crowned queen of england empress of cyprus duchess of normandy but she never got upon her little dark head the red cap of anjou which had covered up jehanes gold hair jehane was neither at the church nor at the great feast that followed she on richards bidding was in her ship li chastel orgoilous whose head swayed to the running tide but a great feast was held at which queen berengere sat by the king in a gold chair and was served on knees by the chief officers of the household the kingdom and the duchy also after dinner full and free homage was done hera desperate long ceremony the little lady had great dignity and if they found her stiff it is to be hoped they remembered her very young but although everybody saw that richard was in the clutches of his ague throughout these performances so much so that when he was not talking his teeth chattered in his head and his hand spilt the wine on its way to the mouthnone were prepared for what was to come unless such intimates as gaston of bearn or mercadet his gascon con captain may have known it at the close of the homagegiving he rose up in his throne threw back his purple robe and showed to all beholders the wrinkled mail beneath it he was in fact in chainarmour from shoulders to feet for a moment all looked openmouthed he drew his sword with a great gesture and held it on high peers and noble vassals he called out in measured tones in which nevertheless deep down the shaking fit could be discerned vibrating the music the work calls us acre is in peril kings who are servants of the king of kings put by their private concerns queens who bow to one throne only to that bow with haste now you of the cross who follows me to win the cross the ships are ready my lords shall we go the great hall was struck dumb queen berengere only half understanding looked scared about her one could not but pity the extinguishment of her poor little great affairs queen joan grew very red she had the spirit of her family was angry fiercely whispered in her brothers ear he barely heard her he shook her words from his ears stamped on the pavement never never i am for the cross lord jesus behold thy knight the work is ready shall i not do it i call yea for this turn ha anjou to the ships to the ships his sword flickered in the air there followed it leaping after the beam a great swish of steel soon a forest of swords ha richard ha anjou ha saint george so they made the rafters volley and so headlong after king richard tumbled out into the dusk and sought the ships the new queen was crying miserably on the dais queen joan tapping her foot beside her late at night they also put out to sea on his knees facing the shrouded east king richard spent his wedding night with his bare sword for his partner chapter iii who fought at acre after they had lost the harbour of limasol from that hasty dark hour of setting out the fleet sailed it seemed under new stars and encountered a new strange air all night they toiled at the oars and in the morning very early every eye was turned to the fired east where in the seahaze lay the sacred places clothed like the sacrament in that gauzy veil first of them trenchemer steered the kings red galley in whose prow stiff and hieratic as a figurehead was the king himself watching for a sign the great ships rolled and plunged the tide came racing by them bluegreen water lipped with foam carrying upon it unknown weeds golden fruit floating wreckage unfamiliar a dead fish scarletrayed a basket strangely wroughtdrifting heralds of a country of dreams about noon when mass had been said upon his galley king richard was seen to throw up his arms and stretch them wide the shout followed the signterra sancta terra sancta they heard him cry voice after voice tongue after tongue took up the word and lifted it from ship to ship all fell upon their knees save the rowers a dim coast veiled in violet lifted before their eyesmountain ranges great hollows clouded places so far and silent so mysteriously wrapt full of awe no one could speak no one had thought to speak but must look and search and wonder a quick flight of shore birds flashing creatures that twittered as they swept by broke the spell this then was a land where living things abode it was not only of the sacred dead they drew nearer their hearts comforted they saw margat a lonely tower high on a split rock they saw tortosa with a haven in the sea tripolis a very white city neplyn botron they saw with a great terraced castle afterwards beyrout cedars about its skirt mountains rose up nearer to the sound of the surf they saw lebanon capped with cloudwreaths then snowy hermon gleaming in the sun they saw mount tabor with a grey head and two mountains like spires which stood separate and apart tyre they passed and sidon rich cities set in the sand then scandalion at length after a long night of watching a soft hill showed covered with verdure and glossy dark woods carmel shaped like a womans breast making this hallowed mount in the plain beyond they saw acre manytowered and all about it the tents of the christian hosts and before it in the blue waters of the bay ships riding at anchor more numerous than the seabirds that haunt monte gibello or swim sentinel about its base trumpets from the shore answered to their trumpets they heard a wild tattoo of drums within the walls on even keels in the motionless tide the ships took up their moorings and king richard throwing the end of his cloak over his shoulder jumped off the gunwale of trenchemer and waded breastdeep to shore he was the first of his realm to touch this storied syrian earth now for affairs the meeting of the kings was cordial or seemed so king philip came out of his pavilion to meet his royal brother and richard kissing him asked him how he did very vilely richard said the young man i think there is a sword in my head the glaring sun flattens me by day and all night i shiver fever my poor coz said richard with a kind hand upon his shoulder philip burst out with his symptoms wailing like a child the devil bites me i vomit black my skin is as dry as a snakes yesterday they bled me three ounces richard walked back with him among the tents conversing cheerfully and for a few days held his old ascendancy over philip but only for a few other of the leaders he saw some gave him no welcome the marquess of montferrat kept his quarters the duke of burgundy was in bed the archduke of austria luitpold a hairy man with light red eyelashes professed great civility but richard had a bad way with strangers not being receptive he took no pains to pretend that he was the archduke made long speeches richard short replies the archduke made longer speeches richard no replies then the archduke grew very red and richard nearly yawned this was at the english kings formal reception by the leaders of the crusade with the grand master of the temple he got on better liking the looks of the man he did not observe saintpol on king philips left hand but there he was flushed excited and tensely observant of his enemy that same night when they held a council of war there was seen a smoulder of that fire which you might have decently supposed put out king philip came down in a mighty hurry and sat himself in the throne montferrat burgundy and others of that faction serried round about him the english and angevin chiefs were furious and the archduke halted between two opinions by the time lateish when king richard was announced gaston of bearn and young saintpol had their swords half out but richard came and stood in the doorway a magnificent leisurely figure all his party rose up richard waited watching the archduke who really had not seen him before rose with apologies then the french followed suit singly one here and one there there only remained seated king philip and the marquess of montferrat still richard waited by the door presently in a quiet voice he said to the usher take your wand usher to that paralytic over there tell him that he shall use it or i will the message was delivered at an angry nod from king philip the marquess got darkly up and richard came into the hall with king guy of jerusalem these two sat down one on each side of france and so the council began it was hopeless from the outseta posse of hornets droned into fury by the archduke while he talked the rest maddened longing for each others blood failing that of luitpold richard who as yet had no plans of his own took no interest whatever in plans he acted throughout as if the marquess was not there and as if he wished with all his heart that the archduke was not there on his part the marquess would have given nearly all he owned to have behaved so to guy of lusignan set over him but the marquess had not that art of lazy scorn which belongs to the royal among beasts he glowered he was sulky meantime the archduke buzzed his agelong periods and richard clasping his knee looked at the ceiling at last he sighed profoundly and god of heaven and earth escaped him king philip burst into a guffawhis first for many a dayand broke up the assembly richard had himself rowed out to jehane in her ship he had no business there though his business was innocent enough but she could not tell him so now the girl was dejected ill and very nervous about herself moreover she had suffered from seasickness she could not hide her comfort to have him so he took her up and kissed her as of old and ended by settling her on his knee there she cried quietly but freely he stayed with her till she slept then went back to the shore and walked about the trenches thinking out the business before him the dawn light found him at it in a day or two having got his tackle ashore he began the assault upon a plan of his own without reference to any other principality or power at all by this time king philip lay heaped in his bed and had had his distempered brain wrought upon by montferrat and his kind saintpol des barres and their kind richard had with him poictevins and angevins men of provence and languedoc normans and english scots and welshry black genoese sicilians pisans and grifons from cyprus the count of champagne had his flemings to hand the templars and the hospitallers served him gladly it was an agglomerate a horde not an army and nobody but he could have wielded it he by the virtue in him had them all at his nod the english who love to be commanded hauled stones for him all day though he had not a word of their language the swart praying italians raved themselves hoarse whenever he came into their lines even the cypriotes sullen and timorous creatures whom no power among themselves could have driven to the walls fixed the great petraries and mangonels and ran grinning into the trap of death for this tawnyhaired hero who stood singing bareheaded within bowshot of the turks and laughed like a boy when some fellow slipped on to his back upon the dry grass he was everywhere day after dayin the trenches on the towers teaching the bowmen their business crying mort de dieu when a mangonel did its work and some flung rock made the wall to fly he crouched under the tortoisescreens with the miners took a mattock himself as indifferently as an arbalest or a crossbow he could do everything and have if not a word a cheerful grin for every man who did his duty as it was evident that he knew what such duty should be and could have done it better himself men sweated to win his praise he was nearly killed on a scalingladder too early put up or too long left so three arrows struck him and the defenders calling on allah rolled an enormous boulder to the edge of the wall which must have crushed him out of recognition on the last day garde sire dornna del ciel came the cries from below but lady virgin growled a shockhead from boctonunderbleane and pulled his king bodily off the ladder the poor fellow was shot in the throat at the next moment the stone fell harmless king richard took up his dead englishman in his arms and carried him to the trenches he did no more fighting until he had seen him buried and ordained a mass for him things of those sort tempted men to love him the siege lasted ten days or more with varying successes day and night in the city they heard the drums beat to arms the cries of the sheiks and more piercing drawnout cries than theirs to the nightly shrilled pronouncement of the greatness of god came as answer the christians wailing prayer save us holy sepulchre the king of france had an engine which he called the bad neighbour and did well with it until the turks provided a bad kinsman much bigger which put the neighbour to shame and finally burned him king richard had a belfry and the count of flanders could throw stones with his sling from the trenches into the marketplace at any rate he said he could and they all believed him the christians caused the accursed tower to totter they made a breach below the tower of flies in a most horrible part of the haven mine and countermine richard on the north side worked night and day denying himself rest food reasonable care for a week forgetful of jehane and her hope the weather grew stiflingly hot night and day there was no breath of wind the whole country reeked of death and abomination once indeed a gate was set fire to and rushed the christians saw before them for the first time the ghostly winding way of a street where blind pale houses heeled to each other six feet apart there was a breathless fight in that pent way a strangling throttled business richard with his peers of normandy swaying banners the crashing sound of steel on steel the splash of split polls but it could not be carried the turks surging down on them a wall of men bodily forced them out there was no room to swing an axe no space for a horse to fall least of all for draught of the bow richard cried the retreat they could not turn so walked backwards fighting and the turks repaired the gate acre did not fall by the sword but by starvation rather and the diligent negotiations of saladin with our king richards terms were restore the true cross empty us acre of menatarms leave two thousand hostages this was accepted at last the kings rode into acre on the twelfth of july with their hosts and the holloweyed courtesans watched them furtively from upper windows they knew their harvest was to reap harvest with them was seedtime with others it was seedtime with the archduke king richard set up his household in the castle with a good lodging for jehane in the street of the camel king philip miserably ill went to the house of the templars with him sedulously his friend the marquess of montferrat but luitpold of austria proposed himself for the castle and richard endured him as well as he could but then luitpold went further he set up his banner on the tower side by side with richards dragon meaning no offence at all now king richards way was a short way he had found the archduke a burdensome ass but no more the world was full of such one must take them as part of the general economy of providence but he knew his own worth perfectly well and his own standing in the host so when they told him where the austrians flag flew he said take it down they took it down luitpold grew red made a long speech in german at which richard frowned and another shorter in latin at which he laughed luitpold put up his flag again again richard said take it down luitpold was so angry that he made no speeches at all he ran up his flag a third time when king richard was told he laughed and on this occasion said throw it away gaston of bearn more vivacious than discreet did so with ignominious detail that day there was a council of the great estates at which king philip presided in a furred gown for though the weather was suffocating his fever kept him chill to the bones to the marquess pale with his old grudge was now added the archduke flaming with his new one the mottled duke of burgundy blinked approval of all grudges and young saintpol poured fire into the fire richard was not present nor any of his faction they because they had not been advertised he because he was in the street of the camel at the knees of jehane the fair the archduke began on the instant by god my lords he said is there in the world a beast more flagrant than the king of england not killed already the marquess showed the white rims of his eyes injurious desperate bloody villain was his commentary and saintpol lifted up his hand to his master for leave to speak mischief but king philip said fretfully well well we can all speak of something i suppose he scorns me he has always scorned me he refuses me homage he shamed my sister and now he takes the lead of me the marquess kept muttering to the table hopeless villain hopeless villain and the archduke after staring about him for sympathy claimed attention if not that for he brought his fist down with a thump by thunder but i kill him he said deep in his throat saintpol came running and kissed his knee to luitpolds great surprise philip shivered in his furs i must go home he fretted i am smitten to death i must die in france where is the king of england asked the marquess knowing perfectly well evil light upon him cried saintpol he is in my sisters house between them they give me a nephew oho montferrat said is that it why then we know where to strike him quickest we should make navarre of our party he has done that himself by all accounts said the duke of burgundy wideawake the archduke returning to his new lodgings in the bishops house sent for his astrologers and asked them could he kill the king of england my lord said they you cannot how is that he asked lord they told him by our arts we discover that he will live for a hundred years it is very remarkable said the archduke what sort of years will they be lord said the astrologers they are divers in complexion but many of them are red i will provide that they be said the archduke go away the marquess sought no astrologers but instead the street of the camel and jehanes house he observed this with great care watching from an entry to see how king richard would come out whether attended or not he observed more than the house for much more was forced upon him human garbage filled the close ways of acre men and women marred by themselves or a hideous begetting hairless persons and snug little chamberers botchfaces scaldheads minions of many sorts silentfooted arabians as shameless as dogs greeks pimps and panders abominable women murder was swiftly and secretly done montferrat from his entry saw the manner of it a norman knight called hamon le rotrou came out of an infamous house in the dusk and stepped into the street of the camel with his cloak delicately round him fine as he was he was insanely a lover of the vile thing he had left for he knelt down in the street to kiss her wellworn doorstep he knelt under the light of a small lamp and out of the shadow behind him stepped catfoot a tall thin man white from head to foot who saying all hail master stabbed hamon deep in the side hamon jerked up his head tottered fell without more than a tired mans sigh sideways into the arms of his killer this one eased his fall as tenderly as if he was upholding a girl let him down into the kennel drew him thence by the shoulders into the dark and himself vanished montferrat swore softly to himself that was neatly done i must find out who this expert may be he went away full of it having forgotten his housed enemy there was a sheik moffadin in the jail one of the soldans hostages for the return of the true cross the marquess went to see him who of your people he asked is very tall and lightfooted robes him from head to foot in white linen and kills quietly as if he loved the dead with an all hail master we call him an assassin in our language the sheik replied but he is not of our people by any means he is a servant of the old man who dwells on lebanon what old man is this moffadin i can tell you no more of him said the sheik save that he is master of many such men who serve him faithfully and in silence but he hates the soldan and the soldan him how do they serve him by killing yes they kill whomsoever he points out and so receive or think to receive a crown in paradise is this old mans name death by our saviour cried the marquess the sheik answered his name is sinan but the name of death would suit him very well where should i get speech with some of his servants the marquess inquired adding for my life is in danger i have enemies who are irksome to me by the tower of flies you will find them said the sheik and late at night there are always some of his people walking there seek out such a man as you have seen and without fear accost him after his fashion kissing him and saying ah ali ah abdallah servant of ali i am very much obliged to you moffadin said the marquess that same night jehane was in pain and king richard dared not leave her nor the physicians either and in the morning early she was delivered of a child a strong boy and then lay back and slept profoundly richard set two black women to fan the flies off her without stopping once under pain of death and having seen to the proper care of the child and other things returned alone through the blanching streets glorifying and praising god chapter iv concerning the tower of flies saintpol and the marquess of montferrat in the church of saint lazarus of the knights on lammas day the son of richard and jehane was made a christian by the abbot of poictiers gossips were the count of champagne the earl of leicester and by proxy the queenmother he was named fulke at the moment of anointing the churchbell was rung and at that moment gilles de gurdun spat upon the pavement outside saintpol said to him we must do better than that gilles and gilles i pray god may spit him out oh he said saintpol with a bitter laugh he helps those who are helpful of themselves i cannot help myself eustace said gurdun i have tried i had him unarmed before me at messina and he looked me down and i could not do it have at his back then i hope it may not come to that said gilles and yet it may if it must come with me tonight to the tower of flies said saintpol here is my shameful sister brought out of church i cannot stay i stay said gilles de gurdun king richard came out of church and jehane and the child carried on a shield jehane who had much ado to walk without falling saw not gilles but gilles saw her and the red in his face took a tinge of black while she was before him he gaped at her with a dry tongue clacking in his mouth consumed by a dreadful despair but when she had passed by swaying in her weakness barely able to hold up her lovely head he lifted his face to the white sky and looked unwinking at the sun wondering where else an equal cruelty could abide in this golden king as cruel as the sun and as swift and as splendid ah dastard dastard at the minute gilles could have leapt at him and mauled the great shoulders with a dogs weapons there was no solace for him but to bite so he dashed his forearm into his face and sluiced his teeth in that but king richard of the high head mounted his horse in the churchyard and rode among the people before jehanes bearers to the street of the camel squires of his threw silver coins among the crowds who filled the ways within the house he laid her on her bed and held up the child before her high in the air he was in that great mood where nothing could resist him she faint and fragrant on the bed so frail as to seem transparent a disembodied sprite smiled because she felt at ease as the feeble do when they first lie down lo fulke of anjou sang richardfulke son of richard the son of henry the son of geoffrey the son of fulke fulke my son fulke i will make thee a knight even now he held the babe in one hand with the free hand drew his long sword the flat blade touched the nodding little head rise up sir fulke of anjou true knight of thine house sieur de cuigny when i have thee home again by the face he cried shortly as if remembering something we must get him the badge a switch of wild broom dear lord sweet lord murmured jehane faint in bed nearly gone but he raved on when i lay even as thou fulke naked by my mother my father sent for a branch of the broom and stuck it in the pillow against i could carry it and shalt thou go without it boy art not thou of the broombearers he put the child into the nurses arm and went to the door he called for gaston of bearn for the dauphin of auvergne for mercadet for the devil the bishop of salisbury came running in bishop said king richard you must serve me today you must take ship my friend with speed you must go to bordeaux thence ahorseback to the moor above angers pluck me a branch of the wild broom and return i must have it i tell you so go haste bishop god be with you the bishop began to splutter hey sire never call me that again bishop if your ship is within sight by sunset he said call me rather the prince of the devils see my chancellor take my ring to him omit nothing off with you and back with all speed ha sire look you now cried the desperate bishop there will be no broom before next easter here we are at lammas there will be a miracle said richard i am sure of it go fairly pushing him from the door he returned to find jehane in a dead faint this set him raving a new tune he fell upon his knees incontinent raised her in his arms carried her about kissed her all over cried upon the saints and god did every extravagance under the sun omitted the one wise thing of letting in the physicians abbot milo at last coming in saved jehane from him for the deeper purposes of god the count of saintpol going to the castle to the queens side found the marquess with her she also lay white and twisting on a couch crisping and uncrisping her little hands montferrat stood at her head three of her ladies knelt about her whispering in her own tongue proffering orange water sweetmeats a feather whisk saintpol knelt in her view madame how is it with your grace he said the little lady quivered but took no notice madame said saintpol again i am a peer of france but a knight before all i am come to serve your grace with my manhood i pray you speak to me the marquess folded his arms his large white face was a sight to see queen berengeres palms were bleeding a little where her nails had broken the skin she was quite white but her eyes burning black had no pupils when saintpol spoke for the second time she shook beyond all control and threw her head about also she spoke i suffer i suffer horribly it is cruel beyond understanding or knowledge that a girl should suffer as i suffer where is god where is mary where are the angels dearest madame dearest madame said the cooing women and one stroked her face but the queen shook the hand off and went wailing on saying more than she could have meant is it good usage of the daughter of a king lord jesus is this the way of marriage that the bride be left on her wedding day she jumped up on her couch and took hold of her bosom in the sight of men she hath given him a child he is with her now am i not fit for children shall there never be milk oh oh here is more shame than i can bear she hid her face in her hands and rocked herself about montferrat really moved said low to saintpol are we knights to suffer these wrongs to be said saintpol with a sob in his voice ah god mend it he will said montferrat if we help to mend this reminded saintpol of his own words to de gurdun so he made haste to throw himself before the queen that he might still be pure in his devotion my lady berengere he said ardently take me for your soldier i am a bad man but surely not so bad as this let me fight him for you the queen shook her head impatient hey what can you do against so glorious a man he is the greatest in the world ha domeneddio said the marquess with a snort i have that which will abate such glory dearest madame we go to pray for your health he kissed her hand and drew away with him saintpol who was trembling under the thoughts that fired him oh my soul marquess said the youth when they were in the glare of day again what shall we do to mend this wretchedness the marquess looked shrewdly end the wretch who wrought it do we go clean to that marquess have we no backthoughts of our own the work is clean enough you come tonight to the tower of flies yes yes i will come said saintpol i shall have one with me the marquess went on who will be of service mind you ah said saintpol and so shall i the marquess stroked his nose hum he said advising who might your man be saintpol one said eustace who has reason to hate richard as much as that poor lady in there who is that my sister jehanes lover by the visible host said montferrat we shall be a loving company all told so they parted for the time the tower of flies stands apart from the city on a spit of sand which splays out into two flanges and so embraces in two hooks a lagoon of scummy ooze of weeds and garbage of all the waste and silt of a slack water in front of it only is the tidal sea which there flows languidly with a halffoot rise on the other is the causeway running up to the city wall above and all about this dead marsh you hear day and night the buzzing of innumerable great flies and in the daytime see them hanging like gauze in the thick air they say the reason is that anciently the pagans sacrificed hecatombs hereabout to the idols they worshipped but another more likely is that the lagoon is a dead slack and stinks abominably all dead things thrown from the city walls come floating thither and there stay rotting the flies get what they can sharing with the creatures of land and sea for great fish feed there and at night the jackals and hyaenas come down and bicker over what they can drag out but more than once or twice the sharks drag them in and have fresh meat if their brother sharks allow it however all this may be the place has a dreadful name a dreadful smell and a dreadful sound what with the humming of flies and dull rippling of the sharks these can seldom be seen since the water is too thick but you can tell their movements by the long oily waves like the heads of large arrows which their fins throw behind them as they quest from carcase to carcase down there in the ooze thither in the murk of night came montferrat in a black cloak holding his nose but made feverish through his ears by the veiled chorus of the flies by the starshine and glow of the putrid water he saw a tall man in a white robe who stood at the extreme edge of the spit and looked at the sharks montferrat hid his guards behind the tower crossed himself drew his sword to hack a way through the monstrous flies and so came swishing forward like a man who mows a swathe the tall man saw him but did not move the marquess came quite close what are you looking at my friend he asked in the arabian tongue i am looking at the sharks which have a new corpse in there said the man see what a turmoil there is in the water there must be six monsters together in that swirl see see there speeds another the marquess turned sick god help i cannot look he said why said the arabian it is a dead man they fight over may be may be said the marquess you my friend are very familiar with death so am i nor do i fear living man but these great fish terrify me you are a fool returned the other they seek only their meat but you and i and our like seek nicer things than that we have our souls to feed and the soul of a man is a free eater of stranger appetite than a shark the marquess looked at the flies o god arabian let us go away from this place is there no rest from the flies none at all said the arabian for thousands have been slain here and the flies also must be fed pah horrible said the marquess all in a sweat the arabian turned but his face was hidden with a horrible appearance as if a hooded cloak stood up by itself and a voice proceeded from a fleshless garb you marquess of montferrat it said what do you want with me by the tower of flies the marquess remembered his needs i want the death of a man he said but not here o christ who sent you asked the arabian the sheik moffadin a captive in the name of ali and of abdallah servant of ali so the marquess and would have kissed the man but that he saw no face under the hood and dared not kiss emptiness come with me said the arabian an hour later the marquess came into the tower of flies shaking he found saintpol there the archduke of austria and gilles de gurdun there were no greetings where is your man marquess asked saintpol of the pale italian he is out yonder looking at the sharks said the marquess in a whisper but he will serve us if we dare use him he struck at the flies weaving about his head this is a horrible place saintpol he said staring saintpol shrugged the deed we compass dear marquess is none of the choicest remember said he the marquess then saw that austrias broad leather back was covered with flies this quickened his loathing by our saviour he said one must hate a man very much to talk against him here do you hate enough asked saintpol the marquess stared about him he saw the archduke peacefully twiddle his thumbs he saw de gurdun who stood moodily looking at the floor oh content you saintpol answered him that man hates more than you or i and with more reason what are your reasons eustace asked montferrat still in a whisper i hate him said saintpol for my brothers sake whose back he broke for my sisters sake whose heart he must break before he has done with her for my houses sake to which in eudos person he gave the lie because he is of anjou cruel as a cat and savage as a dog because he is a ruthless swift treacherous secret unconscionable beast are these enough reasons for you by god eustace said the breathless montferrat i cannot think it not here then said saintpol i hate him for berengeres sweet sake that is a good and clean hatred i believe that wasted lady writhing white on a bed moved me to pure pity if i loved her before i will love her now with whole service not daring belie my knighthood i love that queen and intend to serve her i have never seen such pitiful beauty before what is the man insatiate shall he have everything he shall have nothing that will serve for me i hope now marquess it is your turn the marquess struck out at the flies i hate him he said because before the king of france he called me a liar and threatened me with ignominious death he gasped here and looked round him to see what effect he had made saintpols eyes greengrey like his sisters were upon him rather coldly gurduns on the floor still the archduke was scratching in his beard and the chorus of flies swelled and shrilled the marquess needed alliances eh my friends he said almost praying will this not serve me said saintpol marquess listen to this man speak gilles gilles looked up i have tried to kill him i had my chance fair i could not do it i shall try again for the law is on my side to you lords i shall say nothing for i am a man ashamed to speak of what i desire to do not yet certain whether i can accomplish it this i say the man is my liege lord but a thief for all that i loved my lady jehane when she was twelve years old and i a page in her fathers house i have never loved any other woman and never shall there are no other women she gave herself to me for good reason and he himself gave her into my hand for good reason and then he robbed me of her on my wedding day and has slain my father and young brother to keep her he has given her a child enough of this dastard i will follow and follow until i dare to strike then i will kill him let me alone gilles red and gloomy had to jerk the words out he was no speaker the marquess had a fierce eye ha de gurdun he said we need thee good knight but come out of this accursed flyroost and we shall show thee a better way than thine it is the flies that make thee afraid eh damn the flies said gilles they will never disturb me they do but seek their meat they disturb me horribly said the marquess with italian candour saintpol laughed i told you that i could bring you in a man he said now marquess you have our two clean reasons what is yours i have given you mine said montferrat shifting his feet he called me a liar it lacks cogency said saintpol one must have clean reasons in an unclean place the marquess broke out into blasphemy may hell scorch us all if i have no reasons what has he not kept me from my kingdom guy of lusignan will be king by his means what is philip against richard what am i what is the archduke he had forgotten that the archduke was there by beelzebub the god of this place said that deepvoiced hairy man you shall see what the archduke is when you want him but i am no murderer i am going home i know what is due to a prince and from a prince do as you please my lord said saintpol but our schemes are like to be endangered by such goings i have so little liking for your schemes to be plain with you replied the archduke that they may fail and fail again for me how i deal with the king of england who has insulted me beyond hope is a matter for him and me to determine cousin said montferrat you desert me cousin again said the archduke do you wonder and so he walked out punctilious boar cried saintpol in a fume who can only get his tushes in one way now marquess what are we to do the marquess smiled darkly and tapped his nose i have my business in good train i have an ancient friend on lebanon stand in with me the pair of you and i have all done smoothly you hire asked saintpol drily then he shruggedoh but we may trust you per la madonna said the marquess what will you do gilles saintpol asked the norman will you leave it to the marquess of montferrat i will not said gilles i follow king richard from point to point i hire nobody the marquesss hands went up desperate of such folly you only with me my eustace he said saintpol looked up i differ from either i have a finer plan than either you are satisfied with a swordstroke in the back by my soul it shall not be in the back cried de gurdun saintpol shrugged again that is the marquesss way but what matter you want to see him down so do i by heaven but in hell not on the earth i will see him tormented i will see him ashamed i will wreck his hopes i will make him a mockery of all kings drag his high spirit through the mud of disastrousness pouf do you think him all flesh he is finer stuff than that what he makes others i seek to make himsoiled defiled a blown rag there is work to be done in that kind here and at home king philip will see to one i stay with the host it is a good plan said the marquess i admire it exceedingly but steel is safer for a common man i go to lebanon for my part to my friends there but i think we are in agreement before they went away they cut their arms with a dagger and mingled their blood the marquess wrapped his wound deep in his cloak to keep the flies from it across the silence of the night as they made their way into the city came the cry of the watchman from a belfry save us holy sepulchre it floated from tower to tower from land far out to sea jehane dry in her hot bed heard it richard on his knees in an oratory heard it crossed himself and repeated the words queen berengere moaned in her sleep the duke of burgundy snored and the arabian spat into the lagoon chapter v the chapter of forbidding how de gurdun looked and king richard hid his face since the soldan broke his pledges king richard swore that he would keep his so he had all the two thousand hostages killed except the sheik moffadin whom the marquess had enlarged he has been blamed for this and i if it were my business should blame him too he asked no counsel and allowed no comment by this time he was absolute over the armies in acre if i am to say anything upon the red business it shall be this that he knew very well where his danger lay it was his friends not his enemies he had reason to fear and upon these the effect of what he did was instantaneous and perhaps welltimed the count of flanders had died of the campsickness king philip was stricken to the bones with the same crawling disease nothing now could keep philip away from france acre was full of rumours meetings of kings and princes spies racing messengers who should stay and who go was the matter of debate philip meant to go his friend prince john of england had been writing to him flanders must be occupied and flanders near england was nearer yet to normandy the marquess also meant to goto sidon for lebanon he had things to do up there on richards and his own account as you shall hear but the archduke chose to stay in acreand so on king richard heard of each of these hasty discussions with a shrug and only put his hand down when they were all concluded he said that unless french hostages were left in his keeping for the fulfilment of covenants he should know what to do and what is that king of england asked philip what becomes me was the short answer given in full hail before the magnates they looked at each other and askance at the sanguinehued king who drove them all huddling before him by mere magnanimity what could they do but leave hostages they left burgundy beauvais and henry of champagneone friend one enemy and one blockhead now you see a reason for drawing the sword upon the wretched turks if richard had planted they poor devils had to water so king philip went home and the marquess to sidon for lebanon and richard knowing full well that they meant him ill here and at home turned his face towards jerusalem when the time came for ordering the goings of his host he grew very nervous about what he must leave behind him in acre whether he was a good man or not a good husband a good lover or not he was passionately a father in every surge and cry of his wild heart he showed this the heart is a generous inn keeps open house grows wide to meet all corners the company is divers in king richards heart sat three guests christ and his lost cross jehane and her lost honour and little fulke upon her breast christ was a dumb guest but the most eloquent still there had been no nods from him since the great day of fontevrault but richard watched him daily and held himself bound to be his footboy see these desperate shifts of the greathearted man here were his two other guests little fulke who claimed everything and still jehane who claimed nothing and outside the door stood berengere crisping and uncrisping her small hands to serve christ he had married the queen to serve the queen he had put away jehane to honour jehane who had given him her honour he had abjured the queen now lastly he prayed christ to save him fulke his first and only son my saviour christ he prayed on his last night at acre let thine honour be the first end of this adventure but if honour come to thee my lord through me let honour stay with me and my son through thee i cannot think i do amiss to ask so much one other thing i ask before i go out watch over these treasures of mine that i leave in pawn for i know very well that i shall get no more of them then he kissed the mother and the child comforting them and went out not trusting himself to look back at the house he had made the defences of acre as good as he knew which was very good indeed he had bettered the harbour he left ships in it established a post between it and beyrout between beyrout and cyprus he sent guy of lusignan to be his regent in that island emperor if he chose he left abbot milo to comfort jehane the viscount of beziers to rule the town and garrison shriven fortified with the sacrament he spent his last night in acre on the st of august next morning as soon as it was day he led his army out on its march to jerusalem joppa was his immediate object to which place a road ran between the mountains and the sea never far from either he had little or no transport nor could expect food by the way for saladin had seen to that the ships had to work down level with him with reserves of men and stores and even so the thing had an ugly look the mountains of ephraim not very lofty were covered with a thick growth of holmoak excellent cover wherein as he knew quite well the saracens could move as he moved choose their time and attack him on front rear or left flank wherever chance offered it was a journey of peril harassing slow and without glory for six weeks he led and held a running battle wherein the powers of earth and air the powers of mahomet and dark forces within his own lines all strove against him he met them alone with a blank face eyes bare teeth hardset whatever provocation was offered from without or within he would not attack nor let his friends attack until the enemy was in his hand you who know what longanimity may be and how hard a thing to come at may admire him for this directly the christians were over the brook belus their difficulties were upon them the way was through a pebbly waste of beach and saltgrass and a seascrub of grey bushes a mile to their left the rocks began spurs of the mountains the shrubs became stunted trees the rocks climbed the trees with them then the forest rose first sparsely then thick and dark lastly into the deep blue of the sky soared the toothed ridges grey scarred and splintry scurrying horsemen on beasts incredibly sure of foot hung on the edge of these fastnesses yelling whirling their lances whiteclad swarthy and hoarse they came by fifties or in clouds they came swept by like a windstorm and were gone and in each shrill and terrible rush some stragglers be sure would call upon christ in vain or sometimes great companies of mamelukes in mail massed companies in blocks of men stood covered by their bowmen as if offering battle if the christians opened out to attack as at first they did or some party of knights more adventurous than another pricked forward at a canter and hastening as their hearts grew high cried at last the charge passavant or sauve anjou out of the wood with cries would come the black cavalry sweep up behind our men and cut off one company or another and if so by day by night there was no long peace under the large stars desperate stampedes the scattering of campfires trampling grunting in the dark ghostly horsemen looming and vanishing suddenly in the halflight and in the lull the querulous howling of wild beasts disappointed to their full days succeeded their empty days when they were alone with the desert and the sun then hunger and thirst assailed them serpents bit them stinging flies drove men mad the sand burnt their feet through steel and leather they lost more this way than by saracen ambush and lost more hearts than men this was a time for private grudges to awaken hatred feeds on such dry meat in the empty watches of the night in the blistering daytime under the white sky or the deep violet des barres remembered his struck face de gurdun his stolen wife saintpol his dead brother and the duke of burgundy his forty pounds it must be said that richard stretched his authority as far as it would go his direct aim was to reach joppa with speed and thence to strike inward over the hills to the holy city it was against sense to attack this enemy hugging the woody heights but as time went on as he lost men and heard the muttering of those who saw them go he understood that if he could tempt saladin into close battle upon chosen ground it would be well this was a difficult matter for though as he knew the saracen army followed him in the woods it kept well out of sight none but the light horsemen showed near at hand and their tactics were to sting like wasps and flynever to join battle at last in the swamp of arsuf where the dead river splays over broad marshes and goes in a swamp to the seaedge he saw his chance and took it here a feint carried out by gaston of bearn with great spirit brought saladin into the open the christians continued their toilsome march saladin attacked their rear and for six hours or more that rearguard fought a retreating battle meeting shock after shock striking no blow while the centre and the van watched them this was one of the tensest days of richards iron rule de charron commanding the rear sent imploring messengersfor christs love let us charge sire we can bear no more of this he was answered let them come on again then saintpol seeing one of the chances of his life was in open mutiny of the tongue are we sheep then thus he to the french with burgundy is the king a drover of cattle where is the chivalry of france even richards friends grew fretful champagne tossing his head muttering curses to himself gaston of bearn pale and serious chewing his beard two more wild assaults the rearguard took stiffly at the third they broke in two places but repelled the turks richard watching like a hawk saw his opportunity he sent down a message to the duke of burgundy to saintpol and de charronhold them yet once more at six blasts of my trumpet charge the duke of burgundy block though he was was prepared to obey about him came buzzing saintpol and his friends impossible my lord duke we cannot keep in our men attack attack saladin was then coming on one of his thunderous charges god strike blind those french mules cried richard they are out this was true from left to centre the christian bowmen were out the knights pricking after them to the charge richard cursed them from his heart sound trumpets he shouted we must let go they sounded they ran forward the english first then the normans poictevins men of anjou and pisa black genoesebut the left had moved before them and made doubtful richards echelon they knelt pulled bowstrings to the ear the sky grew dun as the long shafts flew the oncoming tide of men flickered and tossed like a broken sea and the soldans green banner dipped like a reed in it a second time the blast of arrows like a gust of death smote them flat richards voice rang sharply outpassavant chivalers sauve anjouand a young poictevin knight stooping low in his saddle went rocking down the line with words for henry of champagne who ruled the centre the archers ran back and crouched richard and his chivalry on the extreme right moved out the next company after him and the next and the next company following company until in echelon all the long fluttering array galloped over the marsh overlapped and enfolded the saracen hordes in their bright embrace a frenzied cry from some emir by the standard gave notice of the danger the bodyguard about the soldan were seen urging him saladin gave some hasty order as he rode off richard saw it and tasted the bitterness of folly by god we shall lose himoh bemused hog of burgundy he sent a man flying to the duke but it was too late saladin gained the woods and with him his bodyguard the flower of his state the mamelukes also turned to fly to right to left the mad horsemen drovethe black the plumed the nubians in yellow the turcomans with spotted skins over their mail the men of syria knighthood of egypttrampling underfoot their own kind but the steel chain held most of these the knights had bound horse to horse wide on the left the templars and hospitallers fanned out and swept all stragglers into the net so within hoops of iron as it were the slaughter began silent breathless wet work here james davesnes was killed a good knight and here des barres went down in a huddle of black men and had infallibly perished but that king richard himself with his axe dug him out your pardon king of the world sobbed des barres kissing his enemys knee pooh says richard we are all kings here take my sword and get crowns and so he turned again into battle and des barres pressed after him that was the beginning of a firm friendship between the two des barres eschewed the counsels of saintpol from that day but there was treachery still awake and about when the rout was begun richard reined up for a minute to breathe his horse and watch the way of the field he sat apart from his friends seeing the lines ride by all in a moment inexplicably as when in a race of the tide comes a sudden thwart gust of wind and changes the face of the day there was a scurry a babble of voices the stampede of men fighting to kill the turks with christians on their backs came trampling struggling together a sword glinted close to richarddeath to the angevin devil he heard and turning received in mid shield de gurduns sword at the same moment a knight ran full tilt into the assailant knocked him off his horse and himself reeled powerless to strike this was des barres paying his debts the king smiled grimly to see the wholesome treachery and gurduns dismay at it gilles gilles says he be sure you get me alone in the world when next you strike at my back now get you up norman and fight a flying enemy if you please i will await your return de gurdun saluted but avoided his lords face and rode after the turks des barres stood deepbreathing by the king will he come back sire asked the french knight not he said richard he is ashamed of himself he added that is a very honest man to whom i have done a wrong but listen to this des barres if i had not wronged him i was so placed that i should have injured a most holy innocent soul let be i shall meet de gurdun again he may have me yet if he do not tire he had been speaking as if to himself so far but now turned his hawkeyes upon des barres tell me now he said who gave the order to the rear to charge against my order sire replied des barres it was the duke of burgundy you do not understand me said richard it came through the duke of burgundys windpipe but who put it into his thick head des barres looked troubled ah sire must i answer you considering him king richard said no des barres you need not for now i know who it was well he has lost me my game and won a part of his i doubt then he rode off bidding des barres sound the recall of the pagans that day writes milo by hearsay we made hecatombs two score five yet the king my master took no pleasure of that as i gather deeming that he should have had saladins head in a bag also we gained a clear road to joppa so they did but joppa was a heap of stones they held a great council there richard put out his views there were two things to be done repair joppa and march at once on jerusalem there to find and have again at saladin or pursue the coast road to ascalon and raise the siege of that city i my lords am for ascalon richard said it is the key of egypt while the soldan holds us cooped up in ascalon he can get his packmules through if we relieve it after the battery we have done him we can hold jerusalem at our whim what do you say to this duke of burgundy in the natural order of things the duke would have said nothing but he had been filled to the neck by saintpol richard being for ascalon the key of egypt the duke declared himself for jerusalem the key as he rather flatly said of the world to this richard contented himself with replying that a key was little worth unless you could open the door with it all the french stood by their leader except des barres he with richards party leaned to the kings side but the duke of burgundy would not budge sat like a lump he would not go to ascalon and none of his battle should go richard cursed all frenchmen but gave in the truth was he dared not leave saintpol behind him they repaired the walls and towers of joppa garrisoned the place then late in the autumn truthfully too late they struck inland over a rolling grass country towards blanchegarde a white castle on a green hill moving slowly and cautiously they pushed on to ramleh thence to betenoble which is actually within two days march of jerusalem the month was october mellow autumn weather king richard moved by the sacred influences the level peace of the fair land filled day and night with the thought that he was on the threshold of that soil which bore the very footmarks of our blessed saviourking richard i say was in great heart he had been against the enterprise thus to do he would have approached from ascalon the enterprise was folly but it was glorious folly for which a man might well die he was ready to die though he hoped and believed that he should not saladin once bitten would be shy he had been badly bitten at arsuf then came the bishop of beauvais with burgundy to his tentsaintpol stayed behindwith speeches saying that the winter season was at hand that it would be more prudent to withdraw to joppa or even to go down to ascalon ascalon needed succours it seemed richards heart stood still at this treachery then he blazed out in fury are we hare or hounds by heaven do you presume he mastered himself what part pray does almighty god take in these pastimes of yours the duke of burgundy looked heavily at the bishop the bishop said sire ascalon is besieged said richard you old fool do you not know the soldan better than that or do you put him on a parity with this duke it was under siege three weeks ago as you remember perfectly well the duke still looked at the bishop driven again to say something the latter begansire your words are injurious but i have spoken advisedly the count of saintpol ah said richard the count of saintpol now i begin to understand you please to fetch in your count of saintpol saintpol was sent for and he came darkly smiling respectful but aware king richard held his voice but not his hand on the curb the hand shook a little saintpol he said the duke of burgundy refers me to the bishop the bishop to you this seems the order of command in king philips host between the three of you i conceive to lie the honour of france now observe me three weeks ago i was for ascalon and you for jerusalem now that i have brought you within two days of your desiretwo days observeyou are for ascalon and i for jerusalem what is the meaning of this sire said saintpol reasonably it means that we believe the holy city impregnable at this season or untenable and ascalon still pregnable the king put a hand to the table it means nothing of the sort man you do not believe ascalon can be taken it is eight days journey and was in straits a month ago you make me ashamed of the men i am forced to lead what faith have you what religion the faith of your sick master the runagate the religion of your white marquess of montferrat and i had taken you for men foh you are rats this was dreadful hearing saintpol bit his lip but made no other answer sire said the bishop with heat my manhood has never been reproached before when you carried war into my country in the king your fathers time i met you in a hauberk of mail if i met your grace judge if i should fear the soldan it is my devout hope to kiss the holy sepulchre and touch the holy cross but before i die not afterwards pish said king richard sire beauvais ventured again our master king philip set us over his host as fosterfathers of his children we dare not imperil so many lives unadvisedly unadvisedly the king thundered at him red to the roots of his hair i withdraw the word sire said the bishop in a hurry yet it is the mature opinion of us all that we should seek the coast for winterquarters not the high lands we claim at least the duty of choosing for those whose guardians we are if richard had been himself of two years earlier he would have killed then and there a second count of saintpol and for a pulse or two the young man saw his death bright in the kings eyes that the angry man commanded himself is i think to his credit as it was he did what he had certainly never done before he tried to reason with the duke of burgundy duke of burgundy he said leaning over his chair and talking low you are no frenchman and the more of a man on that account you and i have had our differences i have blamed you and you me but i have never found you a laggard when there was work for the sword or adventure for the heart now of all adventures in the world the highest in which a man may engage is here across those hills lies the city of god of which i suppose no soul among us might unhelped dare hope the sight much less the touch least of all the redemption i tell you duke of burgundy there is that within me not my own which will lead you thither with profit glory and honour will you trust me so far as i have gone along with you i have done reasonably well did i scatter the heathen at arsuf no thanks to you burgundy but i did did i hold a safe course to joppa have i then brought you so near and myself so near for nothing at all if i have been a fool in my day i am not a fool now i speak what i know with this host i can save the city without the best of it i can do nothing what do you say my lord will you let beauvais take his frenchmen to dishonour and you and your burgundians play for honour with me the prize is great the reward sure here or in heaven what do you say duke of burgundy his voice shook by now and all the bystanders watched without breath the heavy brooding mottled man over against him he faithful to his nature looked at the bishop of beauvais but beauvais was looking at his ring what do you say my lord again asked king richard the duke of burgundy was troubled he blinked looking at saintpol but saintpol was looking at the tentroof be pleased to look at me said richard and the man did look working under his wrongs by god richard said the duke of burgundy you owe me forty pound king richard laughed till he was helpless it may be it may well be he gasped between the throes of his mirth o lump of clay o wonderful halfman o most expressive riverhorse you shall be paid and sent about your business archbishop be pleased to pay this man his bill i will content you burgundy with money but i will be damned before i take you to jerusalem my lords he said altering voice and look in a moment i will conduct you to the ships since i am not strong enough for jerusalem i will go to ascalon but you by the living god you shall go back to france he dismissed them all and next day broke up his camp but before that very early in the morning after a night spent with his head in his hands he rode out with gaston and des barres to a hill which they call montjoy because from there the pilgrims tending south see first among the folded hills jerusalem itself lie like a dove in a nest the moon was low and cold the sun not up but the heavens and earth were full of shadowless light every hilltop every black rock upon it stood sharply cut out as with a knife king richard rode silently his face covered in a great hood neither man with him dared speak but kept the distance due so they skirted hill after hill wound in and out of the deep valleys until at last gaston pricked forward and touched his master on the arm richard started not turned montjoy dear master said gaston there before them as out of a cup rose a dark conical hill with streamers of white light behind and as might be leaping from it the light shines on jerusalem said gaston richard looking up at the glory uncovered his head sharp against the light stood a single man on montjoy who faced the full sun they who saw him there were still deep in shade gaston and des barres said king richard when they had reached the foot of the wet hill stay you here let me go on alone gaston demurred the hill is manned sire beware an ambush you have enemies close by he hinted at saintpol i have only one enemy that i fear gaston said the king and he rides my horse do as i tell you they obeyed so he went under their anxious eyes slowly he toiled up the bridlepath which the feet of many pilgrims had worn into the turf slowly they saw him dip from the head downwards into the splendour of the dawn but when horse and man were bathed full in light those two below touched each other and held hands for they saw him hoist his great shield from his shoulder and hold it before his face so as he stayed screening himself from what he sought but dared not touch the solitary watcher turned and came near him and spoke why does the great king cover his face said gilles de gurdun and why does he of his own will keep the light of god from him is he at the edge of his dominion hath he touched the limit of his power then i am stronger than my duke for i see the towers shine in the sun i see the mount of olives calvary also and the holy temple of god i see the church of the sepulchre the battlements and great gates of the city look my lord king see that which you desire that you may take it fulke of anjou was king of jerusalem and shall not richard be a king what is lacking what is amiss for kings may desire that which they see and take that which they desire though other men go cursing and naked said king richard from behind his shield is that you gurdun my enemy i am that man said gilles and bolder than you are since i can look unoffended upon the place where our lord god suffered as a man suffering it seems maketh me sib with god i will never look upon the city though i have risked all for the sake of it said richard for now i know that it was no design of gods to allow me to take it although it was certainly his desire that i should come into this country perhaps he thought me other than now i am i will not look for if i look upon it i shall lead my men up against it and then they will be cut off and destroyed since we are too few i will never see what i cannot save said gilles between his teeth you robber you have seen my wife and cannot save her now richard laughed softly god bless her he said she is my true wife and will be saved sure enough yet i will tell you this gurdun if she was not mine she should be yours and what is more she may be so yet you speak idly said gurdun of things which no man knows ah said the king but i do know them leave me i wish to pray gilles moved off and sat himself on the edge of the hill looking towards jerusalem if richard prayed it was with the heart for his lips never opened but i believe that his heart in this hour of clear defeat was turned to stone he took his joys with riot his triumphs calmly his griefs he shut in a trap such a nature as his i suppose respects no persons whether god beat him or his enemy he would take it the same way all that gilles heard him say aloud was this what i have done i have done deliver us from evil he bade no farewell to his hope he asked no greeting for his altered way when he had turned his back upon the sacred places he lowered his shield and then rode down the hill into the cold shadow of the valley if he was changed or if his soul naked of hope was stricken bleak so was the road he had to go that day he broke up his camp and fared for ascalon and the sea stormy weather set in the rains overtook him he was quagged blighted with fever lost his way his men his mens love campsickness came and spread like a fungus men rotten through to the brain died shrieking and as they shrieked they cursed his name one a poictevin named rolf whom he knew well turned away his blackened face when richard came to visit him ah rolf said the king dost thou turn away from me man i do that by our lord said rolf since by these deeds of thine my wife and children will starve or she become a whore as god lives said richard i will see to it i do not think he can be living any more said rolf if he lets thee live king richard richard went away the time dragged the rain fell pitilessly without end he found rivers in floods fords roaring torrents all ways choked at every turn the duke of burgundy and saintpol worked against him also he found ascalon in ruins but grimly set about rebuilding it this took him all the winter because the french judging perhaps that they had done their affair took to the ships and sailed back to acre there they heard what came more slowly to king richard strange news of the marquess of montferrat and terrible news of jehane saintpol chapter vi the chapter called clytemnestra at acre by the time september was set the sun had put all the air to the sword so that the city lay stifled stinking in its own vice and the nights were worse than the days then was the great harvest of the flies when men died so quickly that there was no time to bury them so also mothers saw their children flag or felt their force grow thin one or another swooned suddenly and woke no more or a woman found a dead child at the breast or a child whimpered to find his mother so cold at this time while jehane lay panting in bed awake hour by hour and fretting over what she should do when the fountains of her milk should be dry and this little fulke royal glutton crave without getting of hershe heard the women set there to fan her talking to each other in drowsy murmurs believing that she slept by now she knew their speech said one between the slow passes of the fans giafar ibn mulk hath come into the city secretly and the other then we have a thief the more peace said the first thou grudger he is one of my lovers and telleth me whatsoever i seek to know he is come in from lebanon so much and more i know already what ill report doth he bring of his master asked the second a lazy girl whose name was misra as the first was called fanoum fanoum answered very ill report of the melekthat was king richards name herebut it is according to the desires of the marquess ohe said misra we must tell this sleeper she is moon of the melek thou art a fool to think me a fool said fanoum why then shall i be one to turn the horn of a mad cow to pierce my own thigh let the franks kill each other what have we but gain they are dogs alike misra said hearken thou o fanoum the melek is no dog nay he is more than a man he is the yellowhaired king of the west riding a white horse who was foretold by various prophets that he should come up against the sultan that i know then he will have more than a mans death said fanoum the marquess goeth with giafar to lebanon to see the old man of musse whom he serveth the melek must die for of all men living or dead the marquess hateth him oh king of kings said misra with a little sob and thou wilt stand by thou sorrowful while the marquess kills the melek fanoum answered certainly i will for any of our lords people can kill the marquess but it needeth the guile of the old man to kill the melek let the wolf slay the lion while he sleepeth anon cometh the shepherd and slayeth the gorged wolf that is good sense well said misra it may be so but i am sorry for his favourite here there are no daughters of au so goodly as this one the melek is a wise lover of women let be for that replied fanoum comfortably the old man of musse is a wiser he will come and have her and we do well enough in lebanon they would have said more had jehane needed any more but it seemed to her that she knew enough there was danger brewing for king richard whom she faithless wretch had let go without her as she thought of the leper of her promise to the queenmother of richard towering but to fall her heart grew cold in her bosom then filled with fire and throbbed as if to burst it is extraordinary however how soon she saw her way clear and on how small a knowledge who this old man might be who lived on lebanon and was most wise in the matter of women she could have no guess but she was quite sure of him was certain that he was wise she knew something of the marquess her cousin any ally of his must be a murdermonger a wise lover of women the old man of musse who dwelt on lebanon wiser than richard and she more goodly than the daughters of au who were the daughters of ali beautiful women what did it matter if she excelled them god knew these things but jehane knew that she must go to market with the old man of musse so much she calmly revolved in her mind as she lay her length with shut eyes in her bed with the first cranny of light she had herself dressed by her sulky sleepy women and went abroad there were very few to see her none to dare her any harm so well as she was known two eunuchs at a wicked door spat as she passed she saw the feet of a murdered man sticking out of a drain the scurry of a little troop of rats mostly the dogs of the city had it to themselves no women were about but here and there a guarded light betrayed sin still awake and here and there a bell calling the faithful to church sounded a homely note of peace the morning was desperately close without a waft of air she found the abbot milo at his lodging in the act of setting off to mass at the church of saint martha the sight of her wild face stopped him no time to lose my child he said when he had heard her we must go to the queen it is due to her saviour of mankind he cried with flacking arms for what wast thou content to lay down thy life they hurried out together just as the sun broke upon the tiles of the domed churches and acre began to creep out of bed the queen was not yet risen but sent them word that she would receive the abbot but on no account madame de saintpol jehane pushed off the insult just as she pushed her hot hair from her face she had no thoughts to spare for herself the abbot went into the queens house berengere looked very drowned he thought in her great bed one saw a sharp white oval floating in the black clouds which were her hair she looked younger than any bride could be childish a child ill of a fever wilful querulous miserable all the time she listened to what milo had to say her lips twitched and her fingers plucked gold threads out of the cherubim on the coverlet kill the king of england kill my lord montferrat eh they cannot kill him oh oh ohshe moaned shudderinglyi would that they could then perhaps i should sleep o nights her strained eyes pierced him for an answer what answer could he give my news is authentic madame i came at once as my duty was to your grace as to the proper person here she sat right up in her bed wideeyed all alight yes yes i am the proper person i will do it if no other can virgin maryshe stretched her arms out like one crucifiedlook at me am i worthy of this if she addressed the virgin mary her invitation was pointedly to the abbot a less proper spectator he did look however and pitied her deeply at her lips dry with hatred which should have been freshly kissed at her drawn cheeks into her amazed young heart eh god he knew her loveworthy once and now most pitiful he had nothing to say she went on breathless gathering speed he has spurned me whom he chose he has left me on my wedding day i have never seen him alonedo you heed me never never once ah now he has chosen for his minion let her save him if she can what have i to do with him i am the daughter of a king and what is he to me who treats me so if i am not to be mother of england i am still daughter of navarre let him die let them kill him what else can serve me now she fell back and lay staring up at him in every word she said there was sickening justice what could milo do in his private mind he confirmed a suspicionbeing still loyal to his kingthat one and the same thing may be at one and the same time all black and all white he did his best to put this strange case madame he said i cannot excuse our lord the king nor will i but i can defend that noble lady whose only faults are her beauty and strong heart mentioning jehanes beauty he saw the queen look quickly at him her first intelligent look yes madame her beauty and the love she has been taught to give our lord the king married her uncanonically it is true but who was she to hold up church law before his face well then she by her own pure act caused herself to be put away by the king abjuring thus his kingly seat hey but it is so that by her own prayers her proper pleading her proper tears she worked against her proper honour and against the child in her womb what more could she do what more could any wife any mother than that ah say that you hate her without stint would you have her die why no for what pain can be worse than to live as she lives my lady she prevailed against the king but she could not prevail against her own holy nature working upon the kings great heart no when the king found out that she was to be mother of his child he loved her so well that though he must respect her prayers he must needs respect her person also the king thought within himself i have promised madame de saintpol that i will never strive with her in love and i will not now must i promise almighty god that in her life i will not strive so at all alas madame and alas here the king was too strong for the girl here her own nobility rose up against her pity her not blame her and for the kingi dare to say itfind pity as well as blame all those who love his high heart his crowned head find pity for him in theirs for many there are who do better having no occasion to do as ill but there can be none who mean better for none have such great motions milo might have spared his breath the queen had heard one phrase of all his speech and during the rest had pondered that when he had done she said fetch me in this lady i would speak with her breast shall touch breast here said milo to himself full of hope and mouth meet mouth courage old heart when the tall girl was brought in queen berengere did not look at her nor make any response to her deep reverence but bade her fetch a mirror from the table in this she looked at herself steadily for some time smoothing and coiling back her hair arranging her neckcovering so as to show something of her bosom and so on she sent jehane for boxes of unguent her colourboxes brush for the eyebrows powder for the face finally she had brought to her a little crown of diamonds and set it in her hair after patting her head and turning it about and about she put the glass down and made a long survey of jehane they do well she said who call you sulky you have a sulky mouth i allow your shape but there are reasons for that you are very tall you have a long throat green eyes are my detestationfie turn them from me your hair is wonderful and your skin i suppose women of the north are so commonly come nearer jehane obeying the queen touched her neck then her cheek show me your teeth she said they are strong and good but much larger than mine your hands are big and so are your ears you do well to cover them let me see your foot she peeped over the edge of the bed jehane put her foot out it is not so large as i expected said the queen but much larger than mine then she sighed and threw herself back you are certainly a very tall girl and twentythree years old i am not twenty yet and have had fifty lovers the abbot of poictiers said you were beautiful do you think yourself so it is not my part to think of it madame said jehane holding herself rather stiffly you mean that you know it too well said berengere i suppose it is true you have a fine colour and a fine personbut that is a womans now look at me carefully and say how you find me put your hand here and here and here touch my hair look well at my eyes my hair reaches to my knees when i stand up to the floor when i sit down i am a kings daughter do you not think me beautiful yes madame oh madame jehane trembling before her visions could hardly stand still but the queen who had no visions now the mirror was put by went plaining on when i was in my fathers court his poets called me frozen heart because i was cold in loving messire bertran de born loved me and so did my cousin the count of provence and the count of orange and raimbaut and gaucelm and ebles of ventadorn now i have found one colder than ever i was and i am burning are you a great lover of the king at this question put so quietly jehane grew grave it took her above her sense of dangers being in itself a dignity i love the king so well queen berengere she said that i think i shall make him hate me in time folly snapped the queen or guile you would spur him is it true what the abbot milo told me i know not what he has told you said jehane but it is true that i have not dared let the king love me and now dare least of all the queen clenched her hands and teeth you devil she said how i hate you you reject what i long for and he loathes me for your sake you a creature of nought and i a kings daughter from the nostrils of jehane the breath came fluttering and quick in her splendid bosom stirred a storm that if she had chosen to let it loose could have shrivelled this little prickly leaf but she replied nothing to the queens hatred instead with eyes fixed in vacancy and one hand upon her neck she spoke her own purpose and lifted the talk to high matters i touch not again your king and mine o queen but i go to save him woman said berengere do you dare tell me this are my miseries nothing to you have you not worked woe enough jehane suddenly threw her hair back fell upon her knees lifted her chin madame madame madame i must save him if i die i implore your pardoni must go why what can you do against montferrat the queen shivered a little jehane looked fixedly at her solemn as a dying nun you say that i am handsome she said then stopped then in a very low voicewell i will do what i can she hung her golden head the queen after a moment of shock laughed cruelly i suppose i could not wish you anything worse than that i hate you above all people in the world mother of a bastard oh it will be enough punishment go you hot snake leave me jehane rose to her feet bowed her head and went out next moment the queen must have whipped out of bed for she caught her before she could shut the door and clung to her neck sobbing desperately o god jehane save richard have mercy on me i am most wretched now the other seemed to be queen my girl said jehane i will do what i promised she kissed the scorching forehead and went away with milo to find giafar ibn mulk to get at him it was necessary to put the girl fanoum to the question this was done giafar ibn mulk enticed into the house proved to be a young man of prudence and resource he could not he said conduct them to his master because he had been told to conduct the marquess but an equally sure guide could be found and there were no objections to his delaying his own illustrious convoy for a week or more further than that he could not go nor did the near prospect of death which the abbot exhibited to him prove any inducement to the alteration of his mind death he said when the implements of that were before him if i am to die i am to die not twice it happens to a man but i recommend to these priests the expediency of first finding el safy as this was to be their guide up lebanon those priests agreed el safy also agreed when they had him a galley was got ready for sea the provisional grand master of the temple wrote a commendatory letter to his beloved friend in the one god sinan lord of the assassins vetus de monte and then in two days time milo the abbot jehane with her little fulke a few women and el safy their master in the affair left acre for tortosa whence they must climb on muleback to lebanon chapter vii the chapter of the sacrifice on lebanon also called cassandra from the haven at acre to the bill of tortosa is two days sailing with a fair wind thence climbing the mountains you reach musse in four days more if the passes are open if they are shut you do not reach it at all high on lebanon above the frozen gorge where orontes and leontes rivers of syria separate in their courses above the terrace of cedars above shurky the clouded mountain lies a deep green valley sentinelled on all sides by snow peaks and by the fortresses upon their tops in the midst of that among cedars and lines of cypress trees is the white palace of the lord of the assassins as big as a town a man may climb from pass to pass of lebanon without striking upon the place sighting it from some dangerous crag he may yet never approach it none visit the old man of musse but those who court death in one of his shapes and to such he never denies it dazzling snowcurtains black hangingwoods sheer walls of granite frame it in looking up on all sides you see the soaring pikes and deep under a cofferlid of blue it lies greener than an emerald a valley of easy sleep there in the great chambers young men lie dreaming of women and sleek boys stand about the doorways with cups of madness held close to their breasts they are eaters and drinkers of hemp these people which causes them to sleep much and wake up mad then when the old man calls one or another and says go down the mountains into the cities of the seaboard and when thou seest suchaone kiss him and strike deephe goes out then and there with fixed eyeballs and never turns them about until he finds whom he seeks nor ever shuts them until his work is done this is the custom of musse in the enclosed valley of lebanon thither on mules from tortosa came el safy leading the abbot milo and jehane and brought them easily through all the defiles to that castle on a spur which is called montferrand but in the language of the saracens barin from that height they looked down upon the domes and gardens of musse and knew that half their work was done what immediately followed was due to the insistence of el safy who said that if jehane was not suitably attired and veiled she would fail of her mission jehane did not like this it is not the custom of our women to be veiled el safy she said except at the hour when they are to be married and it is not the custom of our men replied the assassin to choose unveiled women and this for obvious reasons what are your reasons my son asked the abbot i will tell you said el safy if a man should come to our master with a veiled woman saying my lord i have here a woman faced like the moon and more melting than the peach that drops from the wall the old man would straightway conceive what manner of beauty this was and picture it more glorious than the truth could ever be and then the reality would climb up to meet his imagining but otherwise if he saw her barefaced before him for eyesight is destructive to mindsight if it precede it the eye must be servant so then he dreaming of the veiled treasure weds her and finds that she is just what was predicted of her by the merchant for women and other delights as we understand the affair are according to our zest and our zest is a thing of the minds devising added unto desire as the edge of a sword is superadded to the sword so the fair woman must certainly be veiled the saying hath meat in it said the abbot but here is no question of merchants nor of marriage pardieu if there is no question of marriage of what is there question in this company asked el safy let me tell you that two questions only concern the old man of musse jehane who had stood pouting with a very high head throughout this little colloquy said nothing but now she allowed el safy his way so she was dressed they put on her a purple vest thickly embroidered with gold and pearls underdrawers of scarlet silk and gauze trousers such as eastern women wear of many folds her hair was plaited and braided with pearls a broad silk girdle tied about her waist over all was put a thick white veil heavily fringed with gold round her ankles they put anklets of gold with little bells on them which tinkled as she walked last scarlet slippers they would have painted her face and eyebrows but that el safy decided that this was not at all necessary when all was done she turned to one of her women and demanded her baby el safy to milos surprise made no demur then they put her in a gold cage on a mules back and so let her down by a steep path into the region of birds and flowering trees there was very little conversation except when the abbot hit his foot against a rock in the valley they passed through a thick cedar grove and so came to the first of four gates of approach half a score handsome boys barelegged and in very short white tunics led them from hall to hall even to the innermost where the old man kept his state the first hall was of cedar painted red the second was of green wood with a fountain in the middle the third was deep blue and the fourth colour of fire but the next hall which was long and very lofty was white like snow except for the floor which had a bloodred carpet and there on a white throne sat the old man of musse himself as blanched as a swan robed all in white whitebearded and about him his assassins as colourless as he the ten boys knelt down and crossed their arms upon their bosoms el safy fell flat upon his face and crawling so like a worm came at length to the steps of the throne the old man let him lie while he blinked solemnly before him not the pope himself as milo had once seen him hoar with sanctity looked more remotely more awfully pure than this king of murder snowy upon his bloodred field what gave closer mystery was that the light came strange and milky through agate windows and that when the old man spoke it was in a dry whispering voice which with the sound of a murmur in the forest was in tune with the silence of all the rest el safy stood up and was rigid there ensued a passionless flow of question and answer the old man murmured to the roof scarcely moving his lips el safy answered by rote not moving any other muscles but his jaws as for the assassins they stayed squat against the walls as if they had been dead men buried sitting at a sign from el safy the abbot with veiled jehane came down the hail and stood before the white spectre on his throne jehane saw that this was really a man there was a faint tinge of red at his nostrils his eyes were yellowish and very bright his nails coloured red the shape of his head was that of an old bird she judged him bald under his high cap but his beard came below his breastbone when he opened his mouth to speak she observed that his teeth were the whitest part of him and his lips rather grey he did not seem to look at her but said to the abbot tell me why you have come into my country being a frank and a christian dog and why you have brought with you this fair woman my lord said the abbot after clearing his throat we are lovers and servants of the great king whom you call the melek richard a lion indeed in the paths of the moslems who makes bitter war upon your enemy the soldan and in defence of him we are come for it appears that a servant of your lordships called giafaribn mulk is now in acre which is king richards good town conspiring with the marquess the death of our lord it is the first i have heard of it said the old man he was sent for a different purpose but his hand is otherwise free what else have you to say why this my lord said the abbot that our lord the king has too many enemies not declared who compass his destruction while he compasses their souls health this is so shameful that we think it no time for the kings lovers to be asleep therefore i with this woman who of all persons living in the world is most dear to him as he to her have come to warn your lordship of the marquess his abominable design in the sure hope that your lordship will lend it no favour king richard we believe is besieging the holy city and therefore no doubt hath the countenance of almighty god but if the devil who loves the marquess and is sure to have him may reckon your lordship also upon his side we doubt that he may prevail and do you also think asked the old man scarcely audible that the melek richard will thank you for these precautions of yours my lord said milo we seek not his thanks nor his good opinion but his safety it is one thing to seek safety said the old man but another thing to find or keep it get you back to the doorway so they did and the lord of the place sat for a long time in a stare not moving hand or foot now it happened that the child in jehanes arm woke up and began to stretch itself and whimper and nozzle about for food jehane tried to hush it by rocking herself to and fro gently on one foot the abbot horrified frowned and shook his head but jehane who knew but one lord now richard was away took no notice presently young fulke set up a howl which sounded piercing in that still place milo began to say his prayers but no one moved except jehane whose course to her own mind was clear she put the great veil back over her head and bared her beauty she unfastened the purple vest and bared her bosom this she gave to the childs searching mouth the free gesture the bent head the unconscious doing made the act as lovely as the person fulke murmured his joy and jehane looking presently up saw the old mans solemn eyes blinking at her this did not disconcert her very much for she thought if he is correctly reported he has seen a mother before now it might seem that he had or had not his action reads either way after three minutes blinking he sent an old assassin not el safy down the hall to the door thus he reported saith the old man of musse lord of the assassins tell the sheik of the nazarenes that the marquess of montferrat shall come up and go down and after that come up no more also let the sheik depart in peace and with all speed lest i repent and put him suddenly to death as for the fair woman she must remain among my ladies and become my dutiful wife as a ransom price the abbot as one thunderstruck raised his hands on high o sack of sin he groaned o dross for the meltingpot o unspeakable sacrifice but jehane gravely smiling checked him why lord abbot is any sacrifice too great for king richard she asked gently reproving him nay go my father i shall do very well i am not at all afraid now do what i shall tell you kiss the hand of my lord richard from me when you see him bidding him remember the vows we made to each other on the day at fontevrault when he took up the cross and again before the lifted host at cahors and to my lady queen berengere say this that from this day forth i am wife of a man and stand not between her bed and the king as god knows i have never meant to stand kiss me now my father and pray diligently for me he tells us that he did and records the day long ago when he had first kissed the poor girl in the chapel of the dark tower the day when as she hoped she had taught her great lover to tread upon her heart at this time a great black the chief of the eunuchs came and touched her on the shoulder whither now friend said jehane he pointed the way being a deafmute lead said she i will follow and so she did she turned no more her head nor did she go with it lowered but carried it cheerfully as if her business was good the black led her by many winding ways to a garden filled with orangetrees and across this to a bronze door there stood two more blacks on guard with naked swords in their hands the eunuch struck twice on the lintel the door was opened from within and they entered an old lady dressed in black came to meet them to her the eunuch handed jehane made a reverence and retired they shut the bronze doors what more after the bath and putting on of habits more sumptuous than she had ever heard tell of she was taken by slaves into the hall of felicity there among the heavyeyed languid women jehane sat herself staidly down and suckled her child chapter viii of the goingup and goingdown of the marquess the marquess of montferrat travelled splendidly from acre to sidon with six galleys in his convoy so many indeed did not suffice him for at sidon he took off his favourite wife with her women eunuchs and janissaries and thus with twelve ships came to tripolis thence by the aleppo road he went to karak of the knights thence again after a rest of two days he startedhe the knights and esquires of his body in cloth of gold with scarlet housings for the mules litters for his womenkind with his poets his jongleurs his priest his turcopoles and favourites all this gaudy company for the great ascent of montferrand his mind was to impress the old man of musse but it fell out otherwise the old man was not easily impressed because he was so accustomed to impressing you do not prophesy to prophets or shake priests with miracles when he reached the top of montferrand he was met by a grave old sheik who informed him quietly that he must remain there the marquess was very angry the sheik very grave the marquess stormed and talked of armed hosts look up my lord said the sheik the mountainridges were lined with bowmen in the hangingwoods he saw the gleam of spears between them and the sky on all sides as far as one could see gloomed the frozen peaks the marquess felt a sinking he arose chastened on the morrow and negotiations were resumed on the altered footing finally he begged for but three persons without whose company he said he could not do he must have his chaplain his fool and his barber impossible the sheik said adding that if they were so necessary to the marquess he might for the present remain with them at montferrand in that case however he would not see the lord of the assassins but that very honourable sir said the marquess with illconcealed impatience is the simple object of my journey so it was reported the sheik observed it is for you to consider for my own part i should say that these persons cannot be indispensable for a short visit i can give his lordship a week said the marquess my master replied the sheik may give you an hour but considers that half that time should be ample to be sure there is the waiting for audience which is always wearisome my friend the marquess said opening his eyes i am the kingelect of jerusalem i know nothing of such things replied the sheik i think we had better go down three only went down the sheik the marquess and giafar ibn mulk when at last they were in the gardenvalley and better still had reached the third of the halls of degree they were met by the chief of the eunuchs who told them his master was in the harem and could not be disturbed the marquess who so far had been all smiles and interest was now greatly annoyed but there was no help for that in the blue court he must needs wait for nearly three hours by the time he was ushered into the milky light of the audience chamber he was faint with rage and apprehension he was dazzled he stumbled over the bloodred carpet arrived fainting at the throne there he stayed tonguecloven while the colourless lord of assassins blinked inscrutably upon him with eyes so narrow that he could not tell whether he so much as saw him and the adepts rigid by the tribunewall stared at their own knees what do you need of me marquess of montferrat asked the old hierarch in his most remote voice the marquess gulped some dignity into himself excellent sir he said i seek the amity of one king to another alliance in a common good cause the giving and receiving of benefits and similar courtesies these propositions were written down on tablets and carefully scrutinized by the old man of musse who said at last let us take these considerations in order of what kings do you propound the amity of yourself sir replied the marquess and of myself i am not a king said sinan and had not heard that you were one either i am kingelect of jerusalem the marquess replied with stiffness the old man raised his wrinkled forehead well he said let us get on what is your common good cause eh eh said the marquess brightening it is the cause of righteous punishment i strike at your enemy the soldan through his friend king richard the old man pondered him do you strike marquess he asked at length sir the marquess made haste to answer your question is just it so happens that i cannot strike king richard because i cannot reach him i admit it i am quite frank but you can strike him i believe in so doing let me observe you will deal a mortal blow at saladin who loves him and makes treaties with him to your detriment and the scandal of christendom do you speak of the scandal of christendom asked sinan twinkling alas i must said the marquess very mournful the cause is near to your heart i see marquess it is in it replied the marquess the old man considered him afresh then inquired where the melek might be found the marquess told him we believe he is at ascalon separate from the duke of burgundy giafar ibn mulk and cogia hassan said the old man as if talking in his sleep come hither the two young men rose from the wall and fell upon their faces before the throne their master spoke to them in the tone of one ordering a meal return with the marquess to the coast by the way of emesa and baalbek and when you are within sight of sidon strike one of you will be burned alive i think it will be giafar let the other return speedily with a token the audience is finished the old man closed his eyes at a touch from another the two prostrate assassins crept up and kissed his foot then rose waiting for the marquess he pale as death saw felt heard nothing at another sign a man put his hand on either shoulder ha jesusgod grunted the marquess as the sweat dripped off him stop bleating silly sheep you will awaken the master said giafar in a quick whisper they led him away and the old man slept in peace the marquess saw nothing of his people at montferrand for to begin with they were not there and secondly he was led another way by the desolate crag of masyaf where a fortress hung as it seems in midair watches the valleys like a little cloud through fields of snow by terraces cut in the ice where the sheer rises and drops a thousand feet either way so to emesa a mountain village huddled in perpetual shadows thence down to baalbek and by foaming rivergorges into the sun and sight of the dimpling sea thus they led the doomed italian he by this time knew the end was coming and had braced himself to meet it stolidly the towers of sidon rose chastely white above the violet they saw the golden sands rimmed with foam they saw the ships going down a lane luxuriant with flowers and scented shrubs where steep cactus hedges shut out the furrowed fields and olive gardens and the cicalas made hissing music giafar ibn mulk broke the silence of the three men is it time he asked of his brother without turning his head not yet cogia replied the marquess prayed vehemently but with shut lips they reached an open moor where there were rocks covered with cistus and wild vine here the air was very sweet and pure the sun pleasant the marquesss ass grew frisky pricked up his ears and brayed giafar ibn mulk edged up close and put his arm round the marquesss neck the signal is a good one he said strike cogia cogia drove his knife in up to the heft the marquess coughed giafar lifted him from his ass quite dead now says he go thou back cogia i will stay here for so the old man plainly desired i think with you said cogia give me the token so they cut off the marquesss right hand and cogia after shaking it put it in his vest when he was well upon his way to the mountain road giafar sat down on a bank of violets ate some bread and dates then went to sleep in the sun so afterwards he was found by a picket of soldiers from sidon who also found all of their lord but his right hand they took giafar ibn mulk and burned him alive the old man of musse was extremely kind to jehane who pleased him so well that he was seldom out of her company he thought fulke a fine little boy as he could hardly fail to be owning such parents all the liberty that was possible to the favourite of such a great prince she had one day about six weeks after she had first come into the valley he sent for her when she had come in and made her reverence he drew her near to his throne put his arm round her and kissed her he observed with satisfaction that she was looking very well my child he said kindly i have news which i am sure will please you very much of the marquess of montferrat is by this time lying disintegrate in a vault jehanes green eyes faltered for a moment as she gazed into his wise old face sir she asked by habit is this true it is quite true said the old man in proof of it regard his hand which one of my assassins the survivor has brought me he drew from his bosom a pale hand and would have laid it in jehanes lap if she had let him as she would not he placed it beside him on the floor pursuing his discourse he said i might fairly claim my reward for that and so i should if i had not got it already again jehane pondered him gravely what reward more have you sire the old man smiling very wisely pressed her waist jehane thought why what will you do with me now sire she inquired will you kill me can you ask said the old man then he went on more seriously to say that he supposed the life of king richard to be safe for the immediate future but that he foresaw great difficulties in his way before he could be snug at home the marquess of montferrat was by no means his only enemy he told her the melek suffers what all great men suffer from the envy of others who are too obviously fools for him to suppose them human creatures but there is nothing a fool dislikes so much as to behold his own folly and as your melek is a lookingglass for these kind you may depend upon it they will smudge him if they can he is the bravest man in the world and one of the best rulers but he has no discretion he is too absolute and loves too little jehane opened her eyes very wide why do you know my lord sire she asked the old man took her hand there are very few personages in the world of whom i do not know something he said and i tell you that there are terms to the meleks government a man cannot say yea and nay as he chooses without paying the price the debt on either hand mounts up he may choose with whom he will settlethose he has favoured or those he has denied as a rule one finds the former more insatiable let him then beware of his brother jehane leaned towards him pleading with eyes and mouth oh sire she said trembling at the lips if you have any regard for me tell me when any danger threatens king richard for then i must leave you why that is as it may be said her master but i will let you know what i think good for you to know and that must content you jehanes beauty enhanced as it was now by the sumptuous attire which she loved and by her bodily wellbeing was great and her modesty greater but her heart was the greatest thing she had she raised her eyes again to the twinkling eyes of her possessor and kept them there for a few steady seconds while she turned over his words in her mind then she looked down saying i will certainly stay with you till my lords danger is at hand it is a good air for my baby it is good for all manner of things said the old man and remarkably good for you my garden of exhaustless pleasure and i will see to it that it continues to water the roses in your cheeks beautiful child jehane folded her hands you will do as you choose my lord said she i doubt not be quite sure of it dear child said the old man then he sent her back into the harem chapter ix how king richard reaped what jehane had sowed and the soldan was gleaner consider with anxious care the marrow of your master when he is fortunate writes milo of poictiers if it lasts him he is a slow spender of his force but on that account all the more dangerous in adversity having the deeper funds by this i would be understood to imply that the devil of anjou turned to fighting uses in king richards latter years found him a habitable fortalice with the best reasons in life for the reflection he might have said it more simply for it is simply true deserted by his allies balked of his great aspiration within a days march of the temple of god yet as far from that as from his castle of chinon eaten with fever having death lost purpose murmurings fed envy reproach upon his consciencehe yet fought his way through sullen leagues of mud to ascalon besieged it drove his enemy out regained it thence pushing quickly south he surprised darum and put the garrison to the sword by this act he cut saladin in two and drove such a wedge into the body of his empire as might leave either lung of it at his mercy the time seemed indeed ripe for negotiation saladin sent his brother down from jerusalem with presents of hawks richard sitting in armed state at darum received him affably there was still a chance that treaty might win for jesus christ what the sword had not won then as if in mockery of the greatness of men came ill news apace the frenchmen back in acre heard tell of montferrats doings and undoing pretty work of this sort perturbed the allies the duke of burgundy charged saladin with the murder saintpol loudly charged king richard and the dukes death coming timely left him in the field he made the most of his chance wrote to the emperor to king philip to his cousin the archduke of austria at home by now of this last shameful deed of the red angevin he even sent messengers to richard himself with open letters of accusal richard laughed but for all that broke off negotiations with saladin until he could prove saintpol as great a liar as he himself knew him to be then rose up again the question of the crown of jerusalem the count of champagne took ship and came to darum to beg it of richard he too brought news with him the duke of burgundy was dead of an apoplexy it seems that god is still faintly on my side said richard there went out a sooty candle the next words gave his boast the lie beau sire said count henry i grieve to tell you something more before i left acre i saw the abbot milo richard had grey streaks in his face ah he says hoarsely go on cousin the young man stammered beau sire god strikes in divers places but always finds out the joints of our harness go on says king richard sitting very still dear sire my cousin the abbot milo went out of acre three weeks before the death of the marquess with him also went madame jehane but he returned without her this is all i know though it is not all that the abbot knows at the mention of her name the king took a sharp breath as you or i do when quick pain strikes us to the rest he listened without a sign and asked at the end where is milo he is at acre sire says the count and in prison who put him there myself sire you did wrong count get you back to acre and bring him to me champagne went away great trouble as you know always made richard dumb the grief struck inwards and congealed he became more than ever his own councillor the worst in the world lucky for the abbot milo that he was in bonds but now you see why he penned the aphorism with which i began this chapter after that short stabbing flash across his face he shut down misery in a vice the rest of his talk with the count might have been held with a groom henry of champagne knowing the man left him the moment he got the word and king richard sat down by the table and for three hours never stirred he was literally motionless straightly rigid a little grey about the face white at the cheekbones his clenched hand stiff on the board white also at the knuckles his eyes fixed on the doormen came in knelt and said their say then encountering his blank eyes bent their heads and backed out quietly if he thought none may learn his thought if he felt none may touch the place if he prayed let those who are able imagine his prayers what jehane had been to him this book may have shadowed out this only i say that he knew from the very first hint of the fact why she had gone out with milo and sent milo home alone the queen knew because jehane had told her but he knew with no telling at all she had gone away to save him from herself needing him not because she so loved him it was her beauty which was hungry for his desire not daring to mar her beauty she had sought to hide it greater love hath none than this if he thought of that it should have softened him he did not think of it he knew it at the end of his grim vigil he got up and went out of his house he was served with his horse his esquires came at call to the routine of garrison days and nights he rode round the walls out at one of the gates on a sharp canter of reconnaissance in the hills perhaps he spoke more shortly than usual and more drily there may have been a dead quality in his voice usually so salient there was no other sign at supper he sat before them all ate and drank at his wont once only he startled the hallful of them he dropped his great gold cup and it split but as day followed night all men saw the change in him christians and saracens alike a spirit of quiet savagery seemed to possess him the cunning with the mad interludes of a devil he set patient traps for the saracens in the hills and slaughtered all he took one day he fell upon a great caravan of camels coming from babylon to jerusalem and having cut the escort to pieces slew also the merchants and travellers he seemed to give the sword the more heartily in that he sought it for himself but could never get it no doubt he deserved to get it he performed deeds of impossible foolhardy gallantry the deeds of a knighterrant rode solitary made singlehanded rescues suffered himself to be cut off from his posts and then with a handful of knights or alone indeed carved his way back to darum des barres the earl of leicester and the grand master never left his side gaston of bearn used to sleep at the foot of his bed and creep about after him like a cat but this terrible mood of his wore them out then at last the count of champagne came back with milo and more bad news joppa was in sore straits again besieged the bishop of sarum was returned from the west having a branch of dead broom in his hand and stories of a throttled kingdom on his lips before any other richard had milo alone the good abbot is very reticent about the interview in his book what he omits is more significant than what he says i found my master he writes sitting up in his bed in his hauberk of mail they told me he had eaten nothing for two days yet vomited continually he had killed five hundred saracens meantime i suppose he knew who i was tell me my good man he said strange address the name of the person to whom madame danjou took you i said sire we went to the lord of the assassins whom they call old man of musse why did you go monk he asked and felt about for his sword but could not find it yet it was close by i said sire because of a report which had reached the ears of madame that the marquess and the old man were in league to have you murdered to this he made no reply except to call me a fool later he asked how died the marquess sire i answered most miserably he went up lebanon to see the old man and came presently down again with two of the assassins in his company but none of his train these persons being near his city of sidon at a signal agreed upon stabbed him with their long knives then cut off his right hand and despatched it to the old man by one of them the other stayed by the corpse and was so found peacefully sleeping and burned the king said nothing but gave me money and a little jewel he used to wear as if i had done him a service then he nodded a dismissal and i wondering left him he did not speak to me again for many weeks you may collect that richard was very ill he was the disease of his mind fed fat upon the disease of his body and from the spoils of the feast savagery reared its clotted head syrian mothers still quell their children with the name of melek richard a reminiscence of the dreadful time when he was without ruth or rest he spoke of his purposes to none listened to none the bishop of sarum had come in with a budget of disastrous news count john had england under his heel philip of france had entered normandy in force the lords of aquitaine were in revolt if god had no use for him in the east here was work to do in the west but had he none what of joppa shuddering under the sword what of acre where the french army wallowed in sloth with two queens at its mercy and saintpol in the mercyseat what indeed of jehane nobody breathed her name yet night and day the image of her floated halfhid in scarlet clouds before king richard these clouds a torn regiment raced across his vision like cavalry broken in mad retreat out of the tumbled mass two hands would throw up white long thin hands jehanes hands drowned in frothy blood then in his waking dream when he drove in the spurs and started to save the colours changed black swam over the blood and one hand only would stay held up warningly saying forbear i am separate fenced set apart thus it was always menace wicked endeavour shipwreck ruin always so her agony and denial his wrath and defeat but this was wholesome torment there was other not so purgatorialdamned torment that was when the sudden thought of her possession by another man of his own robbery his own impotence to regain came upon him in a surging flood and made his neck swell with the rage of a beast and no crouching to spring no flash through the air no snatching here here was no gilles de gurdun to deal with only the beasts resource was his who had the beasts desire without his power at such times of obsession he lashed up and down his chamber or the flat roof of his house all the tragic quest of a leopard in a cage making blank his desperate hunting eyes lord lord lord how long can this endure alas the cage was wider than any room and stronger by virtue of his own fashioning of the locks but to do him justice jehanes grave face would sail like a moon among the stormclouds sooner or later and humble him to the dust sometimes mostly at dawn when a cool wind stole through the trees he saw the trail of events more clearly and knew whom to blame and whom to praise generous as he was through and through at these times he did not spare the whip but the image he set up before whom to scourge himself was jehane saintpol that pure cold saint offering up her proud body for his needs and so sure as he did that he desired her and so sure as he desired he raged that he had been robbed robber as he owned himself now he had been robbed so the old black strife began again many and many a dawn as he thought of these things he went out alone into the shadowless places of the land to the quiet lapping sea to the gardens or to the housetop fronting the newborn day with prayer throbbing for utterance but a tongue too dry to pray despair seized on him and he led his men out to deathdealing that so haply he might find death for himself the time wore to early summer while he was nightly visited by the thought of his sin and daily winning more stuff for repentance then one morning instead of going out singly to battle with his own soul he went in to the abbot milo what follows shall be told in his own words the king came to me very early in the morning of saints primus and felician while i yet lay in my bed milo milo said he what must i do to be saved he was very white and wild shaking all over i said dear master save thy people on all sides they cry to theefrom england from normandy from anjou from joppa also and acre there is no lack of entreaty he shook his head here he said i can do no more god is against me the work too holy for such a wretch lord i said we are all wretches heaven save us if your grace is held off gods inheritance you can at least hold others from your own here may be you took a charge too heavy but there at home the charge was laid upon you renouncing here you shall gain there it cannot be otherwise i believed in what i said but he gripped the caps of his knees and rocked himself about they have beaten me milo saintpol burgundy beauvaisi am bayed by curs what am i milo sire i said your fathers son as they bayed the old lion so they bay the young he gaped at me openmouthed by god milo he said i bayed him myself and believed that he deserved it lord i answered who am i to judge a great king for my part i never believed that monstrous sin was upon him here he jumped up i am going home milo he said i am going home i am going to my fathers tomb i will do penance there and serve my people and live clean look now milo shrive me if thou hast the power for my need is great the thought was blessed to him he confessed his sins then and there all a huddle of them weeping so bitterly that i should have wept myself had i not been ready rather to laugh and crack my fingers to see the breaking up of his long and deadly frost before i shrived him moreover i dared to speak of madame jehane how he had now lost her for ever and why how she was now at last a mans wife and that by her own deliberate will and how also he must do his duty by the queen to all of which he gave heed and promises of quiet endurance then i shrived him and that very morning gave him the lords sacred body in the church of the sepulchre i believed him sane and so for a long time he was as he testified by deeds of incredible valour it was not long after this that the fleet put out to sea shaping course for acre message after message came in from beleaguered joppa but king richard paid little heed to them pending the issue of new treating with saladin he certainly sailed with a single eye on acre but joppa lay on his course and it is probable he being what he was that the sight of no means to do great deeds made great deeds done when his red galley sighted joppa standing in for the purpose all seemed over with the doomed city this no doubt since his mood was hot urged him to one of those impossible acts incredible deeds of valour as milo calls them for which his name lives while those of many better kings are forgotten the country about joppa slopes sharply to the sea and gives little or no shelter for ships but so quick is the slope that a galley may ride under the very walls of the town and take in provision from the seaward windows on the landward side it is dangerously placed seeing that the stoop of the country runs from the mountains to it the few outlying forts the stone bridge over the river cannot be held against a resolute foe when king richards fleet drew near enough to see it was plain what had been done the saracens had carried the outworks they held the bridge at leisure they had broached the walls and swarmed in the flag on the citadel still flew battle or carnage was raging in the streets all about it its fall was a matter of hours now king richard stood on the poop of his galley watching all this he saw a man come running down the mole chased by half a dozen horsemen in yellow a priest by the look of him you could see the gleam of his tonsure as he plunged for so he did plunged into the sea and swam for his life the pursuers drew up on the verge and shot at him with their long bows they were of saladins bodyguard fine marksmen who should never have missed him but the priest swam like a fish and they did miss him king richard himself hooked him out by the gown and then clipped him in his arms like a lover oh brave priest oh hardy heart he cried full of the mans bravery give him room there let him cough up the salt by my soul barons i wish that any draught of wine may be so glorious sweet the priest sat up and told his tale the city was a shambles every man woman or child had been put to the sword only the citadel held out there was no time to lose no time was lost for king richard in his tunic and breeches as he was in his deck shoes without a helm unmailed in any part snatched up shield and axe who follows anjou he called out then plunged into the sea des barres immediately followed him then gaston of bearn with a yell and the earl of leicester neck and neck then the bishop of salisbury a stouthearted prince auvergne limoges and mercadet these eight were all the men in authority that trenchemer held except some clerks fat men who loved not water but as soon as the other ships saw what was afoot a man here and there followed his king the rest rowed closer to the shore and engaged the saracen horsemen with their archers long before any men could be got off the eight were on dry land and had found a way into the sacked city how they did what they did the god of battles knows best but that they did it is certain all accounts of the fray agree bohadin with vinsauf moslem and christian alike what pent rage what storm curbed up short what gall what mortification what smoulder of resentment bit into king richard we may guess who know him such it was as to nerve his arm nerve his following to be his lovers make him unassailable make a devil of him not a devil of blind fury but a cold devil who could devise a scope for his malice choose how to do his stabbing work wiseliest inside the town gate they took up close order wedgewise linked and riveted a shield before shields beside richard with his doubleaxe for the wedges beak they took the steep street at a brisk pace turning neither right nor left but heading always for the citadel boring through and trampling down what met them this at first was not very much only at one corner a company of nubian spears came pelting down a lane hoping to cut them off by a flank movement richard stopped his wedge the blacks buffeted into their shields with a shock that scattered and tossed them up like spray the wedge held firm red work for axe and swords while it lasted they killed most of the nubians drove bodily through the rabble at their heels then into the square of the citadel they came it was packed with a shrieking horde whose drums made the day a hell whose great banners wagged and rocked like osiers in a floodwater they were trying to fire the citadel and some were swarming the walls from others backs the square was like a whirlpool in the sea a sea of tense faces whose waves were surging men and the flying wrack their gonfanons king richard saw how matters lay in this horrible hive these men could not fight so close cavalry can do nothing in a dense mass of foot bowmen cannot shoot confined spearmen against swords are little worth javelins sped once so much he saw and also the straining crowd the lifted threatening arms the stretched necks about the citadel o lord the heathen are come into thine inheritance at the word sirs cleave a way and then he cried above the infernal riot save holy sepulchre save saint george and the wedge drove into the thick of them this work was butchers work like sawing through live flesh too much blood in the business after a while the haft of the kings axe got rotten with it and at a certain last blow gave way and bent like a pulpy stock he helped himself to a beheaded mamelukes scimitar and did his affair with that once twice thrice and four times they furrowed that swarm of men nothing broke their line richard himself was only cut in the feet where he trod on mailed bodies or broken swords the others being themselves in mail were without scathe they held the square until the count of champagne came up with knights and pisan arbalestiers and then the day was won they drove out the invaders on the templars house they ran up the english dragonflag king richard rested himself two days later a pitched battle was fought on the slopes above joppa saladin met richard for the last time and the melek worsted him our king with fifteen knights played the wedge again when his enemy was packed to his taste and this time being known with less carnage but the left wing of the invading army reentered the town the garrison had a panic richard wheeled and scoured them out at the other end so they perished in the sea men say who saw him that he did it alone so terrible a name he had with the saracens this may very well be there had never been seen said they such a fighter before like sheep they huddled at his sight and like sheep his onset scattered them let god arise says milo with a shaking pen and lo he arose o lion in the path who shall stand up against thee he drove saladin into the hills and set him manning once more the watchtowers of jerusalem but he had reached his limit sickness fastened on him and on the ebb of his fury came lagging old despair for a week he lay in his bed delirious babbling breathless foolish things of jehane and the dark tower of the broomy downs by poictiers the hills of languedoc of henry his handsome brother of bertran de born and the falcon at le puy then followed a pleasant thing saladin the noble foe heard of it and sent saphadin his brother to visit him they brought the great emir into the tent of his great enemy o god of the christians cried he with tears what is this work of thine to make such a mirror of thy might and then to shatter the glass he kissed king richards burning forehead then stood facing the standersby i tell you my lords there has been no such king as this in our country my brother the sultan would rather lose jerusalem than have such a man to die at this richard opened his eyes eh saphadin my friend he says death is not mine yet nor jerusalem either make me a truce with my brother saladin for three years then with the grace of god i will come and fight him again but for this time i am spent are you wounded dear sire asked saphadin wounded said the king in a whisper yes wounded in the soul and in the heartsick sick sick saphadin kneeling down kissed his ring may the god whom in secret we both worship the god of gods do well by you my brother so he said and richard nodded and smiled at him kindly when peace was made they carried him to his ship the fleet went to acre chapter x the chapter called bonds king richard sent for his sister joan of sicily on the morrow of his coming to acre and thus addressed her let me hear now sister the truth of what passed when the queen saw madame danjou madame danjou cried joan who as you know had plenty of spirit i think you rob the queen of a title there i cannot rob her of what she never had said king richard but i will repeat my question if you do not remember it no need sire replied the lady and told him all she knew she added sire and my brother if i may dare to say so i think the queen has a grief madame jehane made no pretensionsi hope i do her full justicebut remember that the queen made none either you took her of your royal will she was conscious of the honour but of what you gave you took away more than half the queen loves you richard she is a most miserable lady yet there is time still make a wife of your queen brother richard and all will be well for what other reason in the world did madame jehane what she did for love of an old man whom she had never seen do you think the kings brow grew dark red he spoke deliberately i will never make her my wife i will never willingly see her again i should sin against religion or honour if i did either i will never do that let her go to her own country sire sire said joan how is she to do that as she will says the king but for my part of it with every proper accompaniment sire the dowry i return it every groat the affront the affront is offered i prevent a greater affront is this fixed richard irrevocably she loves you sire she loves ill get up on your feet sire i beseech you pity her i pity her deeply i think i pity everybody with whom i have had to deal i do not choose to have any more pitiful persons about me fare you well sister go lest i pity you she pleaded ah sire the audience is at an end said the king and the queen of sicily rose to take leave he kept his word never saw berengere again but once and that was not yet what remained for him to do in syria he did patched up a truce with saladin saw to henry of champagnes election to guy of lusignans establishment dealt out such rewards and punishments as lay in his power sent the two queens with a convoy to marseilles then two years from his hopeful entry into acre as a conqueror he left it a defeated man he had won every battle he had fought and taken every city he had invested his allies had beaten him not the heathen they were to beat him again with help the very skies took their part he was beset by storms from the day he launched on the deep separated from his convoy driven from one shore to another fatally delayed his enemies had time to gather at home eustace of saintpol beauvais philip of france and behind all these was john of mortain moving heaven and earth and them to get him a realm by a providence as he thought it richard put into corsica under stress of weather and there heard how the land lay in gaul philip had won over raymond of toulouse saintpol heading a jointarmy of theirs was near marseilles ready to destroy him king richard was to walk into a trap by this time you must know he had no more to his power than the galley he rode in and three others he had no des barres no gaston no beziers he had not even mercadet his captain and no thought where they might be the trap would have caught him fast pretty work he said pretty work but i will better it he put about and steered round sicily for the coast of dalmatia here was caught again by furious gales lost three ships out of the four he had and finally sought haven at gazara a little fishing village on that empty shore his intention was to travel home by way of germany and the low countries and so land in england while his brother john was still in france either he had forgotten or did not care to remember that all this country was a fief of the archduke luitpolds he knew of course that luitpold hated him but not that he held him guilty of montferrats murder suspecting no great difficulty he sent up messengers to the lord of gazara for a safeconduct for certain merchants pilgrims this man was an austrian knight called gunther who are your pilgrims gunther asked and was told master hugh a merchant of alost he and his servants what manner of a merchant was gunthers next question my lord they said who had seen him a fine man tall as a tree and strong and straight having keen blue eyes and a reddish beard on his chin as the men of flanders do not use gunther said let me see this merchant and went down to the inn where king richard was now richard was sitting by the fire warming himself when gunther came in furred and portly he did not rise up which was unfortunate in a pretended merchant are you master hugh of alost gunther asked looking him over that is the name i bear said richard and who are you my friend the austrian stammered hey thou dear god i am lord gunther of this castle and town he said raising his voice then the king got up to make a reverence and in so doing betrayed his stature i should have guessed it sir by your gentleness in coming to visit me here i ask your pardon thus the king while gunther wondered you are a very tall merchant hugh says he do they make your sort in alost king richard laughed it is the only advantage i have of your lordship for the rest my countrywomen make straight men i think were you bred in alost master hugh asked gunther suspiciously and again richard laughed as he said ah you must ask my mother lord gunther lightning was the austrians thought here is a pretty easy merchant he raised some little difficulties vexations of routine which king richard persistently laughed at while doing his best to fulfil them gunther did not relish this he named the archduke as his overlord hard upon strangers richard let it slip that he did not greatly esteem the archduke however in the end he got his safeconduct and all would have been well if on leaving gazara he had not overpaid the bill overpay is not the word he drowned the bill in a hurry for the road the innkeeper fretted him reckoning landlord he cried with one foot in the stirrup how the devil am i to reckon halfway up a horse here reckon yourself my man and content you with these he threw a fistful of gold besants on the flags turned his horse sharply and cantered out of the yard colossal man gasped the innkeeper king or devil but no merchant under the sun so the news spread abroad and gunther puffed his cheeks over it a sixfoottwo man a monstrous leisurely merchant who rose not to the lord of a castle and town who did not wait for his lordships humour but found laughable matter in his own who was taller than the archduke and thought his grace a dull dog who made a danae of his landlord was this man jove who could think the archduke a dull dog except an emperor or perhaps a great king a king stay now there were wandering kings abroad how if richard of england had lost his way here he slapped his thigh but this must be richard of englandwhat other king was so tall and in that case o thunder in the sky he had let slip his archdukes deadly enemy he howled for his lanzknechts his boots helmet great sword he set off at once and riding by forest ways cut off the merchant in a day and a night he ran him to earth in the small wooden inn of a small wooden village high up in the carinthian alps blomau by name which lies in a forest clearing on the road to gratz king richard was drinking sour beer in the kitchen and not liking it the lanzknechts surrounded the house gunther with two of them behind him came clattering in glad of the diversion richard looked up ha here is lord gunther again said he better than beer king richard of england said the austrian white by nature heat and his feelings i make you my prisoner so it seems replied the king sit down gunther i offer you beer and a most indifferent cheese but gunther would by no means sit down in the presence of an anointed king for one bidding ah sire it is proper that i should stand before you he said huskily greatly excited it is not at all proper when i tell you to be seated returned king richard so gunther sat down and wiped his head richard finished his beer and then they went to sleep on the floor early in the morning the prisoner woke up his gaoler come gunther he says we had better take the road i am ready sire says gunther manifestly unready he rose and shook himself lead then richard said i follow you sire lead you white dog said the king and showed his teeth for a moment the austrian obeyed one of richards few attendants a norman called martin vaux adopted for his own salvation the simple expedient of staying behind and gunther was in far too exalted a mood to notice such a trifle when he and his troop had rounded the forest road martin vaux rounded it also but in the opposite direction he was rather a fool though not fool enough to go to prison if he could help it being a seaman by grace he smelt for his element and by grace found it after not many days more of him presently archduke luitpold was in his good town of gratz when news was brought him and the man du lieber gott he crowed ach mein gunther and embraced his vassal his fiery little eyes burned red as mars when he flickers but he was a gentleman he took richards proffered hand and after some fumbling about kissed it ha sire came the words deeply exultant from his big throat now we are on more equal terms it appears i agree with you luitpold said the king and then even as the archduke was wetting his lips for the purpose he added but i hope you will not stretch your privilege so far as to make me a speech austria swallowed hard sire it would take many speeches to wipe out the provocations i have received at your hands all the speeches in the councils of the world could not excuse the deaths of my second cousin the count of saintpol and of my first cousin the marquess of montferrat that is true replied richard but neither could they restore them to life sire sire cried the archduke upon my soul i believe you guilty of the marquesss death i assumed that you did was the kings answer and your protestation adds no weight to my theory but otherwise do you admit it king richard the archduke an amazed man looked foolish his mouth fell open and his hair stuck out this gave him the appearance of a perturbed eagle in a bush i am far from denying it says richard i never deny any charges and never make any unless i am prepared to pursue them which is not the case at present i must keep you in safe hold sire the archduke said i must communicate with my lord the roman emperor you are in your right luitpold said king richard the end of the days work was that the king of england was lodged in a high tower some sixty feet above the town wall now consider the acts of martin vaux smelling for the sea in a little time he did better than that for he saw it from the top of a high mountain shining far off in the haze and then had nothing to do but follow down a riverbed which brought him duly to trieste thence he got a passage to venice where the wineshops were too good or too many for him he talked of his misfortunes of his broken shoes of austrian beer of his exalted master of his extreme ingenuity and capacity for all kinds of faithful service now venice was as it is now a place colluvies gentium gaunt lonely arabs stalked the narrow streets or dreamed motionless by the walls of the quay the city was full of strayed crusaders disastrous broken blades of renegade christians renegade moslems adaptable jews of pilgrims and chafferers of relics from the holy places martins story spread like the plague but not unhappily to any advantage of king richard imperturbable in his tower martin vaux then having drunk up the charity of venice shipped for ancona there too he met with attentions for there he met a countryman of his the sieur gilles de gurdun a norman knight when sir gilles heard that king richard was in prison but that jehane was not with him he grew very red that he had never learned of her deeds at acre need not surprise you he had not heard because he had not been to acre with the french host but instead had gone pilgrim to jerusalem and thence with lusignan to cyprus so now he took martin vaux by the windpipe and shook him till his eyes stared like agate balls tell me where madame jehane is you clot or i finish what i have begun he said terribly but martin could tell him no more for he was quite dead it was proper even in ancona to be moving after that and gilles was very ready to move the hunger and thirst for jehane which had never left him for long came aching back to such a pitch that he felt he must now find her see her touch her or die the king was her only clue he must hunt him out wherever he might be one of two things had occurred either richard had tired of her or he had lost her by mischance of travel there was a third possible thing that the queen had had her murdered he put that from him being sure she was not dead death said gilles is great but not great enough to have jehane in her beauty he really believed this so he came back to his two positions if the king had tired of her he would not scruple being as he was to admit as much to gilles if he had lost her he was safe in prison and gilles knew that with time he could find her but he must be sure he thought of another thing if he is in prison in chains he might be stabbed with certain ease his heart exulted at the hot thought it was not hard to follow back on martins dallying footsteps he traced him to venice to trieste up the mountains as far as blomau there he lost him and shot very wide of the mark in fact the slowwitted young man went to vienna on a false rumourbut it boots not recount his wanderings six months after he left ancona ragged hatless unkempt hungry he came within sight of the strong towers of gratz and as he went limping by the town ditch he heard a clear high voice singing li dous consire quem don ainors soven and knew that he had run down his man one other crouching under the wall most intent watcher saw him stop as if hit clap his hand to his shockhead then listen brooding working his jaws from side to side the voice stayed gilles turned and slowly went his way back he limped under the gateway into the town and the croucher by the wall peered at him between the meshes of her dishevelled hair chapter xi the chapter called a latere the old man of musse lord of all the assassins descendant of ali fulness of light master of them that eat hemp and many things beside wedded jehane and made her his principal wife he valued in her apart from her bodily perfections her discretion obedience good sense and that extraordinary sort of pride which makes its possessor humble so inset it is too proud you may say to give pride a thought esteeming her at this price it is not remarkable if she came to be his only wife this was the manner of her life when her husband left her which was very early in the morning she generally slept for an hour then rose and went to the bath her boy was brought to her in the pavilion of the garden of fountains she spent two hours or more with him teaching him his prayers the honour of his father love and duty to his mother respect for the long purposes of god at ten oclock she broke her fast and afterwards her women sat with her at needlework and one would sing or one tell a good tale or leave being given they would gossip among themselves with a look ever at her for approval or what rarely happened disapproval there was not a soul among her slaves who did not love her nor one who did not fear her she talked no more than she had ever done but she judged no less many times a day the old man sent for her or sometimes came to her room to discuss his affairs he never found her out of humour dull perverse or otherwise than welldisposed to all his desires far from that every friday he gave thanks in the mosque for the gift of such an admirable wifegrave discreet pious amorous chaste obedient nimble complaisant and most beautiful as he hereby declared that he found her being a man of the greatest possible experience this was high praise nor had he been slow in making up his mind that she was to be trusted he was about to prove his deed as good as his opinion word was brought her on a day as she sat in the harem with her boy on her knee singing to herself and him some winding song of france that this redoubtable lord of hers was waiting to see her in her chamber she put the child down and followed the eunuch entering the room where the old man sat she knelt down as was customary and kissed his knee he touched her bent head rise up my child says he sit with me for a little i have matters of concernment for you she sat at once by his side he took her hand and began to talk to her in this manner it appears jehane that i am something of a prophet your late master the melek richard has fallen into the power of his enemies he is now a prisoner of the archdukes on many charges first the killing of your brother eudo count of saintpol but that is a very trifling affair which occurred moreover in fair battle next they accuse himfalsely as you knowof the death of montferrat we may have our own opinion about that but the prime matter as i guess is ransom and whether those who wish him ill not for what he has done to them but for what he has not allowed them to do to him will suffer him to be ransomed now what have you to say my child i see that it affects you jehane was affected but not as you might expect with great selfpossession she had a very practical mind there were neither tears nor heartbeatings neither panic nor flying of colours her eyes sought the old mans and remained steadily on them her lips were firm and red what are you willing to do sire she asked him sinan stroked his fine beard i can dispose of the business of montferrat in a few lines he said considering more i can reach the melek and assure him of comfort what i cannot do so easily though i admit no failure mind is to induce his enemies at home to allow of a ransom i can do that said jehane if you will do the rest the old man patted her cheek it is not the custom of my nation to allow wives abroad you moreover are not of that nation how can i trust the melek who i know loves you how can i trust you who i know love the melek oh sire says jehane looking him full in the face i came here because i loved my lord richard and when i have assured his safety i shall return here she looked down as she addedfor the same reason and for no other i quite understand you child said the old man and put his hand under her chin this made her blush and brought up her face again quickly dear sire she said shyly you are very kind to me if i had another reason for returning it would be that sinan kissed her and so it shall be my dear he assured her there is time enough you shall certainly go due regard being had to my dignity and your health which is delicate just now have no fear for me my lord she said i am very strong he kissed her again saying i have never known a woman at once so beautiful and so strong he wrote two letters sealing them with his own signet and that of king solomon to the archduke he said curtly to the archduke luitpold vetus de monte sends greeting if the melek richard be any way let in the matter of his life and renown i bid you take heed that as i served the marquess of montferrat so also i shall serve your serenity but the emperor demanded more civil advertisement he got a remarkably fine letter to the most exalted man henry by the grace of god emperor of the romans happy pious ever august the invincible conqueror vetus de monte by the same great chief of the assassins sends greeting with the kiss of peace let your celsitude make certain acquaintance with error in regard to the most illustrious person whom you have in hold not that melek richard caused the death of the marquess conrad but i the ancient the lord of assassins fulness of light for good cause namely to save my friend the same melek from injurious death at the hands of the marquess and him the said melek i am resolved at all hazards to defend by means of the silent smiters who serve me so farewell and may he protect your celsitude whom we diversely worship as with every business of the old mans preparations were soon and silently made in three or four days time jehane strained the young fulke to her bosom took affectionate humble leave of her master and left the green valley of lebanon on her embassy she was sent down to the coast in the manner becoming the estate of a sultans favourite wife she never set foot on the ground never even saw it she was in a closecurtained litter herself veiled to the eyes sitting with her was a vast old turkish woman whom in the harem they called the mother of flowers mules bore the litter eunuchs on mules surrounded it on all sides a third line of defence rode the janissaries hooded in white on white arabian horses so they came swiftly to tortosa whose lord in strict alliance with him of musse little knew that in paying homage to the shrouded cage he was capinhand to jehane of picardy long galleys took up the burden of the mountain roads dipped and furrowed across the aegean and touched land at salonika hence by relays of bearers jehane was carried darkly to marburg in styria where at last she saw the face of the sky they took her to the inn and unveiled her then the chief of the eunuchs handed her a paper which he had written himself being deprived of a tonguemadame fragrance of the harem gulzareen which is to say golden rose thus i am commanded by my dreadful master from this hour and place you are free to do what seems best to your wisdom the letters of our lord will be sent forward by the proper bearers of them one to gratz where the archduke watches the melek and one to the emperor of the romans wherever he may be found in gratz is he whom you seek this day six months i shall be here to attend your sufficiency he bowed three times and went away now mother said jehane to the old duenna do for me what i bid you and quickly get me brown juice for my skin and a ragged kirtle and bodice such as the egyptians wear give me money to line it and then let me go all this was done jehane put on vile raiment which barely covered her stained her fair face neck and arms brown and let her hair droop all about her then she went barefoot out hugging herself against the cold being three months gone with child and took the road over barren moorland to gratz she had not seen king richard for nearly two years at the thought of which thing and of him the hot blood leapt up to thrust and tingle in her face she did not mean to see him now if she could help it for she knew just how far she could withstand him she would save him and then go back thus she reasoned with herself as she trudged jehane ma mye thou art wife now to a wise old man who is good to thee and has exalted thee above all his women thou must have no lovers now only save him save him save him lord jesus lady mary she treated this as a prayer and kept it very near her lips all the way to gratz except when she felt herself flush all over with the thought school of god is so great a king to be prayed for as if he were a sick monk nevertheless she prayed more than she flushed nothing disturbed her she slept in woods in byres in stackyards bought what she needed for food attracted no attention and got no annoyance worthy the name at the closing in of the fifth day she saw the walls of the city rise above the black moors into the sky and the towers above them the dome of a church gilded caught the dying suns eye its towers were monstrous tall round and peaked with caps of green copper on the walls she counted seven other towers heavy squat flatroofed fortresses with huge battlements a great flag hung in folds motionless about a staff all was a uniform dun muffled in stormy sky lowering remote from knowledge and alien but jehane herself was of the north and not impressionable grey skies were familiar tents to her moorlands roomy places one heap of stones much like another but her heart beat high to know richard half a league away all her trouble was how she should find him in such a great town it was dusk when she reached it they were about to shut the gates she let them having seen that there were booths and hovels at the barriers even a little church it was there she spent the night huddled in a corner by the altar dawn is a laggard in styria she awoke before it was really light and crept out munching a crust the suburb was dead asleep a little breeze ruffled the poplars and blew wrinkles on the town ditch about and about the walls she went peering up at their ragged edge at the huge crumbling towers at the storks on steep roofs eh lord god here lies in torment my lovely king she cried to herself the keen breeze freshened the cloudwrack went racing westward it left the sky clean and bare out of the east came the red sun and struck fire upon the dome of saint stanislas out of a high window then came the sound of a man singing a sharp strong voice tremulous in the open notes she held her bosom as she heard al entrada del tems clar eya per joja recomencar eya vol la regina mostrar quel es si amoroza the sun kindled her lifted face filled her wet eyes with light and glistened on her praying lips after that her duty was clear as she conceived it she dared not attempt the tower that would reveal her to him but she could not leave it she must wait to learn the effect of her lords letter wait to see the bearer of it here she would wait where she could press the stones which bore up the stones pressed by richard so she did crouching on the earth by the wall sheltered against the wind or the wet by either side of a buttress getting her food sparingly from the booths at the gate or of charity the townsmen of gratz hoarsevoiced touzleheads mostly divined her to be an anchoress a saint or an unfortunate she was not of their country for her hair was burnt yellow like a lombards and her eyes green her face tanned and searching was like a hungarians they thought that she wove spells with her long hands on this account at first she was driven away on to the moors but she always returned to her place in the angle and counted that a day gained when she knew by richards strong singing that he yet lived his songs told her more than that they were all of love and if her name came not in her image did she knew by the mere pitch of his voicewho so wellwhen he was occupied with her and when not mostly he sang all the morning from the moment the sun struck his window thus she judged him a light sleeper from noon to four there was no sound surely then he slept he sang fitfully in the evening not so saliently more at night if there was a moon and generally he closed his eyes with a stave of li dous consire that song which he had made of and for her when she had been sitting there for upwards of a month and still no sign from the bearer of the letter she saw gilles de gurdun come halting up the poplar avenue and pry about the walls much as she herself had done she knew him at once for all his tatters this squarefaced lowbrowed norman how he came there if not as a slothound comes she could not guess but she knew perfectly well what he was about the bloodinstinct had led him inflexible man from far acre across the seas over the sharp mountains and enormous plains the bloodinstinct had brought him as truly as ever love led hermore truly indeed here he was with murder still in his heart watching him through the meshes of her hair elbowing her arms on her knees she thought what should she do plead nay dare she plead for so royal a head for so great a heart so great a king for one so nearly god that for a sacrifice she could have yielded up no more to very god this strife tore her to pieces while gurdun snuffled round the walls actually round the buttress where she crouched spying out the entries on one side she feared gilles on the other scorned what he could do there was the leper he made gilles terrible even her sacrifice on lebanon might not avail against such as he but king richard but this strong singer but this god of war gilles came round the walls for a second time nosing here and there stopping shaking his head limping on then she heard the kings voice singing high and sharp and spiring his glorious voice keener than any mans as pure as any boys singing with astounding gaiety al entrada del tems clar eya gilles stopped as one struck and gaped up at the tower to see his stupid mouth open jehanes bosom heaved with pride wellnigh insufferable had any woman since mary conceived such a lover as hers oh gilles gilles go you on with your knife in your vest what can you do little oaf against king richard gilles went in by the gate and she let him go he was away two days by which time she had cause to alter her mind the prisoner sang nothing and presently a man dressed like a bohemian came out of the town and spoke to her this was cogia the assassin bearer of the letter well cogia said jehane holding herself mistress the letter of our lord has been delivered i think it may go hard with the melek what cogia does the archduke dare the archduke mistress desires not the meleks death he is a worthy man but many do desire itkings of the west kinsmen of the marquess above all the meleks bloodbrother one of that princes men as i judge him is with him nowone of your country mistress in a vision she saw the leper again a dull smear in the sunny waste scratching himself on a white stone she saw him come hopping from rock to rock his wagging finger shapeless face tongueless voice mistress said cogia she turned blank eyes upon him i pray she said i pray has god no pity cogia shrugged what has god to do with pity the end of the world is in his hand already the melek is a king and the norman dung in his sight who knows the end but god and how shall he pity what he hath decreed for wisdom this i say if the king dies the man dies jehane threw up her head the king will not die cogia yet tomorrow if the man comes not out i will go to seek him early in the morning gilles did come out turned the angle of the ditch and shuffled towards her his head hung jehane moved swiftly out from the shadow of the buttress and confronted him she folded her arms over her breast and at that moment the shadow of richards tower was capped with the shadow of richard himself but she saw nothing of this halt there sir gilles she said the norman gave a squeal like a hog startled at his trough and went deadfire colour ha heart of jesus said gilles de gurdun chapter xii the chapter of strife in the dark one very great power of king richards had never served him better than now the power of immense quiescence whereunder he could sit by day or by night as inert as a stone a block hewn into shape of a man neither to be moved by outside fret nor by the workings of his own mind into this rapt state he fell when the prison doors shut on him and so remained for three or four weeks alone while the fates were spinning the archduke came daily to him with speeches injuries to relate injuries to impart king richard hardly winked an eyelid the archduke hinted at ransom and richard watched the wall behind his head he spoke of letters received from this great man or that which made ransom not to be thought of and richard went to sleep what are you to do with a man who meets your offers and threats with the same vast unconcern if it is matter for resentment richard gave it if it is a matter which money may leaven it is to be observed that while richard offered no money his enemies offered much these letters to the archduke were not of the sort which fill the austere folios of the codex diplomaticus as bins with bran or make rymers book as dry as ezekiels valley they were pungent pertinent allusive succinct supplementing as with meat those others the count of saintpol wrote for instance kinsman kill the killer of your kin and could hardly have expressed himself better under the circumstances king philip of france sent two letters one by a herald very long and chiefly in the language of the epistle of saint james designed for the codex the other lay in the vest of a savigniac monk and was to this effect in a ridded acre the husbandman can sow with hopes of good harvesting when the corn is garnered he calleth about him his friends and fellowlabourers and cheer abounds labour and pray i pray last came a limping pilgrim from aquitaine whose hat was covered with metal saints and in his left shoe a wad of parchment which had made him limp this proved to be a letter from john count of mortain which said now i see in secret but when i am come into my kingdom i will reward openly the archduke was by no means a wise man but it was not easy to know something of european politics and mistake the meaning of letters like these if it was a question of money here was money and imagine now the archduke bursting with the urgent secrets of so many princes making speeches about themthrough all of which king richard slumbered damn it he flouts me does he said austria at last and left him alone from that moment richard began to sing let us do no wrong to luitpold it was not merely a question of money but money turned the scale not only had richard mortally affronted his gaoler he had innumerably offended him the archduke was punctilious richard with his petulant foot stamped on every little point he laboured or else like a buttress let him labour them in vain he did not for a moment disguise his fatigue in luitpolds presence his relief at his absence or his unconcern with his properties this galled the man he could not for the life of him affect indifference to richards indifference when the messenger therefore arrived from the old man of musse the insolence of the message was most unfortunate the archduke angry as he was could afford to be cool he played on the old man the very part which richard had played on himthat is treated him and his letter as though they were not then he broke with richard altogether and then came gilles de gurdun with secret words and offers the archduke drained his beerhorn and with his big hand wrung his beard dry he winked hard at gilles whom he thought to be a hired assassin of deplorable address sent probably by count john are you angry enough to do what you propose he asked him i am not let me tell you i have been trying to kill him for four years said gilles and are you man enough my fellow gilles cast down his eyes i have not been man enough yet since he still lives i think i am now then there was a pause what is your price asked luitpold after this gilles said i have no price and the archduke you suit my humour exactly richard i say had begun to sing from the day he was sure that the archduke had given him up physical relief may have had something to do with that but moral certainty had more what made him fume or freeze was doubt there was very little room for doubt just now but that his enemies would prove too many for austrias scruples his friends he was not aware that he had any friends des barres gaston auvergne milo what did they amount to his sister joan his mother his brothers here he shrugged knowing his own race too well he had never heard of the angevin who helped any angevin but himself lastly jehane he had lost her by his own fault and her extreme nobility let her go glorious among women he was alone odd creature he began to sing singing like a genius to the broad splash of sunlight on brickwork gilles de gurdun found him richard was sitting on a bench against the wall one knee clasped in his hands his head thrown back his throat rippling with the tide of his music he looked as fresh and gallant a figure as ever in his life his beard trimmed sharply his strong hair brushed back his doublet green his trunks of fine leather his shoes of yet finer the song he was upon was li chastel d amors which runs las portas son de parlar al eissir e al entrar qui gen non sab razonar defors li ven a estar e las claus son de prejar ab cel obron li cortes and so on through many verses made continuous by the fact that the end of each sixth line forms the rhyme of the next five now gilles knew nothing of southern minstrelsy and if he had the pitch he was screwed to would have shrilled such knowledge out of him at defors li ven a estar he came in and sturdily forward richard saw him and put up his hand on went the hammered rhymes e las claus son de prejar ab cel obron li cortes here was a little break gilles very dark took a step up shot richards warning hand dedinz la clauson qui es son las mazos dels borges on went the exulting voice after the new rhymes gayer and yet more gay li chastel damors has twelve linked verses and king richard wound up in their music sang them all when at last he had stopped he said now gurdun what do you want here gilles came a step or two of his way and so again a step or two and so again by jerks when he was so near that it was to be seen what he had in his right hand the king got up gilles saw that he had light fetters on his ankles which could not stop his walking richard folded his arms oh gurdun he said what a fool you are gurdun vented a sob of rage and flung himself forward at his enemy he was a shorter man but very thickset with arms like steel he had a knife rage like a thirst he was free richard as he came on hit him full on the chin and sent him flying gurdun picked himself up again his mouth twitching his eyes so small as to be like slits knife in hand he leaned against the wall to fetch up his breath well said richard have you had enough yes you wolf said gurdun i shall wait till it is dark i think it may suit you better was the kings comment as he sat down on the bed gurdun squatted by the wall watching him after about an hour of humming airs to himself richard lay full length and in a short time gilles ascertained that he was asleep this brought tears into the mans eyes he began to cry freely virgin mary virgin mary why could he not kill this frozen devil of a king was there a race in the world which bred such men to sleep with the knife at the throat he rose to his feet went to look at the sleeper but he knew he could not do his work he ranged the room incessantly and at every second or third turn brought up short by the bed sometimes he flashed up his long knife it always stayed the length of his arm then flapped down to his flank in dejection if he wakes not i must go away i cannot do it so he told himself as finally he sat down by the wall it grew dusk he was tired sick giddy his head dropped he slept when he woke up as with a snort he did it was inky dark now was the time not even god could see him now he turned himself about inch by inch he crept forward edging along by the beds edge painfully he got on his knees threw up his head jehane my robbed lost soul he howled and stabbed with all his might king richard catlike behind him caught him by the hair and cuffed his ears till they sang ah dastard cur ah mongrel ah whitegalled norman eft gods feet if i pommel you for this pommel him he did and having drawn blood at his ears he turned him over his knee as if he had been a schoolboy and lathered his rump with a chairleg this humiliating punishment had humiliating effects gilles believed himself a boy in the cloisterschool again with his smock up mea culpa mea culpa hey reverend father have pity he began to roar dropping him at last richard tumbled him on to the bed blubber yourself to sleep clown he told him blessed ass i have heard you snoring these two hours snoring and rootling over your jackknife sleep man but if you rootle again i flog again mind you that gilles slept long and was awoken in full light by the sound of king richard calling for his breakfast the gaoler came palefaced in a thousand pardons sire a thousand pardons bring my food dietrich says richard and send the barber also the next time the archduke desires murder done let him find a fellow who knows his trade this one is a bungler heres the third time to my knowledge he has missed off with you gilles lay face downwards abject on the bed in came the kings breakfast a jug of wine some white bread the kings beard was trimmed his hair brushed fresh clothes put on he dismissed his attendants crossed over the room like a stalking cat and gave gilles a clap behind which made him leap in the air get up gurdun said richard tell me that you are ashamed of yourself and then listen to me gilles went down on one knee god knows my lord king he mumbled that i have done shamefully by you he got up his face clouded his jaw went square but not more shamefully by the same god than you have done by me the king looked at him i have never justified myself to any man he said quietly nor shall i now to you i take the consequences of all my deeds when and as they come but from the like of you none will ever come i speak of men now i will tell you this very plainly the next time you cross my path adversely i shall kill you you are a nuisance not because you desire my life but because you never get it try no more gurdun where is jehane my lord said gurdun very black i cannot tell you where the countess of anjou may be he was answered she is not here and is not in france i believe she is in palestine palestine palestine lord christ have you turned her away gilles cried beside himself again king richard looked at him but afterwards shrugged you speak after your kind now gurdun get you home go to my friends in normandy to my brother mortain to my brother of rouen bid them raise a ransom i must go back you have disturbed me sickened me of assassination reminded me of what i intended to forget if i get any more assassins i shall break prison and the archdukes head and i should be sorry to do that as i have no grudge against him find des barres gurdun raise all normandy find above all mercadet and set him to work in poictou as for england my brother geoffrey will see to it aquitaine i leave to the lord of bearn off now gurdun do as i bid you but if you speak another word to me of madame danjou by gods death i will wring your neck you are not fit to speak of me how should you dare speak of her you a stabithedark a blackentry cutter of throats a hedgerow knifer foh you had better speak nothing but be off stay i will call the castellan and so he did roaring through the keyhole the gaoler came up flying conduct this animal into the fresh air dietrich said king richard send him about his business tell your master he will now do better and when that is done let me go on to the leads that i may walk a little gurdun followed his guide speechless but the archduke was very vexed and declined to see him i decide to be a villain and he makes me a vain villain said the great man bid him go to the devil so then gilles with head hanging came out of the gate and jehane leaped from her angle to confront him to say that he dropped like a shot bird is to say wrong for a bird drops compact but gilles went down disjunct his jaw dropped his hands dropped his knees last his head ha heart of jesus he said and covered his eyes she began to talk like a hissing snake what have you done with the king what have you done king richard on the roof peered down and saw her he turned quite grey i could do nothing jehane gilles whimpered i went to kill him you fool i know it i saw you go i could have stayed you as i do now but i would not why not jehane she spurned him with a look because i love king richard and know you gilles what you can do and what not pshutt you are a rat rat says gilles i may be but a rat may be offended this king robbed me of you and slew my father and brothers therefore i hated him is it not enough reason her eyes grew cold with scorn your father your brothers she echoed him pooh i have given him more than that i have burned my heart quite dry i have accepted shame i have sold my body and counted as nothing my soul robbed you nay but i robbed myself and robbed him also when i cut him out of my own flesh from the day when through my prayers against blood he was affianced to the spanish woman i held him off me though i drained more blood to do it then that not sufficing to save him i gave myself to the old man of musse to be his wife one of his women do you understand his wife i say and you talk now of father and brothers and your robbery to me who am become an old mans toy one of many what are they to my soul and my hearts blood to my life and light and the glory that i had from richard oh you fool you fool what do you know of love you think it is embracing clipping playing with a chin you fool it is scorching your heart black it is welling blood by drops it is fasting in sight of food death where sweet life offers shame held more honourable than honour oh saint mary star of women what do men know of love dryeyed and pinched she looked about her as if to find an answer in the sullen moors if she had looked up to the heavy skies she might have had one for on the towers top stood king richard like a ghost listen now to me jehane said gilles red as fire i have hated your king for four years and three times sought his life but now he has beaten me altogether too strong too much king for a man to dare anything singly against him what he slept and i could not do it and then i slept and he awoke and let me lie then once again i woke and thought him still sleeping and stabbed the bed and he came behind me stealthy as a cat and trounced me over his knee like a child oh oh jehane he is more than man and i by so much less and now and now he sends me out to win his ransom as if i were an old lover of his and i am going to do it why god in glory look down upon us what is the force that he hath gilles now shivered and looked about him but jehane having mastered her breath smiled he is king she said come gilles i will go with you you shall find the abbot milo and i the queenmother i have the ear of her i will do as i am bid jehane said the cowed man because i needs must as they went away together king richard on the roof threw up his arms to the sky howling like a night wolf now god thou hast stricken me enough now listen thou i shall strike if i can after a while came cogia the assassin to whom jehane said cogia i must take a journey with this man you shall put us on the way and wait for me until i come again mistress replied cogia i am your slave do as you will she put on the dress of a religious gilles the weeds of a pilgrim from jerusalem then cogia bought them asses in gratz and led them down to trieste they found a ship going to bordeaux went on board had a fair passage passed the pillars of hercules on their tenth day out and were in the gironde in five more at bordeaux they separated gilles went to poictiers in a company of pilgrims jehane having learned that queen berengere was at cahors turned her face to the gascon hills but she had left behind her a prisoner to whom death could bring the only ransom worth a thought chapter xiii of the love of women ask me no more how i did in those days writes abbot milo mercy smile upon me in the article of death but i worked for the ransom of king richard as i hope i should for that of king christ many an abbey of touraine goes lean now because of me many a mass is wrought in a pewter chalice that richard might come home yet i soberly believe that madame alois king philips sister was precious above rubies in the work i think he is right that stricken lady in the habit of a grey nun of fontevrault came by night to paris and found her brother with john of mortain they had been upon the very business philip not all knave had been moved by the news of richards immobility he had had some of de gurduns report christdieu he said a great king calm in chains and my brother richard yet god knows i hate him so he went muttering on the count edged in his words as he could he hates you indeed sire he hates me he hates all of us i think we could find him reasons for that my friend if he lacked them said philip shrewdly do you know that de gurdun is in poictou come from styria count john said nothing but he did know it very well when they announced madame alois the king started and the count went sick white we will receive her grace said philip and advanced towards the door for the purpose in she came in her old eager stumbling secret way knelt in a hurry to kiss her brothers hand then rose and looked intently at john of mortain the king said you visit us late sister but your occasions may drive you they do drive me sire i have seen the sieur gilles de gurdun king richard is in hold at gratz and must be delivered by you sister by me sire you grow christian madame it is my need sire i have done king richard a great wrong this is not tolerable to me eh says philip not so fast was no wrong done to you wrong was done me said the white girl but not by him the wrong lies in his blood what though the wrongdoer is dead his blood must answer it alois shivered and so for that matter did one other there she answered i pray for his death dying or dead his blood shall answer it you speak darkly sister i live in the dark said alois king richard has affronted my house in you sister but she said i have affronted king richard through his house is this all you have to say alois no sire she told him with a fierce and biting look at mortain but it is all i need say now it was a cry broke strangling from the count ha jesus sire save my brother the wretch could bear no more the womans eyes were like swords king philip marvelled you he said you john put out his hands oh sire madame is in the right i am a wicked man i must make my brother amends he must be saved king philip scratched his head who is in the dark if not i i will deal with you presently mortain but you madame he turned hotly on the lady you must be plainer what is your zeal for the king of england he is your cousin and might have been your husband alois flinched but philip went roughly on do you owe him thanks that he is not is this what spurs you she looked doubtfully i owe him honour philip she said slowly he is a great king great king great king philip broke out pest and great rascal there is no truth in him no bottom no thanks no esteem he counts me as nothing to him said alois you are nothing madame said philip i am king of france your brother and lord he is my vassal owes fealty and breaks it signs treaties and levies war hectors me and laughs kills my servants and laughs he is my cousin but i am his suzerain i do not choose to be mocked there will be no rest for this kingdom while he is in it he stopped then turned to the shaking man as for you count of mortain i must have an explanation my sister loves her enemies it is a christian virtue i have not found it one of yours you perhaps fear your enemies even caged is this your thought you have made yourself snug in aquitaine count you are not unknown in anjou i think do you begin to wish that you might be are you by chance a little oversnug i candidly say that i prefer you for my neighbour in those parts i can deal with you do me the obedience to speak sire said the count spreading out his hands madame alois has turned me i am a sinner but i can restore my brother is my lord a clement prince pish said king philip and gave him his back madame go to bed he said to his sister i shall pay dear for it but i will not oppose my cousins ransom be content with that alois slipped out then he turned upon john like a flash of flame now mortain he said what proof is there of that old business of my sisters john showed him a scared eyethe milky eye of a drowned man ah god sire there is none at allnonenone he had no breath philip raised his voice look to yourself i shall not help you leave my lands go where you will hide bury your head drown yourself if i spoke what lies bottomed in my heart i should kill you with mere words but there is worse for you in store there will be war in france if i know richard but mark what i say after that there shall be war in england the thought of richard overwhelmed him he gave a queer little sigh see now how much love and what lives of women are spent for one tall man who gives nothing and asks nothing but waits looking lordly while they give and give and give let richard come since women cry for wounds but you he flamed again get you to hell you are all a liar avoid me lest i learn more of you dear sire john began philip loathed him ah get you gone snake or i tread upon you he said and the prince avoided so much was wrought by alois of france no visitation of a dead woman could have shocked queen berengere more suddenly than the apparition of a tall nun when she saw it was jehane she put her hand upon her heart ah she said you trouble me again jehane am i never to rest from you jehane did not falter do i have any rest the king is chained in styria he must be redeemed it is your turn i saved his life for you once by selling my own now i am the wife of an old man with nothing more to sell do you sell something sell sell what can i sell that he will buy whined berengere he loves me not well said jehane what has that to do with it do you not love him i am his miserable wife i have nothing to sell sell your pride berengere says jehane berengere bit her lip you speak strangely to me woman says jehane i am grown strange once i was a girl dishonoured because i loved now i am a wife greatly honoured because i do not love you do not love your husband how should i said jehane when i love yours but i honour my husband and watch over his honour he is good to me you dare to tell me that you love the king ah you have been with him again jehane looked critically at her i have not seen him nor ever shall till he is dead but we must save him you and i berengere berengere the little toy woman when she saw how noble the other stood and how inflexible came wheedling to her with hands to touch her chin jehane sister let it be my part to save richard indeed i love him you have done so much to you now he should be nothing let me do it let me do it please jehane so she stroked and coaxed the tall nun smiled must i always be giving and my well never be dry yes yes i will trust you no you shall not kiss me yet i have not done go to the queenmother go to the king your brother go not to the french king nor to count john he is more cruel than hyaenas and more a coward find the abbot milo find the lord of bearn find the sieur des barres find mercadet raise england sell your jewels your crown eh god of gods sell your pretty self the queenmother is a fierce woman but she will help you do these things faithfully and i leave king richards life in your hands may i trust you the other girl looked up at her wistfully still touching her chin kiss me jehane yes yes i will kiss you now frozen heart you are thawed jehane going back to bordeaux found cogia with a ship wherein she sailed for tortosa but berengere queen of england played a queens part chapter xiv how the leopard was loosed the burning thought of jehane cut off sixty feet below him yet far as she could ever be swept across richards mind like a roaring wind and ridded the room for wilder guests in came stalking mighthavebeen and nomore holding each by a shrinking shoulder the delicate maid of his first delight jehane lissom in a thin gown jehane like a bud with her long hair alight her hair was loose her face aflame she was very young very much to be kissed fresh and talloh god the mere loveliness of her in came the scent of wet stubbles the fresh salt air of normandy the pale gold of the shaws the pale sky the mild october sun he felt again the stoop again the lift of her to his horse again the stern ride together saw again the dark tower and all the love and sweet pleasure that they made the bride in the church turning her proud shy head the bride in his arm clinging as they flew the bride in the tower the crowned countess the nestling mateoh impossibly lost inconceivably put away eternally his lover and bride pity if you can this lonely heart this king in chains this hot angevin son of henry son of geoffrey son of fulke this yeaandnay he who dared not look upon the city lest seeing he should risk all to take it had now looked upon the bride unaware and could not touch her the fragrance of her the sacred air in which a loved woman moves had floated up to him his by all the laws of hell in spite of heaven but his no more such nearness and such deprivationto see to desire and not to seizeflung his wits abroad from that hour his was a lost soul hungry emptyeyed ranging feverish he lashed up and down his prisonroom with bare teeth gleaming and desperate soft strides no thought he had but mere despair no hope but the mere ravin of a beast he was across the room in four he turned he lunged back at the wall he threw up his head turned and lunged turned and lunged again he was always at it or rocking on his bed no hope nor thought nor reckoning had he but to say yea against god who said him nay so many times had he stood fatal enemy of himself his yea would hold fast while none accepted it his nay while no one obeyed but the supple knees of men sickened him of his own decree these fools accept my bidding the bidding then is foolishness so when fate so when god underwrote his bill le roy le veult he scorned himself and the bill and risked wide heaven to make either nought if austria had murdered him then it had perhaps been well but his enemies being silenced his friends did enemies work unknowing by giving him scope to mar himself the ransom was raised at the price of blood and prayers the ransom was paid the earl of leicester and bishop of salisbury brought it so the leopard was loosed with a quick shake of the head as if doing violence to himself he turned his face westward and pushed through the low countries to the sea there he was met by his english peers by longchamp by his brother of rouen by men who loved and men who feared but he had no word for any grim and hungry he stalked through the lane they made him on to the galley folded in his cloak there lonely he paced the bridge he was rowed to the west with his eyes fixed always on the east away from his kingdom to where he supposed his longing to be his mother met him at dunwich it seemed he knew her not my son my son richard she said as she knelt to him get up madame he bid her i have work to do he rode savagely to london through the grey essex flats had himself crowned anew went north with a force to lay lincolnshire waste levelled castles exacted relentless punishment exorbitant tribute the last acquittance he set a red smudge over the middle of england being altogether in that country three months a total to his name and reign of a poor six then he left it for good and all carrying away with him grudging men and grudged money and leaving behind the memory of a stone face which always looked east a sword a heart aloof the myth of a giant knight who spoke no english and did no charity but was without fear cruelly just and as cold as an outland grave if you ask an englishman what he thinks of richard yeaandnay he will tell youthat was a king without pity or fear or love considering neither god nor the enemy of god nor unhappy men if the fear of god is the beginning of wisdom the love of him is the end of it how could king richard love god who did not fear enough or we who feared too much he crossed into normandy and at honfleur was met by them who loved him well but he repaid them ill here also they seemed remote from his acquaintance gaston of bearn with eyes alight came dancing down the quay to be the first to kiss him richard shaking with fever or what was like fever gave him a burning dry hand but looked away from him always hungrily to the east des barres who had thrown off allegiance for his love got no thanks for it he may have known abbot milo again or mercadet his lean good captain he said nothing to either of them his friends were confounded here was the gallant shell of king richard with a new insatiable tenant so indeed they found it there was great business to be done war the holding of assise the redressing of wrongs from the sea to the pyrenees he did it but in a terrible hasty way it appeared that every formal act required fretted him to waste that every violent act allowed gave him little solace it appeared that he was living desperately fast straining to fill up time rather than use it towards some unknown but to him certain end his first act in normandy after new coronation was to besiege the border castles which the french had filched in his absence one of these was gisors he would not go near gisors but conducted the leaguer from rouen as a blindfold man plays chess and from rouen he reduced the great castle in six weeks one thing more he did there which gave gaston a clue to his mood he sent a present of money a great sum to an old priest curate of saintsulpice and when they told him that the man was dead and a great part of the church he had served burnt out by king philip his face grew bleak and withered and he said then i will burn philip out he had gisors castle churches burgherholds the whole town burned level with the ground there was not to be a stone on a stone and it was so gaston of bearn slapped his thigh when he heard of this now he said now at last i know what ails my king he has seen his lost mistress he did so ruthlessly in normandy that he went far to make his power a standing dread to the fair duchy on the rock at les andelys he built a huge castle to hang there like a thundercloud scowling over the flats of the seine he called it what his temper gave no hint of so dry with fever he was the galliard hold let me see chastelgaillard stand ready in a year he said put on every living man in normandy if need be he planned it all himself rock of the rock it was to be making the sheer yet more sheer he called it again his daughter daughter of his conception of death build said he my daughter gaillarda as i have conceived her let the great birth be and it was so for a bitter christening when all was done he had his french prisoners thrown down into the fosse and they say that it rained blood upon him and his artificers as they stood by that accursed font the man was mad nothing stayed him for the first time since they who still loved him had had him back they heard him laugh when his daughter gaillarda was brought forth and spine of god he cried this is a saucy child of mine and saucily shall she do by the french power then his face was wrenched by pain as with a sob he said i had a son fulke gaillarda did saucily enough to tyrannise over ten years of philips life in the end as all know she played the strumpet and served the enemies of her fathers house but not while richard lived to rule her he drove philip into a truce of years pushed down into touraine and thence went to anjou but not to sit still he was never still never seemed to sleep or get any of the solace of a man he ate voraciously but was not nourished drank long but was never drunken revelled without mirth hunted fought but got no joy he utterly refused to see the queen who was at cahors in the south she is no wife of mine he said let her go home tentative messages were brought by very tentative messengers from his brother john good service such and such had been done in languedoc so and so had been hanged or gibbeted so and so rewarded what had our dear and royal brother to say to each he said the same thing let my good brother come but john never came no one knew what to make of him he spoke to none of his affairs none dared speak to him milo writes in his book the king came back from styria as one who should arise from the grave with all the secrets of the chattering ghosts to brood upon some worm gnawed his vitals some maggot had drilled a hole in his brain i know not what possessed him or what could possess him beside a devil this i know he never sent to me for direction in spiritual affairs nor so far as i could learn to any other religious man he never took the sacrament nor seemed to want it but be sure he wanted it most grievously so insanely ridden he lived for three years one of which would have worn a common man to the bones but the fire still crackled freely fed his eyes were burning bright his mind when he gave it was keen his head when he lent it seemed cool what was he living for did death himself look askance at such a man or find him a good customer who sent him so many souls two things only were clear he sent messenger after messenger to rome and he returned his wifes dowry those must mean divorce or repudiation of marriage certainly the queens party took it so though the queen herself clung pitifully to her throne and the queens party grew the larger for the belief such as it was the queens party nested in aquitaine and the limousin with all the turbulent lords of that duchy under its flag prince john himself was with berengere at cahors biting his nails as was usual with him one eye watching for richards vengeance one eye wide for any peaceoffering from the french king he dared not act overtly against richard nor dared to take up arms for him so he waited the end was not very far off count eustace of saintpol was the moving spirit in these parts grown to be an astute unscrupulous man of near thirty years his spies kept him well informed of richards intolerable state he knew of the embassies to rome of the fierce murdering moods of the black moods of the cheerless revelry and fruitless energy of this great stricken angevin in some such hagridden day my enemy may be led to overtax himself he considered to that end he laid a trap he seized and fortified two hillcastles in the limousin between which lay straggling a village called chaluz let us get richard down here was his plan he will think the job a light one and we shall nip him in the hills the bishop of beauvais lent a hand so did adhemar viscount of limoges and achard the lord of chaluz not because he desired but because he was forced by limoges his suzerain another forced labourer was sir gilles de gurdun who had been found by saintpol doing work in poictou and won over after a few trials now when king richard had been some four nearly five years at home neither nearer to his rest nor fitter for it than he had been when he landed he got word from the south that a great treasure had been found in the limousin a man driving the plough on a hillside by chaluz had upturned a gold table at which sat an emperor charles or another with his wife and children and the lords of his council all wrought in fine gold i will have that golden emperor said richard having just made one out of clay let him be sent to me he spoke carelessly as they all thought simply to get in his gibe at the new emperor of the romans his nephew whom he had caused to be chosen and seeing that that was not the treasure he craved it is like enough but somebody took his word into languedoc and somebody brought back word saintpols word that the viscount of limoges as suzerain of chaluz claimed treasuretrove in it then i will have the viscount of limoges as well said richard let him be sent to me and the table with him the viscount did not go we have him eh we have him cheered saintpol rubbing his hands together but the viscount be not so very sure he may send gaston or mercadet or if the fit is on him he may come in force we cannot support that i believe that you have played a fools part saintpol i am playing a gentlemans part replied the other to entrap a villain your villain is six foot two inches and hath arms to agree said the viscount a dry man we will lay him by the heels viscount we will lop those long arms coldblooded desperate tyrant he has brought two lovely ladies to misery now let him know misery thus saintpol feeling very sure of himself the queen was at cahors all this time living in a convent of white nuns probably happier than she had ever been in her life before count john kept her informed of all richards offences saintpol you may take my word for it was so exuberantly on her side that it must be almost an offence in her to refuse him but she in a pure mood of abnegation would hear nothing against king richard even when she was told with proof positive that he was in treaty with rome she said not a word to her friends secretly she hugged herself beginning like most women to find pleasure in pain let him deny me let him deny me thrice even as thou wert denied sweet lord jesus she prayed to christ on the wall so denied thou didst not cease from loving i think the woman in thee outcried the man she got a piercing bliss out of each new knife stuck in her little jumping heart once or twice she wrote to alois of france who was at fontevrault in her kings country dear lady she wrote they seek to enrage my lord against me if you see him tell him that i believe nothing that i hear until i receive the word from his own glorious mouth alois chilly in her cell took no steps to get speech with king richard let her suffer i suffer she would say and then curiously jealous lest more pain should be berengeres than was hers a daughters of france she made haste to send assuring messages to cahors still berengere sweetly agonised saintpol sent her letters full of love and duty enthusiastic breathing full arms against her wrongs but she always replied count of saintpol you do me injury in seeking to redress your own i admit nothing against my lord the king many hate him but i love him my will is to be meek meekness would become you very well also saintpol could not think so lastly came the intelligence that king richard in person was moving south with a great force to win the treasure of chaluz the news was true not only did he dwell with the nervous persistency of the afflicted upon the wretched gold caesar but with clearer political vision saw a chance of subduing all aquitaine any stick will do even adhemar of limoges he said not suspecting saintpols finger in the dish and told mercadet to summon the knights and the knights their array before he set out he sent two messengers moreone to rome and one much further east then he began his warlike preparations with great heart chapter xv oeconomic reflections of the old man of musse jehane called gulzareen the golden rose had borne three children to the old man of musse she was suckling the third and teaching her eldest the young fulke of anjou his creed or as much of it as she could remember when there came up a herald from tortosa who bore upon his tabard the three leopards of england he delivered a sealed letter thus superscribed la treshaulte et ma tres chere dame madame jehane comtesse danjou de la part le roy richard hastez tousjours the letter was brought to the old man as he sat in his white hail among his mutes fulness of light said the vizier after prostrations here is come a letter from the melek richard sealed for her highness the golden rose give it to me vizier said the old man and broke the seal and read madame most dear lady in a very little while i shall be free from my desperate nets and then you shall be freed from yours keep a great heart after five years of endeavour at last i come quicklyrichard of anjou the old man sat stroking his fine beard for some time after he had dismissed his vizier looking straight before him down the length of his hail no sound broke the immense quiet under which he accomplished his meditations of life and death the assassins dreaming by the walls breathed freely through their noses as a small voice heard from far off in these dreams of theirs the voice of one calling from a distant height came his words cogia ibn hassan ibn alnouk come and hearken a slim young man rose ran forward and fell upon his face before the throne once more the faint far cry came floating bohadin son of falmy of balsora come and hearken and another whiterobed youth followed cogia my sons said the old man the word is upon you go to the west for forty days in the country of the franks in the south parts thereof but north of the great mountains you shall find the melek richard admirable man whom allah longs for strike my sons but from afar for not otherwise shall ye dare him and gain the gates of paradise and the softbosomed women of your dreams go quickly prepare yourselves the two young men crawled to kiss his foot then they went out and silence folded the hail of audience once more like a wrapping later in the day a slavegirl told jehane that her master was waiting for her the baby was asleep in the cradle under a muslin veil she kissed fulke a fine tall boy six and a half years old and followed the messenger the old man embraced her very affectionately kissed her forehead and raised her from her knees come and sit with me beautiful and pious wife mother of my sons said he i have many things to say to you when they were close together on the cushions of the window sinan put his arm round her waist and said for a good and happy marriage my gulzareen it is well that the woman should not love her husband too much but rather be meek show obedience to his desires and alacrity and give courtesy the man must love her and honour that in her which makes her worth her beauty to wit the bounty of her fruitfulness and her discretion but for her it is enough that she suffer herself to be loved and give him her duty in return the love that seeds in her she shall bestow upon her children that is how peace of mind grows in the world and happiness for without the first there can never be the second you my child have a peaceful mind is it not so my lord jehane replied with no sign of the old discontent upon her red mouth i am at peace for i have your affection you tell me that i deserve it and i give my children love and you are happy jehane she sighed ever so lightly i should be happy my lord but sometimes even now i think of king richard and pray for him i believe that you do said the old man and because i desire your happiness in all things i desire you to see him again a bright blush flooded jehane whose breath also became a trouble by a quick movement she drew her veil about her lest he should see her unquiet breast so the mother of proserpine might have been startled into new maidenhood when in her wanderings some herd had claimed her in love her husband watched her keenly not unkindly jehanes trouble increased he left her alone to fight it so at last she did then touched his hand looking deeply into his face he loving her greatly held her close well joy of my joy lord she said speaking hurriedly and low let me not see him ask it not of me it is more than i dare it is more than would be right i ask it for his sake not for mine for he has a great heart the greatest heart that ever man had in the world also he is sudden to change as i know very well and the sight of me denied him might move him to a desperate act as once before it did she lowered her head lest he should see all she had to show he smiled gravely stroking her hand and playing with it up and down no child no he said it will do you no harm now the harm i take it has been done soon it will be ended you shall hear from his own lips that he will not hurt you jehane looked at him in wonder startled out of confusion of face do you know more of him than i do sire she asked with a quick heart i believe that i do replied the old man and take my word for it dear child that i wish him no ill i wish him he continued very deliberately less ill than he has sought to do himself i wish him most heartily well and you my girl whom i have grown wisely and tenderly to love you my golden rose moon of the caliph my stem my vine my holy vase my garden of endless delightfor you i wish above all things rest after labour refreshment and peace well i believe that i shall gain them for you go therefore since i bid you and take with you your son fulke that his father may see and bless him and if he think fit provide for him after the custom of his own country and when you have learned as learn you will from his mouth what i am sure he will tell you come back to me my pleasant joy and rest upon my heart jehane sighed and wrought with her fingers in her lap if it must be sire why of course it must be said the old man briskly he sent her away to the harem with a kiss on her mouth and had in cogia and bohadin son of falmy of balsora to these two rapt assassins he gave careful instructions which there was no mistaking the golden rose properly attended would accompany them as far as marseilles she would journey on to pampluna and abide in the court of the king of navarre who loved arabians as his father before him until such time as word was brought her by one of them the survivor that they had found king richard and that he would see her then she would set out attended by the vizier the chief of the eunuchs and the mother of flowers and act as she saw proper very soon after this the galley left the marble quay of tortosa upon a prosperous voyage through blue water jehane her son fulke of anjou and the other persons named were in a great green pavilion on the poop but she saw nothing and knew nothing of cogia ibn hassan ibn alnouk or of bohadin son of falmy of balsora chapter xvi the chapter called chaluz when king richard said without any confirmatory oath that he should hang adhemar of limoges and the count of saintpol all who heard him believed it the abbot milo believed it for one figuratively you can see his hands up as you read him to hang two knights of such eminent degree and parts he writes were surely a great scandal in any christian king not that the punishment were undeserved or the executioner insufficient god knoweth but very often true policy points out the wisdom of the mean and this is its deliberative that to hang a bad man when another vengeance is opensuch as burning in his castle killing on his walls or stabbing by apparent mistake for a common personto hang him i say suggests to the yet unhanged a way of treating his betters there are more ways of killing a dog than choking him with butter and so it is with lords and other rebels against kings in this particular case king richard only thought to follow his great father whom at this time he much resembled what in the end he did was very different from any act of that monarchs that i ever heard tell of to remember which makes me weep tears of blood but so he fully purposed at that time being in his hottest temper of yea he said yea to the hanging of saintpol and limoges and made ready a host which must infallibly crush chaluz were it twenty times prepared but he said nay to the sacrifice of jehane on lebanon and to that end increased his arms to overawe all the kingdoms of the south which had sanctioned it vanguard battle and rear he mustered fifteen thousand men des barres led the van english bowmen norman knights battle was his all arms from anjou poictou and touraine rearguard the earl of leicester took his viceroy in aquitaine when the garrison of chaluz saw the forested spears on the northern heights the great engines piled against the skyline the train of followers pennons of the knights dragon of england leopards of anjou the single lion of normandy the wise among them were for instant surrender here is an empery come out against us cried adhemar if i was not right when i told you that i knew king richard the filched empery of a thief said saintpol honesty is ours i fight for my lady berengere the glory of two realms my sovereign mistress till i die vastly well returned the other but i do not fight for this lady but for a gold table with gold dolls sitting at it such also was the reflection of achard castellan of chaluz looking ruefully at his crazy walls two grassy hills rise like breasts out of a rolling plain of grass each is crowned with a tower between them are the church and village of chaluz which form a straggling street wall and ditch pen in these buildings and tie tower to tower as richard saw it was the easiest thing in the world to cut the line in the middle isolate then reduce the towers at leisure adhemar saw that too and got no comfort from it until it occurred to him that if he occupied one tower and left the other to saintpol he would be free to act at his own discretion that is not act at all against the massed power of england and anjou saintpol you see fought for the life of richard and adhemar for a gold table which makes a great difference he effected this separation of garrisons however some show of resistance was made by manning the walls and daring the day with banners king richard went softly to work as he always ways did when actually hand in hand with war warfare was an art to him neither a sport nor a counterirritant he was never impetuous over it for a week he satisfied himself with a close investiture of the town on all sides no supplies could get in nor fugitives out then when everything was according to his liking he advanced his engines brought forward his towers set sappers to work and delivered assault in due form and at the weakest point he succeeded exquisitely there was no real defence the two hilltowers were stranded chaluz was his he put the garrison to the sword and set the village on fire at once viscount adhemar and his men surrendered richard took the treasureit was found that the golden caeesar had no headand kept his word with the finders hanging the viscount and castellan on one gibbet within sight of the other tower oh frozen villain swore saintpol between his teeth so shalt thou never hang me but when he looked about him at his dozen of thinfaced men he believed that if richard was not to hang him it might be necessary for him to hang himself more it came into his mind that there was a hand or two under him which might be anxious to save him the trouble being however a man of abundant spirit he laughed at the summons to surrender so long as there was a horse to eat man to shoot or arrow for the shooting as for fire he believed himself impregnable by that arm and any day succour might come from the south surely his queen would not throw him to the dogs where was count john if not hastening to win a realm where king philip if not hopeful to chastise a vassal daily king richard in no hurry but desperately reckless rode close to the tower and met the hardy eyes of saintpol watching him from the top richard was a galliard fighter as he had always been come down saintpol he would say and dance with limoges when i come down sire the answer would be there will be no dancing in your host richard took his time and also intolerable liberties with his life milo lost his hair with anxiety not daring to speak gaston of bearn did dare but was shaken off by his mad master des barres who loved him perhaps as well as any never left him for long together and wore his brain out devising shifts which might keep him away from the walls but richard for this present whim of his chose out a companion devil as heedless as himself mercadet namely his brown gascon captain of like proportions like mettle like foolhardiness and with him made the daily round never omitting an exchange of grim banter with saintpol it was terrible to see him without helm on his head or reason in it canter within range of the bow oh saintpol he said one day if thou wert worth my pains i would have thee down and serve thee as i did thy brother eudo but no thou must be hanged it seems and saintpol grinning cheerfully answered have no fear king thou wilt never hang me by my soul said richard back again a little more of this bold gut of thine my man and i let thee go free sire said saintpol soberly that were the worst of all how so boy because if you forgave me i should be required by my knighthood to forgive you and that i will never do if i can help it so i should live and be damned have it then as it must be said richard laughing and turned his back saintpol could have shot him dead but would not look de gurdun he says there goes the king unmailed wilt thou shoot him in the back and so end all by god eustace says gilles that i will not why not then gurdun said because i dare not i am more afraid of him when he scorns me thus than when his face is upon me let him lead an assault upon the walls and i will split his headpiece if i may but i will never again try him unarmed pouf said saintpol but he was of the same mind then came a day when des barres was out upon the neighbouring hills with a company of knights scouting there had been rumours of hostile movement from the south from provence and roussillon of a juncture of prince john known to be in gascony with the queens brother of navarre nothing was known certainly but richard judged that john might be tempted out it was a bright cold day cloudless with a most bitter northeast wind singing in the bents des barres sitting his horse on the hill blew upon his ungauntleted hand then flacked it against his side to drive the blood back surveying the field with a hunters eye he saw king richard ride out of the lines on his chestnut horse mercadet with him and in a green cloak gaston of bearn richard had a red surcoat and a blown red plume in his cap he carried no shield and by the ease with which he turned his body to look behind him one hand on the crupper des barres was sure that he was not in mail folly of a fool he snorted to his neighbour savaric de dreux there pricks our lord the king as if to a party of hawks wait said savaric where away now to bandy gibes with saintpol pardieu where else should he go at this hour saintpol will never do him a villainy said savaric no no but de gurdun is there wait now says savaric again look look who comes out of the smoke they could see the beleaguered tower perfectly brown and warmlooking in the sun below it still smoking the village of chaluz a heap of charred brickwork they saw a man in clean white come creeping out of the smoke stooping at a run he hid wherever he could behind the broken wall but always ran nearer stooped and ran with bent body over his bent knees he worked his way thus gradually nearer and nearer to the tower and des barres watched him anxiously some campthief making off look look cried savaric the white man had come out by the tower was now kneeling in the open at the same moment a man slipped down a rope from the towertop before he had touched earth they saw the kneeling man pull a bowstring to his ear and let fly next the fellow on the rope touching ground ran fleetly forward and springing on the whiterobed man drove him to the earth they saw the flash of a blade that is strange warfare said des barres greatly interested there is warfare in heaven also said savaric see those two eagles two great birds were battling in the cold blue feathers fell idly like black snowflakes then one of the eagles heeled over and down he came but when they looked towards the tower again they saw a great commotion men running horses huddled together one in red held up by one in green then a riderless chestnut horse looked about him and neighed des barres gave a short cry o god they have shot king richard between them come savaric we must go down stop again said that other let us sweep up those assassins as we go there i see another thief in white des barres saw him too spur spur he called to his knights follow me he got his line in motion they all galloped across the sunny slopes like a light cloud but as they drove forward the play was in progress they saw it done as it were in a scene one white figure lay heaped upon the ground another was running by the wall towards him furtively and bent as the first had come the third actor he of the tower had not heard the runner but was still stooped over the man he had evidently killed groping probably for marks or papers upon him spur spur cried des barres and the line went rattling down they were not in time the white runner was too quick for the killer of his mate he did indeed look round but the other was upon him before he could rise there was a short tussle the two rolled over and over then the whiteclad man got up raised his fallen comrade shouldered him and sped away into the smoke of chaluz when des barres and his friends were within bowshot of the tower one man only was below it and he lay where he had been stabbed the whiterobed murderers the living and the dead were lost in smoke the king and his party were gone out of the tower came saintpol with his men unarmed bareheaded and waited silently in rank for des barres this one came up at a gallop my prisoner count of saintpol he called out as he came then halted his line by throwing up his hand the king has been shot sir guilhem saintpol said gravely not by me i am the kings prisoner take me to him lest he die before i see his eyes who is that dead man of yours over there asked des barres his name is sieur gilles de gurdun a knight of normandy and enemy of the kings but dead if dead he be on the kings account he killed the assassin i know that very well says des barres for i saw the deed which was a good one i must hunt for those whitegowns who might they be i know nothing of them they are no men of mine their robes were all white their faces all dark and they ran like turks but what can turks do here they must be found said des barres and sent out savaric with half of his men they picked up gilles quite dead of two wounds one in the back of the neck another below the heart des barres put him over his saddlebow then took his prisoners into camp king richard had been carried to his pavilion and put to bed his physicians were with him and the abbot milo quite unmanned gaston of bearn was crying like a girl at the door the earl of leicester had ridden off for the queen yvo tibetot for the count of mortain des barres learned that they had pulled out the arrow a common one of genoese make but feared poison king richard had been shot in the right lung chapter xvii the keening in the wan hours left to him came three women one after another and spoke the truth so far as they knew it each the first was alois of france in the habit of a grey lady of fontevrault with a face more dead than her cowl and hair like wet weed but in her hollow eyes the fire of her mystery who said to the watchers by the door let me in i am the voice of old sorrow so they held back the curtains of the tent and she came shuffling forward to the long body on the bed at the sound of her skirts the king turned his altered face her way then rolled his head back to the dark take her away he said in a whisper so des barres stood up between him and the woman but alois put her hands out as a blind man does souls health des barres i purge old sins avoid all of you she said and leave me with him save only his confessor what i have to say must be said in secret as it was done secretly richard sighed let her stay and let milo stay he said the rest went out on tiptoe alois came and knelt at the head of the bed listen now richard said she for thy last hour is near and mine also twice over i have sought to tell thee but was denied each time i might have done thee a service now i will do thee good service thou art not guilty of thy fathers death nor he of my despair the king did not turn his head but looked up sideways so that she saw his eye shining his lips moved then stuck together so milo put a sponge with wine upon them then he whispered tell me alois who was guilty with thee she said thy brother john of mortain was that man a villain is he a moaning sigh escaped the king longdrawn shuddering very piteous eh alois alois which of us four was not a villain said alois what is past is past and i have told thee what is to come i cannot tell thee for the past swallows me up yet i say again thy brother john is a sick villain a secret villain and a thief god help him god judge him said richard with another sigh i can do neither nor will not he moaned again but so hopelessly as being so weary and fordone that abbot milo began to blubber out loud alois lifted up her drawn face and struck her breast ah would to god richard she cried would to god i had come to thee clean i had saved thee then from this most bitter death for if i love thee now judge how i had loved thee then he said with shut eyes none could love me long since none could trust me and not i myself then he said fretfully to the abbot take her away milo i am tired alois kneeling kissed his dry forehead farewell she said king richard most a king when most in bonds and most merciful when most in need of mercy my work is done remains to pray and prepare she went out noiselessly as she had come in and no man of them saw her again next came queen berengere about the time of sunset she came stiffly as if holding herself in a trap with much formal bowing to death quite white like ivory in a black robe in her hands a great crucifix at the door she paused for a minute the earl of leicester being with her grief is quick in me leicester she said then to the ushers of the door does he live will he know me does he wake does he not cry for me now madame the king sleeps they told her i go to pray for him said the queen and went in stiffly she knelt at his bedhead and with both hands held up the crucifix to her face she began to talk to it in a low worn voice as though she were asking the christ to reckon her misery thou christ she complained thou christ look upon me the daughter of a king crucified terribly with thee this dying man is the king my husband who denied me as thou christ wert denied who sought to put me by and yet is loved yet i love him christ yet i have worked for him against my honour holding it as cheap as he did when he was in prison i humbled myself to set him loose when he was loosed i held his enemies back while he cruelly held me back i have prayed for him and pray now while he lies there struck secretly and dies not knowing me and leaves me alone careless whether i live or die ah saviour of the world do i suffer or not she awoke the sick man who opened his eyes and stared about him he signed to milo to draw nigh which the snuffling old man did who is here he whispered not no no dearest lord said milo quickly but the queen is here ah said he poor wretch and he sighed then he said turn me over milo it was done with a flux of blood to the mouth they stayed that and brought him round with aqua vitae the queen was terribly moved to see his ravaged face no doubt she loved him but she had nothing to say for some time their eyes were fixed each on the other the queens misty the kings feverbright terribly searching terribly intelligent he read her soul madame he said but she could scarcely hear him i have done you great wrong yet greater wrong elsewhere i cannot die in comfort without your pardon but i cannot ask it of you for if i still had years to live i should do as i have done a sob of injury shook the queen richard richard richard she wailed i suffer you have my heart you have always had it and what have i nothing o god nothing at all madame said he the wrong i did you was that i gave you the right to anything that was the first and greatest wrong to give it you i thieved and in taking it again i thieved again god knoweth he shut his eyes and kept them shut she called to him more urgently richard richard but he made no answer and appeared to sleep the queen shivered and sniffed turned to her christ and so spent the night the last to come was jehane in a white gown and she came with the dawn eager and flushed she was with dawncolour in her face and stepped lightly over the dewy grass her lips parted and hair blown back she came in exalted with grief so that no wardens of the door nor queens nor college of queens could have stayed her she was as tall as any there and went past the guard at the door without question or word said and so lightly and fiercely to the bed there she stood dilating and glowing looking not back on her spent life but on to the glory of the dying the queen knew that she was there but went on with her prayers or seemed to go on jehane knelt suddenly put her arms out over richard stooped and kissed his cheek then she looked up desperately triumphing for any one to question her right none did berengere prayed incessantly and jehane panted the words broke from her at last dost thou question my right berengere she said fiercely to kiss a dead man to love the dead and speak greatly of the dead which of us three women thinkest thou knoweth best what report to make concerning this beloved thou or alois or i alois came speaking of old sins and you are here plaining of new sins what shall i do now i am here am i to speak of sin to come thou dear knight and she touched his head there is no more room for thy great sins alas but i think thou shalt leave behind thee some spark of a fire she looked again at berengere who saw the glint of her green eyes and the old proud discontent twisting her lip but did nothing look berengere said jehane i speak as mother of his child fulke of anjou i had rather my son fulke sinned as his fathers have sinned so that he sinned greatly like them than that he should grow pale scheming safety in a cloister and make the man in our saviour ashamed of his choice i had rather the bad blood stay so it stay great blood than that it should be thin like thine what is there to fear girl a sword i have had a sword in my heart eight years and made no sound let the son pierce what the father pierced before i am a lover saying not to my beloved stroke my heart dearest lord but instead stab if thou wilt my king and let me bleed for thee so i have bled sweet lord jesus and so shall bleed again she stooped and kissed his head saying amen let the poor bleed if the king ask the queen went on praying but richard opened his eyes without start or quiver looked at jehane leaning over him and smiled well my girl well he said thou art in good time what of the lad he is here richard bring him to me says the king so des barres stole out to the moslems at the door and came back leading fulke by the hand a slim tall boy fairhaired and frank in the face with his fathers delicate mouth and bold grey eyes jehane turned to take him this is thy father boy i know it maam says young fulke and knelt down by the bed king richard put his hand on his head what a rough pelt fulke he says like thy fathers god send thee a better inside to it my boy god make a man of thee he will never make me a great king sire says fulke he can make thee better than that said his father i think not answered fulke you are the greatest king in the whole world sire the old man of musse said it kiss me fulke said richard the boy put his face up quickly and kissed his fathers lips what a lover the king laughed and jehane said he always kisses on the lips richard sighed suddenly tired fulke looked about frightened at all the solemnity and took his mothers hand she gave him over to des barres who led him away the king signed to jehane to bend down her head so she did and even thus could barely hear him i must die in peace if i can sweet soul he muttered they all saw that the end was not far off tell me what will become of thee when i am gone she stroked his cheek i shall go back to my husband and children dear one i have left three behind me all sons are they good to thee art thou happy i am at peace with myself wife of a wise old man i love my children and have the memory of thee richard these will suffice me there is one more thing for thee to give me my jehane she smiled pityingly why what is left to give richard he said in her ear our boy fulke ah said jehane the queen was now watching her intently between her hands jehane jehane said king richard sweating with the effort to be heard all our life together thou hast been giving and i spending thou miser that i might play the prodigal for the last time i ask of thee deny me not wilt thou stay here with fulke our son jehane could not speak she shook her head and showed him her eyes all blind with tears the tears came freely from more eyes than hers richards head dropped back and for a full minute they thought him gone but no he opened his eyes again and moved his lips they strained to hear him the sponge the sponge he said then bring me in saintpol the cold light began to steal in through the crannies of the tent the young man was brought in by des barres in chains jehane now behind richards head lifted him up in her arms knock off those fetters says the king saintpol was free eustace says richard you and i have bandied hard words enough and blows enough my chains will be off before sunrise and yours are off already answer me is gurdun dead saintpol dropped to his knees oh my lord he died where he fell but as god knows he had no hand in this nor had i if i know it i suppose god knows it too said richard smiling rather thinly now eustace i have a word to say i have done much against your name to your brother because he spoke against a great lady and ill of my house to your sister here because i loved her not well enough and myself too well eustace you shall kiss her before i go saintpol got up and went to her brother and sister kissed each other above the kings head then said richard now i will tell you that i had nothing to do with the death of your cousin montferrat oh sire oh sire cried saintpol but jehane looked at her brother i had to do with that eustace she said he laid the death of the king and i laid his death at the price of my marriage he deserved it sister said saintpol he did deserve it and i deserve what he had oh sire he urged with tears take my life as your right is but forgive me first what have i to forgive you brother said richard come kiss me we were good friends in the old days saintpol with tears kissed him richard sat up i require you now saintpol and des barres that between you you defend my son fulke milo has the deeds of his lands of cuigny bring him up a good knight and let him think gentlier of his father than that father ever did of his will you do this make haste make haste the queen broke in with a cry oh sire oh sire is there nothing for me madame she turned to jehane and held her fast by the knees have pity spare me a little a very little work o christ o christshe rocked herself aboutcan i do nothing in the world for my king jehane stooped to take her up madame watch over my little fulke when his father is gone and i am gone the queen was crying bitterly i will never leave him if you will trust me she began to say richard put his band out let it be so my lords serve the queen and me in this matter the two lords bowed their heads and the queen tumbled to her sobbed prayers again the kings eyes were almost gone certainly he could not see out of them they understood his moving lips a sponge quick jehane brought it and wiped his mouth she could not see either for tears he gave a strong movement wrenched his head up from her arm then gave a great gasp christ i am done there followed on this a rush of blood which made all hearts stand still they wiped it away but jehane saw that with that hot blood had gone his spirit she lifted high her head and let them read the truth from her eyes then she put her lips upon his and so stayed and felt him grow cold below her warmth the fire was out they buried him at fontevrault as he had directed at the feet of his father king john was there with the peers of england normandy and anjou the queen was there but not alois unless behind the grille and not king philip because he hated king john much worse than he ever hated richard and jehane was not there nor fulke of anjou with his governors because they had another business to perform not all of king richard was buried there where the great effigy still marks the place of great dust jehane had his heart in a casket and with fulke her son des barres her brother saintpol gaston of bearn and the abbot milo took it to the church of rouen and saw it laid among the dead dukes of normandy fitting sepulture for a heart as bold as any of theirs and capable of more gentle music when the fine hand plucked the chords after this jehane kissed fulke and left him with the queen his uncle and guilhem des barres then she went back to her ship in the white palace in the green valley of lebanon the old man of musse embraced his wife moon of my soul my garden my treasurehouse he called her and kissed her all over the king died in peace my lord she said and i have peace because of that thy children shall call thee blessed my beloved as i call thee the prophecy of the leper was not fulfilled sir says jehane ah replied the old man of musse all these things are in the hands of the supreme disposer who with his forefinger points us the determined road then jehane went in to her children and other duties which her station required of her epilogue of the abbot milo when i consider writes the abbot milo on his last page that i have lived to see the deaths of three kings of england wearers of the broomswitch and of the manner of those deaths i am led to admire the wonderful ordering of almighty god who accorded to each of them an end illustrative of his doings in the world and so wrote as it were in blood for our learning king henry produced strife king richard induced strife and king john deduced it king henry died cursing and accursed king richard forgiving and forgiven king john blaspheming and not held worthy of reproof the first did evil meaning evilly the second evil meaning well the third was evil so the first was wretched in death the second pitiful the third shameful the first loved a few the second loved one the third none so the death of the first was gain to a few that of the second to one that of the third to none for he that loves not neither can he hate he is negligible in the end but observe now the chief woe of these kings of the house of anjou was that they hurt whom they loved more than whom they hated king henry was a great prince who did evil to many both in his life and death my dear master lord and friend might have been a greater had not his head gone counter to his heart his generosity not been tripped up by his pride so generous as he was all the world might have loved him as one loved him and yet so arrogant of mind that the very largess he bestowed had a sting beneath it as though he scorned to give less to creatures that lacked so much all his faults and most of his griefs sprang from this rending apart of his nature his heart cried yea to a noble motion then came his haughty head to suggest trickery and bid him say nay to the hearts urgency he was a religious man a pious man the hottest fighter with the coolest judgment of any i have ever known a great lover of one woman he might have been a happy man if she had been let have her way but he thwarted her he played with her wholeheart love blew hot and cold neither let her alone nor clove to her through all so she had to pay and of him my friend and king howsoever i say from the bottom of my soul if his death did not benefit poor jehane then it is a happy thing for a woman to go bleeding in the side but i know that she was fortunate in his death and believe that he was also for he had space for reparation died with his lovers about him having been saved in time from a great disgrace and it is a very wise man who reports illi mors gravis incubat qui notus nimis omnibus ignotus moritur sibi but king richard knew himself in those last keen hours and as we believe won forgiveness of god god be good to him where he is they say that when he died that same day his soul was solved from purgatorial fires by reason one may suppose of his glorious captaincy of the armies of the cross and he drawn up to heaven in a flamy cloud i know nothing certainly of this which was not revealed to me but my prayer is that he may be now with hannibal and judas maccabaeus and charles the great emperor and by this time of writing if there be no offence in it with jehane to sit upon his knee upon whose two souls jesu have mercy explicit
