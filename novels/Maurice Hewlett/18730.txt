lore of proserpine by maurice hewlett thus go the fairy kind whither fate driveth not as we who fight with it and deem us free therefore and after pine or strain against our prison bars in vain for to them fate is lord of life and death and idle is a strife with such a master hypsipyle charles scribner's sons new york copyright by charles scribner's sons to despoina from whom to whom all preface i hope nobody will ask me whether the things in this book are true for it will then be my humiliating duty to reply that i don't know they seem to be so to me writing them they seemed to be so when they occurred and one of them occurred only two or three years ago that sort of answer satisfies me and is the only one i can make as i grow older it becomes more and more difficult to distinguish one kind of appearance from another and to say that is real and again that is illusion honestly i meet in my daily walks innumerable beings to all sensible signs male and female some of them i can touch some smell some speak with some see some discern otherwise than by sight but if you cannot trust your eyes why should you trust your nose or your fingers there's my difficulty in talking about reality there's another way of getting at the truth after all if a thing is not sensibly true it may be morally so if it is not phenomenally true it may be so substantially and it is possible that one may see substance in the idiom so to speak of the senses that i take it is how the greeks saw thunder storms and other huge convulsions that is how they saw meadow grove and stream in terms of their own fair humanity they saw such natural phenomena as shadows of spiritual conflict or of spiritual calm and within the appearance apprehended the truth so it may be that i have done some such may be the explanation of all fairy experience let it be so it is a fact i believe that there is nothing revealed in this book which will not bear a spiritual and a moral interpretation and i venture to say of some of it that the moral implications involved are exceedingly momentous and timely too i need not refer to such matters any further if they don't speak for themselves they will get no help from a preface the book assumes up to a certain point an autobiographical cast this is not because i deem my actual life of any interest to any one but myself but because things do occur to one in time and the chronological sequence is as good as another and much the most easy of any i had intended but my heart failed me to pursue experience to the end there was to have been a section to be called despoina dealing with my later life but my heart failed me the time is not yet though it is coming i don't deny that there are some things here which i learned from the being called despoina and could have learned from nobody else there are some such things but there is not very much and won't be any more just yet some of it there will never be for the sorry reason that our race won't bear to be told fundamental facts about itself still less about other orders of creation which are sufficiently like our own to bring self consciousness into play to write of the sexes in english you must either be sentimental or a satirist you must set the emotions to work otherwise you must be quiet now the emotions have no business with knowledge and there's a reason why we have no fairy lore because we can't keep our feelings in hand the greeks had a mythology the highest form of art and we have none why is that because we can neither expound without wishing to convert the soul nor understand without self experiment we don't want to know things we want to feel them and are ashamed of our need mythology therefore we english must make for ourselves as we can and if we are wise we shall keep it to ourselves it is a pity because since we alone of created things are not self sufficient anything that seems to break down the walls of being behind which we agonise would be a comfort to us but there's a worse thing than being in prison and that is quarrelling with our own nature i shall have explained myself very badly if my reader leaves me with the impression that i have been writing down marvels the fact that a thing occurs in nature takes it out of the portentous there's nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so with that i end contents preface the windows a boy in the wood harkness's fancy the gods in the schoolhouse the soul at the window quidnunc the secret commonwealth beckwith's case the fairy wife oreads a summary chapter lore of proserpine the windows you will remember that socrates considers every soul of us to be at least three persons he says in a fine figure that we are two horses and a charioteer the right hand horse is upright and cleanly made he has a lofty neck and an aquiline nose his colour is white and his eyes dark he is a lover of honour and modesty and temperance and the follower of true glory he needs no touch of the whip but is guided by word and admonition only the other is a crooked lumbering animal put together anyhow he has a short thick neck he is flat faced and of a dark colour with grey eyes of blood red complexion the mate of insolence and pride shag eared and deaf hardly yielding to whip and spur i need not go on to examine with the philosopher the acts of this pair under the whip and spur of love because i am not going to talk about love for my present purpose i shall suggest another dichotomy i will liken the soul itself of man to a house divided according to the modern fashion into three flats or apartments of these the second floor is occupied by the landlord who wishes to be quiet and is not it seems afraid of fire the ground floor by a business man who would like to marry but doubts if he can afford it goes to the city every day looks in at his club of an afternoon dines out a good deal and spends at least a month of the year at dieppe harrogate or one of the german spas he is a pleasant faced man as i see him neatly dressed brushed anointed polished at the extremities for his boots vie with his hair in this particular if he has a fault it is that of jingling half crowns in his trouser pocket but he works hard for them pays his rent with them and gives one occasionally to a nephew that youth at any rate likes the cheerful sound he is rather fond too of monopolising the front of the fire in company and thinks more of what he is going to eat some time before he eats it than a man should but really i can't accuse him of anything worse than such little weaknesses the first floor is occupied by a person of whom very little is known who goes out chiefly at night and is hardly ever seen during the day tradesmen and the crossing sweeper at the corner have caught a glimpse on rare occasions of a white face at the window the startled face of a queer creature who blinks and wrings at his nails with his teeth who peers at you jerks and grins who seems uncertain what to do who sometimes shoots out his hands as if he would drive them through the glass altogether a mischancy unaccountable apparition probably mad nobody knows how long he has been here for the landlord found him in possession when he bought the lease and the ground floor who was here also fancies that they came together but can't be sure there he is anyhow and without an open scandal one doesn't like to give him notice a curious thing about the man is that neither landlord nor ground floor will admit acquaintance with him to each other although if the truth were known each of them knows something for each of them has been through his door and i will answer for one of them at least that he has accompanied the undesirable upon more than one midnight excursion and has enjoyed himself enormously if you could get either of these two alone in a confidential mood you might learn some curious particulars of their coy neighbour and not the least curious would be the effect of his changing the glass of the first floor windows it seems that he had that done directly he got into his rooms saying that it was impossible to see out of such windows and that a man must have light where he got his glass from by whom it was fitted i can't tell you but the effect of it is most extraordinary the only summary account i feel able to give of it at the moment is that it transforms the world upon which it opens you look out upon a new earth literally that the trees are not trees at all but slim grey persons young men young women who stand there quivering with life like a row of caryatides on duty but tiptoe for a flight as keats says you see life as it were rippling up their limbs for though they appear to be clothed their clothing is of so thin a texture and clings so closely that they might as well not be clothed at all they are eyed they see intensely they look at each other so closely that you know what they would be doing you can see them love each other as you watch as for the people in the street the real men and real women as we say i hardly know how to tell you what they look like through the first floor's windows they are changed of everything but one thing they occupy the places fill the standing room of our neighbours and friends there is a something about them all by which you recognise them a trick of the hand a motion of the body a set of the head god knows what it is how little and how much but for all that a new creature a thing like nothing that lives by bread now just look at that policeman at the corner for instance not only is he stark naked everybody is like that but he's perfectly different from the sturdy good humoured red faced puzzled man you and i know he is thin woefully thin and his ears are long and perpetually twitching he pricks them up at the least thing or lays them suddenly back and we see them trembling his eyes look all ways and sometimes nothing but the white is to be seen he has a tail too long and leathery which is always curling about to get hold of something now it will be the lamp post now the square railings now one of those breathing trees but mostly it is one of his own legs yet if you consider him carefully you will agree with me that his tail is a more expressive remnant of the man you have always seen there than any other part of him you may say and truly that it is the only recognisable thing left what do you think of his feet and hands they startled me at first they are so long and narrow so bony and pointed covered with fine short hair which shines like satin that way he has of arching his feet and driving his toes into the pavement delights me and see too that his hands are undistinguishable from feet they are just as long and satiny he is fond of smoothing his face with them he brings them both up to his ears and works them forward like slow fans transformation indeed i defy you to recognise him for the same man except for a faint reminiscence about his tail but all's of a piece the crossing sweeper now has shaggy legs which end in hoofs his way of looking at young people is very unpleasant and one had always thought him such a kindly old man the butcher's boy what a torso is walking with his arm round the waist of the young lady in number seven these are lovers you see but it's mostly on her side he tilts up her chin and gives her a kiss before he goes and she stands looking after him with shining eyes hoping that he will turn round before he gets to the corner but he doesn't wait now wait wait who is this lovely straining beating creature darting here and there about the square bruising herself poor beautiful thing against the railings a sylph a caught fairy surely surely i know somebody is it it can't be that careworn lady god in heaven is it she enough show me no more i will show you no more my dear sir if it agitates you but i confess that i have come to regard it as one of the most interesting spectacles in london the mere information to say nothing of the amusement which i have derived from it would fill a volume but if it did i may add i myself should undoubtedly fill a cell in holloway i will therefore spare you what i know about the doctor's wife and what happens to lieutenant colonel storter when i see him through these windows i could never have believed it unless i had seen it these things are not done i know but observed in this medium they seem quite ordinary lastly for i can't go through the catalogue i will speak of the air as i see it from here my dear sir the air is alive thronged with life spirits forms lovely immaterial diaphanous shapes are weaving endless patterns over the face of the day they shine like salmon at a weir or they darken the sky as redwings in the autumn fields they circle shrieking as they flash like swallows at evening they battle and wrangle together or they join hands and whirl about the square in an endless chain of their beauty their grace of form and movement of the shifting filmy colour hue blending in hue of their swiftness their glancing eyes their exuberant joy or grief i cannot now speak beside them one man may well seem rat and another goat beside them indeed you look for nothing else and if i go on to hint that the owner of these windows is of them though imprisoned in my house that he does at times join them in their streaming flights beyond the housetops and does at times carry with him his half bewildered half shocked and wholly delighted fellow lodgers i have come to the end of my tether and your credulity and for the time at least have flowered myself to death the figure is as good as plato's though my pegasus will never stable in his stall we may believe ourselves to be two persons at least in one and i fancy that one at least of them is a constant so far as my own pair is concerned either one of them has never grown up at all or he was born whole and in a flash as the fairies are such as he was at any rate when i was ten years old such he is now when i am heavily more than ten and the other of us very conscious of the flight of time and of other things with it is free to confess that he has little more hold of his fellow with all this authority behind him than he had when we commenced partnership he has some and thinks himself lucky since the bond between the pair is of such a nature as to involve a real partnership a partnership full of perplexity to the working member of it the ordinary forensic creature of senses passions ambitions and self indulgences the eating sleeping vainglorious assertive male of common experience and it is not to be denied that it has been fruitful nor again that by some freak of fate or fortune the house has kept a decent front to the world at large it is still solvent still favourably regarded by the police it is not it never will be a mere cage of demons its walls have not been fretted to transparency no passing eye can detect revelry behind its decent stucco no passing ear thrill to cries out of the dark no no troubles we may have but we keep up appearances the heart knoweth its own bitterness and if it be a wise one keepeth it to itself i am not going to be so foolish as to deny divergences of opinion even of practice between the pair in me but i flatter myself that i have not allowed them to become a common nuisance a cause of scandal a stumbling block a rock of offence or anything of that kind uneasy tenant wayward partner as my recondite may be he has had a relationship with my forensic which at times has touched cordiality influential he has not been for his colleague has always had the upper hand and been in the public eye he may have instigated to mischief but has not often been allowed to complete his purpose if i am a respectable person it is not his fault he seeks no man's respect if he has occasionally lent himself to moral ends it has been without enthusiasm for he has no morals of his own and never did have any on the other hand he is by nature too indifferent to temporal circumstances to go about to corrupt his partner his main desire has ever been to be let alone anything which tended to tighten the bonds which held him to his co tenant would have been a thing to avoid he desires liberty and nothing less will content him this he will only have by inaction by mewing his sempiternal youth in his cage and on his perch but the tie uniting the pair of us is of such a nature that neither can be uninfluenced by the other it is just that you should hear both sides of the case my forensic eating and arguing self has bullied my other into hypocrisy over and over again he has starved him deprived him of his holidays ignored him ridiculed him snubbed him mercilessly this is severe treatment you'll allow and it's worse even than it seems for the unconscionable fellow owing to this coheirship which he pretends to disesteem has been made privy to experiences which must not only have been extraordinary to so plain and humdrum a person but which have been as i happen to know of great importance to him and which to put the thing at its highest have lifted him dull dog as he is into regions where the very dogs have wings out upon it but he has been in and out with his victim over leagues of space where not one man in ten thousand has been privileged to fare he has been familiar all his life with scenes with folk with deeds undreamed of by thirty nine and three quarters out of forty millions of people and by that quarter million only known as nursery tales not only so but he has been awakened to the significance of common things having at hand an interpreter and been enabled to be precise where wordsworth was vague he has known zeus in the thunder in the lightning beheld the shaking of the dread aegis in the river source he has seen the breasted nymph he has seen the oreads stream over the bare hillside there are men who see these things and don't believe them others who believe but don't see he has both seen and believed the painted figured universe has for him a new shape whispering winds and falling rain speak plainly to his understanding he has seen trees as men walking his helot has unlocked the world behind appearance and made him free of the spirits of natural fact who abide there if he is not the debtor of his comrade and he protests the debt he should be but the rascal laps it all up as a cat porridge without so much as a wag of the tail for thank you such are the exorbitant overlords in mortal men who pass for reputable persons with a chief seat at feasts such things you may say read incredibly but mutatis mutandis i believe them to be common though unrecorded experience i deprecate in advance questions designed to test the accuracy of my eyesight or the ingenuous habit of my pen i have already declared that the windows of my first floor lodger are of such properties that they show you in xenophon's phrase greek ta onta te os onta kai ta me onta os ouk onta now consider it from his side if i were to tell the owner of those windows that i saw the policeman at the corner a helmeted blue tunicked chin scratching ponderous man some six foot in his boots how would he take it would he not mock me what that rat ridiculous and what on earth could i reply i tell you the whole affair is one of windows or sometimes of personally conducted travel and who is guide and who guided is one of those nice questions in psychology which perhaps we are not yet ready to handle of the many speculations as to the nature of the subliminal self i have never found one to be that he may be a fairy prisoner occasionally on parole but i think that not at all unlikely may not metempsychosis be a scourge of two worlds if the soul of my grandam might fitly inhabit a bird might not a fairy ruefully inhabit the person of my grandam if fairy godmothers perchance were fairy grandmothers i have some evidence to place before the reader which may induce him to consider this hypothesis who can doubt at least that shelley's was not a case where the not human was a prisoner in the human who can doubt that of blake's and what was the result forensically shelley was treated as a scoundrel and blake as a madman shelley it was said broke the moral law and blake transcended common sense but the first i reply was in the guidance of a being to whom the laws of this world and the accidents of it meant nothing at all and to the second a wisdom stood revealed which to human eyes was foolishness windows in either case there was a martyrdom and human exasperation appeased by much broken glass let us not however condemn the wreckers of windows who is to judge even them who is to say even of their harsh and cruel reprisals that they were not excusable may not they too have been ridden by some wild spirit within them which goaded them to their beastly work but if the acceptance of the doctrine of multiple personality is going to involve me in the reconsideration of criminal jurisprudence i must close this essay i will close it with the sentence of another philosopher who has considered deeply of these questions it is to be observed he says that the laws of human conduct are precisely made for the conduct of this world of men in which we live breed and pay rent they do not affect the kingdom of the dogs nor that of the fishes by a parity of reasoning they need not be supposed to obtain in the kingdom of heaven in which the schoolmen discovered the citizens dwelling in nine spheres apart from the blessed immigrants whose privileges did not extend so near to the heart of the presence how many realms there may be between mankind's and that ultimate object of pure desire cannot at present be known but it may be affirmed with confidence that any denizen of any one of them brought into relation with human beings would act and reasonably act in ways which to men might seem harsh and unconscionable without sanction or convenience such a being might murder one of the ratepayers of london compound a felony or enter into a conspiracy to depose the king himself and being detected very properly be put under restraint or visited with chastisement either deterrent or vindictive or both but the true inference from the premises would be that although duress or banishment from the kingdom might be essential yet punishment so called ought not to be visited upon the offender for he or she could not be nostri juris and that which were abominable to us might well be reasonable to him or her and indeed a fulfilment of the law of his being punishment therefore could not be exemplary since the person punished exemplified nothing to mankind and if vindictive then would be shocking since that which is vindicated in the mind of the victim either did not exist or ought not the ancient greek who withheld from the sacrifice to showery zeus because a thunder bolt destroyed his hayrick or the egyptian who manumitted his slaves because a god took the life of his eldest son was neither a pious nor a reasonable person there is much debatable matter in this considered opinion a boy in the wood i had many bad qualities as a child of which i need mention only three i was moody irresolute and hatefully reserved fate had already placed me the eldest by three years of a large family add to the eminence thus attained intentions which varied from hour to hour a will so little in accordance with desire that i had rather give up a cherished plan than fight for it and a secretive faculty equalled only by the magpie and you will not wonder when i affirm that i lived alone in a household of a dozen friendly persons as a set off and consolation to myself i had very strongly the power of impersonation i could be within my own little entity a dozen different people in a day and live a life thronged with these companions or rivals and yet this set me more solitary than ever for i could never appear in any one of my characters to anybody else but alone and apart what worlds i inhabited worlds of fact and worlds of fiction at nine years old i knew nelson's ardour and wellesley's phlegm i had napoleon's egotism galahad's purity lancelot's passion tristram's melancholy i reasoned like socrates and made phaedo weep i persuaded like saint paul and saw the throng on mars' hill sway to my words i was by turns don juan and don quixote tom jones and mr allworthy hamlet and his uncle young shandy and his you will gather that i was a reader i was and the people of my books stepped out of their pages and inhabited me or to change the figure i found in every book an open door and went in and dwelt in its world thus i lived a thronged and busy life a secret life full of terror triumph wonder frantic enterprise a noble and gallant figure among my peers while to my parents brothers and sisters i was an incalculable fitful creature often lethargic and often in the sulks they saw me mooning in idleness and were revolted or i walked dully the way i was bid and they despaired of my parts i could not explain myself to them still less justify having that miserable veil of reserve close over my mouth like a yashmak to my father i could not speak to my mother i did not the others being my juniors all hardly existed who is to declare the motives of a child's mind what was the nature of this reticence was it that my real habit was reverie was it as i suspect that constitutional timidity made me diffident i was a coward i am very sure for i was always highly imaginative was it finally that i was dimly conscious of matters which i despaired of putting clearly who can say and who can tell me now whether i was cursed or blessed certainly if it had been possible to any person my senior to share with me my daily adventures i might have conquered the cowardice from which i suffered such terrible reverses but it was not i was the eldest of a large family and apparently the easiest to deal with of any of it i was what they call a tractable child being in fact too little interested in the world as it was to resent any duties cast upon me it was not so with the others they were high spirited little creatures as often in mischief as not and demanded much more pains then i ever did what they demanded they got what i did not demand i got not lo here is alle what shold i more seye how it was that taking no interest in my actual surroundings i became aware of unusual things behind them i cannot understand it is very difficult to differentiate between what i imagined and what i actually perceived it was a favourite string of my poor father's plaintive lyre that i had no eyes he was a great walker a poet and a student of nature every sunday of his life he took me and my brother for a long tramp over the country the intense spiritual fatigue of which exercise i should never be able to describe i have a sinking of the heart even now when i recall our setting out intolerable labour i saw nothing and said nothing i did nothing but plug one dull foot after the other i felt like some chained slave going to the hulks and can well imagine that my companions must have been very much aware of it my brother whose nature was much happier than mine who dreamed much less and observed much more was the life of these woeful excursions without him i don't think that my father could have endured them at any rate he never did i amazed irritated and confounded him at most times but in nothing more than my apathy to what enchanted him the birds the flowers the trees the waters did not exist for me in my youth the world for me was uninhabited a great empty cage people passed us or stood at their doorways watching us but i never saw them if by chance i descried somebody coming whom it would be necessary to salute or to whom i might have to speak i turned aside to avoid them i was not only shy to a fault as a diffident child must be but the world of sense either did not exist for me or was thrust upon me to my discomfort and yet all the while as i moved or sat i was surrounded by a stream of being of infinite constituents aware of them to this extent that i could converse with them without sight or speech i knew they were there i knew them singing whispering screaming they filled my understanding not my senses i did not see them but i felt them i knew not what they said or sang but had always the general sense of their thronging neighbourhood footnote and me also when i was enabled at a later day to perceive them i am thankful to remember and record for my own comfort that that day came not too late for my enchantment to overtake his and proceed in company i enlarge upon this because i think it justifies me in adding that observing so little what i did observe with my bodily eyes must almost certainly have been observable but now let the reader judge the first time i ever saw a creature which was really outside ordinary experience was in the late autumn of my twelfth year my brother next in age to me was nine my eldest sister eight we three had been out walking with our mother and were now returning at dusk to our tea through a wood which covered the top of a chalk down i remember vividly the scene the carpet of drenched leaves under bare branches the thin spear like shafts of the underwood the grey lights between the pale frosty sky overhead with the sickle moon low down in it i remember too various sensations such as the sudden chill which affected me as the crimson globe of the sun disappeared and again how when we emerged from the wood i was enheartened by the sight of the village shrouded under chimney smoke and by the one or two twinkling lights dotted here and there about the dim wolds in the wood it was already twilight and very damp perhaps i had been tired more likely bored as i always was when i was not being somebody else i remember that i had found the path interminable i had been silent as i mostly was while the other two had chattered and played about our mother and when presently i stayed behind for a purpose i remember that i made no effort to catch them up i knew the way perfectly of course and had no fear of the dark oddly enough i had no fear of that i was far less imaginative in the night than in the day besides that by the time i was ready to go after them i had much else to think of i must have been looking at him for some time before i made out that he was there so you may peer into a thicket a hundred times and see nothing and then a trick of the light or a flutter of the mood and you see creatures where you had been sure was nothing as children will i had stayed longer than i need looking and wondering into the wood not observing but yet absorbing the effects of the lights and shades the trees were sapling chestnuts if i am not mistaken spanish chestnuts and used for hop poles in those parts their leaves decay gradually the fleshy part so to speak dropping away from the articulation till at last bleached skeleton leaves remain and flicker at every sigh of the wind the ground was densely carpeted with other leaves in the same state or about to become so the silver grey was cross hatched by the purple lines of the serried stems and as the view receded this dipped into blue and there lost itself it was very quiet a windless fall of the light to day i should find it most beautiful and even then i suspect i felt its beauty without knowing it to be so looking into it all without realising it i presently and gradually did realise something else a shape a creature a thing of form and pressure not a wraith not i am quite certain a trick of the senses it was under a clump of the chestnut stems kneeling and sitting on its heels and it was watching me with the bright quick eyes of a mouse if i were to say that my first thought was of some peering and waiting animal i should go on to qualify the thought by reference to the creature's eyes they were eyes which like all animals' could only express one thing at a time they expressed now attention the closest not fear not surprise not apprehension of anything that i might be meditating against their peace but simply minute attention the absence of fear no doubt marked their owner off from the animals of common acquaintance but the fact that they did not at the same time express the being itself showed him to be different from our human breed for whatever else the human pair of eyes may reveal it reveals the looker the eyes of this creature revealed nothing of itself except that it was watching me narrowly i could not even be sure of its sex though i believe it to have been a male and shall hereafter treat of it as such i could see that he was young i thought about my own age he was very pale without being at all sickly indeed health and vigour and extreme vivacity were implicit in every line and expressed in every act he was clear skinned but almost colourless the shadow under his chin i remember was bluish his eyes were round when not narrowed by that closeness of his scrutiny of me and though probably brown showed to be all black with pupil indistinguishable from iris the effect upon me was of black vivid black unintelligent eyes which see intensely but cannot translate his hair was dense and rather long it covered his ears and touched his shoulders it was pushed from his forehead sideways in a thick in a solid fold as if it had been the corner of a frieze cape thrown back it was dark hair but not black his neck was very thin i don't know how he was dressed i never noticed such things but in colour he must have been inconspicuous since i had been looking at him for a good time without seeing him at all a sleeveless tunic i think which may have been brown or grey or silver white i don't know but his knees were bare that i remember and his arms were bare from the shoulder i standing he squatting on his heels the pair of us looked full at one another i was not frightened no more was he i was excited and full of interest so i think was he my heart beat double time then i saw with a curious excitement that between his knees he held a rabbit and that with his left hand he had it by the throat now what is extraordinary to me about this discovery is that there was nothing shocking in it i saw the rabbit's wild and panic blown eye i saw the bright white rim of it and recognised its little added terror of me even in the midst of its anguish that must have been the conventional fright of a beast of chase an instinct to fear rather than an emotion for of emotions the poor thing must have been having its fill it was not till i saw its mouth horribly open its lips curled back to show its shelving teeth that i could have guessed at what it was suffering but gradually i apprehended what was being done its captor was squeezing its throat i saw what i had never seen before and have never seen since i saw its tongue like a pale pink petal of a flower dart out as the pressure drove it revolting sight as that would have been to me witnessed in the world here in this dark wood in this outland presence it was nothing but curious now as i watched and wondered the being following my eyes' direction looked down at the huddled thing between his thighs and just as children squeeze a snap dragon flower to make it open and shut its mouth so precisely did he pressing or releasing the windpipe cause that poor beast to throw back its lips and dart its dry tongue he did this many times while he watched it and when he looked up at me again and while he continued to look at me i saw that his cruel fingers as by habit continued the torture and that in some way he derived pleasure from the performance as if it gratified him to be sure that effect was following on cause inevitably i have never i believe been cruel to an animal in my life i hated cruelty then as i hate it now i have always shirked the sight of anything in pain from my childhood onwards yet the fact is that not only did i nothing to interfere in what i saw going on but that i was deeply interested and absorbed in it i can only explain that to myself now by supposing that i knew then that the creature in front of me was not of my own kind and was not in fact outraging any law of its own being is not that possible may i not have collected unawares so much out of created nature i am unable to say all i am clear about is that here was a thing in the semblance of a boy doing what i had never observed a boy do and what if i ever had observed a boy do would have flung me into a transport of rage and grief here therefore was a thing in the semblance of a boy who was no boy at all so much must have been as certain to me then as it is indisputable now one doesn't at that age reason things out one knows them and is dumb though unconvinced before powerful syllogisms to the contrary all children are so confronted by strange phenomena and yet i had facts to go upon if child as i was i had been capable of inference i need only mention one if this creature had been human upon seeing that i was conscious of its behaviour to the rabbit it would either have stopped the moment it perceived that i did not approve or was not amused or it would have continued deliberately out of bravado but it neither stopped nor hardily continued it watched its experiment with interest for a little then finding me more interesting did not discontinue it but ceased to watch it he went on with it mechanically dreamingly as if to the excitation of some other sense than sight that of feeling for instance he went on lasciviously for the sake of the pleasure so to be had in other words being without self consciousness and ignorant of shame he must have been non human after all too it must be owned that i cannot have been confronted by the appearance for more than a few minutes allow me three to have been spent before i was aware of him three more will be the outside i can have passed gazing at him but i speak of minutes of course referring to my ostensible self that inert apathetic child who followed its mother that purblind creature through whose muddy lenses the pent immortal had been forced to see his familiar in the wood and perchance to dress in form and body what for him needed neither to be visible it was this outward self which was now driven by circumstances to resume command the command which for three minutes by his reckoning he had relinquished both of us no doubt had been much longer there had we not been interrupted a woodman homing from his work came heavily up the path and like a guilty detected rogue i turned to run and took my incorruptible with me not until i had passed the man did i think to look back the partner of my secret was not then to be seen out of sight out of mind is the way of children out of mind then withdrew my incorruptible i hurried on ran and overtook my party half way down the bare hillside i still remember the feeling of relief with which i swept into the light felt the cold air on my cheeks and saw the intimacy of the village open out below me i am almost sure that my eyes held tears at the assurance of the sweet familiar things which i knew and could love there literally were my own people that which i had left behind must be unlawful because it was so strange in the warmth and plenty of the lighted house by the schoolroom table before the cosily covered teapot amid the high talk the hot toast and the jam my experience in the dusky wood seemed unreal lawless almost too terrible to be remembered never never to be named it haunted me for many days and gave rise to curious wonderings now and then as i passed the patient humble beasts of common experience a carter's team nodding jingling its brasses a donkey patient humble hobbled in a paddock dogs sniffing each other a cat tucked into a cottage window i mused doubtfully and often whether we had touched the threshold of the heart of their mystery but for the most part being constitutionally timid i was resolute to put the experience out of mind when next i chanced to go through the wood there is no doubt i peered askance to right and left among the trees but i took good care not to desert my companions that which i had seen was unaccountable therefore out of bounds but though i never saw him there again i have never forgotten him harkness's fancy i may have been a precocious child but i cannot tell within a year or two how soon it was that i attained manhood there must have been a moment of time when i clothed myself in skins like adam when i knew what this world calls good and evil by which this world means nothing more nor less than men and women and chiefly women i think savage peoples initiate their young and teach them the taboos of society by stripes we allow our issue to gash themselves by stripes then upon my young flesh i scored up this lesson for myself certain things were never to be spoken of certain things never to be looked at in certain ways certain things never to be done consciously or for the pleasure to be got out of them one stepped out of childish conventions into mannish conventions and did so certainly without any instruction from outside i remember for instance that as children it was a rigid part of our belief that our father was the handsomest man in the world handsome was the word in the same way our mother was by prerogative the most beautiful woman if some hero flashed upon our scene garibaldi lancelot of the lake or another the greatest praise we could possibly have given him for beauty excellence courage or manly worth would have put him second to our father so also helen of sparta and beatrice of florence gave way that was the law of the nursery rigid and never to be questioned until unconsciously i grew out of it and becoming a man put upon me the panoply of manly eyes i now accepted it that to kiss my sister was nothing but that to kiss her friend would be very wicked i discovered that there were two ways of looking at a young woman and two ways of thinking about her i discovered that it was lawful to have some kinds of appetite and to take pleasure in food exercise sleep warmth cold water hot water the smell of flowers and quite unlawful so much as to think of or to admit to myself the existence of other kinds of appetite i discovered in fact that love was a shameful thing that if one was in love one concealed it from the world and above all the world from the object of one's love the conviction was probably instinctive for one is not the descendant of puritans for nothing but the discovery of it is another matter attendance at school and the continuous reading of romance were partly responsible for that physical development clinched the affair i was in all respects mature at thirteen though my courage to use the word in chaucer's sense was not equal to my ability i had more than usual diffidence against me more than usual reserve and self consciousness from which i have only lately escaped grew upon me hand in hand with experience but being now become a day scholar at the grammar school and thrown whether i would or not among other boys of my own age i sank my recondite self deeply under the folds of my quickened senses i became aware of a world which was not his world at all i watched i heard i judged i studied intently my comrades and while in secret i shared their own hardy lives i was more than content to appear a cipher among them i had no friends and made none all my comradeship with my school mates took place in my head for however salient in mood or inclination i may have been i was a laggard in action in company i was lower than the least of them in my solitude at their head i captured the universe daily to and fro for two or three years i journeyed between my home and this school with a couple of two mile walks and a couple of train journeys to be got through in all weathers and all conditions of light i saw little or nothing of my school fellows out of hours and lived all my play time if you can so call it intensely alone with the people of my imagination to whose number i could now add gleanings from the grammar school i don't claim objective reality for any of these i am sure that they were of my own making though unseen beings throng round us all though as a child i had been conscious of them though i had actually seen one in these first school years of mine the machinery i had for seeing the usually unseen was eclipsed my recondite self was fast in his cachot and i didn't know that he was there but one may imagine fairies enough out of one's reading and going beyond that using it as a spring board advance in the work of creation from realising to begetting so it was with me the faerie queen was as familiar as the latin primer ought to have been i had much of mallory by heart a book full of magic forth of his pages stepped men at arms and damsels the moment i was alone and held me company for as long as i would the persons of homer's music came next to them i was hector and held andromache to my heart i kissed her farewell when i went forth to school and hurried home at night from the station impatient for her arms i was never paris and had only awe of helen even then i dimly guessed her divinity that godhead which the supremest beauty really is but i was often odysseus the much enduring and very well acquainted with the wiles of calypso next in power of enchantment came certainly don quixote in whose lank bones i was often encased dulcinea's charm was very real to me i revelled in her honeyed name i was don juan too and i was tom jones but my most natural impersonation in those years was tristram the luxury of that champion's sorrows had a swooning sweetness of their own of which i never tired iseult meant nothing i cared nothing for her i was enamoured of the hero and saw myself drenched in his passion like narcissus in the fable i loved myself and saw myself in tristram's form the most beautiful and the most beloved of beings chivalry and romance chained me at that time and not the supernatural the fairy adventures of the heroes of my love swept by me untouched morgan le fay britomart vivien nimue merlin did not convince me they were picturesque conventions whose decorative quality i felt while so far as i was concerned they were garniture or apparatus and yet the fruitful meadows through which i took my daily way were as forests to me the grass stems spired up to my fired fancy like great trees among them i used to minish myself to the size of an ant and become a pioneer hewing out a pathway through virgin thickets i had my ears alert for the sound of a horn of a galloping horse of the questing beast and hounds in full cry but i never looked to encounter a fairy in these most fairy solitudes beleaguered ladies knights errant dwarfs churls fiends of hell leaping like flames out of pits in the ground all these but no fairies it's very odd that having seen the reality and devoured the fictitious i should have had zest for neither but so it is as for my school mates though i had very little to say to them or they to me i used to watch them very closely and as i have said came to weave them into my dreams some figured as heroes some as magnanimous allies some as malignant enemies some who struck me as beautiful received of me the kind of idolatry the insensate self surrender which creatures of my sort have always offered up to beauty of any sort i remember t e a very shapely and distinguished youth i worshipped him as a god and have seen him since alas i remember b also a tall lean loose limbed young man he was a great cricketer a good natured sleepy giant perfectly stupid i am sure but with marks of breed about him which i could not possibly mistake him too i enthroned upon my temple frieze he would have figured there as meleager had i been a few years older as it was he rode a blazoned charger all black and feutred his lance with the knights of king arthur's court then there was h n a good looking good natured boy and t r another many and many a day did they ride forth with me adventuring that is spiritually they did so physically speaking i had no scot or lot with them we were in plate armour visored and beplumed we slung our storied shields behind us we had our spears at rest we laughed told tales sang as we went through the glades of the forest down the rutted charcoal burner's track and came to the black mere where there lay a barge with oars among the reeds i can see now h n throw up his head bared to the sky and slanting sun he had thick and dark curly hair and a very white neck his name of chivalry was sagramor t r was of stouter build and less salient humour he was bors a brother of lancelot's i who was moody here as in waking life was tristram more often tramtris of other more sinister figures i remember two r s who bullied me until i was provoked at last into facing him a greedy pale lecherous boy graceless a liar but extremely clever i had a horror of him which endures now if he as i have had a dweller in the deeps of him his must have been a satyr i cannot doubt it now disastrous ally for mortal man vice sat upon his face like a grease vice made his fingers quick he had a lickorous tongue and a taste for sweet things which even then made me sick so repulsive was he to me so impressed upon my fancy that it was curious he did not haunt my inner life but i never met him there no shape of his ever encountered me in the wilds and solitary places in the manifest world he afflicted me to an extent which the rogue fairy in the wood could never have approached perhaps it was that all my being was forearmed against him and that i fought him off at any rate he never trespassed in my preserves the other was r d a bleared and diseased creature a thing of pity and terror to the wholesome one of those outcasts of the world which every school has to know and reckon with a furtive nail bitten pick nose wretch with an unholy hunger for ink earth worms and the like what terrible tenant do the likes of these carry about with them he too haunted me but not fearfully but he too i now understand too well was haunted and ridden to doom i pitied him tried to be kind to him tried to treat him as the human thing which in some sort he was i discovered that when he was interested he forgot his loathsome cravings and became almost lovable i went home with him once to a mean house in he took me into the backyard and showed me his treasury half a dozen rabbits as many guinea pigs and a raven with a bald head he was all kindness to these prisoners fondled them with hands and voice spoke a kind of inarticulate baby language to them and gave them pet names he forgot his misery his poverty i remember that he never had a handkerchief and always wanted one that his jacket sleeves were near his elbow and that his wrist bones were red and broken but now there shone a clear light in his eye he could face the world as he spoke to me of the habits of his friends we got upon some sort of terms by these means and i always had a kind of affection for poor r d in a sense we were both outcasts and might have warmed the world for each other if i had not been so entirely absorbed in my private life as to grudge any moment of it unnecessarily spent i should have asked him home but boys are exorbitant in their own affairs and i had no time to spare him i was a year at before i got so far with any schoolfellow of mine there but just about the time of my visit to r d i fell in with another boy called harkness who for some reason of his own desired my closer acquaintance and got as much of it as i was able to give to anybody and a good deal more than he deserved or i was the better of he too was a day boy whose people lived in a suburb of the town which lay upon my road we scraped acquaintance by occasionally travelling together so much of the way as he had to traverse from this point onward all the advances were his i had no liking for him and in fact some of his customs shocked me but he was older than i very friendly and very interesting he evidently liked me he asked me to tea with him he used to wait for me going and returning i had no means of refusing his acquaintance and did not but i got no good out of him as he was older so he was much more competent not so much vicious as curious and enterprising he knew a great many things which i only guessed at and could do much or said that he could which i only dreamed about he put a good deal of heart into my instruction and left me finally with my lesson learned i never saw nor heard of him after i left the school we did not correspond and he left no mark upon me of any kind the lesson learned i used the knowledge certainly but it did not take me into the region which he knew best his grove of philosophy was close to the school in k park which is a fine enclosure of forest trees glades brake fern and deer here in complete solitude for we never saw a soul my sentimental education was begun by this self appointed professor as i remember he was a good looking lad enough with a round and merry face high colour bright eyes a moist and laughing mouth had he known the way in he would have been at home in the garden of priapus where perhaps he is now he was hardy in address a ready speaker rather eloquent upon the theme that he loved and i dare say he may have been as fortunate as he said or very nearly certainly what he had to tell me of love and women opened my understanding i believe that i envied him his ease of attainment more than what he said he had attained i might have been stimulated by his adventures to be adventurous on my own account but i never was neither at that time nor at any other i am quite certain that never in my life have i gone forth conquering and to conquer in affairs of the heart you need to be a casanova which harkness was in his little way and i have had no aptitude for the part but as i said just now i absorbed his teachings and made use of them so far as he gave me food for reflection i ate it and assimilated it in my own manner neither by him nor by any person far more considerable than himself has my imagination been moved in the direction of the mover of it let great poet great musician great painter stir me ever so deeply i have never been able to follow him an inch i was excited by pictures to see new pictures of my own by poems to make poems of my own not of theirs in these no doubt were elements of theirs there was a borrowed something a quality an accent a spirit of attack but the forms were mine and the setting always so all my life i have used other men's art and wisdom as a spring board i suppose every poet can say the same this was to be the use to me of the lessons of the precocious affectionate and philoprogenitive harkness i remember very well one golden summer evening when he and i lay talking under a great oak he expounding and i plucking at the grass as i listened or let my mind go free how quite suddenly the mesh he was weaving about my groping mind parted in the midst and showed me for an appreciable moment a possibility of something it was no more which he could never have seen from the dense shade in which we lay there stretched out an avenue of timber trees whereunder the bracken breast high had been cut to make a ride upon this bracken and upon this smooth channel in the midst the late sun streamed toward us a soft wash of gold behind all this the sky pale to whiteness immediately overhead deepened to the splendid orange of the sunset each tree cast his shadow upon his neighbour so that only the topmost branches burned in the light over and above us floated the drowsy hum of the insect world rarely we heard the moaning of a wood dove more rarely still the stirring of deer hidden in the thicket shade this was a magical evening primed with wonders in the glamour of which master harkness could find nothing better for him to rehearse than the progress of his amours with his mother's housemaid yet something of the evening glow something of the opulence of summer smouldered in his words he painted his mistress with the colour of the sunset he borrowed of it burnt gold to deck her clay he hymned the whiteness of her neck her slender waist her whispers the kisses of her mouth the scamp was luxuriating in his own imaginings or reminiscences much less of a lover and far more of a rhapsodist than he suspected as such his paean of precocious love stirred my senses and fired my imagination but not in the direction of his own for the glow which he cast upon his affair was a borrowed one he had dipped without knowing into the languid glory of the evening which like a pool of wealth lay ready to my hand also i gave him faint attention from the first after he had started my thoughts he might sing rapture after rapture of his young and ardent sense for me the spirit of a world not his whispered a te convien tenere altro viaggio and little as i knew it in my vague exploration of that scene of beauty of those scarcely stirring stilly burning trees of that shimmering fronded fern of that misty splendour i was hunting for the soul of it all for the informing spirit of it all harkness's erotics gave ardour to my search but no clew i lost him left him behind and never found him again he fell into the garden of priapus i doubt as for me i believed that i was now looking upon a dryad i was looking certainly at a spirit informed a being irradiate and quivering with life and joy of life stood dipt to the breast in the brake stood so bathing in the light stood so preening herself like a pigeon on the roof edge and saw me and took no heed she had appeared or had been manifest to me quite suddenly at one moment i saw the avenue of lit green at another she was dipt in it i could describe her now at this distance of time a radiant young female thing fiercely favoured smiling with a fierce joy with a gleam of fierce light in her narrowed eyes upon her body and face was the hue of the sun's red beam her hair loose and fanned out behind her head was of the colour of natural silk but diaphanous as well as burnished so that while the surfaces glittered like spun glass the deeps of it were translucent and showed the fire behind her garment was thin and grey and it clung to her like a bark seemed to grow upon her as a creeping stone weed grows harkness would have admired the audacity of her shape as i did but i found nothing provocative in it as well might a boy have enamoured himself of a slim tree as of that unearthly shaft of beauty i said that she preened herself the word is inexact she rather stood bathing in the light motionless but for the lifting of her face into it that she might dip or for the bending of her head that the warmth behind her might strike upon the nape of her neck those were all her movements slowly rehearsed and again and again rehearsed with each of them she thrilled anew she thrilled and glowed responsive to the play of the light i don't know whether she saw me though it seemed to me that our looks had encountered if her eyes had taken me in i should have known it i think and if i had known it i should have quailed and looked at her no more so shamefaced was i so self conscious that i can be positive about that for far from avoiding her i watched her intently studied her in all her parts and found out some curious things looking at her beside the oaks for instance whence she must have emanated i could judge why it was that i had not seen her come out her colouring was precisely that of her background her garment smock or frock or vest as you will was grey green like the oak stems her whites were those of the sky gleams her roses those of the sun's rays the maze of her hair could hardly be told from the photosphere i tested this simply and summarily shutting my eyes for a second when i opened them she was gone shutting them again and opening there she was sunning herself breathing deep and long watching her own beauties as the light played with them i tried this many times and it did not fail me i could with her assistance bring her upon my retina or take her off it as if i had worked a shutter across my eyes but as i watched her so i got very excited her business was so mysterious her pleasure in it so absorbing she was visible and yet secret i was visible and yet she could be ignorant of it i got the same throbbing sort of interest out of her as many and many a time i have got since out of watching other wild creatures at their affairs crouching hidden where they could not discern me by any of their senses few things enthral me more than that and here i had my first taste of it i remember that my heart beat i remember that i trembled nothing could have torn me from the spot but what precisely did an alien intervention the besotted harkness stopped short in his recital and asked me what i was staring at that was the end of it i had rather have died than tell him perhaps i was afraid of his mockery perhaps i dared not risk his unbelief perhaps i felt ashamed that i had been prying perhaps i grudged him the sight of her moulded beauty and keen wild face what am i staring at why nothing i said i got up and put the strap of my school satchel over my head i never looked for her again before i walked away whether she left when i left whether she was really there or a projection of my mind whether my inner self my prisoner had seen her or my schoolboy self through his agency whether it was a trick of the senses a dream or the like i can't tell you i only know that i have now recalled exactly what i seemed to see and that i have seen her since her or her co mate once or twice i can account for her now easily enough i can assure myself that she was really there that she or the like of her pervades haunts indwells all such places but it seems that there must be a right relation between the seer and the object before the unseen can become the seen put it like this that form is a necessary convention of our being a mode of consciousness just as space is just as time just as rhythm are then it is clear enough that the spirits of natural fact must take on form and sensible body before we can apprehend them they take on such form for us or such body through our means that is what i mean by a right relation between them and ourselves now some persons have the faculty of discerning spirits that is of clothing them in bodily form and others have not but of those who have it all do not discern them in the same form or clothe them in the same body the form will be rhythmical to some to other some audible to others yet again odorous aromatic pain or bliss these modes are no matter they are accidents of our state they cause the form to be relative just as the conception of god is but the substance is constant i have seen innumerable spirits but always in bodily form i have never perceived them by means of any other sense such as hearing though sight has occasionally been assisted by hearing if during an orchestral symphony you look steadily enough at one musician or another you can always hear his instrument above the rest and follow his part in the symphony in the same way when i look at fairy throngs i can hear them sing if i single out one of them for observation i hear him or her sing not words never words they have none i saw once like a driven cloud the spirits of the north west wind sweep down the sky over the bare ridge of a chalk down winged and shrouded eager creatures embattled like a host they were grey and dun coloured pale in the face their hair swept forward not back for it seemed as if the wind in gusts went faster than themselves and was driving them faster than they could go another might well have heard these beings like a terrible rushing music as cries of havoc or desolation wild peals of laughter fury and exultation but to me they were inaudible i heard the volleying of the wind but them i saw so in the still ecstasy of that dryad bathing in light i saw beyond doubt what the greeks called by that name what some of them saw and i saw it in their mode although at the time of seeing i knew nothing of them or their modes because it happened to be also my mode but so far i did not more than see her for though i haunted the place where she had been she never came there again nor never showed herself it became to me sacred ground where with awed breath i could say here indeed she stood and bathed herself here i really saw her and she me and i encompassed it with a fantastic cult of my own invention it may have been very comic or very foolish but i don't myself think it was either because it was so sincere and because the impulse to do it came so naturally i used to bare my head i made a point of saving some of my luncheon which i took with me to school that i might leave it there it was real sacrifice that because i had a fine appetite and it was pure worship in my solitary hours which were many i walked with her of course talked and played with her but that was another thing imagination or fancy and i don't remember anything of what we said or did it needs to be carefully distinguished from the first apparition with which imagination having nothing whatever to proceed upon had nothing whatever to do one thing however i do remember that our relations were entirely sexless and as i write another comes into mind i saw no affinity between her and the creature of my first discovery it never occurred to me to connect the two either positively as being inhabitants of a world of their own or negatively as not being of my world i was not a reflective boy but my mind proceeded upon flashes by leaps of intuition when i was moved i could conceive anything everything when i was unmoved i was as dull as a clod it was idle to tell me to think i could only think when i was moved from within to think that made me the despair of my father and the vessel of my schoolmaster's wrath so here i saw no relationship whatsoever between the two appearances now of course i do i see now that both were fairies informed spirits of certain times or places for time has a spirit as well as space but more of this in due season i am not synthesising now but recording one had been merely curious the other for a time enthralled me the first had been made when i was too young to be interested the second found me more prepared and seeded in my brain for many a day gradually however it too faded as fancy began to develop within me i took to writing i began to fall in love and at fifteen i went to a boarding school farewell then to rewards and fairies the gods in the schoolhouse who am i to treat of the private affairs of my betters to evoke your fragrant names felicite perpetua loves of my tender youth shall i forget thee emilia thy slow smile and peering brown eyes of mischief or appeal rosy lauretta or thee whom i wooed desperately from afar lured by thy buxom wellbeing thy meek and schooled replies and if i forget you not how shall i explore you as maladies trace out the stages of your conquest as if you were spores never never worship went up from me to you and worship is religion and religion is sacred so my dears were you each of you in your turn sacred in your shrines before each of you in turn i fell down suddenly come corpo morto cadde and to each of you in turn i devoted those waking hours which fancy had hitherto claimed of me yet this i do feel free to say by leave of you ladies that calf love has not the educative value of the genuine passion it is blind worship by instinct it is a sign of awakening sense but it is not its awakener it is a lovely thing as all quick or burning growth is but it has little relation to the soul and our northern state is the more gracious that consummation of it is not feasible apart from the very obvious drawbacks there is one not quite so obvious i mean the early exhaustion of imaginative sympathy love indeed is an affair of maturity i don't believe that a man in this country can love before forty or a woman before thirty five they may marry before that and have children and they will love their children but very rarely each other i am thinking now of love at its highest rating as that passion which is able to lift a man to the highest flight of which the soul is capable here on earth a flight mind you which it may take without love as the poet's takes it or the musician's but which the ordinary man's can only take by means of love calf love is wholly a sex matter perfectly natural mostly harmless and nearly always a beautiful thing to be treated tenderly by the wise parent in my own case my mother treated it so with a tact and a reverential handling which only good women know and i had it as i had mumps and measles badly with a high temperature and some delirium but with no aggravation from outside it ran its course or its courses and left me sane one of its effects upon me was that it diverted the mind of my forensic self from the proceedings or aptitudes of my recondite i neither knew nor cared what my wayward tenant might be doing indeed so much was my natural force concerned in the heart affair of the moment that the other wretch within me lay as it were bound in a dungeon he never saw the light the sun to him was dark and silent was the moon there in fact he remained for some five or six years while sex pricked its way into me intent upon the making of a man he maybe was to have something to say to that something to do with it but not yet so much for calf love but now for a more important matter i left the grammar school at s at the age when boys usually go to their harrow and winchester as well equipped i daresay as most boys of my years for with the rudiments i had been fairly diligent and with some of them even had become expert i was well grounded in latin and french grammar and in english literature was far ahead of boys much older than myself looking back now upon the drilling i had at s i consider it was well done but i have to set against the benefits i got from the system the fact that i had much privacy and all the chance which that gives a boy to educate himself withal my school hours limited my intercourse with the school world before and after them i could develop at my own pace and in my own way and i did i believe that when i went to my great school i had the makings of an interesting lad in me but i declare upon my conscience that it was that place only which checked the promise for ten years or more and might have withered it altogether my father was an idealist of he showed the enthusiasm and nursed in his bosom the hopes and beliefs of the promoters of the international exhibition of that year there was a plentiful planting of foreign stock in england after that and one of its weedy saplings was an international education company which out of a magniloquent prospectus and some too confident shareholders bore one fruit the london international college at spring grove it never came to maturity and is now dropped and returned to the ground of all such schemes i suppose it had been on the stalk some fifteen years when i went to feed of it the scheme in fact sprang out of enthusiasm and had no bottom in experience it may be true that all men are brothers but it is not logical to infer from that that all brothers are the better for each other's society the raw brazilians chilians nicaraguans and what not who were drawn from their native forests and plunged into the company of blockish yorkshire lads or sharp faced london boys were only scared into rebellion and to demonstration after their manner they used the knife sometimes they hardly ever assimilated and they taught us nothing that we were the better of knowing quite the contrary we taught them football i think and i remember a negro from bermuda a giant of a fellow who raged over the ground like a goaded bull when that game was being played to the consternation of his opponents he had a younger brother with inordinately long arms like a great lax ape a cheerful grinning harmless creature as i remember him he was a football player too his hug was that of an octopus which swallowed you all as for the english in return for their football lore they received the gift of tobacco i learned to smoke at fifteen from a chilian called perez a wizened preternaturally wise old youth nobody in the world could have been wise as he looked and nobody else in the school as dull as he really was over this motley assembly was set as house master a ferocious scotchman of great parts but no discretion and there were assistants too of scholarship and refinement who if they had had the genius for education without which these things are nothing might have put humanity into some of us when it was past the time i discovered this and one of them became my friend and helper i then discovered the tragedy of our system from the other side for the pain is a two edged sword and imbrues the breast of the pedagogue even while it bleeds the pupil to inanition that poor man scholar gentleman humourist poet as he was held boys in terror he misdoubted them they made him self conscious betrayed him into strange hidden acts of violence rendered him incapable of instruction except of the most conventional kind all his finer nature his humanism was paralysed we thought him a poor fool and got a crude entertainment out of his antics actually he was tormenting in a flame and we thought his contortions ridiculous god help us all how are we to get at each other caged creatures as we are but this is indeed a tragic business and i don't want you to tear your hair i remained at spring grove i think four or five years a barren profitless time i remember scarcely one gleam of interest which pierced for more than a few moments the thick gloom of it the cruel dull false gods of english convention for thought it is not held me fast masters and pupils alike were jailers to me i ate and drank of their provision and can recall still with nausea the sour stale taste and still choke with the memory of the chaff and grit of its quality accursed perverse generation god forbid that any child of mine should suffer as i suffered starve as i starved stray where i was driven to stray the english boarding school system is that of the straw yard where colts are broken by routine and again of the farmyard where pups are walked drill in school laissez faire out of it it is at once too dull and too indolent to recognise character or even to look for it it recks nothing of early development or late it measures young humanity for its class rooms like a tailor with the yard measure the discipline of boy over boy is as might be expected brutal or bestial the school yard is taken for the world in small and so allowed to be there is no thought taken or at least betrayed that it is nothing more than a preparation for the world at large there is no reason however to suppose that the international college was worse than any other large boarding school i fancy indeed that it was in all points like the rest there were no traces in my time of the brotherhood of man about it a few portuguese a negro or two were there and a multitude of jews but i fancy i should have found the same sort of thing at eton i was not in any sense suited to such a place as this if i had been sent to travel it had been better for me i was difficult not because i was stiff but because i was lax i resisted nothing except by inertia if my parents did not know me and how should they if i did not know myself and i did not my masters for their part made no attempt to know me nor even inquired whether there might be anything to know i was unpopular as might have been expected made no friends did no good my brother on the other hand was an ideal schoolboy diligent brisk lovable abounding in friendships good at his work and excellent at his play his career at spring grove was one long happy triumph and he deserved it he has a charming nature and is one of the few naturally holy persons i know wholesome thank god we all are or could be pious we nearly all are but holiness is a rare quality if i were to try and set down here the really happy memories which i have of spring grove they would be three the first was the revelation of greece which was afforded me by homer and plato the surging music and tremendous themes of the poet the sweet persuasion of the sophist were a wonder and delight i remember even now the thrill with which i heard my form master translate for us the prayer with which the phaedrus closes beloved pan and all ye other gods who haunt this place beloved pan my knowledge of pan was of the vaguest and yet more than once or twice did i utter that prayer wandering alone the playing field or watching the evening mist roll down the thames valley and blot up the elm trees thick and white clinging to the day like a fleece the third iliad again i have never forgotten nor the twenty fourth nor the picture of the two gods like vulture birds watching the battle from the dead tree nor again do i ever fail to recapture the beat of the heart with which i apprehended some of homer's phrases sandy pylos argos the pasture land of horses or clear seen ithaca these things happened upon by chance in the dusty class room in the close air of that terrible hour from two to three were as the opening of shutters to the soul revealing blue distances dim fields or the snowy peaks of mountains in the sun one seemed to lift one could forget it lasted but an instant but time is of no account to the inner soul of no more account than it is to god i have never forgotten these moments of escape nor can i leave homer without confessing that his books became my bible i accepted his theology implicitly i swallowed it whole the godhead of the olympians the lesser divinity of thetis and alpheios and xanthos were indisputable they were infinitely more real to me than the deities of my own land and though i have found room for these later on in life it has not been by displacing the others nor is there any need for that so far as i see i say that out of homer i took his gods i add that i took them instantly i seemed to breathe the air of their breath they appealed to my reason i knew that they had existed and did still exist i was not shocked or shaken in my faith either by anything i read about them young as i was and insipient i was prepared for what is called the burlesque olympus of the iliad so grievous to professor murray i think i recognised then what seems perfectly plain to me now that you might as well think meanly of a god of africa because the natives make him of a cocoanut on a stick as of zeus and hera because homer says that they played peccant husband and jealous wife if homer halted it is rash to assume that hephaistos did the pathetic fallacy has crept in here mythology was one of the few subjects i diligently read at school and all i got out of it was pure profit for i realised that the gods' world was not ours and that when their natures came in conflict with ours some such interpretation must always be put upon their victory we have a moral law for our mutual wellbeing which they have not we translate their deeds in terms of that law of ours and it certainly appears like a standing fact of nature that when the beings of one order come into commerce with those of another the result will be tragic there is only a harmony in acquiescence and the way to that is one of blood and tears brooding over all this i discerned dimly even in that dusty brawling place and time showed me more and more clearly that i had always been aware of the gods and conscious of their omnipresence it seemed plain to me that zeus whose haunt is dark dodona lorded it over the english skies and was to be heard in the thunder crashing over the elms of middlesex i knew athene in the shrill wind which battled through the vanes and chimneys of our schoolhouse artemis was lady of my country by apollo's light might i too come to be led poseidon of the dark locks girdled my native seas i had had good reason to know the awfulness of pan and guessed that some day i should couch with kore the pale queen i called them by these names since these names expressed to me their essence you may call them what you will and so might i for i had not then reasoned with myself about names by their names i knew them the gods were there indeed ignorantly worshipped by all and sundry then the dryad of my earlier experience came up again and i saw that she stood in such a relation to the gods as i did perhaps to the queen of england that she no less than they was part of a wonderful order and the visible expression of the spirit of some natural fact but whether above all the gods and nations of men and beasts there were one god and father of us all whether all nature were one vast synthesis of spirit having innumerable appearance but one soul i did not then stay to inquire and am not now prepared to say i don't mean by that at all that i don't believe it i do believe it but by an act of religion for there are states of the individual mind states of impersonal soul in which this belief is a positive truth in the which one exults madly or by it is humbled to the dust religion to my mind is the result of this consciousness of kinship with the principle of life all the emotion and moral uplifting involved in this tremendous certainty and all the lore gathered and massed about it this is religion young as i was at the time i now speak of ignorant and dumb as i was i had my moments of exultation and humility moments so wild that i was transported out of myself i left my body supine in its narrow bed and soared above the stars at such times in an aether so deep that the blue of it looked like water i seemed to see the gods themselves a shining row of them upon the battlements of heaven i called heaven olympus and conceived of olympus as a towered city upon a white hill looming up out of the deep blue arch it was vast and covered the whole plateau i saw the walls of it run up and down the ridges in and out of the gorges which cut into the mass it had gates but i never saw forms of any who entered or left it it was full of light and had the look of habitancy about it but i saw no folk only at rare moments of time while i hovered afar off looking at the wonder and radiance of it the gods appeared above the battlements in a shining row still and awful each of them ten feet high these were fine dreams for a boy of sixteen in a schoolhouse dormitory they were mine though but i dreamed them awake i awoke before they began always and used to sit up trembling and wait for them an apologue if you please on the sacred road from athens to eleusis about midway of its course and just beyond the pass there is a fork in it and a stony path branches off and leads up into the hills there in the rock is a shallow cave and before that where once was an altar of aphrodite the ruins of her shrine and precinct may be seen as i was going to eleusis the other day i stopped the carriage to visit the place now beside the cave is a niche cut square in the face of the rock for offerings and in that niche i found a fresh bunch of field flowers put there by i know not what dusty foot wayfarer that was no longer ago than last may and the man who did the piety was a christian i suppose so do i avow myself without derogation i hope to the profession for no more than mr robert kirk a minister of religion in scotland in the seventeenth century do i consider that a knowledge of the gods is incompatible with belief in god there is a fine distinction for you i believe that god exists i infer him by reason stimulated by desire but i know that the gods exist by other means than those if i could be as sure of god as i am of the gods i might perhaps be a better christian but i should not believe any less in the gods i found religion through homer i found poetry through milton whose comus we had to read for examination by some learned board if any one thing definitely committed me to poesy it was that poem and as has nearly always happened to me the crisis of discovery came in a flash we were all there ranked at our inky desks on some drowsy afternoon the books lay open before us the lesson i suppose prepared but what followed had not been prepared that some one began to read the star that bids the shepherd fold now the top of heav'n doth hold and the gilded car of day his glowing axle doth allay in the steep atlantic stream and immediately in a moment in the twinkling of an eye it was changed for me from verse to poetry that is from a jingle to a significant fact it was more than it appeared it was transfigured its implication was manifest that's all i can say except this that untried as i was i jumped into the poetic skin of the thing and felt as if i had written it i knew all about it e'l chi e'l quale i was privy to its intricacy i caught without instruction the alternating beat in the second line and savoured all the good words gilded car glowing axle star that bids the shepherd fold allay ravished me young as i was i knew why he had called the atlantic stream steep and remembered homer's greek stugos hudatos aipa rheethra good soul our pedagogue suggested deep i remember to this hour the sinking of the heart with which i heard him but the flash passed and darkness again gathered about me the normal darkness of those hateful days sabrina fair lifted it my sky showed me an amber shaft i am recording moments the reader will remember the few gleams which visited me in youth i was far from the time when i could connect them see that poetry was the vesture of religion the woven garment whereby we see god love had to teach me that i was not born until i loved my third happy memory is of a brief and idyllic attachment very fervent very romantic entirely my own and as i remember it now entirely beautiful nothing remains but the fragrance of it and its dream like quality the sense i have of straying with the beloved through a fair country such things assure me that i was not wholly dead during those crushing years of servitude but those are as i say gleams out of the dark they comfort me with the thought that the better part of me was not dead but buried here with the worse they point also to the truth as i take it to be that the lack of privacy is one of the most serious detriments of public school life i don't say that privacy is good for all boys or that it is good for any unless they are provided with a pursuit it is true that many boys seek to be private that they may be vicious and that the having the opportunity for privacy leads to vice but that is nearly always the fault of the masters vice is due to the need for mental or material excitement it is a crude substitute for romance if a boy is debarred from good romance because he doesn't feel it or hasn't been taught to feel it he will take to bad it is nothing else at all he is bored and remembering that a boy can only think of one thing at a time the single aim of the master should be to give every boy in his charge some sane interest which he can pursue to the death as a terrier chases a smell in and out up and down every nerve bent and quivering there is a problem of the teaching art which the college at spring grove made no attempt to solve while i was there you either played football and cricket or you were negligible i was bad at both was negligible and neglected i suspect that my experiences are very much those of other people and that is why i have taken the trouble to articulate them and perhaps to make them out more coherent than they were we don't feel in images or think in words the images are about us the words may be at hand but it may well be that we are better without them this world is a tight fit and life in it as the duke said of one day of his own life is a devilish close run thing if the blessed gods and the legions of the half gods in their habit as they live were to be as clear to us as our neighbour tom or our chief at the office what might be the lot of tom's wife or what the security of our high stool at the desk as things are our blank misgivings are put down to nerves our yearning for wings to original sin the policeman at the street corner sees to it for our good that we put out of sight these things and so we grow rich and make a good appearance it is only when we are well on in years that we can afford to be precise and looking back to remember the celestial light the glory and the freshness of the dream in which we walked and bathed ourselves the soul at the window when i had been in london a year or two and the place with its hordes was become less strange and less formidable to me i began to discover it for myself gradually the towering cliffs resolved themselves into houses and the houses into shrouded holds each with character and each hiding a mystery they now stood solitary which had before been an agglutinated mass childe roland to the dark tower came i knew one from the other by sight and had for each a specific sensation of attraction or repulsion of affection or terror i read through the shut doors i saw through the blank windows not a house upon my daily road but held a drama or promised a tragedy i had no sense for comedy in those days life to me waking life was always a dreadful thing and sometimes my bodily eyes had glimpses which confirmed my fancy unexpected sudden and vivid flashes behind curtained windows i once saw two men fighting shadowed black upon a white blind i once looked out of a window at the army and navy stores into a mean bedroom across the way there was a maidservant in there making beds emptying slops tidying this and that quite suddenly she threw her head up with a real despair and next moment she was on her knees by the bed praying i never saw prayer like that in this country the soul went streaming from her mouth like blown smoke and again one night very late i was going to bed and leaned out of my window for air before me across back yards leafless trees and a litter of packing cases and straw rose up a dark rampart of houses in the midst of it a lit window i saw a poorly furnished sitting room a table with a sewing machine a paraffin lamp a chair with an antimacassar a man in his shirt sleeves sat there by the table smoking a pipe then the door opened and a tall slim woman came in all in white with loose dark hair floating about her shoulders she stood between door and table and rested her hand upon the edge of the table the man after a while of continuing to read quite suddenly looked up and saw her they looked at each other motionless he cast down his paper sprang up and went to her he fell to his knees before her and clasped hers she looked across gravely considering then laid her hand upon his head that was all i saw no more husband and wife mother and son sinner and saviour what do i know as with the houses homes of mystery so with the men and women one passed homes they too of things hidden yet more deep the noise of the streets at first paralysing died down to a familiar rumble and the ear began to distinguish voices in the tide sounds of crying calls for help hailings laughter tears separated themselves and appealed you heard them like the cries of the drowning drifting by you upon a dark tide way you could do nothing a word would have broken the spell the mask which is always over the face would have covered the tongue or throttled the larynx you could do nothing but hear finally the passing faces became sometimes penetrable betrayed by some chance gleam of the eyes some flicker of the lips a secret to be shared or conveyed by a hint some stabbing message out of the deep into the deep that is what i mean by the soul at the window every one of us lives in a guarded house door shut windows curtained now and then however you look up above the street level and catch a glimpse of the scared prisoner inside he may be a satyr a fairy an ape or an angel he's a prisoner anyhow who sometimes comes to the window and looks strangely out you may see him there by chance saying to himself like chaucer's creseyde in the temple ascaunces what may i not stonden here and i found out for myself that there is scarcely a man or woman alive who does not hold such a tenant more or less deeply within his house sometimes the walls of the house are transparent like a frog's foot and you see the prisoner throbbing and quivering inside this is rare shelley's house must have been a filmy tenement of the kind with children if you catch them young enough it is more common i remember one whom i used to see nearly every day the child of poor parents who kept a green grocer's shop in judd street saint pancras a still little creature moving about in worlds not recognised she was slim and small fair haired honey coloured her eyes wells of blue i used to see her standing at the door of the shop amid baskets of green stuff crimsoned rhubarb pyramided dates and what not i never saw her dirty or untidy nor heard her speak nor saw her laugh she stood or leaned at the lintel watching i know not what but certainly not anything really there as we say she appeared to be looking through objects rather than at them i can describe it no otherwise than that i or another crossed her field of vision and was conscious that her eyes met mine and yet did not see me to me she was instantly remarkable not for this and not for any beauty she had for she was not at all extraordinary in that quality but for this that she was not of our kind surrounded by other children playing gaily circling about her she was sui generis she carried her own atmosphere whereby in the company of others she seemed unaccountable by herself only normal nature she fitted perfectly but us she did not fit now it is a curious thing accepted by all visionaries that a supernatural being a spirit fairy not human creature if you see it among animals beasts and birds on hills or in the folds of hills among trees by waters in fields of flowers looks at home and evidently is so the beasts are conscious of it know it and have no fear of it the hills and valleys are its familiar places in a way which they will never be to the likes of us but put a man beside it and it becomes at once supernatural i have seen spirits beings whatever they may be in empty space and have observed them as part of the landscape no more extraordinary than grazing cattle or wheeling plover again i have seen a place thick with them as thick as a london square in a snow storm and a man walk clean through them unaware of their existence and make them by that act a mockery of the senses so precisely it was with this strange child unreal to me when she was real to everybody else she had a name a niche in the waking world marks greengrocer was the inscription of the shop she was elsie marks her father was a stout florid man of maybe fifty years with a chin beard and light blue eyes good humoured he seemed and prosperous something of a ready wit a respected and respectable man who stamped his way about the solid ground in a way which defied dreams if i had been experienced i should have remarked the mother but in fact i barely remember her though i spoke with her one day she was somewhat heavy and grave i think downcast and yet watchful she did her business efficiently without enthusiasm and did not enter into general conversation with her customers her husband did that part of the business marks was a merry jew i bought oranges of her once for the sake of hearing her speak and while she was serving me the child came into the shop and stood by her she leaned against her rather than stood took the woman's disengaged arm and put it round her neck looks passed between them the mother's sharply down the child's searchingly up on either side there was pain as if each tried to read the other i was very shy with strangers the more i wanted to get on terms with them the less i was able to do it i asked the child whether she liked oranges i asked the child but the mother answered me measuring her words she likes nothing of ours it's we that like and she that takes that was her reply i am sure that she likes you at any rate i said her hold on the child tightened as if to prevent an escape she should since i bore her but she has much to forgive me such a word left me dumb i was not then able to meet women on such terms nor did i then understand her as i do now here is another case there was a slatternly young woman whom i caught or who caught me unawares who suddenly threw open the windows and showed me things i had never dreamed opposite the chambers in r buildings where i worked or was intended to work and across a wall there was a row of tenements called if i remember gaylord's rents part mews part warehouses and all disreputable the upper story of it as it showed itself to me over the wall held some of the frowsiest of london's horde exactly before my eyes was one of the lowest of these hovels the upper part of a stable i imagine since it had instead of a window a door of which half was always shut and half always open so that light might get in or the tenants lean out to take the air here and so leaning her bare elbows i saw on most days of the week a slim young woman airing herself a pale faced curling papered half bodiced unwashed drab of a girl who would have had shame written across her for any one to read if she had not seemed of all women i have ever seen the least shamefaced her brows were as unwritten as a child's her smile as pure as a seraph's and her eyes blue unfaltering and candid she laughed a greeting exchanged gossip did her sewing watched events as the case might be was not conscious of her servitude or anxious to market it sometimes she shared her outlook with an old woman a horrible greasy go between with straggling grey hair and a gin inflamed face she chatted with this beldame happily she cupped her vile old dewlap or stroked her dishonourable head sometimes a man in shirt sleeves was with her treated her familiarly with rude embraces with kisses nudges and leers she accepted all with good humour and really complete good breeding she invited nothing provoked nothing but resented nothing it seemed to me as if all these things were indeed nothing to her that she hardly knew that they were done as if her soul could render them at their proper worth transmute them sherd them off discard them it was then her surface which took them what her soul received was a distillation an essence then one night i had all made plain she entranced me on a summer night of stillness under a full yellow moon i was working late till past ten past eleven o'clock and looking out of my open window suddenly was aware of her at hers the shutter was down both wings of it and she stood hovering seen at full length above the street she could this be she it was so indeed but she was transfigured illuminated from within she rayed forth light the moon shone full upon her and revealed her pure form from head to foot swathed in filmy blue a pale green blue the colour of ocean water seen from below translucent webbery whatever it was it showed her beneath it as bare as venus was when she fared forth unblemished from the sea her pale yellow hair was coiled above her head her face looked mild and radiant with a health few londoners know her head was bent in a considering way she stood as one who is about to plunge into deep water and stands hesitating at the shock once or twice she turned her face up to bathe it in the light i saw that in it which in human faces i had never seen communion with things hidden from men secret knowledge shared with secret beings assurance of power above our hopes breathless i watched her the drab of my daily observation radiant now then as i watched she stretched out her arms and bent them together like a shield so that her burning face was hidden from me and without falter or fury launched herself into the air and dropt slowly down out of my sight exactly so she did it as we may see a pigeon or chough high on the verge of a sea cliff float out into the blue leagues of the air and drift motionless and light or descend to the sea less by gravity than at will so did she there was nothing premeditated there was nothing determined on mood was immediately translated into ability she was at will lighter or heavier than the air it was so done that here was no shock at all she in herself foreshadowed the power she had rather it would have been strange to me if irradiated transplendent as she was she had not considered her freedom and on the instant indulged it i accepted her upon her face value without question i did not run out to spy upon her ecce unus fortior me in this case being still new to the life into which i was gradually being drawn it did not for one moment occur to me to start an adventure of my own i might have accosted the woman who was as the saying goes anybody's familiar or i might have spied for another excursion of her spirit and with all preparation made have followed her but i did neither of these things at the time i saw her next day leaning bare elbowed on the ledge of her half door her hair in curl papers her face the pale unwholesome pinched oval of most london women of her class her bodice was pinned across her chest she was coarse aproned new from the wash tub or the grate not a sign upon her but told of her frowsy round the stale air of foul lodgment was upon her i found out indeed this much about her ostensible state that she was the wife of a cab driver whose name was ventris he was an ill conditioned sottish fellow who treated her badly but had given her a child but he was chiefly on night work at euston and the man whom i had seen familiar with her in the daytime was not he her reputation among her neighbours was not good she was in fact no better than she should be or as i prefer to put it no better than she could be yet i knew her withal as of the fairy kind bound to this earth bondage by some law of the universe not yet explored not pitiable because not self pitying and what is more important not reprehensible because impossible to be bound as we are soul to body i know that now but did not know it then and yet extraordinary thing i was never shocked by the contrast between her two states of being this is to me a clear and certain evidence of their reality just as it is evidence to me that when at ten years old i seemed to see the boy in the wood i really did see him an hallucination or a dream upsets your moral balance the things impressed upon you are abnormal and the abnormal disturbs you now these apparitions did not seem abnormal i saw nothing wonderful in mrs ventris's act i was impressed by it i was excited by it as i still am by a convulsion of nature a thunder storm in the alps for instance a water spout at sea such things hold beauty and terror they entrance they appal but they never shock they happen and they are right i have not seen what people call a ghost and i have often been afraid lest i should see one but i know very well that if ever i did i should have no fear i know very well that a natural fact impresses its conformity with law upon you first and last it becomes on the moment of its appearance a part of the landscape if it does not it is an hallucination or a freak of the imagination and will shock you i have much more extraordinary experiences than this to relate but there will be nothing shocking in these pages at least nothing which gave me the least sensation of shock one of them a thing extraordinary to all must occupy a chapter by itself i cannot precisely fit a date to it though i shall try and as it forms a whole having a beginning a middle and an end i shall want to depart from my autobiographical plan and put it in as a whole the reader will please to recollect that it did not work itself out in my consciousness by a flash the first stages of it came so in flashes of revelation but the conclusion was of some years later when i was older and more established in the world but before i embark upon it i should like to make a large jump forward and finish with the young woman of gaylord's rents it was by accident that i happened upon her at her mysteries at a later day when i was living in london in camden town by that time i had developed from a lad of inarticulate mind and unexpressed desires into a sentient and self conscious being i was more or less of a man not only adventurous but bold in the pursuit of adventure i lived for some two or three years in that sorry quarter of london in complete solitude in poverty total idleness and the pride of literature like doctor johnson for though i wrote little i read much and though i wrote little i was most conscious that i was about to write much it was a period of brooding of mewing my youth and whatever facility of imagination and expression i have since attained i owe very much to my hermitage in albert street if i walked in those days it was by night london at night is a very different place from the town of business and pleasure of ordinary acquaintance during the day i fulfilled my allotted hours at the desk but immediately they were over i returned to my lodgings got out my books and sat enthralled until somewhere near midnight but then instead of going to bed i was called by the night and forth i sallied all agog i walked the city the embankment skirted the parks unless i were so fortunate as to slip in before gate shutting often i was able to remain in kensington gardens till the opening hour highgate and its woods parliament hill with its splendid panorama of twinkling beacons and its noble tent of stars were great fields for me hampstead heath wimbledon even richmond and bushey have known me at their most secret hour such experiences as i have had of the preternatural will find their place in this book but not their chronological place for the simple reason that as i kept no diary i cannot remember in what order of time they befell me but it was on the southern slope of parliament hill that i came again upon the fairy woman of gaylord's rents i was there at midnight a mild radiant night of late april there were sheep at graze there for though it was darkish under the three quarter moon i was used to the dark and could see them a woolly mass quietly feeding close together i saw no shepherd anywhere but i remember that his dog sat on his haunches apart watching them he was prick eared bright eyed he grinned and panted intensely i didn't then know why he was so excited but very soon i did i became aware gradually that a woman stood among the sheep she had not been there when i first saw them i am sure nor did i see her approach them or enter their school yet there she was in the midst of them seen now by me as she had evidently been seen for some time by the dog seen i suppose by the sheep at any rate she stood in the midst of them as i say with her hand actually upon the shoulder of one of them but not feared or doubted by any soul of us the dog was vividly interested but did not budge the sheep went on feeding i stood bolt upright watching i knew her the moment i saw her she was the exquisitely formed slim and glowing creature i had seen before when she launched herself into the night as a god of homer hermes or thetis launched out from olympus' top into the sea greek ex aitheros empese ponto and words fail me to describe the perfection of her being a radiant simulacrum of our own the inconscient self sufficiency the buoyancy and freedom which she showed me you may sometimes see boys at their maddest tip of expectation stand waiting as she now stood quivering on the extreme edge of adventure yet even in their case there is a consciousness of well being a kind of rolling of anticipation upon the palate a getting of the flavours beforehand that involves a certain dissipation of activity but here all was concentrated the whole nature of the creature was strung to one issue only to that point when she could fling headlong into activity an activity in which every fibre and faculty would be used a comparison of the fairy kind with human beings is never successful because into our images of human beings we always import self consciousness they know what they are doing fairies do not but wait a moment there is a reason human creatures i think know what they are doing only too well because performance never agrees with desire they know what they are doing because it is never exactly what they meant to do or what they wanted to do now with fairies desire to do and performance are instinctive and simultaneous if they think they think in action in this they are far more like animals than human creatures although the form in which they appear to us their shape and colouring are like ours enhanced and refined here now stood this creature in the semblance of a woman glorified quivering and so perched high on his haunches sat the shepherd's dog and no one could look at the two and not see their kinship arriere pensee they had none and all's said in that they were shameless and we are full of shame there's the difference and it is a gulf after a while of this quivering suspense she gave a low call a long mellow and tremulous cry which gentle as it was startled by its suddenness as the unexpected call of a water fowl out of the reeds of a pond makes the heart jump toward the throat it was like some bird's call but i know of no bird's with which to get a close comparison it had the soft quality soft yet piercing of a redshank's but it shuddered like an owl's and she held it on as an owl does but it was very musical soft and open throated and carried far it was answered from a distance first by a single voice but then another took it up and another and then another slowly so the soft night was filled with musical cries which quavered about me as fitfully as fire flies gleam and glance in all quarters of a garden of olive trees it was enchantment to the ear a ravishing sound but it was my eyes which claimed me now for soon i saw them coming from all quarters or rather i saw them there for i can't say definitely that i saw any one of them on the way it is truer to say that i looked and they were there where had been one were now two now two were five now five were a company now the company was a host i have no idea how many there were of them at any time but when they joined hands and set to whirling in a ring they seemed to me to stretch round parliament hill in an endless chain how can i be particular about them they were of both sexes that was put beyond doubt they were garbed as the first of them in something translucent and grey it had been quite easy in the lamplight to see the bare form of the woman whom i first saw in gaylord's rents it was plain to me that her companions were in the same kind of dress i don't think they had girdles i think their arms and legs were bare i should describe the garment as a sleeveless smock to the knees or perhaps more justly as a sack of silky gauze with a hole for the head and two for the arms that was the effect of it it hung straight and took the folds natural to it it was so light that it clung closely to the body where it met the air what it was made of i have no notion but it was transparent or nearly so i am pretty sure that its own colour was grey they greeted each other they flitted about from group to group greeting and they greeted by touching sometimes with their hands sometimes with their cheeks they neither kissed nor spoke i never saw them kiss even when they loved which they rarely did i saw one greeting between two females they ran together and stopped short within touching distance they looked brightly and intently at each other and leaning forward approached their cheeks till they touched they touched by the right they touched by the left then they took hands and drew together by a charming movement of confidence one nestled to the side of the other and resting her head looked up and laughed the taller embraced her with her arm and held her for a moment the swiftness of the act and its grace were beautiful to see then hand in hand they ran to others who were a little further off the elder and taller had a wild dark face with stern lips like a man's the younger was a beautiful little creature with quick squirrel's motions i remember her hair which looked white in that light but was no doubt lint colour it was extremely long and so fine that it clung to her shoulders and back like a web of thin silk footnote i argue from this peculiar manner of greeting which i have observed several times that these beings converse by contact as dogs cats mice and other creatures certainly do i don't say that they have no other means of converse but i am sure i am exact in saying that they have no articulate speech they began to play very soon with a zest for mere irresponsible movement which i have never seen in my own kind i have seen young foxes playing and it was something like that only incomparably more graceful greyhounds give a better comparison where the rippling of the body is more expressive of their speed than the flying of their feet these creatures must have touched the earth but their bodies also ran and just as young dogs play for the sake of activity without method or purpose so did these and just as with young animals the sexes mingle without any hint of sexuality so did these if there was love making i saw nothing of it there they met on exact equality so far as i could judge the male not desirous the female not conscious of being desired but it was a mad business under the cloudy moon it had a dream like element of riot and wild triumph i suppose i must have been there for two or three hours during all which time their swift play was never altogether stopped there were interludes to be seen when some three or four grew suddenly tired and fell out they threw themselves down on the sward and lay panting beaming watching the others or they disappeared into the dark and were lost in the thickets which dot the ground then finally i saw the great whirling ring of them form under what common impulse to frenzy i cannot divine there was no signal no preparation but as if fired in unison they joined hands and spreading out to a circumference so wide that i could distinguish nothing but a ring of light they whirled faster and faster till the speed of them sang in my ears like harps and whirling so melted away later on and in wilder surroundings than this i saw and shall relate in its place a dance of oreads it differed in detail from this one but not i think in any essential this was my first experience of the kind quidnunc i was so fired by that extraordinary adventure that i think i could have overcome my constitutional timidity and made myself acquainted with the only actor in it who was accessible if i had not become involved in another matter of the sort but i don't know that i should have helped myself thereby to the night the things of the night pertain if i could have had speech with mrs ventris in that season of her radiancy there would have been no harm but by day she was another creature thereby contact was impossible because it would have been horrible it is true that a certain candour of conduct distinguished her from the frowsy drabs with whom she must have jostled in public house bars or rubbed elbows at lodging house doors a sort of unconsciousness of evil which i take to have been due to an entire absence of a moral sense it is probable that she was not a miserable sinner because she did not know what was miserable sin heat and cold she knew hunger and thirst rage and kindness she could not be unwomanly because she was not woman nor good because she could not be bad but i could have been very bad and to me she was luckily horrible i could not divorce her two apparent natures still less my own we are bound all of us by our natures bound by them and bounded i could not have touched the pitch she lived with the pitch of which she was without defilement let me hope that i realised that much i shall not say how my feet burned to enter that slum of squalor where hovered this bird of the night unless i add as i can do with truth that i did not slake them there i saw her on and off afterward for a year perhaps but tenancies are short in london there was a flitting during one autumn when i was away on vacation and i came back to see new faces in the half doorway and other elbows on the familiar ledge but as i have said above a new affair engrossed me shortly after my night pageant on parliament hill this was concerned with a famous personage whom all knowing london though i for one had not known it called quidnunc but before i present to the curious reader the facts of a case which caused so much commotion in distinguished bosoms of the late eighties i think i should say that while i have a strong conviction as to the identity of the person himself i shall not express it i accept the doctrine that there are some names not to be uttered similarly i shall neither defend nor extenuate if i throw it out at all it will be as a hint to the judicious or a clew if you like to those who are groping a way in or out of the labyrinth of being to me two things are especially absurd one is that the trousered or skirted forms we eat with walk with or pass unheeded are all the population of our world the other that these creatures ostensibly men or women with fancies hopes fears appetites like our own are necessarily of the same nature as ourselves if beings from another sphere should by intention or chance meet and mingle with us i don't see how we could apprehend them at all except in our own mode or unless they were so to speak translated into our idiom but enough of that the year in which i first met quidnunc so far as my memory serves me was i was in those days a student of the law with chambers in gray's inn which i daily attended but being more interested in palaeography than in modern practice and intending to make that my particular branch of effort i spent much of my time at the public record office indeed a portion of every working day the track between r buildings and rolls yard must have been sensibly thinned by my foot soles there can have been few of the frequenters of chancery lane bedford row and the squares of gray's inn who were not known to me by sight or concerning whom i had not imagined or discerned circumstances invisible to their friends or themselves to account for their acts or appearances among these innumerable personages portly solicitors dashing clerks scriveners racing tipsters match sellers postmen young ladies of business young ladies of pleasure clients descending out of broughams clients keeping rendezvous in public houses and what not quidnunc's may well have been one but i believe that it was in warwick court that passage from holborn into the inn that quite suddenly i first saw him or became aware that i saw him for being as he was to all appearance an ordinary telegraphic messenger i may have passed him daily for a year without any kind of notice but on a day in the early spring of mid april at a guess i came upon him in such a way as to remark him incurably i saw before me on that morning of tender leafage of pale sunlight and blue mist contending for the day a strangely assorted pair proceeding slowly toward the inn a telegraph boy was one by his side walked vehemently explaining a tall elderly solicitor white whiskered drab spatted frock coated eye glassed silk hatted in every detail the trusted family lawyer i knew the man by sight and i knew him by name and repute he was let me say for i withhold his real name george lumley fowkes of fowkes vizard and fowkes respectable head of a more than respectable firm and here he was with his hat pushed back from his dewy forehead tip toeing protesting extenuating to a slip of a lad in uniform the positions of the odd pair were unaccountably reversed jack was better than his master the deference was from the elder to the brat the stoop of fowkes's shoulder the anxious angle of his head his care to listen to the little he got and how little that was i could not but observe his frequent ejaculations of god bless my soul his deep concern and the boy's unconcern curtly expressed if expressed at all all this was singular so much more than singular was it to myself that it enthralled me they stopped at the gateway which admits you to bedford row to finish their colloquy the halt was made by fowkes barely acquiesced in by his companion poor old fowkes what with his asthma the mopping of his head the flacking of his long fingers exhibited signals of the highest distress i need hardly assure you sir i heard and then believe me sir when i say he was marking time unhappy gentleman for with such phrases does the orator eke out his waning substance the lad listened in a critical staring mood and once or twice nodded while i was wondering how long he was going to put up with it presently he jerked his head back and showed fowkes by the look he gave him that he had had enough of him the old lawyer knew it for final for he straightened his back then his hat touched the brim and made a formal bow i leave it so sir he said i am content to leave it so and then with every mark of respect he went his way into bedford row i noticed that he walked on tiptoe for some yards and then more quickly flapping his arms to his sides the boy stood thoughtful where he was communing by the looks of him quite otherwhere and i had the opportunity to consider him he appeared to be a handsome well built lad of fifteen or so big for his age and precocious by that i mean that his scrutiny of life was mature that he looked capable far beyond the warrant of his years he was ruddy of complexion freckled and had a square chin his eyes were light grey with dark lashes to them they were startlingly light and bright for such a sunburnt face and seemed to glow in it like steady fires it was in them that resided that sat as it were enthroned that mature masterful expression which i never saw before or since in one so young i have seen the eyes of children look as if they were searching through our world into another that is almost habitual in children but here was one apparently a boy who seemed to read into our circumstances as you or i into a well studied book as though they held nothing inexplicable nothing unaccounted for beyond these singular two eyes of his his smiling mouth with its reminder of archaic statuary was perhaps his only noticeable feature he wore the ordinary uniform of a telegraphic messenger which in those days was grey with a red line down the trousers and a belt for the tunic his boots were of the service pattern so were his ankle jacks his hands were not cleaner than they ought to have been his nails well bitten back such was he studying him closely over the top of my newspaper by and by he fixed me with his intent bright eyes my heart beat quicker but when he smiled like the pallas of aegina i smiled too then without varying his expression even while he smiled upon me he vanished vanished there's no other word for it he vanished i did not see him go i don't know whether he went or where he went at one moment he was there smiling at me looking into my eyes at the next moment he was not there that's all there is to say about it i flashed a glance through the gate into bedford row another up to r buildings and even ran to the corner which showed me the length and breadth of field place he was not gone any of these ways these things are certain now for the sequel mere fortune led me at four that afternoon into bedford row a note had been put into my hands at the record office inviting me to call upon a client whose chambers were in that quarter and i complied with it directly my work was over now as i walked along the row the boy of that morning's encounter was going into the entry of the house in which fowkes and vizards have their offices i had just time to recognise him when the double knock announced his errand i stopped immediately he delivered in a telegram and came out i was on the step whether he knew me or not he did not look his knowledge his eyes went through me his smiling mouth did not smile at me my heart beat i didn't know why but i laughed and nodded he went his leisurely way and i watched him this time almost out of sight but while i stood so watching old fowkes came bursting out of his office tears streaming down his face the telegram in his hand where is he where is he this was addressed to me i pointed the way old fowkes saw his benefactor as i suppose him to have been and began to run the lad turned round saw him coming waved him away and then disappeared again he had done it but old fowkes in no way surprised stood rooted to the pavement with his hands extended so far toward the mystery that i could see two or three inches of bony old wrist beyond his shirt cuffs after a while he turned and slowly came back to his chambers he seemed now not to see me or he was careless whether i saw him or not as he entered the doorway he held up the telegram bent his head and laid a kiss upon the pink paper but that is by no means all now i come to the richborough story which all london that is as old as i am remembers that part of london it may be will not read this book or if it does will not object to the recall of a case which absorbed it in i am not going to be indiscreet the lady married and the lady left england moreover naturally i give no names but if i did i don't see that there is anything to be ashamed of in what she was pleased to do with her hand and person it was startling to us of those days it might be startling in these what was more than startling was the manner in which the thing was done that is known to very few persons indeed i had seen enough upon that april day whose events form my prelude to give me remembrance of the handsome telegraph boy the next time i saw him which was near midnight in july the place hyde park i knew him at once i had been sharing in prince's gate with a dull company an interminable dinner one of those at which you eat twice as much as you intend or desire because there is really nothing else to do on one side of me i had had a dowager whom i entirely failed to interest on the other a young person who only cared to talk with her left hand neighbour there was a reception afterward to which i had to stop so that i could not make my escape till eleven or more the night was very hot and it had been raining but such air as there was was balm after the still furnace of the rooms i decided immediately to walk to my lodging in camden town entered by prince's gate crossed the serpentine bridge and took a bee line for the marble arch it was cloudy but not at all dark i could see all the ankle high railings which beset the unwary passenger and may at any moment break his legs and his nose imperil his dignity and ruin his hat dimly ahead of me upon a broad stretch of grass i presently became aware of a concourse there was no sound to go by and the light afforded me no definite forms the luminous haze was blurred but certainly people were there a multitude of people i was surprised but not alarmed save for an occasional wastrel of civilisation incapable of degradation and concerned only for sleep the park is wont to be a desert at that hour but the hum of the traffic the flashing cab lamps never quite out of sight prevent fear far from being afraid i was highly interested and hastening my steps was soon on the outskirts of a throng a throng it certainly was a large body of persons male and female scattered yet held together by a common interest loitering and expectant strangely silent not concerned with each other rarely in couples with all their faces turned one way namely to the south east or if you want precision precisely to hyde park corner i have remarked upon the silence that was really surprising so also was the order observed and what you may call decorum there was no ribaldry no skylarking no shrill discord of laughter without mirth in it to break the solemnity of the gracious night these people just stood or squatted about if any talked together it was in secret whispers it is true that they were under the watch of a tall policeman yet he too i noticed watched nobody but looked steadily to the south east with his lantern harmless at his belt as my eyes grew used to the gloom i observed that all ranks composed the company i made out the shell jacket the waist and elongated limbs of a life guardsman the open bosom of an able seaman i happened upon a young gentleman in the crush hat and inverness of the current fashion i made certain of a woman of the pavement and of ladies of the boudoir of a hospital nurse of a greenwich pensioner of two flower girls sitting on the edge of one basket of a shoeblack i think of a costermonger and a nun others there were and more than one or two of most categories in a word there was an assembly i accosted the policeman who heard me civilly but without committing himself to my first question what was going to happen he carefully answered that he couldn't say but to my second with the irrepressible scorn of one who knows for one who wants to know he answered more frankly who are they waiting for why quidnunc mister quidnunc that's who it is him they call quidnunc so now you know in fact i did not know he had told me nothing would tell me no more and while i stood pondering the oracle i was sensible of some common movement run through the company with a thrill unite them intensify them draw them together to be one people with one faith one hope one assurance and then the nun who stood near me fell to her knees crossed herself and began to pray and not far off her a slim girl in black turned aside and covered her face with her hands a perceptible shiver of emotion a fluttering sigh such as steals over a pine wood toward dawn ran through all ranks far to the south east a speck of light now showed which grew in intensity as it came swiftly nearer and seemed presently to be a ball of vivid fire surrounded by a shroud of lit vapour again as by a common consent the crowd parted stood ranked with an open lane between the on coming flare grown intolerably bright now seemed to fade out as it resolved itself into a human figure a human figure at the entry of the lane of people there undoubtedly was a figure with so much light about him raying i thought from him that it was easy to observe his form and features out of the flame and radiant mist he grew and showed himself to me in the trim shape and semblance with the small head and alert air of a youth and such as he was in the belted tunic and peaked cap of a telegraph messenger he came smoothly down the lane formed by the obsequious throng and stood in the midst of it and looked keenly with his cold clear eyes and fixed and inscrutable smile from one expectant face to another there was no mistaking him whom all those people so eagerly awaited he was my former wonder of gray's inn the saviour of old mr fowkes but all my former wonder paled before this my latter for he stood here like some young eastern king among his slaves one hand on his hip the other at his chin his face expressionless his eyes fixed but unblinking meantime the crowd which had stretched out arms to him as he came was now seated quietly on the grass intently waiting watching for a sign they sat all those people in a wide ring about him he was in the midst a hand to his chin whether sign was made or not i saw none but after some moments of pause a figure rose erect out of the ring and hobbled toward the boy i made out an old woman an old wreck of womanhood a scant haired blue lipped ruin of what had once been woman i heard her snivel and sniff and wheeze her lord ha' mercy as she went by slippering forward on her miserable feet hugging to her wasted sides what remnant of gown she had fawning before the boy within the sphere of light that came from him if he loathed or scorned or pitied her he showed no sign if he saw her at all his fixed eyes looked beyond her if he abhorred her his nostrils did not betray him he stood like marble and suffered what followed it was strange enacting what seemed to be a proper rite she put her shaking left hand upon his right shoulder her right hand under his chin as if to cup it and then with sniffs and wailings interspersed came her petition to his merciful ears what she precisely asked of him muttering wheezing whining snivelling as she did repeating herself with her burthen of o dear o dear o dear i don't know her lost girl her fine up standing girl her nance her only one figured in it as needing mercy her oh sir i ask you kindly and oh sir for this once made me sick yet he bore with her as she ran on dribbling tears and gin in a mingled flood he bore with her heard her in silence and in the end by a look which i was not able to discover quieted and sent her shuffling back to her place so soon as she was down the life guardsman was on his feet a fine figure of a man he marched unfalteringly up stiffened saluted and then observing the ritual of hand to shoulder hand to chin spoke out his piece like the honest fellow he was spoke it aloud and without fear evenly and plainly i thought that he had got it by heart as i thought also of another person i was to hear by and by he wanted badly it seemed news of his sweetheart whom he was careful to call miss dixon she had last been heard of outside the brixton bon marche where she had been seen with a lady friend talking to two young chaps in volunteer uniform they went up the brixton road toward acre lane and miss dixon at any rate was never heard of again it was wearing him out he wasn't the man he had been and had no zest for his meals she had never written his letters to her had come back through the dead office he thought he should go out of his mind sometimes was afraid to shave not knowing what he might be after with them things if anything could be done for him he should be thankful miss dixon was very well connected and sang in a choir here he stopped saluted turned and marched away into the night i heard him pass a word or two to the policeman who turned aside and blew his nose the hospital nurse who spoke in a feverish whisper then a young woman from the piccadilly gas lamps who cried and rocked herself about followed and then to my extreme amazement two ladies with cloaks and hoods over evening gowns one of them a mrs stanhope who was known to me the taller and younger lady chaperoned by my friend i did not recognise her face was hidden by her hood i was now more than interested it seemed to me that i was in a sense implicated at any rate i felt very delicate about overhearing what was to come it is one thing to become absorbed in a ritual the like of which in mid london you can never have experienced before but quite another thing to listen to the secret desires of a friend in whose house you may have dined within the month however by whatever casuistries i might have compassed it i did remain let me hope nay let me believe of myself that if the postulant had proved to be my friend mrs shrewton stanhope herself i should either have stopped my ears or immediately retired but mrs stanhope i saw at once was no more than dame de compagnie she stood in mid ring with bent head and hands clasped before her while the graceful hooded girl approached nearer to the mysterious oracle and fulfilled the formal rites demanded of all who sought his help her ringed left hand was laid upon his right shoulder her fair right hand upheld his chin when she began to speak which she did immediately and without a tremor again i had the sensation of hearing one who had words by heart this was her burden more or less i am very unhappy about a certain person it is captain maxfield i am engaged to him and want to break it off i must do that i must indeed if i don't i shall do a more dreadful thing i do hope you will help me mrs my friend was sure that you would i do hope so i am very unhappy she had commanded her voice until the very end but as she pitied herself there came a break in it i heard her catch her breath i thought she would fall and so did mrs stanhope it was clear for she went hurriedly forward and put an arm round her waist the younger lady drooped to her shoulder mrs stanhope inclined her head to the person not a sign from him mind you and gently withdrew her charge from the ring the pair then hurried across the park in the direction of knightsbridge and left me i may admit consuming in the fire of curiosity and excitement which they had lit petitions succeeded of various interest but they seemed pale and ineffectual to me before all or nearly all of the waiting throng had been heard i saw uneasiness spread about it face turned to face head to head subtle but unmistakable movements indicated unrest then of the suddenest amid lifted hands and sighed forth prayers the youthful object of so much entreaty receiver of so many secret sorrows seemed to fade and without effort to recede i know not how else to describe his departure he backed away as it were into the dark the people were on their feet ere this sighs wailing appeals sobs adjurations broke the quietness of the night some ran stumbling after him with extended arms most of them stayed where they were watching him fade hoping against hope he emptied himself so to speak of light he faded backward diminishing himself to a luminous glow to a blur to a point of light thus he was gone the disappointed crept silently away each into silence solitude and the night and i found myself alone with the policeman now what in the name of god was all this i asked him and must have it he gave me some particulars admitting at the outset that it was a go they seem to think he said that they will get what they want out of him by wire let him bring them a wire in the morning that's the way of it anything in life from sudden death to a penn'orth of bird seed death ah i've heard 'em cringe to him for death times and again they crawl for it they must have it can't do it theirselves d'ye see no no let him do it somehow once a week during the season his season i should say because he ain't here always by no means they gets about like this and how they know where to spot him is more than i can tell you if i knew it i would but i don't nobody knows that and yet they know it sometimes he's to be found here two weeks running then it'll be the regent's park or the knoll in the green park he's had 'em all the way to hampstead before now and primrose hill's a likely place they tell me telegrams that's what he gives 'em if he's got the mind but they don't get all they want not by no means and some of 'em gets more than they want by a lot he thought then chuckled at a rather grim instance why there was old jack withers 'blue nosed jack' they calls him who works a hammersmith 'bus did you ever hear of that that was a good one if you like now you listen this jack was coming up the brompton road on his 'bus and i was on duty by the boltons and see him coming there was that young feller there too him we've just had here standing quiet by a pillar box reading a letter one foot he had in the roadway and his back to the 'bus up comes old jack pushing his horses and sees the boy gives a great howl like a tom cat 'hi you young frog spawn' he says 'out of my road' and startled the lad i see him look up at jack very steady and keep his eye on him i thought to myself 'there's something to pay on delivery my boy for this here' jack owned up to it afterwards that he felt queer but he forgot about it now if you'll believe me sir the very next morning jack was at london bridge after his second journey when up comes this boy sauntering into the yard comes up to jack and nods 'name of withers' he says 'that's me' says old jack 'thought so' he says 'telegram for you' jack takes it opens it goes all white 'good god' he says 'good god almighty my wife's dead' she'd been knocked down by a pickford that morning sure as a gun what do you think of that for a start he served spotty smith the fried eel man just the very same and lots more i could tell you about they call him quidnunc mister quidnunc too and don't you forget it there's that about him i well sir if it was to come to it that i had to lay a hand on him for something out of queer street i shouldn't know how to do it now i'm telling you a fact i shouldn't know how to do it he was not obviously telling me a fact but certainly he was much in earnest i commented upon the diversity of the company and so learned the name of my friend mrs stanhope's friend he clacked his tongue bless you he said i've seen better than to night though we did have a slap up ladyship and all that was lady emily rich that young thing was earl of richborough's family grosvenor place but we had a duchess or something here one night ah and a bishop another a lord bishop you'd never believe the tales we hear he's known to every night constable from woolwich to putney bridge and the company he gets about him you'd never believe high and low and all huddled together like so many babes in a nursing home no distinction you saw old mother misery get first look in to night my lady waited her turn like a good girl his voice sank to a whisper they tell me he's the only living soul if he is a living soul that's ever been inside the stock exchange and come out tidy he goes and comes in as he likes quite the little stranger they all know him in throgmorton street no no there's more in this than meets the eye sir he's not like you and me but it's no business of mine he don't go down in my pocket book i can tell you i keep out of his way and with reason he never did no harm to me nor shan't if i can help it quidnunc mister quidnunc he might be a herald angel for all i know i went my way home and to bed but was not done with quidnunc the next day which was the first day of the eton and harrow match i read a short paragraph in the echo headed painful scene at lord's to the effect that a lady lunching on lord richborough's drag had fainted upon the receipt of a telegram and would have fallen had she not been caught by the messenger a strongly built youth it said who thus saved what might have been a serious accident that was all but it gave me food for thought and a suspicion which saturday confirmed in a sufficiently startling way on that saturday i was at luncheon in the first avenue hotel in holborn when a man came in tendring by name whom i knew quite well we exchanged greetings and sat at our luncheon talking desultorily a clerk from his office brought in a telegram for tendring he opened it and seemed thunder struck good lord i heard him say good lord here's trouble i murmured sympathetically and then he turned to me quite beyond the range where reticence avails look here he said this is a shocking business a man i know wires to me from bow street he's been taken for forgery that's the charge and wants me to bail him out he got up as we finished and went to write his reply i turned immediately to the clerk is the boy waiting i asked he was i said excuse me tendring and ran out of the restaurant to the street door there in the street as i had suspected stood my inscrutable steady eyed smiling oracle of the night i stood meeting his look as best i might he showed no recognition of me whatsoever then as i stood there tendring came out call me a cab he told the hall porter and to quidnunc he said there's no answer i'm going at once quidnunc went away now tendring's friend i learned by the evening paper was one captain maxfield of the royal engineers he was committed for trial bail refused i may add that he got seven years so much for captain maxfield but much more for lady emily rich of whose fate i have now to tell my friend mrs shrewton stanhope was very reserved would tell me nothing even when i roundly said that i had fancied to see her in the park one evening she had the hardihood to meet my eyes with a blank denial and very plainly there was nothing to be learned from her a visit many visits to the london parks at the hour between eleven and midnight taught me no more but being by now thoroughly interested in the affairs of lady emily rich i made it my business to get a glimpse of her she was it seemed the only unmarried daughter of the large richborough family which had done so well in that sex and so badly in the other that there was not only no son but no male heir to the title that indeed expired with lady emily's father i don't really know how many daughters there were or were not most of them married prosperously one of them became a roman princess one married a mr walker an american stock jobber with a couple of millions of money another was baroness de grass de grass being a jew one became an anglican nun to the disgust i was told of her family lady emily whose engagement to the wretched maxfield was so dramatically terminated was i think the youngest of them i saw her one night toward the end of the season at the opera tendring who was with me pointed her out in a box she was dressed in black and looked very scared she hardly moved once throughout the evening and when people spoke to her seemed not to hear she was certainly a very pretty girl it may have been fancy or it may not but i could have sworn to the corner of a pinky brown envelope sticking out of the bosom of her dress i don't think i was mistaken i had a good look through the glasses she touched it shortly afterward and poked it down at the end i saw her come out a tall girl rather thin very pretty certainly but far from well her eyes haunted me they had what is called a hag ridden look and yet thought i she had got her desire of quidnunc ah but had she hear the end of the tale i say that i saw her come out that's not quite true i saw her come down the staircase and stand with her party in the crowded lobby she stood in it but not of it for her vague and shadowed eyes sought otherwhere than in those of the neat haired young man who was chattering in front of her she scanned rather the throng of people anxiously and guardedly at once as if she was looking for somebody and must not be seen to look as time wore on and the carriage delayed her nervousness increased she seemed to get paler she shut her eyes once or twice as though to relieve the strain which watching and waiting put upon them and then quite suddenly i saw that she had found what she expected i saw that her empty eyes were now filled that they held something without which they had faded out in a word i saw her look fixedly fiercely and certainly at something beyond the lobby following the direction she gave me i looked also there assuredly in the portico square smiling and assured of his will i saw quidnunc stand and his light eyes upon hers for quite a space of time such as that in which you might count fifteen deliberately those two looked at each other messages i am sure sped to and fro between them his seemed to say come i have answered you now do you answer me hers cried her hurt ah but what can i do his with their cool mastery of time and occasion you must do as i bid you there's no other way hers pleaded give me time and his told her sternly i am master of time since i made it the throng of waiting people began to surge toward the door out there in the night link boys yelled great names i heard lord richborough's carriage and saw lady emily clap her hand to her side i saw her reach the portico and stand there hastily covering her head with a black scarf i saw her sway alone there i saw her party go down the steps the next moment quidnunc flashed to her side he said nothing he did not touch her he simply looked at her intently smiling self possessed a master her face was averted i could see her tremble she bowed her head another carriage was announced the richborough coach then was gone i saw quidnunc now put his hand upon her arm she turned him her face a faint and tender smile very beautiful and touching met his own he drew her with him out of the press and into the burning dark london never saw her again i don't attempt to explain what is to me inexplicable was my policeman right when he called quidnunc a herald angel is there any substance behind the surmise that the ancient gods still sway the souls and bodies of men was quidnunc that swift remorseless smiling messenger that god of the winged feet the argeiphont who can answer these things all i have to tell you by way of an epilogue is this a curate of my acquaintance a curate of st peter's eaton square some few years after these events took his holiday in greece he went out as one of a tourist party but having more time at his disposal than was contemplated by the contracting agency he stayed on chartered a dragoman and wandered far and wide on his return he told me that he had seen lady emily rich at pherae in arcadia and that he had spoken to her he had seen her sitting on the door step of a one storied white house spinning flax she wore the costume of the peasants which he told me is very picturesque two or three half naked children tumbled about her they were beautiful as angels he said with curly golden hair and extremely light eyes he noticed that particularly and recurred to it more than once now lady emily was a dark girl with eyes so deeply blue as to be almost black my friend spoke to her he said he had seen that she recognised him in fact she bowed to him he felt that he could not disregard her mere commonplaces were exchanged she told him that her husband was away on a journey she fancied that he had been in england but she explained half laughingly that she knew very little about his affairs and was quite content to leave them to him she had her children to look after my friend was surprised that she asked no question of england or family matters but in the circumstances he added he hardly liked to refer to them she served him with bread and wine before he left her all he could say was that she appeared to be perfectly happy it is odd and perhaps it is more than odd that there was a famous temple of hermes in pherae in former times pindar i believe acclaimed it in one of his epinikean odes but i have not been able to verify the reference the secret commonwealth the interest of my matter has caused me to lose sight of myself and to fail in my account of the flight of time over my head that is however comparable with the facts which were that my attention was then become solely objective i had other things to think of than the development of my own nature i had other things to think of indeed than those which surround us all and press upon us until we become permanently printed by their contact solitary as i had ever been in mind i now became literally so by choice i became wholly absorbed in that circumambient world of being which was graciously opening itself to my perceptions how i knew not i was in a state of momentary expectation of apparitions as i went about my ostensible business i had my ears quick and my eyes wide for signs and tokens that i was surrounded by a seething and whirling invisible population of beings like ourselves but glorified yet unlike ourselves in this that what seemed entirely right because natural to them would have been in ourselves horrible the ruthlessness for instance of quidnunc as he pursued and obtained his desire had quidnunc been a human creature would have been revolting the shamelessness of the fairy wife of ventris had she been capable of shame how shameful had that been but i knew that these creatures were not human i knew that they were not under our law and so i explained everything to myself but to myself only it is not enough to explain a circumstance by negatives if quidnunc and mrs ventris were not under our law neither are the sun moon and stars neither are the apes and peacocks but all these are under some law since law is the essence of the kosmos under what law then were mrs ventris and quidnunc i burned to know that for many years of my life that knowledge was my steady desire but i had no means at hand of satisfying it reading well i did read in a fashion i read for example grimm's teutonic mythology a stout and exceedingly dull work in three volumes of a most unsatisfying kind i read other books of the same sort chiefly german dealing in etymology which i readily allow is a science of great value within its proper sphere but to grimm and his colleagues etymology seemed to me to be the contents of the casket rather than the key for grimm and his colleagues started with a prejudice that gods fairies and the rest have never existed and don't exist to them the interest of the inquiry is not what is the nature what are the laws of such beings but what is the nature of the primitive people who imagined the existence of such beings i very soon found out that grimm and his colleagues had nothing to tell me then there was another class of book that which dealt in demonology and witchcraft exemplified by a famous work called satan's invisible world discovered writers of these things may or may not have believed in witches and fairies which they classed together but in any event they believed them to be wicked the abomination of uncleanness that made them false witnesses my judgment revolted against such ridiculous assumptions here was a case you see where writers treated their subject too seriously having the pulpit cushion ever below their hand and the fear of the ordinary before their eyes grimm and his friends on the other hand took it too lightly seeing in it matter for a treatise on language i got no good out of either school and as time goes on i don't see a prospect of any adequate handling of the theme i should like to think that i myself was to be the man to expound the fairy kind candidly and methodically candidly that is without going to literature for my data and with the notion definitely out of mind that the fairy god mother ever existed but i shall never be that man for though i am candid to the point of weakness i am not to flatter myself that i have method but to whomsoever he may be that undertakes the subject i can promise that the documents await their historian and i will furnish him with a title which will indicate at a glance both the spirit of his attack and the nature of his treatise footnote the reverend robert kirk author of the secret commonwealth was a clergyman and a believer in the beings of whom his book professed to treat he found them a place in his pantheon but he knew very little about them i shall have to speak of him again i expect he is himself an object lesson though his teachings are naught the natural history of the praeternatural it should be i make him a present of that the only possible line for a sincere student god go with him whosoever he be for he will have rare qualities and rare need of them he must be cheerful without assumption respectful without tragic airs as respectable as he please in the eyes of his own law so that he finds respect in his heart also for the laws of the realm in which he is privileged to trade let him not stand as the priest in the orthodox church a looming hierophant let him avoid any rhetorical pose any hint of the grand manner above all let him not wear the smirk of the conjuror when he prepares with flourishes to whip the handkerchief away from his guinea pig here is one who condescends to reader and subject alike he would do harm all round moreover he would be a quack for he is just as much of a quack who makes little of much as he who makes much of little no let his attitude be that of the contadino in some vast church in italy who walking into the cool dark gazes round eyed at the twinkling candles ahead of him in the vague and that he may recover himself a little leans against a pillar for a while his hat against his heart and his lips muttering an ave reassured by his prayer or the peace of the great place he presently espies the sacristan about to uncover a picture not often shown here is an occasion the tourists are gathered intent upon their baedekers he tiptoes up behind them and kneels by another pillar for the pillars of a church are his friendly rocks touching which he can face the unknown the curtain is brailed up and the blue and crimson the mournful eyes the wimple the pointed chin the long idle fingers are revealed upon their golden background while the girls flock about papa with his book and mamma wonders where we shall have luncheon annibale assured familiar of heaven beatified at no expense to himself settles down to a quiet talk with the mother of god his attitude is perfect and so is hers the firmament is not to be shaken but annibale is not a farceur nor his blessed one absurd mysteries are all about us some are for the eschatologist and some for the shepherd some for patmos and some for the podere let our historian remember in fact that the natures into which he invites us to pry are those of the little divinities of earth and he can't go very far wrong nor can we that i am bold to confess is my own attitude toward a lovely order of creation perhaps i may go on to give him certain hints of treatment nearly all of them i think tend to the same point the discarding of literature literature being a man's art is at its best and also at its worst in its dealing with women no man perhaps is capable of writing of women as they really are though every man thinks he is a curious consequence to the history of fairies has been that literature has recognised no males in that community and that of the females it has described it has selected only those who are enamoured of men or disinclined to them the fact of course is that the fairy world is peopled very much as our own and that with great respect to shakespeare an ariel a puck a titania a peas blossom are abnormal it is as rare to find a fairy capable of discerning man as the converse is rare i have known a person intensely aware of the spirits that reside for instance in flowers in the wind in rivers and hills none the less bereft of any intercourse whatever with these interesting beings by the simple fact that they themselves were perfectly unconscious of him it is greatly to be doubted whether shakespeare ever saw a fairy though his age believed in fairies but almost certain that shelley must have seen many whose age did not believe if our author is to have a poetical guide at all it had better be shelley literature will tell him that fairies are benevolent or mischievous and tradition borrowing from literature will confirm it the proposition is ridiculous it would be as wise to say that a gnat is mischievous when it stings you or a bee benevolent because he cannot prevent you stealing his honey there would be less talk of benevolent bees if the gloves were off that is the pathetic fallacy again and that is man all over will nothing i wonder convince him that he is not the centre of the universe if darwin newton galileo copernicus and sir norman lockyer have failed is it my turn to try modesty forbids besides i am prejudiced i think man in the conduct of his business inferior to any vegetable i am a tainted source but such talk is idle and so is that which cries havoc upon fairy morality heaven knows that it differs from our own but heaven also knows that our own differs inter nos and that to discuss the customs and habits of the japanese in british parlours is a vain thing the forsaken merman is a beautiful poem but not a safe guide to those who would relate the ways of the spirits of the sea but all this is leading me too far from my present affair which is to relate how the knowledge of these things of these beings and of their laws came upon me and how their nature influenced mine i have said enough i think to establish the necessity of a good book upon the subject and i take leave to flatter myself that these pages of my own will be indispensable prolegomena to any such work or to any research tending to its compilation in the absence of books in the situation in which i found myself of reticence i could do nothing but brood upon the things i had seen insensibly my imagination latent while i had been occupied with observation began to work i did not write but i pictured and my waking dreams became so vivid that i was in a fair way to treat them as the only reality and might have discarded the workaday world altogether luckily for me my disposition was tractable and law abiding i fulfilled by habit the duties of the day i toiled at my dreary work ate and slept wrote to my parents visited them having got those tasks as it were by heart but i went through the rites like an automaton my mind was elsewhere intensely dogging the heels of that winged steed my fancy panting in its tracks and perfectly content so only that it did not come up too late to witness the glories which its bold flights discovered thanks to it all thanks to it i did not become a nympholept i did not haunt parliament hill o' nights i did not spy upon the darkling motions of mrs ventris desire appetite sex were not involved at all in this affair nor yet was love i was very prone to love but i did not love mrs ventris in whatsoever fairy being i had seen there had been nothing which held physical attraction for me there could be no allure when there was no lure so far as i could tell not one of these creatures except quidnunc and possibly the dryad the sun dyed nymph i had seen long ago in k park had been aware of my presence i guessed though i did not know as i do now that manifestation is not always mutual but that a man may see a fairy without being seen and conversely a fairy may be fully aware of mankind or of some man or men without any suspicion of theirs moreover though i saw them all extraordinarily beautiful i had never yet seen one supremely desirable the instinct to possess which is an essential part of the love passion of every man had never stirred in me in the presence of these creatures if it had i should have yielded to it i doubt not since there was no moral law to hold me back but it never had so far and i was safe from the wasting misery of seeking that which could not from its very nature and mine be sought there was really nothing i could do therefore but wait and that is what i did i waited intensely very much as a terrier waits at the hole of the bolting rabbit by the merest accident i got a clew to a very interesting case which added enormously to my knowledge it was a clear case of fairy child theft the clearest i ever met with i shall devote a chapter to it having been at the pains to verify it in all particulars i did not succeed in meeting the hero or victim of it because though the events related took place in they were not recorded until when the record came into my hands by that time the two persons concerned had left the country and were settled in florida i did see mr walsh the nonconformist minister who communicated the tale to his local society but he was both a dull and a cautious man and had very little to tell me he had himself seen nothing he only had beckwith's word to go upon and did not feel certain that the whole affair was not an hallucination on the young man's part that the child had disappeared was certain that both parents were equally distressed is certain not a shred of suspicion attached to the unhappy beckwith but mr walsh told me that he felt the loss so keenly and blamed himself so severely though unreasonably to my thinking that it would have been impossible for him to remain in england he said that the full statement communicated to the field club was considered by the young man in the light of a confession of his share in the tragedy it would he said have been exorbitant to expect more of him and i quite agree with him and now had better give the story as i found it beckwith's case the facts were as follows mr stephen mortimer beckwith was a young man living at wishford in the amesbury district of wiltshire he was a clerk in the wilts and dorset bank at salisbury was married and had one child his age at the time of the experience here related was twenty eight his health was excellent on the th november at about ten o'clock at night he was returning home from amesbury where he had been spending the evening at a friend's house the weather was mild with a rain bearing wind blowing in squalls from the south west it was three quarter moon that night and although the sky was frequently overcast it was at no time dark mr beckwith who was riding a bicycle and accompanied by his fox terrier strap states that he had no difficulty in seeing and avoiding the stones cast down at intervals by the road menders that flocks of sheep in the hollows were very visible and that passing wilsford house he saw a barn owl quite plainly and remarked its heavy uneven flight a mile beyond wilsford house strap the dog broke through the quick set hedge upon his right hand side and ran yelping up the down which rises sharply just there mr beckwith who imagined that he was after a hare whistled him in presently calling him sharply strap strap come out of it the dog took no notice but ran directly to a clump of gorse and bramble half way up the down and stood there in the attitude of a pointer with uplifted paw watching the gorse intently and whining mr beckwith was by this time dismounted observing the dog he watched him for some minutes from the road the moon was bright the sky at the moment free from cloud he himself could see nothing in the gorse though the dog was undoubtedly in a high state of excitement it made frequent rushes forward but stopped short of the object that it saw and trembled it did not bark outright but rather whimpered a curious shuddering crying noise says mr beckwith interested by the animal's persistent and singular behaviour he now sought a gap in the hedge went through on to the down and approached the clumped bushes strap was so much occupied that he barely noticed his master's coming it seemed as if he dared not take his eyes for one second from what he saw in there beckwith standing behind the dog looked into the gorse from the distance at which he still stood he could see nothing at all his belief then was that there was either a tramp in a drunken sleep possibly two tramps or a hare caught in a wire or possibly even a fox having no stick with him he did not care at first to go any nearer and contented himself with urging on his terrier this was not very courageous of him as he admits and was quite unsuccessful no verbal excitations would draw strap nearer to the furze bush finally the dog threw up his head showed his master the white arcs of his eyes and fairly howled at the moon at this dismal sound mr beckwith owned himself alarmed it was as he describes it though he is an englishman uncanny the time he owns the aspect of the night loneliness of the spot midway up the steep slope of a chalk down the mysterious shroud of darkness upon shadowed and distant objects and flood of white light upon the foreground all these circumstances worked upon his imagination he was indeed for retreat but here strap was of a different mind nothing would excite him to advance but nothing either could induce him to retire whatever he saw in the furze bush strap must continue to observe in the face of this beckwith summoned up his courage took it in both hands and went much nearer to the furze bushes much nearer that is than strap the terrier could bring himself to go then he tells us he did see a pair of bright eyes far in the thicket which seemed to be fixed upon his and by degrees also a pale and troubled face here then was neither fox nor drunken tramp but some human creature man woman or child fully aware of him and of the dog beckwith who now had surer command of his feelings spoke aloud asking what are you doing there what's the matter he had no reply he went one pace nearer being still on his guard and spoke again i won't hurt you he said tell me what the matter is the eyes remained unwinkingly fixed upon his own no movement of the features could be discerned the face as he could now make it out was very small about as big as a big wax doll's he says of a longish oval very pale he adds i could see its neck now no thicker than my wrist and where its clothes began i couldn't see any arms for a good reason i found out afterward that they had been bound behind its back i should have said immediately 'that's a girl in there' if it had not been for one or two plain considerations it had not the size of what we call a girl nor the face of what we mean by a child it was in fact neither fish flesh nor fowl strap had known that from the beginning and now i was of strap's opinion myself advancing with care a step at a time beckwith presently found himself within touching distance of the creature he was now standing with furze half way up his calves right above it stooping to look closely at it and as he stooped and moved now this way now that to get a clearer view so the crouching thing's eyes gazed up to meet his and followed them about as if safety lay only in that never shifting fixed regard he had noticed and states in his narrative that strap had seemed quite unable in the same way to take his eyes off the creature for a single second he could now see that of whatever nature it might be it was in form and features most exactly a young woman the features for instance were regular and fine he remarks in particular upon the chin all about its face narrowing the oval of it fell dark glossy curtains of hair very straight and glistening with wet its garment was cut in a plain circle round the neck and short off at the shoulders leaving the arms entirely bare this garment shift smock or gown as he indifferently calls it appeared thin and was found afterward to be of a grey colour soft and clinging to the shape it was made loose however and gathered in at the waist he could not see the creature's legs as they were tucked under her her arms it has been related were behind her back the only other things to be remarked upon were the strange stillness of one who was plainly suffering and might well be alarmed and appearance of expectancy a dumb appeal what he himself calls rather well an ignorant sort of impatience like that of a sick animal come beckwith now said let me help you up you will get cold if you sit here give me your hand will you she neither spoke nor moved simply continued to search his eyes strap meantime was still trembling and whining but now when he stooped yet lower to take her forcibly by the arms she shrank back a little way and turned her head and he saw to his horror that she had a great open wound in the side of her neck from which however no blood was issuing yet it was clearly a fresh wound recently made he was greatly shocked good god he said there's been foul play here and whipped out his handkerchief kneeling he wound it several times round her slender throat and knotted it as tightly as he could then without more ado he took her up in his arms under the knees and round the middle and carried her down the slope to the road he describes her as of no weight at all he says it was exactly like carrying an armful of feathers about i took her down the hill and through the hedge at the bottom as if she had been a pillow here it was that he discovered that her wrists were bound together behind her back with a kind of plait of thongs so intricate that he was quite unable to release them he felt his pockets for his knife but could not find it and then recollected suddenly that he should have a new one with him the third prize in a whist tournament in which he had taken part that evening he found it wrapped in paper in his overcoat pocket with it cut the thongs and set the little creature free she immediately responded the first sign of animation which she had displayed by throwing both her arms about his body and clinging to him in an ecstasy holding him so that as he says he felt the shuddering go all through her she suddenly lowered her head and touched his wrist with her cheek he says that instead of being cold to the touch like a fish as she had seemed to be when he first took her out of the furze she was now as warm as a toast like a child so far he had put her down for a foreigner convenient term for defining something which you do not quite understand she had none of his language evidently she was undersized some three feet six inches by the look of her and yet perfectly proportioned she was most curiously dressed in a frock cut to the knee and actually in nothing else at all it left her bare legged and bare armed and was made as he puts it himself of stuff like cobweb those dusty drooping kind which you put on your finger to stop bleeding he could not recognise the web but was sure that it was neither linen nor cotton it seemed to stick to her body wherever it touched a prominent part you could see very well to say nothing of feeling that she was well made and well nourished she ought as he judged to be a child of five years old and a feather weight at that but he felt certain that she must be much more like sixteen it was that i gather which made him suspect her of being something outside experience so far then it was safe to call her a foreigner but he was not yet at the end of his discoveries footnote her exact measurements are stated to have been as follows height from crown to sole feet inches round waist inches round bust inches round wrist inches round neck inches heavy footsteps coming from the direction of wishford in due time proved to be those of police constable gulliver a neighbour of beckwith's and guardian of the peace in his own village he lifted his lantern to flash it into the traveller's eyes and dropped it again with a pleasant good evening he added that it was inclined to be showery which was more than true as it was at the moment raining hard with that it seems he would have passed on but beckwith whether smitten by self consciousness of having been seen with a young woman in his arms at a suspicious hour of the night by the village policeman or bursting perhaps with the importance of his affair detained gulliver just look at this he said boldly here's a pretty thing to have found on a lonely road foul play somewhere i'm afraid he then exhibited his burden to the lantern light to his extreme surprise however the constable after exploring the beam of light and all that it contained for some time in silence reached out his hand for the knife which beckwith still held open he looked at it on both sides examined the handle and gave it back foul play mr beckwith he said laughing bless you they use bigger tools than that that's just a toy the like of that cut your hand with it though already i see he must have noticed the handkerchief for as he spoke the light from his lantern shone full upon the face and neck of the child or creature in the young man's arms so clearly that looking down at it beckwith himself could see the clear grey of its intensely watchful eyes and the very pupils of them diminished to specks of black it was now therefore plain to him that what he held was a foreigner indeed since the parish constable was unable to see it strap had smelt it then seen it and he beckwith had seen it but it was invisible to gulliver i felt now he says in his narrative that something was wrong i did not like the idea of taking it into the house but i intended to make one more trial before i made up my mind about that i said good night to gulliver put her on my bicycle and pushed her home but first of all i took the handkerchief from her neck and put it in my pocket there was no blood upon it that i could see his wife as he had expected was waiting at the gate for him she exclaimed as he had expected upon the lateness of the hour beckwith stood for a little in the roadway before the house explaining that strap had bolted up the hill and had had to be looked for and fetched back while speaking he noticed that mrs beckwith was as insensible to the creature on the bicycle as gulliver the constable had been indeed she went much further to prove herself so than he for she actually put her hand upon the handle bar of the machine and in order to do that drove it right through the centre of the girl crouching there beckwith saw that done i declare solemnly upon my honour he writes that it was as if mary had drilled a hole clean through the middle of her back through gown and skin and bone and all her arm went and how it went i don't know to me it seemed that her hand was on the handle bar while her upper arm to the elbow was in between the girl's shoulders there was a gap from the elbow downwards where mary's arm was inside the body then from the creature's diaphragm her lower arm wrist and hand came out and all the time we were speaking the girl's eyes were on my face i was now quite determined that i wouldn't have her in the house for a mint of money he put her finally in the dog kennel strap as a favourite lived in the house but he kept a greyhound in the garden in a kennel surrounded by a sort of run made of iron poles and galvanised wire it was roofed in with wire also for the convenience of stretching a tarpaulin in wet weather here it was that he bestowed the strange being rescued from the down it was clever i think of beckwith to infer that what strap had shown respect for would be respected by the greyhound and certainly bold of him to act upon his inference however events proved that he had been perfectly right bran the greyhound was interested highly interested in his guest the moment he saw his master he saw what he was carrying quiet bran quiet there was a very unnecessary adjuration bran stretched up his head and sniffed but went no further and when beckwith had placed his burden on the straw inside the kennel bran lay down as if on guard outside the opening and put his muzzle on his forepaws again beckwith noticed that curious appearance of the eyes which the fox terrier's had made already bran's eyes were turned upward to show the narrow arcs of white before he went to bed he tells us but not before mrs beckwith had gone there he took out a bowl of bread and milk to his patient bran he found to be still stretched out before the entry the girl was nestled down in the straw as if asleep or prepared to be so with her face upon her hand upon an after thought he went back for a clean pocket handkerchief warm water and a sponge with these by the light of a candle he washed the wound dipped the rag in hazeline and applied it this done he touched the creature's head nodded a good night and retired she smiled at me very prettily he says that was the first time she did it there was no blood on the handkerchief which he had removed early in the morning following upon the adventure beckwith was out and about he wished to verify the overnight experiences in the light of refreshed intelligence on approaching the kennel he saw at once that it had been no dream there in fact was the creature of his discovery playing with bran the greyhound circling sedately about him weaving her arms pointing her toes arching her graceful neck stooping to him as if inviting him to sport darting away like a fairy says beckwith at her magic dancing in a ring bran he observed made no effort to catch her but crouched rather than sat as if ready to spring he followed her about with his eyes as far as he could but when the course of her dance took her immediately behind him he did not turn his head but kept his eye fixed as far backward as he could against the moment when she should come again into the scope of his vision it seemed as important to him as it had the day before to strap to keep her always in his eye it seemed and always seemed so long as i could study them together intensely important bran's mouth was stretched to a sort of grin occasionally he panted when beckwith entered the kennel and touched the dog which took little notice of him he found him trembling with excitement his heart was beating at a great rate he also drank quantities of water beckwith whose narrative hitherto summarised i may now quote tells us that the creature was indescribably graceful and light footed you couldn't hear the fall of her foot you never could her dancing and circling about the cage seemed to be the most important business of her life she was always at it especially in bright weather i shouldn't have called it restlessness so much as busyness it really seemed to mean more to her than exercise or irritation at confinement it was evident also that she was happy when so engaged she used to sing she sang also when she was sitting still with bran but not with such exhilaration her eyes were bright when she was dancing about with mischief and devilry i cannot avoid that word though it does not describe what i really mean she looked wild and outlandish and full of fun as if she knew that she was teasing the dog and yet couldn't help herself when you say of a child that he looks wicked you don't mean it literally it is rather a compliment than not so it was with her and her wickedness she did look wicked there's no mistake able and willing to do wickedly but i am sure she never meant to hurt bran they were always firm friends though the dog knew very well who was master when you looked at her you did not think of her height she was so complete as well made as a statuette i could have spanned her waist with my two thumbs and middle fingers and her neck very nearly with one hand she was pale and inclined to be dusky in complexion but not so dark as a gipsy she had grey eyes and dark brown hair which she could sit upon if she chose her gown you could have sworn was made of cobweb i don't know how else to describe it as i had suspected she wore nothing else for while i was there that first morning so soon as the sun came up over the hill she slipped it off her and stood up dressed in nothing at all she was a regular little venus that's all i can say i never could get accustomed to that weakness of hers for slipping off her frock though no doubt it was very absurd she had no sort of shame in it so why on earth should i the food i ought to mention had disappeared the bowl was empty but i know now that bran must have had it so long as she remained in the kennel or about my place she never ate anything nor drank either if she had i must have known it as i used to clean the run out every morning i was always particular about that i used to say that you couldn't keep dogs too clean but i tried her unsuccessfully with all sorts of things flowers honey dew for i had read somewhere that fairies drink dew and suck honey out of flowers she used to look at the little messes i made for her and when she knew me better would grimace at them and look up in my face and laugh at me i have said that she used to sing sometimes it was like nothing that i can describe perhaps the wind in the telegraph wire comes nearest to it and yet that is an absurd comparison i could never catch any words indeed i did not succeed in learning a single word of her language i doubt very much whether they have what we call a language i mean the people who are like her her own people they communicate with each other i fancy as she did with my dogs inarticulately but with perfect communication and understanding on either side when i began to teach her english i noticed that she had a kind of pity for me a kind of contempt perhaps is nearer the mark that i should be compelled to express myself in so clumsy a way i am no philosopher but i imagine that our need of putting one word after another may be due to our habit of thinking in sequence if there is no such thing as time in the other world it should not be necessary there to frame speech in sentences at all i am sure that thumbeline which was my name for her i never learned her real name spoke with bran and strap in flashes which revealed her whole thought at once so also they answered her there's no doubt so also she contrived to talk with my little girl who although she was four years old and a great chatterbox never attempted to say a single word of her own language to thumbeline yet communicated with her by the hour together but i did not know anything of this for a month or more though it must have begun almost at once i blame myself for it myself only i ought of course to have remembered that children are more likely to see fairies than grown ups but then why did florrie keep it all secret why did she not tell her mother or me that she had seen a fairy in bran's kennel the child was as open as the day yet she concealed her knowledge from both of us without the least difficulty she seemed the same careless laughing child she had always been one could not have supposed her to have a care in the world and yet for nearly six months she must have been full of care having daily secret intercourse with thumbeline and keeping her eyes open all the time lest her mother or i should find her out certainly she could have taught me something in the way of keeping secrets i know that i kept mine very badly and blame myself more than enough for keeping it at all god knows what we might have been spared if on the night i brought her home i had told mary the whole truth and yet how could i have convinced her that she was impaling some one with her arm while her hand rested on the bar of the bicycle is not that an absurdity on the face of it yes indeed but the sequel is no absurdity that's the terrible fact i kept thumbeline in the kennel for the whole winter she seemed happy enough there with the dogs and of course she had had florrie too though i did not find that out until the spring i don't doubt now that if i had kept her in there altogether she would have been perfectly contented the first time i saw florrie with her i was amazed it was a sunday morning there was our four year old child standing at the wire pressing herself against it and thumbeline close to her their faces almost touched their fingers were interlaced i am certain that they were speaking to each other in their own fashion by flashes without words i watched them for a bit i saw bran come and sit up on his haunches and join in he looked from one to another and all about and then he saw me now that is how i know that they were all three in communication because the very next moment florrie turned round and ran to me and said in her pretty baby talk 'talking to bran florrie talking to bran' if this was wilful deceit it was most accomplished it could not have been better done 'and who else were you talking to florrie' i said she fixed her round blue eyes upon me as if in wonder then looked away and said shortly 'no one else' and i could not get her to confess or admit then or at any time afterward that she had any cognisance at all of the fairy in bran's kennel although their communications were daily and often lasted for hours at a time i don't know that it makes things any better but i have thought sometimes that the child believed me to be as insensible to thumbeline as her mother was she can only have believed it at first of course but that may have prompted her to a concealment which she did not afterwards care to confess to be this as it may florrie in fact behaved with thumbeline exactly as the two dogs did she made no attempt to catch her at her circlings and wheelings about the kennel nor to follow her wonderful dances nor in her presence to imitate them but she was like the dogs aware of nobody else when under the spell of thumbeline's personality and when she had got to know her she seemed to care for nobody else at all i ought no doubt to have foreseen that and guarded against it thumbeline was extremely attractive i never saw such eyes as hers such mysterious fascination she was nearly always good tempered nearly always happy but sometimes she had fits of temper and kept herself to herself nothing then would get her out of the kennel where she would lie curled up like an animal with her knees to her chin and one arm thrown over her face bran was always wretched at these times and did all he knew to coax her out he ceased to care for me or my wife after she came to us and instead of being wild at the prospect of his saturday and sunday runs it was hard to get him along i had to take him on a lead until we had turned to go home then he would set off by himself in spite of hallooing and scolding at a long steady gallop and one would find him waiting crouched at the gate of his run and thumbeline on the ground inside it with her legs crossed like a tailor mocking and teasing him with her wonderful shining eyes only once or twice did i see her worse than sick or sorry then she was transported with rage and another person altogether she never touched me and why or how i had offended her i have no notion but she buzzed and hovered about me like an angry bee she appeared to have wings which hummed in their furious movement she was red in the face her eyes burned she grinned at me and ground her little teeth together a curious shrill noise came from her like the screaming of a gnat or hoverfly but no words never any words bran showed me his teeth too and would not look at me it was very odd footnote i have sometimes thought he adds in a note that it may have been jealousy my wife had been with me in the garden and had stuck a daffodil in my coat when i looked in on my return home she was as merry as usual and as affectionate i think she had no memory i am trying to give all the particulars i was able to gather from observation in some things she was difficult in others very easy to teach for instance i got her to learn in no time that she ought to wear her clothes such as they were when i was with her she certainly preferred to go without them especially in the sunshine but by leaving her the moment she slipped her frock off i soon made her understand that if she wanted me she must behave herself according to my notions of behaviour she got that fixed in her little head but even so she used to do her best to hoodwink me she would slip out one shoulder when she thought i wasn't looking and before i knew where i was half of her would be gleaming in the sun like satin directly i noticed it i used to frown and then she would pretend to be ashamed of herself hang her head and wriggle her frock up to its place again however i never could teach her to keep her skirts about her knees she was as innocent as a baby about that sort of thing i taught her some english words and a sentence or two that was toward the end of her confinement to the kennel about march i used to touch parts of her or of myself or bran and peg away at the names of them mouth eyes ears hands chest tail back front she learned all those and more eat drink laugh cry love kiss those also as for kissing apart from the word she proved herself to be an expert she kissed me florrie bran strap indifferently one as soon as another and any rather than none and all four for choice i learned some things myself more than a thing or two i don't mind owning that one thing was to value my wife's steady and tried affection far above the wild love of this unbalanced unearthly little creature who seemed to be like nothing so much as a woman with the conscience left out the conscience we believe is the still small voice of the deity crying to us in the dark recesses of the body pointing out the path of duty teaching respect for the opinion of the world for tradition decency and order it is thanks to conscience that a man is true and a woman modest not that thumbeline could be called immodest unless a baby can be so described or an animal but could i be called 'true' i greatly fear that i could not in fact i know it too well i meant no harm i was greatly interested and there was always before me the real difficulty of making mary understand that something was in the kennel which she couldn't see it would have led to great complications even if i had persuaded her of the fact no doubt she would have insisted on my getting rid of thumbeline but how on earth could i have done that if thumbeline had not chosen to go but for all that i know very well that i ought to have told her cost what it might if i had done it i should have spared myself lifelong regret and should only have gone without a few weeks of extraordinary interest which i now see clearly could not have been good for me as not being founded upon any revealed christian principle and most certainly were not worth the price i had to pay for them i learned one more curious fact which i must not forget nothing would induce thumbeline to touch or pass over anything made of zinc i don't know the reason of it but gardeners will tell you that the way to keep a plant from slugs is to put a zinc collar round it it is due to that i was able to keep her in bran's run without difficulty to have got out she would have had to pass zinc the wire was all galvanised footnote this is a curious thing unsupported by any other evidence known to me i asked despoina about it but she would not or she did not answer she appeared not to understand what zinc was and i had none handy she showed her dislike of it in numerous ways one was her care to avoid touching the sides or top of the enclosure when she was at her gambols at such times when she was at her wildest she was all over the place skipping high like a lamb twisting like a leveret wheeling round and round in circles like a young dog or skimming like a swallow on the wing above ground but she never made a mistake she turned in a moment or flung herself backward if there was the least risk of contact when florrie used to converse with her from outside in that curious silent way the two had it would always be the child that put its hands through the wire never thumbeline i once tried to put her against the roof when i was playing with her she screamed like a shot hare and would not come out of the kennel all day there was no doubt at all about her feelings for zinc all other metals seemed indifferent to her with the advent of spring weather thumbeline became not only more beautiful but wilder and exceedingly restless she now coaxed me to let her out and against my judgment i did it she had to be carried over the entry for when i had set the gate wide open and pointed her the way into the garden she squatted down in her usual attitude of attention with her legs crossed and watched me waiting i wanted to see how she would get through the hateful wire so went away and hid myself leaving her alone with bran i saw her creep to the entry and peer at the wire what followed was curious bran came up wagging his tail and stood close to her his side against her head he looked down inviting her to go out with him long looks passed between them and then bran stooped his head she put her arms around his neck twined her feet about his foreleg and was carried out then she became a mad thing now bird now moth high and low round and round flashing about the place for all the world like a humming bird moth perfectly beautiful in her motions whose ease always surprised me and equally so in her colouring of soft grey and dusky rose flesh bran grew a puppy again and whipped about after her in great circles round the meadow but though he was famous at coursing and has killed his hares single handed he was never once near thumbeline it was a wonderful sight and made me late for business by degrees she got to be very bold and taught me boldness too and i am ashamed to say greater degrees of deceit she came freely into the house and played with florrie up and down stairs she got on my knee at meal times or evenings when my wife and i were together fine tricks she played me i must own she spilled my tea for me broke cups and saucers scattered my patience cards caught poor mary's knitting wool and rolled it about the room the cunning little creature knew that i dared not scold her or make any kind of fuss she used to beseech me for forgiveness occasionally when i looked very glum and would touch my cheek to make me look at her imploring eyes and keep me looking at her till i smiled then she would put her arms round my neck and pull herself up to my level and kiss me and then nestle down in my arms and pretend to sleep by and by when my attention was called off her she would pinch me or tweak my necktie and make me look again at her wicked eye peeping out from under my arm i had to kiss her again of course and at last she might go to sleep in earnest she seemed able to sleep at any hour or in any place just like an animal i had some difficulty in arranging for the night when once she had made herself free of the house she saw no reason whatever for our being separated but i circumvented her by nailing a strip of zinc all round the door and i put one round florrie's too i pretended to my wife that it was to keep out draughts thumbeline was furious when she found out how she had been tricked i think she never quite forgave me for it where she hid herself at night i am not sure i think on the sitting room sofa but on mild mornings i used to find her out doors playing round bran's kennel strap our fox terrier picked up some rat poison towards the end of april and died in the night thumbeline's way of taking that was very curious it shocked me a good deal she had never been so friendly with him as with bran though certainly more at ease in his company than in mine the night before he died i remember that she and bran and he had been having high games in the meadow which had ended by their all lying down together in a heap thumbeline's head on bran's flank and her legs between his her arm had been round strap's neck in a most loving way they made quite a picture for a royal academician 'tired of play' or 'the end of a romp' i can fancy he would call it next morning i found poor old strap stiff and staring and thumbeline and bran at their games just the same she actually jumped over him and all about him as if he had been a lump of earth or a stone just some such thing he was to her she did not seem able to realise that there was the cold body of her friend bran just sniffed him over and left him but thumbeline showed no consciousness that he was there at all i wondered was this heartlessness or obliquity but i have never found the answer to my question footnote i have observed this frequently for myself and can answer beckwith's question for him i would refer the reader in the first place to my early experience of the boy to call him so with the rabbit in the wood there was an act of shocking cruelty done idly almost unconsciously i was not shocked at all child as i was and quickly moved to pity and terror because i knew that the creature was not to be judged by our standards from this and other things of the sort which i have observed and from this tale of beckwith's i judge that to the fairy kind directly life ceases to be lived at the full the object be it fairy or animal or vegetable is not perceived by the other to exist thus if a fairy should die the others would not know that its accidents were there if a rabbit as in the case cited should be caught it would therefore cease to be rabbit we ourselves have very much the same habit of regard toward plant life our attitude to a tree or a growing plant ceases the moment that plant is out of the ground it is then as we say dead that is it ceases to be a plant so also we never scruple to pluck the flowers or the whole flower scape from a plant to put it in our buttonhole or in the bosom of our friend and thereafter to cease our interest in the plant as such it now becomes a memory a gage d'amour a token or a sudden glory what you will this is the habit of mankind but i know of rare ones both men and women who never allow dead flowers to be thrown into the draught but always give them decent burial either cremation or earth to earth i find that admirable yet don't condemn their neighbours nor consider fairies cruel who torture the living and disregard the maimed or the dead now i come to the tragical part of my story and wish with all my heart that i could leave it out but beyond the full confession i have made to my wife the county police and the newspapers i feel that i should not shrink from any admission that may be called for of how much i have been to blame in may on the th of may thumbeline bran and our only child florrie disappeared it was a day i remember well of wonderful beauty i had left them all three together in the water meadow little thinking of what was in store for us before many hours thumbeline had been crowning florrie with a wreath of flowers she had gathered cuckoo pint and marsh marigolds and woven them together far more deftly than any of us could have done into a chaplet i remember the curious winding wandering air she had been singing without any words as usual over her business and how she touched each flower first with her lips and then brushed it lightly across her bosom before she wove it in she had kept her eyes on me as she did it looking up from under her brows as if to see whether i knew what she was about i don't doubt now but that she was bewitching florrie by this curious performance which every flower had to undergo separately but fool that i was i thought nothing of it at the time and bicycled off to salisbury leaving them there at noon my poor wife came to me at the bank distracted with anxiety and fatigue she had run most of the way she gave me to understand her news was that florrie and bran could not be found anywhere she said that she had gone to the gate of the meadow to call the child in and not seeing her or getting any answer she had gone down to the river at the bottom here she had found a few picked wild flowers but no other traces there were no footprints in the mud either of child or dog having spent the morning with some of the neighbours in a fruitless search she had now come to me my heart was like lead and shame prevented me from telling her the truth as i was sure it must be but my own conviction of it clogged all my efforts of what avail could it be to inform the police or organise search parties knowing what i knew only too well however i did put gulliver in communication with the head office in sarum and everything possible was done we explored a circuit of six miles about wishford every fold of the hills every spinney every hedgerow was thoroughly examined but that first night of grief had broken down my shame i told my wife the whole truth in the presence of reverend richard walsh the congregational minister and in spite of her absolute incredulity and i may add scorn next morning i repeated it to chief inspector notcutt of salisbury particulars got into the local papers by the following saturday and next i had to face the ordeal of the daily chronicle daily news daily graphic star and other london journals most of these newspapers sent representatives to lodge in the village many of them with photographic cameras all this hateful notoriety i had brought upon myself and did my best to bear like the humble contrite christian which i hope i may say i have become we found no trace of our dear one and never have to this day bran too had completely vanished i have not cared to keep a dog since whether my dear wife ever believed my account i cannot be sure she has never reproached me for wicked thoughtlessness that's certain mr walsh our respected pastor who has been so kind as to read this paper told me more than once that he could hardly doubt it the salisbury police made no comments upon it one way or another my colleagues at the bank out of respect for my grief and sincere repentance treated me with a forbearance for which i can never be too grateful i need not add that every word of this is absolutely true i made notes of the most remarkable characteristics of the being i called thumbeline at the time of remarking them and those notes are still in my possession here with the exception of a few general reflections which are of little value mr beckwith's paper ends it was read i ought to say by the rev richard walsh at the meeting of the south wilts folk lore society and field club held at amesbury in june and is to be found in the published transactions of that body vol iv new series pp seq the fairy wife there is nothing surprising in that story to my mind but the reprobation with which beckwith visits himself what could he have done that he did not how could he have refrained from doing what he did yet there are curious things about it and one of those is the partiality of the manifestation the fairy was visible to him his child and his dogs but to no one else so in my own experience had she been whom i saw in k park whom harkness my companion did not see my explanation of it does not carry me over all the difficulties i say or will repeat if i have said it before that the fairy kind are really the spirit essence substance what you will of certain sensible things such as trees flowers wind water hills woods marshes and the like that their normal appearance to us is that of these natural phenomena but that in certain states of mind perhaps in certain conditions of body there is a relation established by which we are able to see them on our own terms as it were or in our own idiom and they also to treat with us to some extent to a large extent on the same plane or standing ground that there are limitations to this relationship is plain already for instance beckwith was not able to get his fairy prisoner to speak and i myself have never had speech with more than one in my life but as to that i shall have a very curious case to report shortly where a man taught his fairy wife to speak the mentioning of that undoubted marriage brings me to the question of sex there is of course not the slightest doubt about it mrs ventris was a fairy wife mrs ventris was a puzzle to me for a good many years in fact until despoina explained to me many things for mrs ventris had a permanent human shape and spoke as freely as you or i i thought at one time that she might be the offspring of a mixed marriage like elsie marks whose mother by the way was another case of the sort but in fact mrs ventris and mrs marks were both fairy wives and the wood girl mabilla king whose case i am going to deal with was another but this particular relationship is one which my explanation of fairy apparitions does not really cover for marriage implies a permanent accessibility to put it so of two normally inaccessible natures and parentage implies very much more that indeed implies what the christians call miracle but it is quite beyond dispute i have a great number of cases ready to my hand and shall deal at large with all of them in the course of this essay in which fairies have had intercourse with mortals it is by no means the fact that the wife is always of the fairy kind my own experience at c shall prove that but i must content myself with mentioning the well known case of mary wellwood who was wife to a carpenter near ashby de la zouche and was twice taken by a fairy and twice recovered she had children in each of her states of being and on one recorded occasion her two families met it appears to be a law that the wife takes the nature of the husband or as much of it as she can and it is important to remark that in all cases the children are of the husband's nature fairy or mortal as he may happen to be nature despoina told me follows the male so far as fairies are concerned it seems certain that union with mortals runs in families or clans if one may so describe their curious relationships to each other there were five sisters of the wood in one of the western departments of france lot et garonne i think who all married men two of them married two brothers apart they led the decorous lives of the french middle class but when they were together it was a sight to see a curious one and to us with our strong associations of ideas that tremendous hand which memory has upon our heart strings a poignant one for they had lost their powers but not their impulses it was a case of si vieillesse pouvait i suppose they may have appeared to some chance wayfarer getting a glimpse of them at their gambols between the poplar stems of the road or in the vistas of the hazel brakes as a company of sprightly matrons on a frolic to the greeks foolishness and be sure that such an observer would shrug them out of mind my own impression is that these ladies were perfectly happy that they had nothing of that maggior' dolore which we mortals know and for which our joys have so often to pay let us hope so at any rate for about a fairy or a growing boy conscious of the prison shades could poe have spun his horrors to the greeks foolishness i said in my haste but in very truth it was far from being so to the greeks there was nothing extraordinary in the parentage of a river or the love of a god for a mortal nor should there be to a christian who accepts the orthodox account of the foundation of his faith so far as we know the generative process of every created thing is the same it is therefore an allowable inference that the same process obtains with the created things which are not sensible to ourselves if flowers mate and beget as we do why not winds and waters why not gods and nymphs fauns and fairies it is the creative urgency that imports more than the creative matter to my mind magna componere parvis it is my fixed belief that all created nature known to us is the issue of the mighty love of god for his first made creature the earth i accept the greek mythology as the nearest account of the truth we are likely to get i have never had the least difficulty in accepting it and all i have since found out of the relations of men with their fellow creatures of other genera confirms me in the belief that the urgency is the paramount necessity if i am to deal with a case of a mixed marriage where the wife was a fairy the spirit of a tree i shall ask leave to set down first a plain proposition which is that all natural facts as wind hills lakes trees animals rain rivers flowers have an underlying idea or soul whereby they really are what they appear to which they owe the beauty majesty pity terror love which they excite in us and that this idea or soul having a real existence of its own in community with its companions of the same nature can be discerned by mortal men in forms which best explain to human intelligence the passions which they excite in human breasts this is how i explain the fact for instance that the austerity of a lonely rock at sea will take the form and semblance and much more than that assume the prerogatives of a brooding man or that the swift freedom of a river will pass by as in a flash in the coursing limbs of a youth or that at dusk out of a reed encircled mountain tarn silvery under the hush of the grey hour there will rise and gleam and sink again the pale face the shoulders and breast of the spirit of the pool that finally the grace of a tree and its panic of fury when lashed by storm very capable in either case of inspiring love or horror will be revealed rarely in the form of a nymph there may be a more rational explanation of these curious things but i don't know of one fortunatus et ille deos qui novit agrestes happy may one be in the fairies of our own country happy even yet are they who can find the oreads of the hill dryads of the wood nymphs of river marsh plough land pasture and heath now leaving to greece the things that are greek here for an apologue follows a plain recital of facts within the knowledge of every man of the cheviots i there is in that country not far from otterburn between otterburn and the scottish border a remote hamlet consisting of a few white cottages farm buildings and a shingle spired church it is called dryhope and lies in a close valley which is watered by a beck or burn known as the dryhope burn it is deeply buried in the hills spurs of the cheviots as these are they rise to a considerable elevation but are pasturable nearly to the top there however where the heather begins peat hags and morasses make dangerous provision from which the flocks are carefully guarded it is the practice of the country for the shepherds to be within touch of them all night lest some feeding upward as sheep always do should reach the summits and be lost or mired inextricably these upland stretches consequently are among the most desolate spots to be found in our islands i have walked over them myself within recent years and met not a human soul nor beast of man's taming ravens curlews peewits a lagging fox or limping hare such with the unsensed spirits of the earth will be your company in particular i traversed in the great upland called limmer fell and saw the tarn silent water and the trees called the seven sisters they are silver birches of remarkable size and beauty one of them is fallen standing there looking north west the knapp may be seen easily some five miles away and the extent of the forest with which it is covered can be estimated a great and solemn wood that is which no borderer will ever enter if he can help it there was and may be still a family of shepherds living in dryhope of the name of king when these things occurred there were alive george king a patriarch of seventy five years miranda king his daughter in law widow of his son who was supposed to be a middle aged woman and a young man andrew king her only son that was the family and there was a girl bessie prawle daughter of a neighbour very much in and out of the house and held by common report to be betrothed to andrew she used to help the widow in domestic matters see to the poultry milk the cow churn the butter press the cheeses the kings were independent people like the dalesmen of cumberland and stood as the saying is upon their own foot soles old king had a tenant right upon the fell and owed no man anything there was said to be a mystery connected with miranda the widow who was a broad browed deep breasted handsome woman very dark and silent she was not a native of redesdale not known to be of northumberland her husband who had been a sailor had brought her back with him one day saying that she was his wife and her name miranda he had said no more about her would say no more and had been drowned at sea before his son was born she for her part had been as uncommunicative as he such reticence breeds wonderment in the minds of such a people as they of dryhope and out of wonderment arise wonders it was told that until miranda king was brought in sea birds had never been seen in dryhopedale it was said that they came on that very night when george king the younger came home and she with him carrying his bundle and her own it was said that they had never since left the hamlet and that when miranda went out of doors which was seldom she was followed by clouds of them whichever way she turned i have no means of testing the truth of these rumours but however it may be no scandal was ever brought against her she was respectable and respected old king the grandfather relied strongly upon her judgment she brought up her son in decent living and the fear of god in the year when andrew was nineteen he was a tall handsome lad and a shepherd following the profession as he was to inherit the estate of his forebears one april night in that year he and his grandfather the pair of them with a collie lay out on the fell side together lambing is late in redesdale the spring comes late april is often a month of snow they had a fire and their cloaks the ground was dry and they lay upon it under a clear sky strewn with stars at midnight george king the grandfather was asleep but andrew was broad awake he heard the flock which he could not see sweep by him like a storm the bell wether leading and as they went up the hill the wind began to blow a long steady following blast the collie on his feet ears set flat on his head shuddering with excitement whined for orders andrew after waking with difficulty his grandfather was told to go up and head them off he sent the dog one way off in a flash he never returned that night and himself went another he was not seen again for two days to be exact he set out at midnight on thursday the th april and did not return to dryhope until eleven o'clock of the morning of saturday the th the sheep i may say here came back by themselves on the th the intervening day that night of the th april is still commemorated in dryhope as one of unexampled spring storm just as a certain october night of the next year stands yet as the standard of comparison for all equinoctial gales the april storm we hear was very short and had several peculiar features it arose out of a clear sky blew up a snow cloud which did no more than powder the hills and then continued to blow furiously out of a clear sky it was steady but inconceivably strong while it lasted the force and pressure of the wind did not vary until just the end it came from the south east which is the rainy quarter in northumberland but without rain it blew hard from midnight until three o'clock in the morning and then for half an hour a hurricane the valley and hamlet escaped as by a miracle mr robson the vicar awakened by it heard the wind like thunder overhead and went out of doors to observe it he went out into a still mild air coming from the north west and still heard it roaring like a mad thing high above him its direction as he judged by sound was the precise contrary of the ground current in the morning wreckage of all kinds branches of trees roots and whole clumps of heather strewn about the village and meadows while showing that a furious battle had been fought out on the fells confirmed this suspicion a limb of a tree draped in ivy was recognised as part of an old favourite of his walks the ash from which it had been torn stood to the south east of the village in the course of the day the th news was brought in that one of the seven sisters was fallen and that a clean drive could be seen through the forest on the top of knapp coupled with these dreadful testimonies you have the disappearance of andrew king to help you form your vision of a village in consternation hear now what befell young andrew king when he swiftly climbed the fell driven forward by the storm the facts are that he was agog for adventure since all unknown to any but himself he had ventured to the summits before had stood by silent water touched the seven sisters one by one and had even entered the dreadful haunted forest of knapp he had had a fright had been smitten by that sudden gripe of fear which palsies limbs and freezes blood which the ancients called the stroke of pan and we still call panic after them he had never forgotten what he had seen though he had lost the edge of the fear he had he was older now by some two years and only waiting the opportunity for renewed experience he hoped to have it and he had it the streaming gale drove him forward as a ship at sea he ran lightly without fatigue or troubled breath dimly above him he presently saw the seven trees dipping and louting to the weather but as he neared them they had no meaning for him did not indeed exist for now he saw more than they and otherwise than men see trees ii in a mild and steady light which came from no illumination of moon or stars but seemed to be interfused with the air in the strong warm wind which wrapped the fell top upon a sward of bent grass which ran toward the tarn and ended in swept reeds he saw six young women dancing in a ring not to any music that he could hear did they move nor was the rhythm of their movement either ordered or wild it was not formal dancing and it was not at all a bacchic rout rather they flitted hither and thither on the turf now touching hands now straining heads to one another crossing meeting parting winding about and about with the purposeless and untirable frivolity of moths they seemed neither happy nor unhappy they made no sound it looked to the lad as if they had been so drifting from the beginning and would so drift to the end of things temporal their loose hair streamed out in the wind their light gossamer gowns streamed the same way whipped about their limbs as close as wet muslin they were bare footed bare armed and bare headed they all had beauty but it was not of earthly cast he saw one with hair like pale silk and one ruddy and fierce in the face with snaky black hair which he thought flew out beyond her for a full yard's measure another had hazel brown hair and a sharp little peering face another's was colour of ripe corn and another's like a thunder cloud copper tinged about and about they went skimming the tops of the grasses and andrew king his heart hammering at his ribs watched them at their play so by chance one saw him and screamed shrilly and pointed at him then they came about him like a swarm of bees angry at first humming a note like that of the telegraph wire on a mountain road but as he stood his ground curiosity prevailed among them and they pried closely at him they touched him felt his arms his knees handled his clothing peered into his eyes all this he endured though he was in a horrible fright then one the black haired girl with a bold proud face came and stood closely before him and looked him full into his eyes he gave her look for look she put a hand on each shoulder and kissed him after that there was a tussle among them for each must do what her sister had done they took a kiss apiece or maybe more then circling round him they swept him forward on the wind past silent water over the edge out on the fells on and on and on and never stopped till they reached knapp forest that dreadful place there in the hushed aisles and glades they played with this new found creature played with him fought for him and would have loved him if he had been minded for such adventuring two in particular he marked as desiring his closer company the black haired and bold was one and the other was the sharp faced and slim with eyes of a mouse and hazel brown hair he called her the laughing girl and thought her the kindest of them all but they were all his friends at this time andrew king like young tamlane might have sojourned with them for ever and a day but for one thing he saw by chance a seventh maiden a white faced woe begone horror struck seventh sister blenched and frozen under a great beech she may have been there throughout his commerce with the rest or she may have been revealed to him in a flash then and there so as it was he saw her suddenly and thereafter saw no other at all she held his eyes waking he left his playmates and went to her where she crouched he stooped and took her hand it was as cold as a dead girl's and very heavy amid the screaming of the others undeterred by their whirling and battling he lifted up the frozen one he lifted her bodily and carried her in his arms they swept all about him like infuriated birds the sound of their rage was like that of gulls about a fish in the tide way but they laid no hands on him and said nothing that he could understand and by this time his awe was gone and his heart was on fire holding fast to what he had and wanted he pushed out of knapp forest and took the lee side of the edge on his way to dryhope this must have been about the time of the gale at its worst the seventh sister by silent water may have fallen at this time for had not andrew king the seventh sister in his arms anxiety as to the fate of andrew king was spread over the village and the greatest sympathy felt for the bereaved family to have lost a flock of sheep a dog and an only child at one blow is a terrible misfortune old king i am told was prostrated and the girl bessie prawle violent in her lamentations over her lad the only person unmoved was the youth's mother miranda king the widow she it seems had no doubts of his safety and declared that he would come in his time like his father before him a saying which instead of comforting the mourners appears to have exasperated them probably they did not at all understand it such consolations as mr robson the minister had to offer she received respectfully but without comment all she had to say was that she could trust her son and when he urged that she had better by far trust in god her reply finally and shortly was that god was bound by his own laws and had not given us heads and hearts for nothing i am free to admit that her theology upon this point seems to me remarkably sound in the course of the th anxious day as it promised to be old george king returning from a fruitless quest over the fells came upon his sheep within a few hundred yards of his own house collected together in a flock and under the watch of his dog they were in fact as nearly as possible where he had understood them to be before their stampede of the previous night he was greatly heartened by the discovery though unable to account for the facts of it the dog was excessively tired and ate greedily next morning when the family and some neighbours were standing together on the fell side looking up the valley where the dryhope burn comes down from the hills they saw two figures on the rough road which follows it mrs king the widow i believe had seen them first but she had said nothing it was bessie prawle who raised the first cry that andrew was coming and his wife with him all looked in the direction she showed them and recognised the young man behind him walked the figure of a woman this is the accustomed manner of a man and wife to walk in that country it is almost a proof of their relationship being satisfied of the identity of their child the whole party returned to the homestead to await him and what he was bringing with him speculation was rife and volubly expressed especially by bessie prawle miranda king however was silent but it was noticed that she kept her eyes fixed upon the woman behind her son and that her lips moved as if she was muttering to herself the facts were as the expectations andrew king brought forward a young timid and unknown girl as his wife by that name he led her up to his grandfather then to his mother as such he explained her to his neighbours including though not by name bessie prawle who had undoubtedly hoped to occupy that position herself old king overcome with joy at seeing his boy alive and well and dazed probably by events put his hands upon the girl's head and blessed her after the patriarchal fashion there persisting he seems to have taken canonical marriage for granted though nobody else did and though a moment's reflection had he been capable of so much would have shown him that that could not be the neighbours were too well disposed to the family to raise any doubts or objections bessie prawle was sullen and quiet only miranda king seems to have been equal to the occasion she as if in complete possession of facts which satisfied every question received the girl as an equal she did not kiss her or touch her but looked deeply into her eyes for a long space of time and took from her again an equally searching regard then turning to her father in law and the company at large she said this is begun and will be done he is like his father before him to that oracular utterance old king catching probably but the last sentence replied and he couldn't do better my child he meant no more than a testimony to his daughter in law mrs king's observations coupled with that nevertheless went far to give credit to the alleged marriage the girl so far had said nothing whatever though she had been addressed with more than one rough but kindly compliment on her youth and good looks and now andrew king explained that she was dumb consternation took the strange form of jocular approval of his discretion in selecting a wife who could never nag him but it was consternation none the less the mystery was felt to be deeper there was nothing for it now but to call in the aid of the parish priest the minister as they called him and this was done by the time he had arrived miranda king had taken the girl into the cottage and the young husband and his grandfather had got the neighbours to disperse bessie prawle breathing threatenings and slaughter had withdrawn herself mr robson a quiet sensible man of nearer sixty than fifty years sat in the cottage hearing all that his parishioners could tell him and using his eyes he saw the centre piece of all surmise a shrinking pale slip of a girl by the look of her not more than fifteen or sixteen years old she was not emaciated by any means seemed to be well nourished and was quite as vigorous as any child of that age who could have been pitted against her her surroundings cowed her he judged to dryhope she was a stranger a foreigner to her dryhope and the dryhopedale folk were perilous matter her general appearance was that of a child who had never had anything but ill usage she flinched at every sudden movement and followed one about with her great unintelligent eyes as if she was trying to comprehend what they showed her her features were regular and delicate her brows broad and eyebrows finely arched her chin full her neck slim her hands and feet narrow and full of what fanciers call breed her hair was very long and fine dark brown with gleams of gold her eyes were large grey in colour but as i have said unintelligent like an animal's which to us always seem unintelligent i should have mentioned for mr robson noticed it at once that her hair was unconfined and that so far as he could make out she wore but a single garment a sleeveless frock confined at the waist and reaching to her knees it was of the colour of unbleached flax and of a coarse web her form showed through and the faint flush of her skin she was a finely made girl her legs and feet were bare immodest as such an appearance would have been in one of the village maids he did not feel it to be so with her her look was so entirely foreign to his experience that there was no standard of comparison everything about her seemed to him to be quite what one would have expected until one came so to speak in touch with her soul that if it lay behind her inscrutable sightless and dumb eyes betrayed her there was no hint of it human in form visibly and tangibly human no soul sat in her great eyes that a man could discern that however is not now the point rather it is that to all appearance a modest and beautiful girl she was remarkably undressed it was inconceivable that a modest and beautiful girl could so present herself and yet a modest and beautiful girl she was mr robson put it to himself this way there are birds for instance jays kingfishers goldfinches which are taken absolutely extremely brilliant in colouring yet they do not jar are not obtrusive so it was with her her dress was perhaps taken absolutely indecorous upon her it looked at once seemly and beautiful upon bessie prawle it would have been glaring but one had to dissect it before one could discover any fault with it upon its wearer she was very pale even to the lips which were full and parted as if she must breathe through her mouth he noticed immediately the shortness of her breath it was very distressing and after a little while induced the same thing in himself and not in him only but i can fancy that the whole group of them sitting round her where she was crouched against miranda king's knees were panting away like steam engines before they had done with her while mr robson was there miranda never took her arm off her shoulder for a moment but the girl's eyes were always fixed upon andrew who called himself her husband unless her apprehensions were directly called elsewhere in that case she would look in the required direction for the fraction of a second terrified and ready as you may say to die at a movement and then her fears at rest back to her husband's face mr robson's first business was to examine andrew king a perfectly honest well behaved lad whom he had known from his cradle he was candid up to a point he had found her on the top of knapp fell he said she had been with others who ill treated her what others others of her sort fairies he said who lived up there he pressed him about this fairies did he really believe in such beings like all country people he spoke about these things with the utmost difficulty and when confronted by worldly wisdom became dogged he said how could he help it when here was one mr robson told him that he was begging the question but he looked very blank to the surprise of the minister old king old george king the grandfather had no objections to make to the suggestion of fairies on knapp fell he could not say there was no telling knapp was a known place strange things were recorded of the forest miranda his daughter in law was always a self contained woman with an air about her of being forewarned he instanced her and the minister asked her several questions being pressed she finally said sir my son is as likely right as wrong we must all make up our own minds there that matter had to be left andrew said that he had followed the fairies from the tarn on lammer fell into knapp forest they had run away from him taking this girl of his as he supposed with them he had followed them because he meant to have her they knew that so had run why did he want her he said that he had seen her before when oh long ago when he had been up there alone he had seen her face among the trees for a moment they had been hurting her she looked at him she was frightened but couldn't cry out only look and ask he had never forgotten her her looks had called him often and he had kept his eyes wide open now when he had found her again he determined to have her and at last he said he had got her he had had to fight for her for they had been about him like hell cats and had jumped at him as if they would tear him to pieces and screamed and hissed like cats but when he had got her in his arms they had all screamed together once like a howling wind and had flown away what next here he became obstinate as if foreseeing what was to be what next he had married her married her how could he marry a fairy on the top of knapp fell was there a church there by chance had a licence been handy let me see her lines andrew mr robson had said somewhat sternly in conclusion his answer had been to lift up her left hand and show the thin third finger it carried a ring made of plaited rush i put that on her he said and said all the words over her out of the book and you think you have married her andrew it was put to him ex cathedra he grew very red and was silent presently he said well sir i do think so but she's not my wife yet if that's what you mean the good gentleman felt very much relieved it was satisfactory to him that he could still trust his worthy young parishioner entirely under the influence of miranda king he found the family unanimous for a real wedding to that there were two objections to make he could not put up the banns of a person without a name and would not marry a person unbaptised now to baptise an adult something more than sponsors are requisite there must be voluntary assent to the doctrines of religion by the postulant in this case how to be obtained he saw no way since it was by no means plain to him that the girl could understand a word that was said he left the family to talk it over among themselves saying as he went out of the door that his confidence in their principles was so strong that he was sure they would sanction no step which would lead the two young people away from the church door in the morning miranda king came to him with a report that matters had been arranged and only needed his sanction i can trust my son and see him take her with a good conscience she told him she's not one of his people but she's one of mine and what i have done she can do and is willing to do the clergyman was puzzled what do you mean by that mrs king he asked her what are your people how do they differ from mine or your husband's she hesitated well sir in this way she hasn't got your tongue nor my son's tongue she has none at all said the minister but miranda replied she can talk without her tongue yes my dear he said but i cannot but i can was her answer she can talk to me and will talk to you but not yet she's dumb for a season she's struck so my son will give her back her tongue by and by he was much interested he asked miranda to tell him who had struck her dumb for a long time she would not answer we don't name him it's not lawful he that has the power the master i can go no nearer he urged her to openness got her at last to mention the king of the wood the king of the wood there she stuck and nothing he could say could move her from that name the king of the wood he left it so knowing his people and having other things to ask about what tongue or speech had the respectable the staid miranda king in common with the scared waif to that she answered that she could not tell him but that it was certain they could understand each other how by looks she said and added scornfully she's not the kind that has to clatter with her tongue to have speech with her kindred miranda then was a kinswoman he showed his incredulity and the woman flushed see here mr robson she said i am of the sea and she of the fell but we are the same nation we are not of yours but you can make us so directly i saw her i knew what she was and so did she know me how by the eyes and understanding i felt who she was as she is now so was i once as i am now so will she be i'll answer for her i'm here to do it when once i'd followed my man i never looked back no more will she the woman obeys the man that's the law if a girl of your people was taken with a man of mine she'd lose her speech and forsake her home and ways that's the law all the world over god almighty's self if he were a woman would do the same he couldn't help it the law is his but he made it so sure that not himself could break it what law do you mean she was asked she said the law of life the woman follows the man this proposition he was not prepared to deny and the end of it was that mr robson baptised the girl taking miranda for godmother mabilla they called her by her sponsor's desire mabilla by the wood and as such she was published and married you may be disposed to blame him for lightness of conscience but i take leave to tell you that he had had the cure of souls in dryhope for five and thirty years he claimed on that score to know his people the more he knew of them the less he was able to question the lore of such an one as miranda king and he might remind you that mabilla king is alive to this hour a wife and mother of children that is a fact and it is also a fact as i am about to tell you that she had a hard fight to win such peace married made a woman she lost her haunted look and gained some colour in her cheeks she lost her mortal chill her clothing the putting up of her hair made some difference but loving entreaty all the difference in the world to a casual glance there was nothing but refinement to distinguish her from her neighbours to a closer one there was more than that her eyes they said had the far intent rapt gaze of a wild animal they seemed to search minutely reaching beyond our power of vision to find there things beyond our human ken but whereas the things which she looked at invisible to us caused her no dismay those within our range the most ordinary and commonplace filled her with alarm her eyes you may say communed with the unseen and her soul followed their direction and dwelt remote from her body she was easily startled not only by what she saw but by what she heard nobody was ever more sensitive to sound they say that a piano tuner goes not by sound but by the vibrations of the wire which he is able to test without counting it was so with her she seemed to feel the trembling of the circumambient air and to know by its greater or less intensity that something and very often what thing in particular was affecting it all her senses were preternaturally acute she could see incredible distances hear smell in a way that only wild nature can added to these she had another sense whereby she could see what was hidden from us and understand what we could not even perceive one could guess as much on occasions by the absorbed intensity of her gaze but when she was with her husband which was whenever he would allow it she had no eyes ears senses or thoughts for any other living thing seen or unseen she followed him about like a dog and when that might not be her eyes followed him sometimes when he was afield with his sheep they saw her come out of the cottage and slink up the hedgerow to the fell's foot she would climb the brae search him out and then crouch down and sit watching him never taking her eyes off him when he was at home her favourite place was at his feet she would sit huddled there for hours and his hand would fall upon her hair or rest on her shoulder and you could see the pleasure thrilling her raying out from her just as you can see as well as hear a cat purring by the fire he used to whisper in her ear as if she was a child like a child she used to listen and wonder whether she understood him or no it was sometimes the only way of soothing her her trembling stopped at the sound of his voice and her eyes left off staring and showed the glow of peace for whole long evenings they sat close together his hand upon her hair and his low voice murmuring in her ear this much the neighbours report and the clergyman confirms as also that all went well with the young couple for the better part of two years the girl grew swiftly towards womanhood became sleek and well liking had a glow and a promise of ripeness which bid fair to be redeemed a few omens however remained disquieting when those who loved her thought of them one was that she got no human speech though she understood everything that was said to her another that she showed no signs of motherhood a third that bessie prawle could not abide her she alone of all the little community avoided the king household and scowled whensoever she happened to cross the path of this gentle outland girl jealousy was presumed the cause but i think there was more in it than that i think that bessie prawle believed her to be a witch iii to eyes prepared for coming disaster things small in themselves loom out of a clear sky portentous such eyes had not young andrew king the bride groom a youth made man by love secure in his treasure and confident in his power of keeping what his confidence had won such eyes may or may not have had mabilla though hers seemed to be centred in her husband where he was or where he might be george king was old and looked on nothing but his sheep or the weather as it might affect his sheep miranda king the self contained stoic woman had schooled her eyes to see her common duties whatever else she may have seen she kept within the door of her shut lips she may have known what was coming she must have known that whatever came had to come bessie prawle however with hatred bitter fear and jealousy to sharpen her saw much bessie prawle was a handsome red haired girl deep in the breast full eyed and of great colour her strength was remarkable she could lift a heifer into a cart and had once being dared to it carried andrew king up the brae in her arms the young man she supposed owed her a grudge for that she believed herself unforgiven and saw in this sudden marriage of his a long meditated act of revenge by that in her eyes and as she thought in the eyes of all dryhope he had ill requited her put her to unthinkable shame she saw herself with her favours of person and power passed over for a nameless haunted dumb thing a stray from some other world into a world of men women and the children they rear to follow them she scorned mabilla for flinching so much she scorned her for not flinching more that mabilla could be desirable to andrew king made her scoff that andrew king should not know her dangerous kept her awake at night for the world seemed to her a fearful place since mabilla had been brought into it there were signs everywhere that summer it thundered out of a clear sky once in the early morning she had seen a bright light above the sun a mock sun which shone more fiercely than a fire in daylight she heard wild voices singing on still days she saw the trees in knapp forest bent to a furious wind when mabilla crept up the fell on noiseless feet to spy for andrew king bessie prawle heard the bents hiss and crackle under her as if she set them afire next summer too there were portents there was a great drought so great that dryhope burn ran dry and water had to be fetched from a distance for the sheep there were heather fires in many places smut got into the oats and a plague of caterpillars attacked the trees so that in july they were leafless and there was no shade there was no pasture for the kine which grew lean and languid their bones stuck out through their skin they moaned as they lay on the parched earth and had not strength enough to swish at the clouds of flies they had sores upon them which festered and spread if mabilla the nameless wife was not responsible for this who could be perhaps heaven was offended with dryhope on account of andrew king's impiety bessie believed that mabilla was a witch she followed the girl about spying on everything she did once at least she came upon her lying in the heather she was plaiting rushes together into a belt and bessie thought she was weaving a spell and sprang upon her the girl cowered very white and bessie prawle her heart on fire gave tongue to all her bitter thoughts the witch wife fairy wife child or whatever she was seemed to wither as a flower in a hot wind bessie prawle towered above her in her strength and gained invective with every fierce breath she took her blue eyes burned her bosom heaved like the sea her arm bared to the shoulder could have struck a man down yet in the midst of her frenzied speech in full flow she faltered her fists unclenched themselves her arm dropped nerveless her eyes sought the ground andrew king pale with rage sterner than she had ever seen him stood before her he looked at her with deadly calm be out of this he said you degrade yourself never let me see you again before she had shrunk away he had stooped to the huddled creature at his feet had covered her with his arms and was whispering urgent comfort in her ear caressing her with voice and hands bessie prawle could not show herself to the neighbours for the rest of the summer and early autumn she became a solitary the neighbours said that she was in a decline the drought with all the troubles it entailed of plague pestilence and famine continued through august and september it did not really break till all hallow's and then indeed it did the day had been overcast with a sky of a coppery tinge and intensely dry heat a chance puff of wind smote one in the face hot as the breath of a man in fever the sheep panted on the ground their dry tongues far out of their mouths the beasts lay as if dead and flies settled upon them in clouds all the land was of one glaring brown where the bents were dry straw and the heather first burnt and then bleached pallid by the sun the distance was blurred in a reddish lurid haze knapp fell and its forest were hidden mabilla the dumb girl had been restless all day following andrew about like a shadow the heat had made him irritable more than once he had told her to go home and she had obeyed him for the time but had always come back her looks roamed wide she seemed always listening sometimes it was clear that she heard something for she panted and moved her lips there was deep trouble in her eyes too she seemed full of fear at almost any other time her husband would have noticed it and comforted her but his nerves fretted by the long scorching summer were on this day of fire stretched to the cracking point he saw nothing and felt nothing but his own discomfort out on the parched fell side bessie prawle sat like a bird of omen and gloomed at the wrath to come toward dusk a wind came moaning down the valley raising little spires of dust it came now down now up sometimes two currents met each other and made momentary riot but farm work has to get itself done through fair or foul it grew dark the sheep were folded and fed the cattle were got in and the family sat together in the kitchen silent preoccupied the men oppressed and anxious over they knew not what as for those two aliens miranda king and mabilla by the wood whatever they knew one of them made no sign at all and the other though she was white though she shivered and peered about had no means of voicing her thought they had their tea and settled to their evening tasks the old shepherd dozed over his pipe miranda knitted fast mabilla stared out of the window into the dark twisting her hands and andrew with one of his hands upon her shoulder patted her gently as if to soothe her she gave him a grateful look more than once but did not cease to shiver nobody spoke and suddenly in the silence mabilla gasped and began to tremble then the dog growled under the table all looked up and about them a scattering pattering sound lashed at the window andrew then started up rain he said that's what we're waiting for and made to go to the door miranda his mother and mabilla his young wife caught him by the frock and held him back the dog staring into the window pane bristling and glaring continued to growl they waited in silence but with beating hearts a loud knock sounded suddenly on the door a dull heavy blow as if one had pounded it with a tree stump the dog burst into a panic of barking flew to the door and sniffed at the threshold he whined and scratched frantically with his forepaws the wind began to blow coming quite suddenly down solid upon the wall of the house shaking it upon its foundations george king was now upon his feet good god almighty he said this is the end of the world the blast was not long lived it fell to a murmur andrew king now at the window could see nothing of the rain there were no drops upon the glass nor sound upon the sycamores outside but even while he looked and his grandfather all his senses alert waited for what was to come and the two pale women clung together knowing what was to come there grew gradually another sound which because it was familiar brought their terrors sharply to a point it was the sound of sheep in a flock running it came from afar and grew in volume and distinctness the innumerable small thudding of sharp hoofs the rustling of woolly bodies the volleying of short breath and that indefinable sense of bustle which massed things produce passing swiftly the sheep came on panic driven voiceless in their fear but speaking aloud in the wildly clanging bells they swept by the door of the house with a sound like the rush of water they disappeared in that flash of sound old king cried man 'tis the sheep and flew for his staff and shoes miranda followed to fetch them but andrew went to the door as he was shaking off his clinging wife unlatched it and let in a gale of wind the dog shot out like a flame of fire and was gone it was as if the wind which was driving the sheep was going to scour the house it came madly with indescribable force it rushed into the house blew the window curtains toward the middle of the room drove the fire outward and set the ashes whirling like snow all about andrew king staggered before it a moment then put his head down and beat his way out mabilla shuddering shrank backward to the fireplace and crouched there waiting old king came out booted and cloaked his staff in his hand battled to the door and was swept up the brae upon the gale miranda did not appear so mabilla white and rigid was alone in the whirling room creeping to her through the open door holding to whatever solid thing she could come by entered bessie prawle in all that turmoil and chill terror she alone was hot her grudge was burning in her she could have killed mabilla with her eyes but she did not for mabilla was in the hands of greater and stronger powers before bessie prawle's shocked eyes she was seen rigid and awake she was seen to cower as to some threatening shape then to stiffen to mutter with her dry lips and to grow still to stare with her wide eyes and then to see nothing a glaze swam over her eyes they were open but as the eyes of the dead bessie prawle horror struck stretched out her arms to give her shelter all her honest humanity was reborn in her in this dreadful hour my poor lass i'll not harm ye she was saying but mabilla had begun to move she moved as a sleep walker seeing but not seeing her way she moved as one who must not as one who would she went slowly as if drawn to the open door bessie never tried to stop her she could not though she would slowly as if drawn she went to the door staring before her pale as a cloth rigid as a frozen thing at the threshold she swayed for a moment in the power of the storm then she was sucked out like a dried leaf and was no more seen overhead all about the eaves of the house the great wind shrilled mockery and despairing mirth the fire leapt toward the middle of the room and fell back so much white ash bessie prawle plumped down to her knees huddled and prayed andrew king coming back found her there at it alone his eyes swept the room mabilla bessie prawle where is mabilla the girl huddled and prayed on he took her by the shoulder and shook her to and fro you foul wench you piece this is your doing bessie sobbed her denials but he would not hear her snatching up a staff he turned threw her down in his fury he left the house and followed the wind the wind caught him the moment he was outside and swept him onward whether he would or not he ran down the bank of the beck which seemed to be racing him for a prize leaping and thundering level with its banks before he had time to wonder whether the bridge still stood he was up with it over it and on the edge of the brae up the moorland road he went carried rather than running and where it loses itself in the first enclosure being hard up against the wall over he vaulted across the field and over the further wall out then upon the open fell where the heather makes great cushions and between all of them are bogs or stones he was swept by the wind it shrieked about him and carried him up and over as if he were a leaf of autumn beyond that was dangerous ground but there was no stopping he was caught in the flood of the gale he knew very well however whither it was carrying him to knapp that place of dread whither he was now sure mabilla had been carried resumed by her own people there was no drawing back there was no time for prayer all he could do was to keep his feet he was carried down the dryhope fell he said into the next valley swept somehow over the roaring beck in the bottom and up the rugged side of knapp where the peat hags are as high as rocks and presently knew without the help of his eyes that he was nearing the forest he heard the swishing of the trees the cracking of the boughs the sharp crack and crash which told of some limb torn off and sent to ruin and he knew also by some hush not far off that the wind great and furious as it was was to be quieted within that awful place it was so he stood panting upon the edge of the wood out of the wind which roared away overhead he twittered with his foolish lips not knowing what on earth to do nor daring to do anything had he known it but all the prayers he had ever learned were driven clean out of his head he could dimly make out the tree trunks immediately before him low bushes shelves of bracken fern he could pierce somewhat into the gloom beyond and see the solemn trees ranked in their order and above them a great soft blackness rent here and there to show the sky the volleying of the storm sounded like the sea heard afar off it was so remote and steady a noise that lesser sounds were discernible the rustlings squeakings and snappings of small creatures moving over small undergrowth every one of these sent his heart leaping to his mouth but all his fears were to be swallowed up in amazement for as he stood there distracted without warning without shock there stood one by him within touching distance a child as he judged it with loose hair and bright eyes prying into his face smiling at him and inviting him to come on who in god's name cried andrew king but the child plucked him by the coat and tried to draw him into the wood i understand that he did not hesitate if he had forgotten his gods he had not forgotten his fairy wife i suppose too that he knew where to look for her he may have supposed that she had been resumed into her first state at any rate he made his way into the forest by guess work aided by reminiscence i believe he was accustomed to aver that he knew where she was very well and that he took a straight line to her i have seen knapp forest and doubt it he did however find himself in the dark spaces of the wood and there sure enough he did also see the women with whom his mabilla had once been co mate they came about him he said like angry cats hissing and shooting out their lips they did not touch him but if eyes and white hateful faces could have killed him dead he had been then and there he called upon god and christ and made a way through them his senses had told him where mabilla was he found her pale and trembling in an aisle of the trees she leaned against a tall tree perfectly rigid as cold as a stone staring across him with frozen eyes her mouth open like a round o he took her in his arms and holding her close turned and defied the witches so he called them in his wrath he dared them in the name of god to touch him or his wife and as he did so he says that he felt the chill grow upon him it took him he said in the legs and ran up his body it stiffened his arms till they felt as if they must snap under the strain it caught him in the neck and fixed it he felt his eyes grow stiff and hard he felt himself sway then he said the dark swam over me the dark and the bitter cold and i knew nothing more questioned as he was by mr robson and his friends he declared that it was at the name of god the cold got him first he saw the women hushed and scared and at the same time one of them looked over her shoulder as if somebody was coming had he called in the king of the wood that is what he himself thought it was the king of the wood who had come in quest of mabilla had pulled her out of the cottage in dryhope and frozen her in the forest it was he no doubt said andrew king who had come to defy the christian and his god i detect here the inspiration of his mother miranda the strange sea woman who knew mabilla without mortal knowledge and spoke to her in no mortal speech but the sequel to the tale is a strange one andrew king awoke to find himself in mabilla's arms to hear for the first time in his life mabilla call him softly by his name andrew my husband she called him and when he opened his eyes in wonder to hear her she said andrew take me home now it is all over or words to that effect they went along the forest and up and down the fells together the wind had dropped the stars shone and together they took up their life where they had dropped it with one significant omission in its circumstance bessie prawle had disappeared from dryhope she had followed him up the fell on the night of the storm but she came not back and they say that she never did nothing was found of her body though search was made but a comb she used to wear was picked up they say by the tarn on limmer fell an imitation tortoise shell comb which used to hold up her hair miranda king who knew more than she would ever tell had a shrewd suspicion of the truth of the case but andrew king knew nothing and i daresay cared very little he had his wood wife and she had her voice and between them i believe they had a child within the year i ought to add that i have with these eyes seen mabilla by the wood who became mabilla king when i went from dryhopedale to knapp forest she stood at the farmhouse door with a child in her arms two others were tumbling about in the croft she was a pretty serious girl for she looked quite a girl with a round face and large greyish blue eyes she had a pink cotton dress on and a good figure beneath it she was pale but looked healthy and strong not a tall girl i asked her the best way to knapp forest and she came out to the gate to point it to me she talked simply with a northern accent and might have been the child of generations of borderers she pointed me the very track by which andrew king must have brought her home by which the king of the wood swept her out on the wings of his wrath she named the tarn where once she dwelt as the spirit of a tree all this without a flush a tremor or a sign in her blue eyes that she had ever known the place but these people are close and seldom betray all that they know or think oreads i end this little book with an experience of my own or rather a series of experiences and will leave conclusions to a final chapter i don't say that i have no others which could have found a place indeed there are many others but they were fitful momentary things unaccountable and unrelated to each other without the main clue which in itself is too intimate a thing to be revealed just yet and i am afraid of compiling a catalogue i have travelled far and wide across europe in my day not without spiritual experiences if at some future time these co ordinate into a body of doctrine i will take care to clothe that body in the vesture of print and paper here meantime is something of recent years my house at broad chalke stands in a narrow valley which a little stream waters more than enough this valley is barely a mile broad throughout its length and in my village scarcely half so much i can be in the hills in a quarter of an hour and in five and twenty minutes find myself deeply involved out of sight of man or his contrivances the downs in south wilts are nowhere lofty and have none of the abrupt grandeur of those which guard the sussex coast and weald but they are of much larger extent broader longer more untrodden made much more intricate by the numberless creeks and friths which through some dim cycle of antiquity the sea ebbing gradually to the great avon delta must have graved beautiful with quiet and a solemn peacefulness of their own they always are they endure enormously in saecula saeculorum storms drive over them mists and rains blot them out rarely they are shrouded in a fleece of snow in spring the clouds and the light hold races up their flanks in summer they seem to drowse like weary monsters in the still and fervent heat they are never profoundly affected by such changes of nature's face grow not awful sharing her wrath nor dangerously fair when she woos them with kisses to love they are the quiet and sober spokesmen of earth clad in quaker greys and drabs they show no crimson at sunset no gilded livery at dawn the grey deepens to cool purple the brown glows to russet at such festal times early in the spring they may drape themselves in tender green or show their sides dappled with the white of sheep flowers they bear but secretly little curious orchids bodied like bees eyed like spiders flecked with the blood drops of attis or adonis or some murdered shepherd boy pale scabious pale cowslip thyme that breathes sharp fragrance aromatic pain as you crush it potentilla lady's slipper cloudy blue milkwort toad flax that shows silver to the wind such as these they flaunt not but wear for choiceness you would not see them unless you knew them there for denizens they have the hare the fox and the badger redwings wheatears peewits and airy kestrels are the people of their skies i love above all the solitude they keep and to feel the pulsing of the untenanted air the shepherd and his sheep the limping hare lagging fox wheeling wailing plover such will be your company you may dip deeply into valleys where no others will be by hear the sound of your own heart or the shrilling of the wind in the upland bents i have heard indeed half a mile above me the singing of the great harps of wire which stretch from sarum to shaftesbury along the highest ridge but such a music is no disturbance of the peace rather it assures you of solitude for you wouldn't hear it were you not ensphered with it alone there's a valley in particular lying just under chesilbury where i choose most to be chesilbury a huge grass encampment three hundred yards square with fosse and rampart still sharp with a dozen gateways and three mist pools within its ambit which stands upon the ancient road and dominates two valleys below that coming up from the south is my charmed valley there i know the beings whom i call oreads for want of a homelier word haunt and are to be seen now and then i know because i myself have seen them i must describe this oread valley more particularly i believe east and west above it runs the old road we call the race plain the highest ground hereabouts rising from harnham by salisbury to end at shaftesbury in dorset north of this ridge is chesilbury camp immediately south of that is the valley here the falling flood as it drained away must have sucked the soil out sharply at two neighbouring points for this valley has two heads and between them stands a grass grown bluff the western vale head is quite round but very steep it faces due south and has been found grateful by thorns elders bracken and even heather but the eastern head is sharper begins almost in a point from that it sweeps out in a huge demi lune of cliff the outer cord being the east the inner hugging the bluff facing north from the valley facing these two heads you see the eastern of them like a great amphitheatre its steep embayed side so smooth as to seem the work of men's hands it is too steep for turf it is grey with marl and patchy where scree of flint and chalk has run and found a lodgment ice worn it may be man wrought it is not no red deer picks have been at work there no bright eyed scrambling hordes have toiled their shifts or left traces through the centuries as at the devil's dyke this noble arena is nature's here i saw her people more than once and the first sign i had of them was this i i was here alone one summer's night a night of stars but without a moon i lay within the scrub of the western valley head and looked south i could just see the profile of the enfolding hills but only just could guess that in the soft blackness below me filling up the foreground like a lake the valley was there indeed realise that if i stepped down perhaps thirty yards or so my feet would sink into the pile of the turf carpet and feel the sharp benediction of the dew about me surged and beat an enormous silence the only sound at all and that was fitful came from a fern owl which from a thorn bush above me churred softly and at intervals his content with the night the stars were myriad but sky marks shone out the bear the belt the chair the dancing sister pleiades the galaxy was like a snow cloud startlingly by one by two meteors flared a short course and died you never feel lonely when you have the stars yet they do not pry upon you you can hide nothing from them and need not seek to hide if they have foreknowledge they nurse no after thought now to night as i looked and wondered at their beauty i became aware of a phenomenon untold before yet so quietly did it come and so naturally that it gave me no disturbance nor forced itself upon me a luminous ring a ring of pale fire in shape a long narrow and fluctuating oval became discernible in the sky south of my stand point midway i thought between me and the south it was diaphanous or diaphanous to strong light behind it at one time i saw the great beacon of the south west saturn i think burning through it not within the ring but from behind the litten vapour of which the ring was made lesser fires than his were put out by it it varied very much in shape as it spread or drew out as a smoker's blue rings are varied by puffs of wind now it was a perfect round now so long as to be less a hoop than a fine oblong sometimes it was pear shaped sometimes amorphous bulbous here hollow there and there seemed movement i thought now and again that it was spiral as well as circular that it might under some stress of speed writhe upward like dust in a whirlwind it wavered certainly in elevation lifting sinking wafted one way or another with the ease of a cloud of gnats it was extraordinarily beautiful and exciting i watched it for an hour at times i seemed to be conscious of more than appearance i cannot speak more definitely than that music was assuredly in my head very shrill piercing continuous music no air no melody but the expectancy of an air preparation for it a prelude to melodious issues you may say the overture to some vast aerial symphony i know not what else to call it i was never more than alive to it never certain of it it was as furtive secret and tremulous as the dawn itself now just as under that shivering and tentative opening of great music you are conscious of the fierce energy of violins so was i aware in this surmise of music of wild forces which made it i thought not of voices but of wings i was sure that this ring of flame whirled as well as floated in the air the motion and the sound alike indecipherable were one and the same to me i watched it i say for an hour it may have been for two hours by and by it came nearer gradually very near it was now dazzling not to be looked at full but its rate of approach was inappreciable and as it came on i was able to peer into it and see nothing but its beauty there was a core of intensity intolerably bright about that lambency but no flame in which i saw leaves and straws and fronds of fern flickering spiring heeling over and over that it whirled as well as floated was now clear for a strong wind blew before and after it as it rushed by this happened as i sat there blinding but not burning heralded by a keen wind it came by me and passed a swift wind followed it as it went it swept out toward the hollow of the eastern valley head seemed to strike upon that and glance upward thence it swept gladly up streaming to the zenith grew thin fine and filmy and seemed to melt into the utmost stars i had seen wonders and went home full of thought ii i first saw an oread in this place in a snow storm which driven by a north westerly gale did havoc to the lowlands but not to the folded hills i had pushed up the valley in the teeth of the storm to see it under the white stress it was hard work for me and my dog i had to wade knee deep and he to jump like a cat in long grass through the drifts but we reached our haven and found shelter from the weather high above us where we stood the snow flakes tossed and rioted but before they fell upon us being out of the wind they drifted idly down come in alpe senza vento the whole valley was purely white its outlines blurred by the slant driving snow there was not a living creature to be seen and my dog a little sharp nosed black beast shivered as he looked about with wide eyes and quick set ears for a friendly sight and held one paw tentatively in the air as if he feared the cold suddenly he yelped once and ran limping on three legs or scuttling on all four over the snow toward the great eastern escarpment but midway stopped and looked with all his might into its smoothed hollow his jet black ears stood sharp as a hare's through the white scud i was conscious that he trembled he gazed into the sweep of the curving hill and following the direction he gave me all my senses quick i gazed also but for a while saw nothing very gradually without alarm on my part a blur of colour seemed to form itself and centre in one spot half way up the concave of the down very pale yellow a soft lemon colour at first scarcely more than a warm tinge to the snow it took shape as i watched it and then body also it was now opaque within semi transparency one could trace an outline a form then i made out of it a woman dressed in yellow a slim woman tawny haired in a thin smock of lemon yellow which flacked and bellied in the gale her hair blew out to it in snaky streamers sideways her head was bent to meet the cold her bare white arms were crossed and hugged her shoulders as if to keep her bosom warm from mid thigh downward she was bare and very white yet distinct upon the snow that was the white of chilled flesh i could see though she wore but a single garment and that of the thinnest and shortest though she suffered cold hugged herself and shivered she was not of our nature to die of such exposure her eyes as i could guess were long enduring and steadfast her lips were not blue though her teeth seemed to chatter she was not rigid with the stiffening that precedes frozen death drawing near her by degrees coming within fifteen yards of where she stood and passioned though she saw me waited for me in a way expected me she showed neither fear nor embarrassment nor appealed by looks for shelter she was rather like a bird made tame by winter that finds the lesser fear swallowed up in a greater for myself as when one finds one's self before a new thing one stands and gazes so was i before this being of the wild i would go no nearer speak i could not but i had no fear she was new to me not strange i felt that she and i belonged to worlds apart that as soon might i hope to be familiar with fox or marten as with her my little black dog was of the same mind he was glad when i joined him and wagged his little body tail he has none to say so but he had no eyes for me nor i for him we stood together for company and filled our eyes with the tenant of the waste how long we watched her i have no notion but the day fell swiftly in and found us there she was i take it quite young she was slim and of ordinary proportions when i say that i mean that she had nothing inhuman about her stature was neither giant nor pygmy whether she was what we call good looking or not i find it impossible to determine for when strangeness is so added to beauty as to absorb and transform it our standards are upset and balances thrown out she was pale to the lips had large fixed and patient eyes her arms and legs showed greyish in the white storm but where the smock was cut off the shadows it made upon her were faintly warm one of her knees was bent the foot supported only by the toes the other was firm upon the ground she looked to the casual eye to be standing on one leg her eyes in a stare covered me but were not concerned to see me so near they had the undiscerning look of one whose mind is numbed as hers might well be shelter a barn a hayrick lay within a mile of her and yet she chose to suffer the cold and was able to endure it she knew it i supposed for a thing not to be avoided she took it as it came as she would have taken the warmth and pleasure of the sun we humankind with our wits for ever turned inward to ourselves grieve or exult as we bid ourselves she like all other creatures else was not in that self relation her parts were closer knit and could not separate to envisage each other so at least i read her that she lived as she could and as she must neither looked back with regret nor forward with longing time present the flashing moment was all her being that state will never be ours again i discovered before nightfall what she waited for there alone in the cruel weather a moving thing emerged from the heart of the white fury came up the valley along the shelving down a shape like hers free moving thinly clad suffering yet not paralysed by the storm it shaped as a man a young man and her mate taller darker stoutlier made his hardy legs were browner and so were his arms crossed like hers over his breast and clasping his shoulders his head was bare dark and crisply covered with short hair his smock whipped about him before as the wind drove it behind him it flacked and fluttered like a flag patiently forging his way bowing his head to the gale he came into range and she aware of him waited he came directly to her they greeted by touchings he stretched out his hands to her touched her shoulders and sides he touched both her cheeks her chin the top of her head all with the flat of the palm he stroked her wet and streaming hair he held her by the shoulders and peered into her face then put both arms about her and drew her to him she who had so far made no motions of her own now uncrossed her arms and daintily touched him in turn she put both her palms flat upon his breast next on his thighs next being within the circle of his arms she put up her hands and cupped his face then with a gesture like a sigh she let them fall to his waist fastened them about him and let her head lie on his bosom she shut her eyes seemed contented and appeased he clasped her with a fine protecting air upon him looking down tenderly at her resting head so they stood together in the dusk while the wind tore at their thin covering and the snow lying made a broad patch of white upon his shoulder breathless i looked at them and my dog forgot to be cold high on his haunches with lifted forepaw and sharp cocked ears he watched trembled and whined after a while impatient as it appeared of the ravaging storm the male drew the female to the ground they used no language as we understand it and made no sign that i could see but rather sank together to get the shelter of the drift he lay upon the snow upon the weather side she close beside him they crouched like two birds in a storm and hid their heads under their interlacing arms he gave the weather his back and raised himself on his elbow the better to shield her within his arm she lay and cuddled to him snugly i can describe his action no more closely than by saying that he covered her as a hen her chick as a partridge grouts with her wings in a dusty furrow so he worked in the powdered snow to make her a nest when the night fell upon them with its promise of bitter frost in the unrelenting wind she lay screened against its rigours by the shelter of him they were very still their heads were together their cheeks touched i believe that they slept iii in the autumn in harvest time i saw her with a little one she was lying now deeply at ease in the copse wood of the valley head within a nest of brake fern and her colouring was richer more in tune with the glory of the hour she had a burnt glow in her cheeks her hair showed the hue of the corn which not a mile away our people were reaping afield from where we were she and i one could hear the rattle of the machine as it swept down the tall and serried wheat it was the top of noon when i found her the sun high in heaven but so fierce in his power that you saw him through a mist of his own making and the sky all about him white as a sea fog the oread's body was sanguine brown only her breast which i saw half revealed through a slit in her smock was snowy white it was the breast of a maiden not of a mother with a young child she leaned over it and watched it asleep once or twice she touched its head in affection then presently looked up and saw me if i had had no surprise coming upon her neither now had she her eyes took me in as mine might take in a tree not noticed before or a flowering bush or a finger post such things might well be there and might well not be i had no particular interest for her and gave her no alarm nothing assures me so certainly of her remoteness from myself and of my kinship with her too as this absence of shock she allowed me to come nearer and nearer still to stand close over her and examine the child she did not lift her head but i knew that she was aware of me for her eyelids lifted and fell quickly and showed me once or twice her watchful eyes she was indeed a beautiful creature exquisite in make and finish her skin shone like the petals of certain flowers there is one especially called sisyrinchium whose common name of satin flower describes a surface almost metallic in its lustre i thought of that immediately her skin drank in and exhaled light i could not hit upon the stuff of which her shift was made it looked like coarse silk had a web had fibres or threads it may have been flax but that it was much too sinuous it seemed to stick to the body where it touched even to seek the flesh where it did not touch that it might cling like gossamer with invisible tentacles in colour it was very pale yellow not worn nor stained it was perfectly simple sleeveless and stopped half way between the hip and the knee i looked for but could not discover either hem or seam her feet and hands were very lovely the toes and fingers long and narrow rosy brown i had full sight of her eyes for one throbbing moment extraordinarily bright quick and pulsing waxing and waning in intensity as if an inner light beat in them of the grey colour of a chipped flint stone the lashes were long curving and very dark they were what you might call smut colour and gave a blurred effect to the eyes which was strange this among other things was what set her apart from us this and the patient yet palpitating stare of her regard she looked at me suddenly widely and full taking in much more than me yet making me the centre of her vision it gave me the idea that she was surprised at my nearness and ready for any attack but did not seek to avoid it there i was overstanding her and her offspring and what was must be of the little one i could not see much it was on its side in the fern fast asleep its arms were stretched up the slope its face was between them its knees were bent and a little foot tucked up to touch its body quite naked brown all over it was as plump and smooth and tender as a little pig but it was not pink it was very brown all nature seemed at the top of perfection that wonderful day a hawk soared high in the blue bees murmured all about the distance quivered i could see under the leaves of a great mullein the bright eyes then the round body of a mouse afar off the corn cutter rattled and whirred and above us on the ridgeway some workmen sat at their dinner under the telegraph wires men were all about us at their affairs with nature's face and here stood i a man of themselves and at my feet the oread lay at ease and watched her young there was food for wonder in all this but none for doubt who knows what his neighbour sees who knows what his dog every species of us walks secret from the others every species of us the centre of his universe its staple of measure and its final cause and if at times one is granted a peep into new heavens and a new earth and can get no more perhaps the best thing we win from that is the conviction that we must doubt nothing and wonder at everything here now was i common blundering trampling make shift man peering upon my oread fairy of the hill whatever she was and tempted to gauge her by my man taught balances of right and wrong and use and wont was that young male who had sheltered her in the snow her mate in truth the father of her young one or what sort of mating had been hers what wild love what mysteries of the night and where was he now and was he one or were they many who companioned this beautiful thing and would he come if i waited for him and would he share her watch her quiet content her still rapture idle man made questions custom taught i did wait i sat by her waiting but he did not come iv a month later in october i saw a great assembling of oreads by which i was able to connect more than one experience i could now understand the phenomenon of the luminous ring i reached the valley by about six o'clock in the evening it was twilight not yet dusk the sun was off the hollow which lay in blue mist but above the level of the surrounding hills the air was bathed in the sunset glow the hush of evening was over all the great cup of the down absolutely desert there were no birds nor voices of birds not a twig snapped not a leaf rustled imperceptibly the shadows lengthened faded with the light and again behind the silence i guessed at rather than discerned a preparatory gathering music so finally by twos and threes they came to their assembling once more i never saw them come out of the mist they drifted together there had been a moment when they were not there there was a moment when i saw them i saw three of them together two females and a male they formed a circle facing inwards their arms intertwined the pale colour of their garments the grey tones in their flesh were so perfectly in tune with the hazy light that it would have been impossible i am certain to have seen them at all at a hundred yards' distance i could not determine whether they were conversing or not if they were it was without speech i have never heard an articulate sound from any one of them and have no provable reason for connecting the unvoiced music i have sometimes discerned with any act of theirs it has accompanied them and may have proceeded from them but i don't know that of these three linked together i remember that one of them threw back her head till she faced the sky she did not laugh or seem to be laughing there was no sound it was rather as if she was bathing her face in the light she threw her head back so far that i could see the gleam in her wild eyes her hair streamed downward straight as a fall of water the other two regarded her and the male presently withdrew one of his arms from the circle and laid his hand upon her she let it be so seemed not to notice imperceptibly others had come about these three if i took my eyes off a group for a moment they were attracted to other groups or single shapes some lay at ease on the sward resting on elbow some prone on both elbows some seemed asleep their heads on molehill pillows some sat huddling together with their chins upon their knees some knelt face to face and held each other fondly some were teasing some chasing others winding in and out of the scattered groups but everything was doing in complete silence now and again one flying from another would rise in the air the pursuer following they skimmed soared glided like swallows in long sweeping curves there was no noise in their flight they were quite without reticence in their intercourse desired or avoided loved or hated as the moment urged them strove to win struggled to escape achieved or surrendered without remark from their companions they were like children or animals desire was reason good and if love was soon over hate lasted no longer one passion or the other set them scuffling when it was spent they had no after thought one pretty sight i saw a hare came lolloping over the valley bottom quite at his ease in the midst of the assembly he stopped to nibble then reared himself up and cleaned his face he saw them and they him without concern on either side the valley filled up i could not count the shifting crossing restless shapes i saw down there presently without call or signal as if by one consent the oreads joined hands and enclosed the whole circuit in their ring the effect in the dusk was of a pale glow as of the softest fire defining the contour of the valley and soon they were moving circling round and round shriller and louder swelled the hidden music and faster span the ring it whirled and wavered lifted and fell but so smoothly with such inherent power of motion that it was less like motion visible than motion heard nothing was distinguishable but the belt of pale fire that which i had seen before they had now become a ring of flame intensely swift as if sucked upward by a centripetal force it rose in the air wheeling still with a sound incredibly shrill it rose to my level swept by me heralded by a keen wind and was followed by a draught which caught leaves and straws of grass and took them swirling along round and up and ever up it went narrowing and spiring to the zenith there looking long after it i saw it diminish in size and brightness till it became filmy as a cloud then melted into the company of the stars a summary chapter now it is the recent publication by mr evans wentz of a careful and enthusiastic work upon the fairy faith in celtic countries which has inspired me to put these pages before the public some of them have appeared in the magazines as curious recitals and may have afforded pastime to the idle minded but without the courageous initiative of mr wentz i don't know that i should have attempted to give them such coherence as they may claim to possess and that i fear will be very little without this chapter in which i shall if i can clear the ground for a systematic study of the whole subject no candid reader can i hope rise from the perusal of the book without the conviction that behind the world of appearance lies another and a vaster with a thronging population of its own with many populations indeed each absorbed in uttering its being according to its own laws if i have afforded nothing else i have afforded glimpses into that world and the question now is what do we precisely gather what can we be said to know of the laws of that world in which these swift beautiful and apparently ruthless creatures live and move and utter themselves i shall have to draw upon more than i have recorded here cases which i have heard of which i have read of in other men's books as well as those which are related here as personal revelation if i speak pragmatically ex cathedra it is not intentional if i fail sometimes to give chapter and verse it will be because i have never taken any notes of what has gone into my memory and have no documents to hand but i don't invent i remember there is a chain of being of whose top alike and bottom we know nothing at all what we do know is that our own is a link in it and cannot generally can only fitfully and rarely have intercourse with any other i am not prepared with any modern instances of intercourse with the animal and vegetable world even to such a limited extent for instance as that of balaam with his ass or that of achilles with his horses but i suspect that there are an enormous number unrecorded speech of course is not necessary to such an intercourse speech is a vehicle of human intercourse but not of that of any other created order so far as we know birds and beasts do not converse in speech smell or touch seems to be the sense employed and though the vehicles of smell and touch are unknown to us in moments of high emotion we ourselves converse otherwise than by speech indeed seeing that all created things possess a spirit whereby they are what they are it does not seem necessary to suppose intercourse impossible without speech and i myself have never had any difficulty in accepting the stories of much more vital mixed intercourse which we read of in the greek and other mythologies if we read for instance that such and such a man or woman was the offspring of a woman and the spirit of a river or of a man and the spirit of a hill or oak tree it does not seem to me at all extraordinary the story of the wife who suffered a fairy union and bore a fairy child which disappeared with her is a case in point the fairy father was so far as i can make out the indwelling spirit of a rose and the story is too painful and the detail in my possession too exact for me to put it down here i was myself actually present and in the house when the child was born i witnessed the anguish of the unfortunate husband who is now dead mr wentz has many instances of the kind from ireland and other celtic countries but fairies are by no means confined to celtic countries though they are more easily discerned by celtic races footnote the speech of balaam's ass or of balaam of achilles and his horses are of course necessary conventions of the poet's and do not imply that words passed between the parties of this chain of being then of which our order is a member the fairy world is another and more subtle member subtler in the right sense of the word because it is not burdened with a material envelope like man like the wind like the rose it has spirit but unlike any of the lower orders of which man is one it has no sensible wrapping unless deliberately it consents to inhabit one this as we know it frequently does i have mentioned several cases of the kind mrs ventris was one mabilla by the wood was another i have not personally come across any other cases where a male fairy took upon him the burden of a man than that of quidnunc even there i have never been satisfied that quidnunc became man to the extent that mrs ventris did quidnunc no doubt was the father of lady emily's children but were those children human there are some grounds for thinking so and in that case if the nature follows the male quidnunc must have doffed his immateriality and suffered real incarnation if they were fairy children the case is altered quidnunc need not have had a body at all now since it is clear that the fairy world is a real order of creation with laws of its own every whit as fixed and immutable as those of any other order known to naturalists it is very reasonable to inquire into the nature and scope of those laws i am not at all prepared at present to attempt anything like a digest of them that would require a lifetime and no small part of the task after marshalling the evidence would be to agree upon terms which would be intelligible to ourselves and yet not misleading to take polity alone are we to understand that any kind of government resembling that of human societies obtains among them when we talk of queens or kings of the fairies of oberon and titania for example are we using a rough translation of a real something or are we telling the mere truth is there a fairy king the king of the wood for instance who was he is there a fairy queen who is queen mab who is despoina who is the lady of the lake who is the greek basilissa ton bounon or greek megale kura of whom mr lawson tells us such suggestive things in his modern greek folk lore who is despoina with whom i myself have conversed a dread goddess not of human speech the truth i suspect is this there are as we know countless tribes clans or orders of fairies just as there are nations of men they confess the power of some greater spirit among themselves bow to it instantly and submit to its decrees but they do not so far as i can understand acknowledge a monarchy in any sense of ours if there is a supreme power over the fairy creation it is proserpine but hers is too remote an empire to be comparable to any of ours not even caesar not even the great king could hope to rule such myriads as she she may stand for the invisible creation no doubt but she would never have commerce with it no fairy hath seen her at any time no sovereignty such as we are now discussing would be applicable to her dominion that of artemis or that of pan is more comparable artemis is certainly ruler of the spirits of the air and water of the hills and shores of the sea and to some extent her power overlaps that of pan who is potent in nearly all land solitudes but really the two lord ships can be exactly discriminated they never conflict the legions of artemis are all female though on earth men as well as women worship her the legions of pan are all male though on earth he can chasten women as well as men but pan can do nothing against artemis nor she anything against him or any of his the decree or swift deed of either is respected by the other they are not then as earthly kings leaders of their hosts to battle against their neighbours fairies fight and marshal themselves for war mr wentz has several cases of the kind but pan and artemis have no share in these warfares queen mab is one of the many names and points to one of the many manifestations of artemis the lady of the lake is another both of these have died out and in the country she is generally hinted at under the veil of mistress of the wood or lady of the hill i heard the latter from a wiltshire shepherd the former is used in sussex in the cheviots and in lincolnshire and was introduced i believe by the gipsies titania was a name of romance and so was oberon that of her husband in romance queen mab has no husband nor will she ever have footnote but if this is true who is the king of the wood the statement is too sweeping but she is of course a goddess and not a queen in our sense of the word the fairies who partake of her nature just so far as we partake of theirs pray to her invoke her and make her offerings every day but a vital difference between their kind and ours is that they can see her and live and we never see the gods until we die they have no other leaders i believe and certainly no royal houses faculty is free in the fairy world to its utmost limit a fairy's power within his own order is limited only by the extent of his personal faculty and subject only to the gods there is no civil law to restrain him and no moral law no law at all except the law of being footnote apparent eccentricities of this law such as the obedience to iron or zinc if we may believe beckwith should be noted i can't explain them they seem arbitrary at first sight but nothing in nature is arbitrary we are contemplating then a realm nay a world where anarchy is the rule and anarchy in the widest sense the fairies are of a world where right and wrong don't obtain where possible and impossible are the only finger posts at cross roads for the gods themselves give no moral sanction to desire and hold up no moral check the fairies love and hate intensely they crave and enjoy they satisfy by kindness or cruelty they serve or enslave each other they give life or take it as their instinct appetite or whim may be but there is this remarkable thing to be noted that when a thing is dead they cannot be aware of its existence for them it is not it is as if it had never been ruth therefore is unknown their emotions are maimed to that serious extent that they cannot regret cannot pity cannot weep for sorrow they weep through rage but sorrow they know not similarly they cannot laugh for joy laughing with them is an expression of pleasure but not of joy here then at least we have the better of them i for one would not exchange my privilege of pity or my consolation of pure sorrow for all their transcendent faculty it is often said that fairies of both sexes seek our kind because we know more of the pleasure of love than they do since we know more of the griefs of it that is likely to be true but it is a great mistake to suppose that they are unsusceptible to the great heights and deeps of the holy passion it is to make the vulgar confusion between the passion and the expression of it they are capable of the greatest devotion to the beloved of the greatest sacrifice of all the sacrifice of their own nature these fairy wives of whom i have been speaking miranda king mabilla by the wood when they took upon them our nature and with it our power of backward looking and forward peering was what they could remember was what they must dread no sacrifice they could have escaped at any moment mind you and been free resuming their first nature they would have lost regret but they did not love was their master there are many cases of the kind with men it is otherwise i have mentioned mary wellwood the carpenter's wife twice taken by a fairy and twice recaptured the last time she was brought back to ashby de la zouche she died there but there is reason for this a woman marrying a male fairy gets some but not all of the fairy attributes while her children have them in full at birth she bears them with all the signs of human motherhood and directly they are born her earthly rights and duties cease she does not nurse them and she can only rise in the air when they are with her that means that she cannot go after them if they are long away from her unless she can get another fairy to keep her company by the same mysterious law she can only conceal herself or doff her appearance with the aid of a fairy for some time after her abduction or surrender her husband has to nourish her by breathing into her mouth but with the birth of her first child she can support herself in the fairy manner it was owing to this imperfect state of being that mary wellwood was resumed by her friends the first time the second time she went back of her own accord footnote when a fairy marries a man she gradually loses her fairy power and her children have none of it or only vestiges so much as the children of a genius may perhaps exhibit i am not able to say how long the fairy wife's ability to resume her own nature lasts the forsaken merman occurs to one but i doubt if miranda king at the time say of her son's marriage with mabilla could have gone back to the sea sometimes as in mrs ventris's case fairy wives play truant for a night or for a season i have reason to believe that not uncommon the number of fairy wives in england alone is very considerable over a quarter of a million i am told but with regard to their love business among themselves it is a very different matter so far as i can understand it the fairy child is initiated at the age of puberty and is then competent to pair he is not long in selecting his companion nor does she often seem to refuse him though mating is done by liking in all cases and has nothing whatever to do with the parents it must be remembered of course that they are subject to the primitive law from which man only has freed himself they frequently fight for the possession of the female or measure their powers against each other and she goes with the victor or the better man i don't know any case where the advance has been made by the female pairing may be for a season or for a period or for life i don't think there is any rule but in all cases of separation the children are invariably divided the males to the father the females to the mother after initiation the children owe no allegiance to their parents love with them is a wild and wonderful rapture in all its manifestations and without regard necessarily to sex i never in my life saw a more beautiful expression of it than in the two females whom i saw greet and embrace on parliament hill their motions to each other their looks and their clinging were beyond expression tender and swift nor shall i ever forget the pair of oreads in the snow of whose meeting i have said as much as is possible in a previous chapter it must be remembered that i am dealing with an order of nature which knows nothing of our shames and qualms which is not only unconscious of itself but unconscious of anything but its immediate desire but i am dealing with it to the understanding of a very different order to whom it is not enough to do a thing which seems good in its own eyes but requisite also to be sure of the approbation of its fellow men i should create a wrong impression were i to enlarge upon this branch of my subject i should make my readers call fairies shameful when as a fact they know not the meaning of shame or reprove them for shamelessness when indeed they are luckily without it i shall make bold to say once for all that as it is absurd to call the lightning cruel so it is absurd to call shameful those who know nothing about the deformity no one can know what love means who has not seen the fairies at their loving and so much for that footnote i saw an extraordinary case of that where a male came suddenly before a mated pair asserted himself and took her to himself incontinent there was no fighting he stood and looked the period of suspense was breathless but not long the laws which govern the appearance of fairies to mankind or their commerce with men and women seem to be conditioned by the ability of men to perceive them the senses of men are figuratively speaking lenses coloured or shaped by personality how are we to know the form and pressure of the great river enipeus whose shape for the love of tyro poseidon took and so the accounts of fairy appearance of fairy shape size vesture will vary in the measure of the faculty of the percipient to me personally the fairies seem to go in gowns of yellow grey russet or green but mostly in yellow or grey the oreads or spirits of the hills vary in winter their vesture is yellow in summer it is ash green the dryad whom i saw was in grey the colour of the lichened oak tree out of which she gleamed the fairies in a norman forest had long brown garments very close and clinging to the ankles they were belted and their hair was loose but that is invariable i never saw a fairy with snooded or tied up hair they are always bare footed despoina is the only fairy i ever saw in any other colour than those i have named she always wears blue of the colour of the shadows on a moonlight night very beautiful she too wears sandals which they say the satyrs weave for her as a tribute they lay them down where she has been or is likely to be for they never see her but this matter of vesture is really a digression i have more important matter in hand and that is to consider the intercourse between fairy and mortal as it is governed by appearance how does a man for instance gain a fairy wife how does a woman give herself to a fairy lover i have given a careful account of a case of each sort in answer young king gained his wife by capture lady emily rich followed her lover at a look but this does not really touch the point which is rather how was lady emily rich brought or put into such a relation with quidnunc that she could receive a look from him how was king put into such a relation with mabilla that he could take her away from her own people there must have been an incarnation you would say and i should agree with you now in andrew king's case there was belief to go upon the belief common to all the cheviot side handed down to it from untold generations and never lost coupled with that there was an intense and probably long standing desire in the young man himself to realise and substantiate his belief he had brooded over it his fancy had gone to work upon it he loved his mabilla before ever he saw her his love it was which evoked her and i take it as proved at any rate it is proved to my own satisfaction that faith coupled with desire has power the power of suggestion it is called over spirit as it certainly has over matter if i say then that andrew king evoked mabilla by the wood called her out of her own world into his i assert two things the first that she was really at one time in her own world the second that she was afterward really in his the second my own senses can vouch for that she was fetched back by the king of the wood and recaptured by andrew are minor points grant the first taking and there is no difficulty about them mr lawson gives cases from greece which point to certain ritual performances on the part of the lover the snatching for instance of a handkerchief from the beloved of which the preservation is tantamount to the permanence of the subsequent union he has a curious case too of a peasant who married a nymph and gave her a child but could not make her speak to him he consulted a wise woman who advised him to threaten her with the fire for the baby if she would not talk he did it and the charm worked the nymph spoke fiercely to him you dog leave my child alone she said and seized it from him and with it disappeared that is parallel to my case where love made mabilla speak it was love for her husband to be sure but she had then no children mr wentz gets no evidence of fairy wives from ireland but a great number out of wales one of them is the beautiful tale of einion and olwen p which has many points of resemblance with mine from the border einion also seems to have met the king of the wood like andrew king he was kissed by the nymphs but only by one of them but unlike him he stayed in their country for a year and a day then went back to his own people and finally returned for his fairy wife taliesin was their son no conditions seem to have been made so much for fairy brides but now for fairy grooms i have two cases to add to that of quidnunc but before giving them let me say of his affair that since the suggestion there seems to have come from him to the woman the incarnation if such there were must have been voluntary evocation was not instrumental in it he appeared before her as she had appeared before others many others including myself and his subsequent commerce with her was achieved by his own personal force you may say that she had been prepared to see him by belief and desire by belief and desire acting upon a mind greatly distressed and probably overwrought you may say that she saw what she ardently desired to see it is quite true i cannot deny it but i point to his previous manifestations and leave it there here is a tale to the purpose which i got out of worcestershire two girls daughter and niece of a farmer bosom friends and bed fellows became involved in a love affair and desperate of a happy issue attempted a charm to win their lovers back on all hallow eve two hours before the sun they went into the garden barefoot in their nightgowns and circled about a stone which was believed to be bewitched they used certain words the lord's prayer backward or what not and had an apparition a brown man came out of the bushes and looked at them for some time then he came to them paralysed as they may have been and peering closely into the face of one of them gave her a flower and disappeared that same evening they kept the hallow e'en with the usual play half earnest half game and among other things which they did peascodded the girls the game is a very old one and consists in setting the victim in a chair with her back to the door while her companions rub her down with handfuls of pea shucks during this ceremony if any man enter the room he is her lover and she is handed over to him this was done then to one of the girls who had dared the dawn magic and in the midst of it a brown man dressed in a smock frock tied up with green ribbons appeared standing in the door he took the girl by the hand and led her out of the house she was seen no more that night nor for many days afterward though her parents and neighbours hunted her far and wide by and by she was reported at a village some ten or twelve miles off on the shropshire border where some shepherds had found her wandering the hill she was brought home but could give no good account of herself or would not she said that she had followed her lover married him and lost him nothing would comfort her nothing could keep her in the house she was locked in but made her way out she was presently sent to the lunatic asylum but escaped from that then she got away for good and all and never came back again no trace of her body could be found what are you to make of a thing of the sort i give it for what it is worth with this note only that the apparition was manifest to several persons though not i fancy to any but the girls concerned in the peascodding footnote it is said to have been the base of a roman terminal statue but i have not seen it the willow lad's is another tale of the same kind it was described in by the reverend samuel jordan in the gentleman's magazine if i am not mistaken the willow lad was an apparition which was believed to appear in a withy bed on the banks of the ouse near huntingdon he could only be seen at dusk and only by women he had a sinister reputation and to say of a girl that she had been to the withy bed was a broad hint that she was no better than she should be yet according to mr jordan the girls did go there in numbers and to such effect that by an order of the town council the place was stubbed up you had to go alone to the withy bed between sunset and sunrise of a moonless night to lay your hand upon a certain stump and say and in a loud voice willow boy willow boy come to me soon after the sun and before the moon hide the stars and cover my head let no man see me when i be wed one would like to know whether the willow lad's powers perished with the withy bed they should not but should have been turned to malicious uses there are many cases in mr lawson's book of the malefical effect upon the dryads of cutting down the trees whose spirit they are and most people know landor's idyll or if they don't they should there are queer doings under the sun as well as under the moon a man may travel far without leaving his arm chair by the fire in countries where no tourist tickets obtain and see stranger things than are recorded by herr baedeker the waies through which my weary steps i guide in this delightful land of faery are so exceeding spacious and wyde and sprinckled with such sweet variety of all that pleasant is to eare or eye that i nigh ravisht with rare thoughts' delight my tedious travele doe forget thereby and when i gin to feele decay of might it strength to me supplies and chears my dulled spright the end
