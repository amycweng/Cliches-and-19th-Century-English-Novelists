onslow square this is a romantic tale so romantic is it that i shall be forced to pry into the coy recesses of the mind in order to exhibit a connected reasonable affair not only of a man and his wife prosperously seated in the mean of things nel mezzo del cammin in space as well as timefor the macartneys belonged to the middle class and were well on to the middle of life themselves but of stript quivering and winged souls tiptoe within them tiptoe for flight into diviner spaces than any seemly bodies can afford them as you peruse you may find it difficult to believe that macartney himselfjames adolphus that remarkable solicitorcould have possessed a quivering winged soul fit to be stript and have hidden it so deep but he did though and the inference is that everybody does as for the lady that is not so hard of belief it very seldom iswith women they sit so much at windows that pretty soon their eyes become windows themselvesout of which the soul looks darkling but preening out of which it sometimes launches itself into the deep wooed thereto or not by aubade or serena but a man with his vanity haunting him pulls the blinds down or shuts the shutters to have it decently to himself and his lookingglass and you are not to know what storm is enacting deeply within finally i wish once for all to protest against the fallacy that piracy brigandage pearlfishery and marooning are confined to the wilder parts of the habitable globe never was a greater if more amiable delusion fostered to serve his simplicity by lord byron and others because a man wears trousers shall there be no more cakes and ale because a woman subscribes to the london institution desires the suffrage or presides at a committee does the bocca baciata perde ventura believe me no there are at least two persons in each of us one at least of which can course the starry spaces and inhabit where the other could hardly breathe for ten minutes such is my own experience and such was the experience of the macartney pairand now i have done with exordial matter the macartneys had a dinnerparty on the twelfth of january there were to be twelve people at it in spite of the promised assistance of lancelot at dessert which lucy comforted herself by deciding would only make twelve and a half not thirteen she told that to her husband who fixed more firmly his eyeglass and grunted im not superstitious myself he may not have been but certainly lucy told herself he wasnt very good at little jokes lancelot on the other hand was very good at them twelve and a half he said lifting one eyebrow just like his father why im twelve and a half myself then he propounded his little joke i say mamma on the twelve and halfth of januarybecause the evening is exactly half the daytwelve and a half people have a dinnerparty and one of them is twelve and a half isnt that neat lucy encouraged her beloved its very neat indeed she said and her grey eyes glowed or seemed to glow its what we call an omen at school said lancelot it meansoh well it means lots of things like youre bound to have it and its bound to be a frightful success or an utter failure or something of that kind he thought about it developments crowded upon him i say mamma all this was at breakfast macartney shrouding himself in the morning post yes lancelot it would be awfully good awfully ingenious and all that if one of the people was twice twelve and a half she agreed yes i should like that very likely one of them is lancelot looked extremely serious not mr urquhart he said no said lucy i am sure mr urquhart is older than that but theres margery dacre she might do lancelot had his own ideas as to whether women counted or not in omens but was too polite to express them is she twentyfive do you think shes rather thin lucy exploded and had to kiss the unconscious humourist do you think we grow fatter as we grow older then you must think me immense because im much more than twentyfive she said here was a vital matter it is impossible to do justice to lancelots seriousness on the edge of truth how much more are you really he asked her trembling for the answer she looked heavenly pretty with her drawnback head and merry eyes she was a darkhaired woman with a tender smile but her eyes were her strong featureof an intensely bluegrey iris ringed with black poising to tantalise him adoring the fun of it suddenly she melted leaned until her cheek touched his and whispered the dreadful truththirtyone i wish i could do justice to his struggle politeness tussling with pity for a fall but tripping it up and rising to the proper lightness of touch are you really thirtyone oh well thats nothing it was gallantly done she kissed him again and lancelot changed the subject theres mr lingen isnt there he asked adding hes always here much more than twentyfive said his mother very much aware of mr lingens many appearances in onslow square she made one more attempt at her husband wishing as she always did wish to draw him into the company it was not too successful lingen oh a stripling he said lightly and rustled the morning post like an aspen tree father always talks as if he was a hundred himself said lancelot who was not afraid of him he had to be content with miss dacre after all the othersthe judge and lady bliss aunt mabel and uncle corbet the worthingtons were out of the question as for miss bacchusoh miss bacchus was at least five hundred said lancelot and wished to add up all the ages to see if they came to a multiple of twelve and a half meanwhile mr macartney in his leisurely way had risen from the table cigar in mouth had smoothed his hair before the glass on the chimneypiece looked at his boots wriggled his toes in them with gratifying results adjusted his coatcollar collected his letters in a heap and left the room they saw no more of him half an hour later the front door shut upon him he had gone to his office or as he always said chambers he was rather bleak and knew it reckoning it among his social assets reduced into a sentence it may be said of macartney that the chief good in his philosophy was to be and to seem successful without effort what effort he may have made to conceal occasional strenuous effort is neither here nor there the point is that at fortytwo he found himself solidly and really successful the husband of a very pretty wife the father of a delightful and healthy son the bestdressed solicitor in london and therefore you may fairly say in the world with an earned income of some three or four thousand a year with money in the funds two houses and all the rest of it a member of three very oldfashioned most uncomfortable and absurdly exclusive clubsif this is not success what is and all got smoothly without a crease of the forehead by means of an eyeglass a cold manner and an impassivity which nothing foreign or domestic had ever disturbed he had ability too and great industry but it was characteristic of him to reckon these as nothing in the scales against the eyeglass and the manner they were his by the grace of god but the others he felt were his own additions and of the best these sort of investments enabled a man to sleep they assured one of completeness of effect nevertheless he was a much more acute and vigorousminded man than he chose to appear he was a solicitor it is true and had once been called an attorney by a client in a rage but he could afford to smile at that because he was quite a peculiar sort of solicitor by no means everybodys money rather he was a luxury an appanage of the great his office which he called chambers as if it was an old house in the country was in cork street his clients were landed gentry bankers peers and sons of peers the superior clergy too he handled the affairs of a bishop of lukesboro and those of no less than three deans and chapters tall dark and trenchant with a strong nose and chin and clouded grey eyes a handsome man with a fine air of arrogant comfort on him he stood well and you could not but see what good clothes he woreto my taste i confess a little too good his legs were a feature and great play was made by wits with his trousers he was said to have two hundred pairs and to be aiming at three hundred and sixtyfive certainly they had an edge and must have been kept in order like razors but the legend that they were stropped after every days use is absurd they used to say that they would cut paper easily and every kind of cheese except parmesan he wore an eyeglass which with the wry smile made necessary by its use had the marked effect of intimidating his clients and driving them into indiscretions admissions and intemperate discourse hypnotised by the unknown terrific of which the glitter of the blank surface the writhen and antick smile were such formidable symbols they thought that he knew all and provided that he should by telling it him to these engines of mastery he had added a third he practised laconics and carried them to the very breaking point he had in his timei repeat the talegone without his breakfast for three days running rather than say that he preferred his egg poached his wife had been preoccupied at the timeit had been just before lancelot was born barely a year after marriageand had not noticed that he left cup and platter untouched she was very penitent afterwards as he had intended she should be the egg was poachedand even so she was afraid to ask him when the time was ripe to boil it again it made her miserable but he never spoke of it of course all that was old history she was hardened by this time but still dreadfully conscious of his comforts or possible discomforts this was the manner of the man who you may say had quizzed or mesmerised lucy meade into marriage she had been scarcely eighteen i believe that she was just seventeen and a half when he presented himself the second of three pretty darkhaired and greyeyed girls the slimmest and as i think by far the prettiest the meades lived at drem house which is practically within bushey park here the girls saw much society for the old meades were hospitable and the mother meade a scotchwoman had a great idea of establishing her daughters the sons she left to father meade and his competent moneybags here then james adolphus macartney presented himself and here sat smiling bleakly glaring through his glass one eyebrow raised to enclose it safelyand waited for her to give herself away swaying beneath that shining disk she did it infallibly and he heard her out at leisure and accepted her thats poetry of course really it came near to that he had said to her at a gardenparty in his easiest airiest manner you cant help knowing that i am in love with you now dont you think that we should be a happy couple i do what do you say lucy shall we have a shot he had taken her handthey were alone under a cedar treeand she had not known how to take it away she was then kissed and had lost any opportunity there might have been that was what really happened and as she told her sister mabel some time afterwards when the engagement had been made public and there could be no question of going back you know mabel he seemed to expect it and i couldnt help feeling at the time that he was justified mabel tossing her head up had protested oh my dear nobody knows whether he was justified but yourself and lucy no of course not the question mabel went on is whether you encouraged him or not lucy was clear about that no not the least in the world heencouraged himself i felt that i simply had to do something i suspect that that is perfectly true i am sure that he did just as i said he always did and bluffed her into marriage with an eyeglass and smile awry whether or no he bluffed himself into it too tempted by the power of his magic apparatus is precisely the matter which i am to determine it may have been sobut anyhow the facts show you how successful he was in doing what had to be done cosa fatta capo ha as the proverb says the thing done whether wisely or not was smoothly done everything was of a piece with that he pulled off whatever he tried for without any apparent effort people used to say that he was like a river smoothly flowing very deep rippling constant in mutability husbanding and guiding his eddies its not a bad figure of him he liked it himself and smiled more askew and peered more blandly when he heard it small things betray men here is one his signature was invariably in full yours very truly james adolphus macartney it was as if he knew that adolphus was rather comic opera but wouldnt stoop to disguise it why bother he crowded it upon the bishop upon the dean and chapter of mells upon old lord drake he said why conceal the fact that my sponsors made a faux pas there it is and have done with it such things have only to be faced to be seen as nothings what are we reasonable beings now when lucy meade practically a child for all her sedateness and serious eyes married him two things terrified her on the day one was her husband and the other lest her friends should discover it they never did and in time her panic wore off she fought it in the watches of the night and in the glare of her lonely days not a soul not her mother not even mabel knew her secret james never became comic to her she never saw him a figure of fun but she was able to treat him as a human being lancelots arrival made all the difference in the world to that matter as to all her other matters for even lucy herself could not help seeing how absurdly jealous james was of his offspring for a time he was thrown clean out of the saddle and as near falling in his own esteem as ever in life but he recovered his balance and though he never regained his old ascendency which had been that of a juju he was able to feel himself as he said master in his own house with a very real reserve of terrorismif it should be wanted the great thing macartney thought was discipline constant watchful discipline a man must bend everything to that women have to learn the virtue of giving up as well as of giving giving is easy any woman knows that but giving up let that be seen as a subtle a sublimated form of giving and the lesson is learned but practice makes perfect you must never relax the rein he never did there was all the ingenuity and patience of a woman about him by this time after twelve years and more of marriage they were very good friends or why not say old acquaintances there are two kinds of crystallisation in love affairs with all respect to m de stendhal one kind hardens the surfaces without any decorative effect there are no facets visible no angles to catch the light in the case of the macartney marriage i suspect this to have been the only kinda kind of callosity protective and numbing the less they were thrown together she found the better friends they were at home they were really no more than neighbours abroad she was mrs macartney and never would dine out without him she was oldfashioned her friends called her a prude but she was not at all unhappy she liked to think of lancelot she said and to be quiet and really as miss bacchus a terrible old woman once said lucy was so little of a married woman that she was perfectly innocent but she was oneandthirty and as sweet and pretty a woman as you would wish to see she had the tender dragging smile of a luini madonna grave twilight eyes full of compassionate understanding very dark eyebrows very long lashes like the fringe of rain over a moorland landscape she had a virginal shape and liked her clothes to cling about her knees long fingers longish thin feet but her humorous sense was acute and very delightful and all children loved her such charms as these must have been as obvious to herself as they were to everybody else she had a modest little court of her own francis lingen was almost admittedly in love with her one of macartneys friends but she accepted her riches soberly and did not fret that they must be so hoarded if by moments as she saw herself or looked at herself in the glass a grain of bitterness surged up in her throat that all this fair seeming could not be put out to usury well she put it to herself very differently not at all in words but in narrowed scrutinising eyes halfturns of the pretty head a sigh and lips pressed together there had beennay there waslancelot her darling that was usufruct but usury was a different thing there had never been what you would call or miss bacchus would certainly call usury that indeed she would raise her fine brows compress her lips and turn to her bed then put out the light lying awake very often she might hear james chain the front door trumpet through his nose on the mat and slowly mount the stairs to his own room she thought resolutely of lancelot pursuing his panting quests at school or of her garden in midjune or of the gorse afire on wycross commonand so to sleep a long chapter but you will know the macartney pair by means of it chapter ii a dinner party this was not to be one of macartneys grand fulldress dinnerparties the sort where you might have two lords and would be sure to have one with his lady or a cabinet minister in a morningcoat and greenish tie or a squire and squiress from northumberland up for a month of the season or the dean of mells no nor was it to be one which lucy had to give to her visitinglist and at which as macartney rarely failed to remark there was bound to be a clergyman and some lean woman with strawcoloured hair interested in a settlement it was to be a particular kind of dinnerparty this one of which the first object was to bring urquhart in touch with lingen it could have been done at a club no doubt macartney admitted it yes i know i knowhe used his most tired voice as if he had been combating the suggestion all along you are perfectly right it mightif it had not happened to be exactly what i didnt want jimmy urquhart is rather a queer fish he is apt to shy off if one is not careful it dont suit me to bring them together explicitly do you see i want them to happen on each other they can do that better here than anywhere do you see lucy saw or saw enough she never enquired into jamess law affairs shall i like mr urquhart do you think she asked him the eyeglass focussed upon the cornice and glared at a fly which found itself belated there oh i think so why not well you see i dont know why notor why i should have i ever seen him james was bored no doubt you have hes very much about yes said lucy but i am not james left the fly and fixed herapparently with horror then he looked at his boots and moved his toes up and down he looks like a naval officer he said you instinctively seek the cuffs of his coat beefcoloured face blue eyes a squarejawed chap yes you might like him he might amuse you hes a great liar lucy thought that she might like mr urquhart on those lines the party was arranged the blisses because we owe them a dinner and i think the judge will be amused by jimmy the worthingtonsmakeweights but shes a soft pink woman like a persian kitten does mr urquhart like that lucy asked but james who didnt like his jokes to be capped said drily i dont know then lucys favourite sister mabel was to be allowed because james rather liked corbet he thought him good style now we wanted two women one must be miss bacchushideous of course said james a kind of crime but very smart he meant that she mixed with the aristocracy which was true though nobody knew why the last was to be margery dacre a very pretty girl lucy put her forward and james thought her over gazing out of window i like her name he saidso lucy knew that she was admitted that was all the rest was her care and he washed his mind of it very sure that she would see to it he wished the two men to meet for a particular reason in a haphazard way because it was better to drift urquhart into a thing than to lead him up to it moreover it was not at all disagreeable to him that urquhart a club and office acquaintance should see how comfortably placed he was how well appointed with wife and child with manservant and maidservant and everything that was his urquhart was a rich man and to know that his lawyer was rich was no bad thing it inspired confidence now the particular thing to be done with the two men francis lingen and urquhart was this francis lingen who might be a baronet some day and well to do was at the moment as at most moments hitherto very short of money urquhart always had plenty macartneys idea was that he might get urquhart to fill francis lingens pockets on terms which could easily be arranged there was ample security of course francis lingen could have gone to the jews or the bank but if the thing could be done in a gentlemanly way through ones lawyer who also happened to be a gentleman in ones own set and so onwell why not hence the little dinner over whose setting forth lucy puckered her brows with mrs jenkins her admirable cook and wrote many notes on little slips of paper which she kept for the purpose she knew quite well when james was particular about a party he said less than usual when he was particular over this one he said practically nothing so she toiled and made a success of it the drawingroom looked charming and she herself in black over white with her pearls the most charming thing in it it wanted a week of lancelots day for school he was to come in to dessertthat was understood but the possible danger of a thirteenth was removed by their being two tables of six each james had suddenly ordered this variation of practicehe did not say whyand so it was to be crewdson the invaluable butlervalet of the house who presided over a zenana of maids and seemed to carry his whiskers into the fray like an oriflamme was visibly perturbed at this new notion mr macartney has his reason we know but how is one gentlemans servant to split himself in halves and where does he stand mrs jenkins with tables dotted aboutlike a cafeor an archumpelygo he knew that it was done in the highest places but he knew his own place best we are not what you call the smart set he said we are not park lane or brook street but we are solidthe professionsthe land and the church no jinks in this house and small tables is jinks not a dinner but a kickup so crewdson thought and so he looked but his master was flint mabel came the first the lively and successful mabel two years younger than lucyshe and laurence he was laurence corbet esq of peltry park wavertree and roehampton sw a hunting man and retired soldier as neatly groomed as a man may be he was jolly and adored his mabel he was county and approved by james lucy used to say of him that his smile could cure a toothache lancelot pounced upon the pair instantly and retired with them to the conservatory to show off his orangetree whose pip had been plunged on his first birthday but before long a suspicious sliding of the feet and a shout from corbet of goal betrayed the orangetrees eclipse next plunged miss bacchus with her front hair and front teeth and air of digging you in the ribs she explained that she made a point of being early lest she should be taken for an actress and forestalled macartneys assurance that she never would bewhich annoyed him the worthingtonsshe like an autumn flowerbed and he pale and sleekand francis lingen came in together lingen a very elegant pale pink and frail young man with a strawcoloured moustache who bowed when he shook your hand as if he was going to kiss it but remembered just in time that he was in england he lowered his voice when he spoke to women and most of them liked it lucy wasnt sure whether she did or not it made her selfconscious and perverse at once she found herself wondering a whether he was going to make love to her b when he was going to begin and c how she might best cut him out all this was bewildering made her feel stupid and annoyed her but she really liked francis lingen and had been amused to discover how much he was francis in her private mind certainly he was very elegant he had an outside pocket to his dress coat and a handkerchief which you could have plugged your tooth with he had just said to lucy im so glad to see you its more than a week since we metand i want your advice when crewdson like a priest announced sir matthew and lady bliss the judge and his dame were before lucythe lady had a motherly soul in crimson satin and paste the gentleman square and solid like a pillarbox with a bald head that is a pretty exact description of him the judge was very squareheaded very shiny and very plain but he was solid and he was useful macartney used to say that he had a face like a bad egg certainly he was curdledbut he shone and looked healthy lucy allowed herself to be mothered and in the meantime murmured the judges name and miss bacchuss everybody knows miss bacchus said the gallant man and miss bacchus briskly rejoined more people know tom fool after that they got on excellently then she heard from the door mr urquhart and had time to turn francis lingen over to lady bliss before she faced the ruddy and blueeyed stranger her first thought the only one she had time for was what very blue eyes what a very white shirtfront when she shook hands how dye do you wont know who i am he said at once oh but i do she assured him james described you to me he blinked oh did he i suppose he told you i was a great liar jamess very words she nodded without speaking but laughter flickered over her face like summer lightning well said urquhart i amto him ive known macartney for yearslong before you did i like him but i think he gives himself airs now you cant you know when the man with you is a liar you never know where to have a liar or whether you have him or not and then you get in a fright whether hes not having you macartney saving your presence doesnt like being had lucy laughed and turned to wave her hand to lancelot in the entry of the conservatory that your boy urquhart asked but of course hes like youwith his fathers tricks that was perfectly true and thats your sister of course pretty woman like you tooyou in a sunset perfect unconsciousness robbed this open commentary of sting upon him drifted mrs worthington like a peony in the tideway urquhart bowed your servant maam she cried hullo jimmy you here where else why i thought you were in switzerland so i was he said all among the curates but i came backbecause they didnt he turned to lucy and because i was asked here she asked him were you skiing lancelot will grudge you that he told her i was not no lonely death for me i was bobbing it you are swept off by dozens at a time thereby fifties in a cave its more cheerful then he seemed to remark something which he thought she ought to know jimmy you heard her now macartney and i are both called james but who ever made a jimmy of him she was annoyed with himthe man seemed to suppose she could be pleased by crabbing jamesand glad of margery dacre a mermaid in seagreen who swam in with apologiesdue to macartneys abhorrent eyeglass upon her and then they all went in to their archumpelygo where crewdson and his ladies were waiting for them rari nautes lucys tableshe was between the judge and urquhart and had mabel worthington and miss bacchus before herat once took the mastery urquhart fixed crewdson with his eye and thenceforward commanded him jamess eyeglass speechless with horror over lady blisss shoulder glared like a frosty moon miss bacchus it seems was his old acquaintance she too called him jimmy and drove at him with vigour he charged her not to rally him and being between the two sisters talked to both of them at once or rather started them off as a musichall singer starts the gallery and then let them go on over his head they talked of wycross lucys house in the country compared it with peltry which mabel deprecated as a barrack and came to hear of urquharts house in the new forest it was called martley thicket urquhart said it was a good sort of place ive made an immense lake he said with his eyes so very wide that miss bacchus said youre making two now he described martley and the immense lake house stands high in beech woods but is cut out to the south it heads a valleylawns on three sides smooth as billiard tablesthen the lake with a marble lipand stepsbroad and low steps in flights of eight very good you know you shall see it lucy wanted to know how big was the lake really urquhart said it looked a milebut thats the art of the thing really its two hundred and fifty yards much better than a jab in the eye with a blunt stick i did it by drainage and a dam took a year to get the water up when a hunted stag took to it and swam across i felt that id done something fishing i should think so and a bathinghouse in a wooded cornerin a canebrake of bamboos youll like it miss bacchus said i dont believe a word of it but he seemed not to hear her when will you come and see it he asked lucy she agreed that see it she must if only to settle whether it existed or not you see that miss bacchus has no doubts urquhart said she never hasabout anything she is fixed in certainty like a bee in amber a dull life bless you jimmy she said i thrive on itand youll never thrive pooh said urquhart what you call thriving i call degradation what you snuggle in there out of the draughtsand then somebody comes along and rubs you and picks up bits of paper with you his good spirits made the thing goand jamess eyeglass prevailed not against it but urquharts real triumph was at dessertlancelot sedately by his mother between her and the judge who briskly made way for him lancelot in his eton jacket took on an air of precocious meditative wisdom infinitely diverting to a man who reflects upon boysand no doubt infinitely provocative his coming broke up the talk and made one of those momentous pauses which are sometimes paralysing to a table this one was so and even threatened the neighbouring island upon it broke the voice of urquhart talking to mabel corbet i was out in corfu in he was heard to say i was in fact in the bath when one of my wives came to the door and said that there was a turk in the almondtree i got a duckgun which i had and went out lancelots eyes fixed and pulsing interdicted him they held up the monologue in his hand was a robust apple but that was forgotten i say he said have you got two wives urquharts eyes met his with an extenuating look it was some time ago you see he said and then passing it off there are as many as you like out there dozens lancelot absorbed this explanation through the eyes you could see them at it chewing it like a cud he was engrossed in itlucy watched him i saytwo wives and then giving it up with a savage attack he bit into his apple and became incoherent one cheek bulged dangerously and required all his present attention finally after a time of high tension urquharts wives and the apple were bolted together and given over to the alimentary juices the turk in the almondtree was lost sight of and no one knows why he was there or how he was got outif indeed he ever was for all that urquhart finished his story to his two ladies but lucy paid him divided attention being more interested in her lancelot than in urquharts turk francis lingen at the other table kept a cold eye upon the easy man who was to provide him with ready money as he hoped he admired ease as much as anybody and believed that he had it but he was very much in love with lucy and felt the highest disapproval of urquharts kind of spreadeagle hardihood he bent over his plate like the willowtree upon one his eyelids glimmered he was rather pink and used his napkin to his lips to his neighbour of the left who was lady bliss he spoke sotto voce of our variegated friend and felt that he had disposed of him but that one of his wives filled him with a sullen despair what were you to do with that sort of man macartney saw all this and was dreadfully bored damn jimmy urquhart he said to himself now i shall have to work for my livingwhich i hate after dinner but he did it well go and talk to the judge he said to his company and led the way urquhart settled down to claret and was taciturn he answered lindens tentative openings in monosyllables but he and the judge got on very well chapter iii in the drawingroom after dinner when the men came into the drawingroom francis lingen went directly to lucy and began to talk to her lancelot fidgeted for urquhart who however was in easy converse with the judge and his hostlooking at the watercolours as the talk went on and cutting in as a thought struck him lucy seeing that all her guests were reasonably occupied lent herself to lingens murmured conversation and felt for it just so much tolerance so much compassion you may say as to be able to brave mabels quizzing looks from across the room mabel always had a gibe for francis lingen she called him the ewe lamb and that kind of thing it was plain that she scorned him lucy on the other hand pitied him without knowing it which was even more desperate for the young man it had never entered lingens head however that anybody could pity him true he was poor but then he was very expensive he liked good things he liked them choice and they must have distinction above all they must be rare he had some things which were unique a chair in ivory and bronze one of a set made for mme de lamballe and two of horace walpoles snuffboxes he had a private printingpress and did his own poems on vellum he had turned off a poem to lucy while she was inspecting the appareil once to l m from the fount sonnets while you wait said mabel curving her upper lip but there was nothing in it because many ladies had received the same tribute he had borrowed that too from horace walpole and only wanted notice now you dont pity a man who can do these things even if he has got no money and for what else but want of money could you pity a man of taste i believe myself that both mabel and lucy overrated francis lingens attentions i dont think that they amounted to much more than providing himself with a soundingboard and occasional lookingglass he loved to talk and to know himself listened to he loved to look and to know himself looked at you learned a lot about yourself that way you saw how your things were taken a poetfor he called himself poet and had once so described himself in a hotel visitors booka poet can only practise his art by exerting it and only learn its effect by studying his hearers he preferred ladies for audience and one lady at a time there were obvious reasons for that men never like other mens poetry wordsworth we know avowedly read but his own but mabel and lucy too read all sorts of implications his lowered tones his frequency his persistencemy dear he caresses you with his eyes you know he does mabel used to say lucy wondered whether he really did and ended by supposing it just now therefore francis lingen flowed murmuring on his way like a purling brook rippling fluctuant carrying insignificant straws insects of the hour on his course never jamming or heaving up monotonous but soothing and as for implications good heavens he was stuffed with them like a michaelmas goose i do so wish that you could talk with her you could do so much to straighten things out for the poor child you are so wise theres a kind of balm in your touch upon life something thats aromatic and healing at once sainfoin the healing herbthat should be your emblem i have always thought so by the by have you an emblem i wish youd let me find you one old gerrard will give it meand i will give it to you some patient nimblefingered good soul has coloured my copy you shall have it faithfully rendered and it shall be framed by le notre of vigo streetdo you know his work you mustand stand on your writingtable i see you are shaping a protest frugality another of your shining qualities not of mine no no i admire it in you it is not a manly virtue a frugal swain means a harassed wife now confess would you have me board i believe i would do it if you asked me not very exciting all this but if you want implications it was while this was going on that lancelot hovering and full of purpose annexed urquhart the judge suddenly aware of him between them put a hand upon his head as you might fondle the top of a pedestalwhich lancelot intent upon his prey endured then his moment came a decent subsidence of anecdotes and his upturned eyes caught urquharts i say will you come and see my orangetree its just over there in the conservatory its rather interestingto me you know urquhart considered the proposition yes he said ill do that and they went off lancelot on tiptoe lucys attention strayed the orangetree was exhibited made the most of its history was related there was nothing more to say about it lancelot his purpose growing gave a nervous laugh no turk could hide in that i expect he said and trembled urquhart gazed at the weedy little growth no he said he couldntyet but a ladybird could he picked out a dormant specimen but lancelot was now committed to action beyond recall the words burned his lips i say he said twiddling a leaf of his orangetree i expect youve been a pirate the judge had wandered in and was surveying the pair his hands deep in his trouserspockets urquhart nodded youve bit it he said lancelot had been certain of it good lord the questions crowded upon him what kind of a ship was yours she was a brigantine fifteen hundred tons oh i say with the air of you neednt tell me if youd rather notwas she a good one she was a clipper what name the dog star this was beyond everything ohgood did you ever hang fellows we did many some he had expected that too he felt that he was being too obvious the man of the world in him came into use for treachery i suppose and that kind of thing yes said urquhart and for fun of course lancelot nodded gloomily i know he said so does sir matthew now he said youve led me into admissions you know you are up to the neck said the judge for a moment lancelot looked shrewdly from one to the other was it possible that no no he settled all that its all right hes a guest you seethe same as you are urquhart was looking about him i should smoke a cigarette if i had one he said lancelots hospitality was awake come into fathers room he has tons he led the way for his two friends they pierced the conservatory and entered another open glass door they were now in jamess private room on the threshold lancelot paused to exhibit what he said was a jolly convenient arrangement these were two bay windows with two glass doors between them stretched the conservatory jolly convenient said lancelot what for burglars the judge asked yes for burglars and policemen and father you know i dont think said the terse lancelot why dont you think my friend says the judge and lancelot became cautious oh father wont come into the drawingroom if he can possibly help it he says its mammas provincebut i expect hes afraid of meeting women i mean ladies urquhart blinked at him never be afraid of any one will do for you and me he said and lancelot said deeply rather not then they went into the misogynists study the judge and urquhart were accommodated with cigarettes and lancelot entertained them but he did not pry any further into urquharts past a hint had been enough conversation was easy lancelot talked freely of his father father will be awfully waxy with me for not going to bed he might easily come in herehope he wont all the same but do you know what he likes he likes the same things to happen at the same time every day now mamma and i dont agree with him you see so its rather pink sometimes i expect it is urquhart said mamma of course likes to be quiet a bit she doesnt like ructionshay and all that so i keep myself pretty close quite right said the judge i know lancelot said dreamily and then with great briskness beastly grind all the same the judge had a fit of coughing and urquhart got up and looked about then the judge said that he too should catch it if he didnt go back and make himself polite lancelot led the way back but at the entry of the drawingroom where the talk was buzzing like bees in a limetree he put his hand on the switch and showed the whites of his eyes shall i dare you to switch it off he said to urquhart who replied dont or i shall do it lancelot and he entered the room but before the judge followed there was a momentary flicker of the lights lancelot nudged urquhart hes all right he said out of one corner of his mouth oh hes all right urquhart agreed they both went to lucy and lingen looked mildly round interrupted in his flow lancelots greeting was darling you really must go to bed he knew it it was so obviousthe abhorrent eyeglass apartthat he didnt even try the pathetic only a week before school he got up enquiring of his mother if she would swear to come up presently well goodbye he said to urquhart and held out his hand good night to you said urquhart anyhow you know the worst but lancelot shook his cautious head no he said not the worstand then with a deep chuckle but the best hoho two wives with that he went jolly chap said urquhart and sat himself down by lucy to lingens inexpressible weariness she warmed to his praise but denied him her conscience at work no you mustnt sit down i shall take you to talk to lady bliss youll like her no i shant he said i can see that and shell think ive corrupted her husband but he had to go lingen also she recruited for service he had had a good innings and found himself able to be enthusiastic about urquhart he could bear to discuss himin possible relations with himself of course miss bacchus sized him up aloud according to her habit jimmy urquharta good man yes hes a live man no flies on jimmy urquhart been everywhere had a bit of most things why i suppose jimmy has eaten more things than youve ever read about ive read brillatsavarin said lingen modestly i dare say jimmys had a notch out of him said miss bacchus hes what i call a blade lingen didnt ask her what she called him chapter iv aftertalk nevertheless the two men talked down to knightsbridge together and lingen did most of the talking he chose to expand upon macartney the nearest he dared get to the subject of his thoughts now macartney you know is a very selfcontained man no doubt youve noticed how he shies at expression chilling at times good in a lawyer no doubt you get the idea of large reserves but perhaps as awell as a father for instance that bright boy of theirs now you may have noticed how little there is between them what do you think of the spartan parentin these days oh i think mr lancelot can hold his own said urquhart hell dowith his mother to help i dont suppose the spartan boy differed very much from any other kind of boy mostly they havent time to notice anything but they are sharp as razors when they do an eager note could be detected in francis lingens voice almost a crow ah youve noticed then the mother i mean mrs macartney now there again i think our friend overdoes the repression business a sympathetic attitude means so much to women shell get it somewhere said urquhart shortly well said lingen yes i suppose so but there are the qualifications of the martyr in mrs macartney greensickness urquhart proposed is that what you mean lingen stared it had not occurred to me but now you mention itwell a congestion of the faculties eh i dont know anything about it said urquhart she seemed to me a fond mother and very properly do you mean that macartney neglects her lingen was timid by nature perhaps i went further than i should i think that he takes a great deal for granted i always thought he was a supercilious ass said urquhart but i didnt know that he was a damned fool i saylingen was alarmed i say i hope i havent made mischief urquhart relieved him bless you not with me i use a lawyer for law hes no fool there no indeed lingen said eagerly ive found him most useful in fact i trust him further than any man i know hes a good man urquhart said and hes perfectly honest hed sooner put you off than on any day thats very sound in a lawyer but if he carries it into wedlock hes a damned fool in my opinion they parted on very good terms lingen for the albany urquhart elsewhere meantime lancelot wriggling in his bed was discussing urquhart i say mamma he saida leading questiondo you think mr urquhart really had two wives no darling i really dont i think he was pulling our legs that was bad all our legs all that were pullable certainly your two perhaps he was lancelot sighed oh what happened to the turk i forgot him thinking of his wives he said one of my wives you know he might have had six then i say perhaps mr urquhart is a turk in disguise what do you think lucy was sleepy and covered a yawn i dont think darling i cant im going to bed and you are going to sleep arent you now yes of course yes of course did i tell you about the pirate part his ship was a brigantine called the dog star oh was it yes it was and he used to hang the chaps sometimes for treachery and sometimes for fun how horrid said lucy good night oh well came through the blankets of course you dont understand but i do good night and he was asleep at the turn of that minute james had disappeared into his room so she took herself off to bed surely he might have said a word it had all gone off so well mr urquhart had been such a success and she really liked him very much and how the judge had taken to him and how lancelot at the first stair she stopped in three quarters of a mind to go in and screw a sentence out of him but no she feared the angry blank of the eyeglass trailing up to bed she thought that she could date the crumbling of her married estate by the ascendency of the eyeglass and to think only to think that when she was engaged to james she used to play with it to try it in her eye to hide it from him well she had lancelother darling boy that brought to mind that a week tonight she would be orphaned of him the day she dreaded was coming againand the blank weeks and months which followed it true to his ideas of discipline of the value of doing a thing well for its own sake macartney was dry about the merits of the dinnerparty when they met at breakfast eh oh yes i thought it went quite reasonably urquhart talked too much i thought my dear jamesshe was nettledyou really are he looked up the eyeglass hovered in his hand plaitil nothing i only thought that you were hard to please really because i think a man too vivacious lancelot said to his porridgebowl over the spoon i think hes ripping youve hit it said his father hed rip up anybody lucy piqued upon her tender part was provoked into what she always avoided if she couldacrimony at breakfast i was hostess you see and i must say that the more people talk the more i am obliged to them i suppose that you asked mr urquhart so that he might be amusing jamess head lifted again you could see it over the morning post i asked urquhart for quite other reasons you remember i dont know what they were said lucy my own reason was that he should make things go a party in a parlour she bit her lip the morning post quivered but recovered itself what was the party in a parlour mamma do tell me that was lancelot with a flair for mischief it was all silent and all damned said lucy jolly party said lancelot not like yours though the morning post clacked like a bellying sail then bore forward over an even keel lucy beckoning lancelot left the breakfastroom she was ruffled and so much so that lancelot noticed it and being the very soul of tact where she was concerned spoke neither of his father nor of urquhart all the morning in the afternoon the weather seemed more settled and he allowed himself more play he would like to see mr urquhart on horseback in a battle he thought he expected hed be like henry of navarre lucy thought that he might be would he wear a white plume though much headshaking over this bareheaded i bet you hes just that sort dashing about absolutely recklessfrightfully dangerousa smoking swordgoing like one oclock oh i bet you what you like then with startling conviction father doesnt like him feels scored off i expect he wasnt though but he might be all the same i think father always expects hes going to be scored off dont you at any minute lucy set herself to combat this hazard which was very amusing and by no means a bad shot poor james what a pity it was that he couldnt let himself like anybody it was trueit was quite truehe was afraid of being scored off she husbanded a sigh poor james to pity james was a new experience she felt all the better for it and was able to afford a lighter hand when they met at dinner it may even be that james himself had thought the time come for a little relaxation of askesis or he may have had something to forestall he seldom spoke of his affairs without design at any rate he told her that francis lingen had been with him and that urquhart was likely to be of use ive written to him anyhow he will do as he thinks well urquhart is a sharp man of business lucy said he struck me so i thought that he could never have any doubt of his own mind james wriggled his eyeglass to wedge it more firmly ah you noticed that very acute of you lucy we may have a meeting before longto arrange the whole thing its a lot of money ten thousand pounds your francis is an expensive young man or lets say cidevant jeune homme why do you call him my francis she askedrather mischievous than artless the eyeglass dropped with a click and had to be sought well i can hardly call him mine could i i dont see why he should be anybodys said lucy except his own my dear girl said macartney himself is the last person he belongs to francis lingen will always belong to somebody i must say that he has chosen very wisely you do him a great deal of good thats very nice of you she said i own that i like francis lingen hes very gentle not too foolish and good to look at you must own that hes extremely elegant oh said james tossing up his foot elegant he is what his good horace would have called a very pretty fellowand what i call a nice girl im sure he isnt worth so much savagery lucy said you are like ugolinoand poor francis is your fiero pasto james instantly corrected himself my besetting sin lucy but i must observe he applied his glazed eye to her feetthe colour of your stockings my friend ha a tinge of blue upon my oath so it passed off and that night when after his halfhour with the evening paper in the drawingroom he prepared to leave her she held out her hand to him and said good night he took it waved it and then stooped to her offered cheek and pecked it delicately the good girl felt quite elate she did so like people to be kind to her half an hour later yet in her evening post was a letter from urquhart he proposed for herself and lancelot to go to the play with him the play raffles which ought to meet the case he said he added i dont include macartney in this jaunt partly because he wont want to come but mainly because there wont be room for him i am taking a nephew one bob nugent an osborne boy but very gracious to poor civilians like lancelot and me he signed himself yours to command lucy was pleased and accepted promptly and lancelot was pleased when he heard of it his hackles were up at the graciousness of the osborne kid he honked over it like a heron ho i expect youll tell him that im r e or going to be he said which meant that he himself certainly would the event with subsequent modifications on the telephone proved to be the kind of evening that lancelots philosophy had never dreamed of they dined at the cafe royal where urquhart pointed out famous anarchists and their wives to his young guests they went on to the theatre in what he called a bus but lancelot saw to be a mighty motor which rumbled like a volcano at rest and proceeded by a series of violent rushes accompanied by explosions of a very dangerous kind the whole desperate passage short as it was had the right feeling of lawbreaking about it policemen looked reproachfully at them as they fled on lancelot as guest of honour sat in front and wagged his hand like a semaphore at all times and in all faces he felt part policeman and part malefactor which was just right then they thrilled at the smooth and accomplished villainy of mr du maurier lost not one line of his faultless clothes nor one syllable of his easy utterance like treacle off a spoon said urquhart and then they tore back through the starry night to onslow square leaving in their wake the wrecks and salvage of a hundred frail taxis finally from the doorstep waved the destroyer as the boys agreed she should be called upon her ruthless course listened to the short and fierce bursts of her wrath until she was lost in the great sea of sound and thenreplete to speechlessnesslancelot looked up to his mother and squeezed her hand she saw that his eyes were full well darling she said you liked all that lancelot had recovered himself he let go her hand his reply was majestic not bad he said lucy immediately hugged him now that was exactly what james would have said mutatis mutandis yet she would not have hugged james for it nor have loved him because of it these are our crosses mr wesley reflecting on the jaunt she warmed to the thought of urquhart who had she felt the knack of making you at ease what had he done or how done it well he seemed to be interested in what you said he looked at you and waited for it then he answered still looking at you now so many men looked at their toes when they answered you james always did yet mr urquhart did not look too much there were men who did that no not too much chapter v eros steps in when she was told that francis lingen and urquhart were coming on the nineteenth not to dine lucy said oh what a bore and seeing the mild shock inflicted on the eyeglass by her remark explained that it was lancelots day for going to school and that she was always depressed at such times the eyeglass dropped and its master stretched out his fine long legs with a great display of black speckled sock my dear absurd as it may seem they are coming to see me i know your little way you shant be disturbed if i may be indulged so far as to contrive that the house hold us both i had thought that it would be only civil to bring them in to you for a minute or two when theyve done but that is for you to decide she was immediately penitent oh do of course i daresay they will be useful im very foolish to miss him so much the eyeglass ruefully stared at the fire urquhart consents said james and lingen will have his money more snuffboxes youll find but hes had to work for it insured his lifeand a letter from sir giles which must have cost him something sir giles lingen was the uncle of francis a childless veteran he turned his disk upon her for a moment you like urquhart yes lucy said i do i like himbecause he likes lancelot ah said james who thought her weak where the boy was concerned he added urquhart gets on with children hes a child himself why do you call him that she asked with a tinge of offence in her voice james could raise the fine hairs at the back of her neck by a mere inflection he accepted battle because he only thinks of one thing at a time because to get what he wants hell sacrifice every mortal thingvery often the thing itself which hes after but lucy had heard all that before and wasnt impressed all men are like that she said i could give you a much better reason james and his eyeglass both smiled your exquisite reason he is like a child said lucy because he doesnt know that anybody is looking at him and wouldnt care if anybody was james clasped his shin not bad he said not at all bad but the test of that is the length to which you can carry it would he wear a pot hat with a frockcoatthats the crux it really was to james as she knew very well she perused the glowing fire with its blue salt flames perhaps to most men probably also to mr urquhart but she felt that she would be lowering a generous ideal if she probed any further so james was left to his triumph the fatal week wore on apace one of the few remaining days was wholly occupied with preparations for the last a final jaunt together was charged with a poignancy of unavailing regrets which made it a harder trial than the supreme moment never never had she thought this bright and intense living thing which she had made so beautiful and so dear nor did it make a straws worth of difference to the passion with which she was burdened that she felt precisely the same thing every time he left her as for lancelot he took her obvious trouble like the gentleman he was he regretted it made no attempt to conceal that but was full of little comfortable suggestions which made her want to cry youll have no more sapping upstairs directly after dinner i suppose was one of them another was no more draughty adventures by the round pond lucy thought that she would have stood like jane shore by the round pond in a blizzard for another week of him but she adored him for his intention and was also braced by it her sister mabel who had three boys did not conceal her satisfaction at the approaching releasebut mabel spent christmas at peltry and the hunting was a serious matter the worst of her troubles was over when they were at victoria lancelot immediately became one of a herd and so did she one of a herd of hens at the ponds edge business was business lancelot remained kind to her but he was inflexible this was no place for tears he even deprecated the last hug the lingering of the last kiss he leaned nonchalantly at the window he kept his eye on her she dared not have a tear the train moved he lifted one hand so long he said and turned to his high affairs she was almost aghast to realise how very small how very pale how atomy he lookedto confront a howling world and so to listen to the comfortable words of mrs furnivallbriggs my dear theyve no use for us the utmost we can do is to see that they have good food and warm socks i am untiring about warm socks that is what i am always girding my committee about i tell the vicar my dear sir i will give you their souls if you leave me their soles do you see he is so much amused but he is a very human person except at the altar there hes every inch the priest well goodbye i thought lancelot looked delightful hes taller than my geoff but i must fly i have a meeting of workers at fourfifteen bless me i had no idea it was four oclock the parishroom alphonse a spartan mother lucy paid two calls on people who were out and indulged herself with shopping in sloane street lancelot had recently remarked on her gloves you have jolly thin hands he had said its having good gloves i expect the memory of such delightful sayings encouraged her to be extravagant she thought that perhaps he would find her ankles worth a momentif she took pains with them anyhow he was worth dressing for james never noticed anythingor if he did his ambiguity was twoedged extraordinary hat he might say and drop his eyeglass which always gave an air of finality to comments of the sort but her shopping done for lancelots sake life stretched before her a grey waste she went back to tea to a novel to a weekly paper full of photographs of other peoples houses dogs children and motorcars it was dark she was bored as well as childsick dissatisfied with herself as well as hearthungry she must get herself something to do she said who was the vicar of onslow square she didnt know somehow religion to her had always seemed such a very private affair not a soul must be near her when she said her prayersexcept lancelot of course when he was at home she always said them while he said his last nightah she had not been able to say anything last night all her faculties had been bent to watching him at it was it bravery in himor insensibility she remembered mr urquhart had talked about it all boys are born stoics he said and all girls epicureans thats the instinct they change places when they grow up was james an epicurean it was six oclock they would be at their meeting in jamess room surely they wouldnt want tea apparently crewdson thought that they might otherwisewell she would leave it to crewdson james never seemed to care for anything done by anybody except crewdson sometimes he seemed to resent it have we no servants then the eyeglass seemed to inquire she wondered if james knew for how much his eyeglass was answerable how could one like to be kissed with that glaring disk coming nearer and nearer and if it dropped just at the momentwell it seemed simply to change all ones feelings oh to have her arms round lancelots salient young body and hear him murmur oh i say as she kissed his neck at this moment being very near to tears the light was switched off she seemed to be drowning in dark that was a favourite trick of lancelots who had no business as a matter of fact in his fathers room it gave her a moment of tender joy and for another she played with the thought of him tiptoeing towards her suddenly all in the dark she felt a mans arms about her and a mans lips upon hers to wild alarm succeeded warm gratitude lucy sobbed ever so lightly her head fell back before the ardent advance her eyes closed with parted lips she drank deep of a new consolation her heart drummed a tune to which as it seemed her wings throbbed the answer the kiss was a long oneperhaps a full thirty secondsbut she was released all too soon he left her as he had come on silent feet the light was turned up everything looked as it had been but everything was not she was not she found herself an ariadne in a drawingroom still lax from theseus arms yes but theseus was next door and would come back to her to say that she was touched is to say little she was more elated than touched and more interested than either how utterly romantic how perfectly sweet how thoughtful how ardent of james james of all people in the world her husband of course but who knew better than she what that office had impliedand who less than she what it must have hidden really was it true could it be true for some time she sat luxurious where she had been left gloating the word is fairly used over this new treasure but then she jumped up and looked at herself in the glass curiously quizzingly and even perhaps shamefaced next she laughed richly and from a full heart my dear girl its not hard to see what has happened to you youve been not even in her thoughts did she care to end the sentence but those shining dark eyes that air of floating of winged feetha my dear upon my word at thirtyone my child really it becomes you uncommonly she found herself now walking swiftly up and down the room clasping and unclasping her hands to think that jamesthe last man in the worldhad kept this up his coatsleeve for yearsand at last and how like the dear thing to turn the light out to save his own face of course for he must have known even he must have known that she wouldnt have cared she would have liked the lightto see his eyes there had been no eyeglass this time anyhow but that was it that was a mans romance in cupid and psyche it had been psyche who had wanted to know to see women were like that such realists and as psyche was they were always sorry for it afterwards well bless him he should love her in the dark or how he pleased she stopped againagain in front of the glass what had he seenwhat new thing had he seen to make himwant to kiss her like that was she pretty she supposed that she really was she fingered the crinkled whiteness at her neck touched herself here and there turned her head sideways and patted her hair lifting her chin now was there anything she could put onsomething she could put infor dinner her thoughts were now turned to serious mattersthis and that possibility flashed across her mind they were serious matters because james had made them so by his most extraordinary most romantic most beautiful action then she stretched out her hands the palms upward and sighed out her heart oh what a load is lightened oh days to come voices in the conservatory suddenly made her heart beat violently he was coming she heard james sayoh the rogueyes its rather nice we put it up directly we came lucys idea mind the little step at the door though urquhart francis lingen were in the roomfrancis topknot stood up like a bottlebrush then came the hero of the evening james the unknown eros she beamed into the shining disk sweet old spyglass she would never abuse it again all the same he had pocketed it for the occasion the last time he had been in the room urquhart refused tea tea at seven oclock at night all her eyes were for james who had sought her in love and given her heart again the eyeglass expressed its horror of tea at seven oclock god forbid said james dear ridiculous creature mr urquhart talked at once of lancelot well hes off with all the rest of them they love it you know its movementits towards the unknown the not impossiblethe anything might turn up at any minute now we dont feel so sure about the minutes do we oh dont we though she laughed and tilted her chin we feel anyhow for their minutes bless them she said and urquhart looked at her with narrowed eyes he for god only she for god in him he said he added i like that boy of yours i think he understands meand pleased her there were a few minutes desultory talk in the course of which lucy gravitated towards james and finally put her hand in his arm you should have seen the effect of this simple caress upon the eyeglass like a wounded snake it lifted its head to ask who has struck me it wavered and wagged but lucy was glassproof now urquhart said that he was going away shortly at least he supposed he should a man he knew wanted to try a new motor they were to rush down to biarritz and possibly over the frontier to pampluna but nothing was arranged here he looked scrutinising and half quizzical at her are you adventurously inclined will you try my monster its a dragon she was very adventurously inclinedas james might know but not with a mr urquhart necessarily therefore she hesitated oh i dont really know urquhart laughed be boldbe boldbe not too bold well there it is i start for the newmarket road at eleven tomorrowbut ill fetch you for twopence ask him he jerked his head forward towards james on whose arm her hand rested lucy looked up at her romantic lorda look which might have made a man proud but james may have been proud enough already at any rate he didnt see her look but was genial to urquhartover whom he considered that he had triumphed in the library sooner her than me he said i know that she likes it and so advise her to go but i should die a thousand deaths she wont said urquhart and then to lucy well maam her eyes assented before she did very well ill come i dare say it will be delightful oh it will he said still he rambled onplain grumbling easy familiar talk while lucy fumed and fidgeted to be alone with her joy and pride your handsome sister has asked me to hunt in essex dont like hunting but i do like herand theres a great deal waiting to be done at martley i dont know well talk about it tomorrow then he asked her would she come and look at martley it seemed she had half promised she said oh yes of course nothing of that kind seemed very important but james here looked down at her which made it different we might go at whitsuntide he said she looked deeply updeeply into him so to speak very well we will if youll come oh hell come urquhart said and james i should like it so that was settled heavens how she wished these people would go she could see that francis lingen wanted to be asked to stay to dine but she didnt mean to have that so when urquhart held out his hand with a blunt good night to you she let hers hover about francis as if his was waiting for itwhich it wasnt but had to be oh good night said the embarrassed exquisite and forgot to be tender james picked up the evening paper and was flickering his eye over the leading articles like a searchlight lucy for her part hovered quickfooted in his neighbourhood this was her hour of triumph and she played with it she peeped at the paper over his shoulder till he said please and moved it her fingers itched to touch his hair but very prudently refrained she was too restless to settle to anything and too happy to wish it if she had been a singingbird she would have trilled to the piano but she had not a note of music the dressinggong gave her direction there was plenty to be done the gong im going to make myself smart james quite smart are you coming up james had the paper open in the middle eh oh theres lots of timerun away im rather busy youre not a bit busy but ill go and she went with hardly a perceptible hangback at the door upstairs she rejected her usual choice with a curled lip no no too stuffy oh smithers i couldnt it makes me look a hundred no doubt she was absurd but she had been starved such a thing as this had not happened to her since her days of betrothal and then but seldom when she had satisfied herself she had a panic suppose he said comic opera he said nothing at all he was in a thoughtful mood and talked mostly of urquharts proposal for whitsuntide i believe its rather remarkable quite a place to be seen jimmy does things well you know hes really a rich man as rich as you lucy asked not at all interested in urquhart just now the eyeglass was pained my dear soul you dont know what youre saying she quizzed him with a saucy look i didnt say anything dear i asked something if eyeglasses shiver so did jamess well wellyou quibble i dare say urquhart has fifteen thousand a year and even you will know that i havent half as much she quenched her eyes and looked meek no dear i know all right hes quite rich now what does he do with it do with it james tilted his head and scratched his neck vigorously but not elegantly very often nothing at all there will be years when he wont spend a hundred above his running expenses then hell get a kind of maggot in the brain and squander every sixpence he can lay hands on or he may see reason good and drop ten thousand in a lap like lingens why does he do it god knows who made him hes made like that lucy said it was very interesting but only because she thought james would be pleased then she remembered with a pang of doubt that she was to be driven by this wild man tomorrow but jameswould he he had never been really jealous and just now she didnt suppose he could possibly be so but you cant tell with men so she said james dear very softly and he looked over the table at her if you dont think itsensible i could easily telephone eh what aboutto whomhow i dont follow you i mean to mr urquhart about his motor tomorrow i dont care about it in the least in fact oh said james the motor ah i had forgotten oh i think you might go urquharts been very reasonable about this business of lingens i had a little trouble of courseits a lot of money even for him oh yes i should go if i were you why he might want me to go you knowwhich would bore me to extinction but i know you like that sort of thing he nodded at her yes i should go she pouted and showed storm in her eyesall for his benefit but he declined benefit a strange dear bleak soul very well if it saves you anything ill do it she said james was gratified as he was also by the peeling of walnuts and service of them in a sherry glass which she briskly performed as if she liked it further than that she was too shy to go but in the drawingroom before it might be too late she was unable to forbear her new tenderness she stood behind him her hand fell upon his shoulder and rested there like a leaf he could not but be conscious of ithe was very conscious of it and accepted it as a tribute such a tribute was gratifying lucy was a charming woman she did pretty things in a pretty way as a mans wife should but too seldom did how many mens wivesafter fourteen years of itwould stand as she was standing now nothe luck held he had a tradition of successsuccess without visible effort the luck held like a steady wind filling a sail discipline however gentle but firm he went on reading but said most kindly well luce well adding on an afterthought how can i serve you her eyes were luminous dilating her gentle mood downcast towards his smooth black hair she sighed serve me oh you serve me well im happy just nowthats all not fretting after the boy no no not now bless him all the same to be sure whereon at a closer touch of her hand he looked comically up her head moved ever so slightly towards him he dropped his eyeglass with a smart click and kissed her cheek she shivered and started back a blank dismay fell upon her her heart seemed to stop good heavens not so not at all so had james kissed her in the dark there wasnt a doubt about thatnot the shade of a doubt here had been a brush on the cheek here the cold point of his nose had pecked a little above she had felt that distinctly more distinctly than the touch of his lips whereas that other that fullcharged message of hope and promiseoh that had been put upon her mouth soft and close and long she recalled how her head had fallen back and back how her laden heart had sighed how she had been touched comforted contented good god how strange men were how entirely outside her philosophy she strayed about her drawingroom touching things here and there while he complacently fingered his punch flacking over the leaves with brisk slaps of the hand at this moment he was as comfortablyminded a householder as any in london engaged solely in digestion at peace at home and abroad so unconscious of the fretting straining passionate lost soul in the room with him hovering flicking about it like a white moth as to be supremely ridiculousto any one but lucy it is difficult to hit off her state of mind in a word or in two she was fretted yes but she was provoked too she was provoked but she was incredulous it could not continue it was too much men were not made so and yetand yetjames was a possible eros an eros bless him with an eyeglass and eros loved in the dark she comforted herself with this thought which seemed to her a bright solution of the puzzle and saw james rise and stretch his length without mutiny she received the taps on the cheek of his rolled punch allowed nay procured another chilly peck with no pouting lips no reproachful eyes then came a jar and her puzzlement renewed shall you be late oh my dear soul how can i possibly say i brought papers home with meand you know what that means its an interesting case we have merridew for us i am settling the brief alas for her the infatuate even stayed to detail points of the cause much it appeared depended upon the chancellor of the diocese a very shaky witness he had a passion for qualification and might tie himself into as many knots as an eel on a nightline oh might he indeed and this this was in the scales against her pride and joy she was leftalone on naxos nowwhile james went sharply to his papers there i must leave her till the hour when she could bear the room no more she had fought with beasts there and had prevailed yet unreason as she had made herself call it lifted a bruised head at the last papers papers after such a kiss oh the folly of the wise caught up she knew not whence harboured in the mind she knew not how the bitter words of an old scots song tasted salt upon her lips there dwelt a man into the west and o gin he was cruel for on his bridal night at een he up and grat for gruel they brought him in a gude sheepshead a bason and a towel gar take thae whimwhams far frae me i winna want my gruel standing in the hall while these words were ringing in her head she stayed after they were done a rueful figure of indecision instinct fought instinct and the acquired beat down the innate she regarded the shut door with wise and tender eyes without reproach then bent her head and went swiftly upstairs chapter vi a leap outwards she arose a disillusioned bride with scarcely spirit enough to cling to hope and with less taste for urquharts motor than she had ever had for any duller taskwork nothing in the house tended to her comfort james was preoccupied and speechless the coffee was wrong the letters late and stupid she felt herself at crosspurposes with her foolish little world if james had resought her love overnight it had been a passing whim she told herself that love so desired was almost an insult nevertheless at eleven oclock the motor was there and urquhart in the hall held out his hand she can sprint he said so much ive learned already i think youll be amused lucy hoped so she owned herself very dull that morning well said urquhart he could promise her that she should not be that she might cry for mercy he told her or stifle screams but she wouldnt stifle yawns macartney he said would sooner see himself led out by a firingparty than in such an engine as i have out there she smiled at her memory james is not of the adventurous she saidbut wasnt he shall i be cold put on everything you have he bade her and then everything else she can do sixty you are trying to terrify me she said but you wont succeed i dont know why but i feel that you can drive i think i have caught lancelots complaint perhaps so i know that i impose upon the young and insipient and which am i pray he looked at her dont try me too far she came forth finally to see crewdson and her own chauffeur grouped with urquhart the bonnet was open shining coils mighty cylinders were in view and a great copper feedpipe like a burnished boaconstrictor the chauffeur a beadyeyed swiss stared approval crewdson rubbing his chin offered a deft blend of the deferential butler and the wary man of the world she was tucked in the swiss started the monster they were off with a bound they slashed along knightsbridge won piccadilly circus by a series of short rushes avoided the city and further east found a broad road and slow traffic soon they were in the semiurban fringe among villa gardens overglazed publichouses pollarded trees and country glimpses in between there was floating ice on the ponds a violet rime traversed with dun wheelmarks in the shady parts of the way after that a smooth white road deep green fields much frozen water ducks looking strangely yellow and the low blue hills of essex urquhart was a sensitive driver she noticed that the farseeing eye was instantly known in the controlling foot he used very little brake when he pushed his car there was no mark upon him of urgency success without effort the gospel of james urquhart accepted it as a commonplace and sought his gospel elsewhere he began to talk without any palpable beginning and drifted into reminiscence i remember being run away with by a mule train in ronda the first i had ever handled they got out of handit was a nasty gorge with a bend in it where you turn on to the bridge i got round that with a welldirected stone which caught the offside leader exactly at the root of his wicked ear he had only one ear so you couldnt mistake it he ducked his head and up with his heels he went over and the next pair on top of him we pulled up not much the worse well the point of that story is that the pace of that old coach and six mokes i assure you has always seemed to me faster than any motor ive ever driven it was nothing to be compared with it of course but the effort of those six mad animals the elan of the thing the rumbling and swaying about heeling over that infernal gorge of stone you cant conceive the whirl and rush of it now were doing fifty yet you dont know it windscreen yes thats very much but the concealment of effort is more youve had a life of adventure she said lancelot may have been right he wasnt far wrong urquhart said as a fact i have never been a pirate but i have smuggled tobacco in the black sea and thats as near as you need go i excuse myself by saying that it was a long time agotwenty years i dare say that i was young at the time that i was very hard up and that i liked the fun lovely country you know that strip of shore you never saw such oleanders in your life and sand like crumbled crystal we used to land the stuff at midnight up to our armpits in water sometimes and a man would stand up afterwards shining with phosphorus like a golden statue romantic no poet could relate it they used to cross and recross in the starlightall the gleaming figures like a ballet done for a sultan in the arabian nights i was at that for a couple of years and then the gunboats got too sharp for us and the game didnt pay she had forgotten her spleen her eyes were wide at the enlarging landscape and what did you do nextor what had you done before tell me anything i really dont know what i did before i went out to the chersonese from naples i remember that well i had been knocking about vesuvius for a bit keeping very bad company which nevertheless behaved very well to me but finally there was a row with knives which rather sickened me of the vesuvians so i shipped for constantinople and fell in with a very nice old chap on board he took me on at his contraband job i didnt get very much money but i got some and saw a deal of life when it was over i went to greece i like the greeks they are a fine people what did you do in greece she insisted not interested in the fineness of the people blasting first he said they were making the railway from larissa through tempe that was a dangerous job because the rock breaks so queerly you never know when it has finished i had seen a good deal of it in south america so i butted in and was taken on then i did some mining at lavrion and captained a steamer that carried mails among the islands that was the best time i had you see i like responsibility and i got it everything else was tameout there i mean i got into government service at corfu and stopped there six years or more i was all sorts of thingslighthousekeeper inspector of marine works harbourmaster and then my wicked old father i must tell you about him some day you could write a book about him up and diedin his bed of all places in the world and left me a good deal of money that was the ruin of me i really might have done something if it hadnt been for that strange thing he turned me out of the house in a rage one day and had neither seen me nor written me a letter from my seventeenth to my thirtieth birthday when he diedor thereabouts but at the last when he was on his bed of death he rolled himself over and said to the priest theres jimmy out at his devilry among the haythen turks he says begob that was a fine boy and ill leave him a plum and so he did i wish he hadnt i was making my hundred and fifty in corfu and was the richest man in the place and i liked the life that was where you had so many wives she reminded him so it was well perhaps i neednt assure you that the number has been exaggerated ive very nearly had some wives but there was always something at the last minute there was a girl at valletta i remembera splendid girl with the figure of a young venus and a tragic face and great eyes that seemed to drown you in dark lady macbeth as a child might have been like thator antigone with the doom on her or perhaps elektra no i expect elektra took after her mother redhaired girl i fancy but there you are she was a lovely solemn deepeyed hagridden goose not a word to saythought mostly of pudding i found that out by supposing that she thought of me then i was piqued and we parted i suppose shes vast now and glued to an upper windowledge with her great eyes peering through a slat in the shutter living in a bedgown imagine a wife who lives in a bedgown they were lunching at colchester when these amorous chapters were reached lucy was quite at her ease with her companion a wife who was always at the dressmakers would suit you no better but i dont know that mixed marriages often answer after all so dreadfully much can never be opened between you thats quite true he said and by no means only of mixed marriages how much can your average husband and wife open between them practically nothing since they choose to live by speech but what else have we i would choose to live by touch he said if two people cant communicate fully and sufficiently by the feelers they are not in the same sphere and have no common language but speech is absurd why every phrase and nearly every word has a conventional value by touch she was set dreaming by that so she and jamesa james she had had no conception ofhad communicated not fourandtwenty hours ago certainly subsequent speech had not advanced the intelligence then conveyed but she resumed urquharts affairs and do you despair of finding a woman with whom you can hold communion no he said looking at the bread which he broke i dont despair at all i think that i shall find her and then he looked steadily at her and she felt a little uncomfortable but it was over in a minute she feared to provoke that again so made no fishing comment but she was abundantly curious of what his choice would be meantime he mused aloud what you want for a successful marriage isa layer of esteem without which you will infallibly if you are a man overreach yourself and be disgusted then a liberal layer of animal passionand i only shrink from a stronger word for fear of being misunderstoodwhich you wont have unless you have a vitality b imagination thirdly for a crown respect you must know your due and your duty and fear to omit the one or excuse the other everything follows from those three and how do you know when you have found them he looked up and out into the country a sudden glory he said a flare of insight theres no mistake possible who was the man she asked him rather mischievously who saw a girl at a ball and said thats a fine girl ill marry herand did itand was miserable he twinkled as he answered that was savage landor but it was his own fault he could never make concessions she thought him a very interesting companion on the way home he talked more fitfully with intervals of brooding silence but he was not morose in his fits and when he excused himself for sulking she warmly denied that he did any such thing i expect you are studying the motor she said and he laughed im very capable of that altogether a successful day she returned braced to her duties her james and his hiddenup eros to go home to james had become an exciting thing to do chapter vii patience and psyche there are two ways of encountering an anticlimax an heroic an unheroic lucy did her best to be a heroine but her temperament was against her her imagination was very easily kindled and her reasons much at the mercy of the flames by how much she was exalted by so much was she dashed but she had a conscience too a lively one with a forefinger mainly in evidence it would be tedious to recount how often that wagged her into acquiescence with a james suddenly revealed freakish and how often she relapsed into the despair of one sharply rebuffed when she found him sedately himself however or by means of her qualities the timecure worked its way her inflammation wore itself out and her life resumed its routine of dinnerparties calls and callers francis lingens purring and letters to or from lancelotwith this difference mind you that far recessed in her mind there lay a grain a grain of promise that and a glamorous memory she was able to write her first letter to lancelot in high spirits then to tell him her little bits of news and to remind him really to remind herself of good days in the past holidaytime something she may have said or left unsaid as the chance may be drew the following reply she always wrote to him on friday so that he might answer her on sunday dear mama he wrote i was third in weakly order which was rather good idt mr tonks said if i go up so fast i shall brake the ceialing bad spelling i know but still last wendesday a boy named jenkinson swalowed a buttonhook but recovered it practically as good as when bought or perhaps a xmas present he was always called bolter for a nickname so it was jolly convene for once he did the right thing mostly he is an utter ass how is the polligamous pirate getting on with wives c that comes from a greek word polis a city so i suppose in the country they are too conventual i like him awfully hes my sort not fathers though well the term is waring away five days crost off on new diery where shall we go this time three months easter i mean wycross i hope but suppose dreery brighton hope not i must swot now kings of isereel and suchlike so goodby now or so long as we say herelancelot she thought that she must show the letter to urquhart when next she saw him and meantime of course showed it to james the eyeglass grew abhorrent over the spelling this boy passes belief look at this lucy ceialing oh dont you see she cried he had it perfectly cei well and then a devil of doubt came in and he tried an a oh i can see it now on his blottingpad whichever he decided on he must have forgotten to cross out the other you shouldnt be so hard on your own son his first letter too james felt compunction no no i wont be hard its all right of course he read on the polligamous pirate with wives c had to be explained she told him the story the eyeglass became a searchlight exploring her did urquhart tell that tale upon my soul it was sheer nonsense of course but oh i dont know said james you cant tell with a man of that sort he can be a march hare if hes in the mood hed as soon shoot a turk as a monkey or keep two women as half a dozen by the by lucy and the eyeglass went out like a falling star dont let that sentimental idiot make too much of an ass of himself lucys eyes concentrated they shone who is your sentimental idiot i havent the least notion what you mean i mean francis lingen of course you must admit oh and he nipped her indignation in the bud i know you wont misunderstand me i am not at all a fool you are kindness itself generosity itself but there it is hes an ass and theres really nothing more to say lucy was mollified she was indeed amused after the first flash remembering the james of a week ago the eager wooer of the dark she was able to be playful with a little jealousy but if he could have knownor if she had cared to tell himwhat she had been thinking of on sunday afternoon when francis purred to her about himself and sought her advice how best to use his ten thousand of urquharts poundswell james would have understood thats all so she laughed poor francis lingen he is not very wise but i must say that your honour is perfectly safe with me my dear child said james frowning no no i shall go on it will do you good there is one thing you may always be quite sure of dear and that is that the more francis lingen is a goose the less likely i am to encourage him in goosery if there is such a word james pished but she pursued him mabel was announced up from the country to dine and sleep the parthian shot was delivered actually on the way to mabels embrace but im flattered to see you jealousplease understand that i should like you to be jealous of the chair i sit on james was hurt and uncomfortable he thought all this rank form and mabelthe bright and incisive mabel with her high hunting colourmade it much worse what is james jealous oh how perfectly splendid is he going to give secret orders to crewdson not to admit mr as they do in plays at the st jamess oh james do tell me whom you darkly suspect caesars wife my dear and injured man james writhed but he was in the trap you may be too trenchant it would seem and your cleaver stick fast in the block it behooved him to take a strong line this kind of raillery must be stopped he must steer between the serious and the flippant he hated to be pert on the other hand to be solemn would be offensive to lucywhich he would not be for james was a gentleman mabel my dear you stretch the privileges of a guest a promising beginning he thought but lucy pitied him plunging there and cut all short by a way of her own oh mabel you are a goose come and take your things off and tell me all about peltry and the hunting and the new horse mr urquhart told me he was going to stay with you is he im so glad you like him lancelot and i highly approve i must show you lancelots letter about him he calls him the polligamous piratewith two ls of course yes said james who had recovered his composure yes my dear but he gives you the accent in polis does he though im afraid that was beyond me she paused to beam at james that pleases you its a sign of grace certainly so the squall blew over james was dining out somewhere so the sisters had a short dinner and a very long evening by the fire lucy dallied with her great news until crewdson had served the coffeethen out it came with inordinate and delightful delicacy of approach mabels eyes throughout were fixed upon her face and of course naturally here lucy turned away her own but nothingnot a sign neither then nor since i she stopped bit her lip then broke forth i shall never understand it oh i do think it extraordinary mabel said at once its not at all extraordinary it would be with any one else but not with james lucy lifted her head what do you mean mabel well its difficult to explain you are so odd about james he is either the sort of being you name in a whisperor makes you edgy all overlike a slatepencil but jamesi dare say you havent noticed it you think hes a clever man and so he may be but really he has never grown up lucys foot began to rock my dear girl really oh i know i know of course youre annoyed especially after such a queer experience we wont discuss itit will be useless but thats my opinion you know i think that he was completely successful according to his own ideas the battle raged i need not add that the mystery far from being undiscussed was driven up and down the field of possibility till a late hour nor that mabel held to her position in high disparagement as lucy felt of lancelot deeply involved an upshot and a shrewd one was mabels abrupt well what are you going to do now i mean supposing he does it again lucy mused i dont somehow think he will for a long time she added naively i wish he would i like it mabel understood her you mean that you like him for doing it and dreamy lucy nodded yes thats exactly what i mean i do awfully mabel here kissed lucy dearest youre wonderfully sweet you would love anybody who loved you i dont think i would lucy said but i should certainly have loved james more if he had ever seemed to love me and i cant possibly doubt that he did that day that lancelot went back what bothers me is that he stopped there and so to it again in the manner of women tireless in speculation about what is not to be understood james restored in tone was affable and even considerate in the morning mabel studying him with new eyes had to admire his flawless surface though her conviction of the shallow depth of him was firmlier rooted than before he ishe really isa tremendous donkey poor james she thought to herself as he gave out playful sarcasms at her expense and was incisive without loss of urbanity mabel was urgent with her sister to join the party at peltry when urquhart was there i do wish you would hes rather afraid of you i think and that will throw him upon mewhich is what is wanted that was how she put it james quite the secure backed her up i should go if i were you he said to lucy from behind the morning post it will do you a great deal of good you always choose february to moult in and you will have to be feathered down there besides its evident you can be useful to mabel lucy went so far as to get out her engagement book and to turn up the date not very seriously what she found confirmed her i cant she said its out of the question why what is happening mabel must know its an opera night said lucy the walkuere is happening oh are they hm yes i suppose i cant expect you lucy was scornfully clear i should think not indeed not for a wilderness of urquharts not all the peltry of siberia said james rather sharply as he thought and dismissed the subject in favour of his own neatlyspatted foot wagner he said i am free to confess that apart from the glory of the thing i had rather marry one of mr urquharts wives said the hardy mabel two said james quite ready for her mabel rattled away to her essex and left her sister all the better for the astringent she had imparted lucy did not agree with her by any means it made her hot with annoyance to realise that anybody could so think of james at the same time she felt that she must steady herself after all a man might kiss his wife if he pleased and he might do it how he pleased it was undignified to speculate about it she tried very hard to drive that home to herself and she did succeed in imposing it upon her conduct but she was not convinced she was too deeply romantic for conviction by any such specious reasoning that affair in the dark had been the real thing it impliedoh everything let come what might let be what was that was the true truth of the mystery and to be loved like that wasoh everything but she dismissed it from her thoughts with an effort of will and relations with james resumed their old position they became formal they were tinged now and again with the old asperity they were rather dreary lancelots star rose as jamess sank in the heavens his letters became her chief preoccupation but jamess star fallen low though it were still showed a faint hue of rosecolour some little time after thissomewhere in early february she met urquhart at a luncheon party and was glad to see him he shook hands in his usual detached way as if her gladness and their acquaintance were matters of course he sat next to her without ceremony removing another mans namecard for the purpose and after a few short snapped phrases about anything or nothing they drifted into easy talk lucys simplicity made her a delightful companion when she was sure of her footing she told him that she had been saving up lancelots letter to show him good he said i want it but it was not here as it happened so she wrote out from memory the sentence about urquhart the polligamous pirate with wives c arent you flattered she asked him radiant with mirthful malice he frowned approval he was pleased but like all those who make laughter he had none of his own that shot told i got him with the first barrel trust a boy to love a lawbreaker hell never forget me that hes my friend for life he added as if to himself hope so anyhow lucy at this had she been a cat would have purred and kneaded the carpet as it was her contentment emboldened her to flights she was much more bird than cat i wonder if you are really a lawbreaker she said i dont think i should be surprised to know it of you he frowned again no i should say that the ground had been prepared for that you wouldnt be surprisedbut would you be disturbed thats what i want to know before i tell you this had to be considered what did she in her private mind think of lawbreakers one thing was quite clear to her whatever she might think of them she was not prepared to tell him im a lawyers wife you know that tells me nothing he said that would only give you the position of an expert it doesnt commit you to a line ill tell you thisit may encourage you to a similar confidence if i wanted to break a law very badly i shouldnt do it on reflection perhaps but i could never resist a sudden impulse if somebody told me that it would be desirable in all sorts of ways to break a mans head i shouldnt do it because i should be bothering myself with all the possibilities of the thinghow desirable it might be or how undesirable but if happening to be in his company i saw his head in a breakable aspectsplosh i should land him a nasty one thats a certainty now what should you say to that it happens that i want to know it was evident to her that he really did lucy gave him one of her kind compassionate looks which always made her seem beautiful and said i should forgive you i should tell you that you were too young for your years but i should forgive you im sure thats what i wanted to know said urquhart and remained silent for a while when he resumed it was abruptly on a totally new matter i shall bring my sister over to you after this shes here i dont know whether youll like her shell like you where is she lucy asked rather curious shes over there by our hostess that big black hat is hers shes underneath it lucy saw a spry blackhaired youngish woman very vivacious but what she herself called good james would have said smart not at all like her brother she thought and said so shes not such a scoundrel urquhart admitted but she takes a line of her own her husbands name is nugent he is south irish where we are north that boy who went with us to the play is her son he is a lively breedso it hasnt turned out amiss shes not at all your sort but as you know the worst of us you may as well know what we can do when we exert ourselves he added my old father now with beelzebub was a terror do tell me about him it would take too long he was very oldfashioned in most ways they used to call him king urquhart in donegal the worst of it was that he knew good claret and could shoot that makes a bad combination he used to sit on a hogshead of it in his front yard and challenge all and sundry to mortal combat he really did duels he used to call them he said me honours involved dye see and believed it but they were really murders because he was infallible with a revolver he adored my mother but she couldnt do anything with him tush me dear he used to say i wouldnt hurt a hair of his bald head and then hed have to bolt over to france for a bit and keep quiet but everybody liked him im sorry to say they gave him a public funeral when he died they took him out of the hearseimagine the great sooty plumes of itand carried him to the chapelhalf a mile away lucy didnt know how much of this to believe which made it none the worse he was a catholic he was and so are you he looked up eh i suppose i amif any what do you mean she insisted well he said its there i expect you dont get rid of it she considered this to herself mrs nugentthe honourable mrs nugent as it afterwards appearedmade herself very amiable we both like boys she said which makes everything easy i hope you liked my patyou met him i know yours seems to be an unconscious humourist jimmy is always chuckling over him mine takes after the urquharts rather grim but quite sound when you know them my husband is really irish he might say begorra at any minute the urquharts are a mixed lot jimmy says were eurasians when hes cross with uswhich means with himself i suppose we were border thieves once like the turnbulls and pringles but james i planted us in ireland and there have been james urquharts ever since i dont know why that seems satisfactory but it does i saw what jimmy was saying you know she said presently he began upon me and then slid off to our deplorable father an inexhaustible subject to jimmy who really admires that kind of thing lucy smilingly deprecated the criticism oh but he does if he could be like that he would be but he wants two qualitieshe cant laugh and he cant cry father could only laugh internally he used to get crimson and swallow hard that was his way jimmy cant laugh at all thats the mischief of it and crying too father could cry rivers one of the best things i remember of him was his crying before mother damn it all meg i missed him he said choking with grief mother knew exactly what to say youll get him next time jimmy come and change your stockings now well our jimmy couldnt do that to begin with of course he wouldnt have missed him no said lucy reflecting i dont think he would missunless he was in too much of a hurry to hit mrs nugent looked quickly at her that is very clever of you you have touched on his great difference from father he is awfully impatient all this did lucy a great deal of good james thought that she had better call on mrs nugent he knew all about her chapter viii again the second time was in late february at the opera the walkuere of all operas in the world where passion of the suddenest is seen on its most radiant spring morning james who was dreadfully bored by wagner and only went because it was the thing to do and truly also because a man must be seen with his wife could not promise to be there dressed at such an unearthly hour as halfpast sixjames i say did not go with her but vowed to be there long before seven that he undertook so she went alone and sat as she always did half hidden behind the curtain of her box on the second tier the place was flooded with dark the great wonder beganthe amazing prelude with its brooding its surmisals its storms its pounding hooves remorselessly pursuing and flashes of the horn like the blare of lightning she surrendered herself and as the curtain rose settled down to drink with the eyes as well as with the ears for she was no musician and could only be deeply moved by this when she saw and heard it immediately absorbed her the music of preparation and suspense seemed to turn her bones to liquorand at this moment she again felt herself possessed by mans love the strong hand over her heart the passion of his hold the intoxication of the kiss to the accompaniment of shrill and wounded violins she yielded herself to this miracle of the dark she seemed to hear in a sharp whisper you darling she half turned she half swooned again she drank and she gave to drink the music speared up to the heights of bliss then subsided as the hold on her relaxed when she stretched out her hand for her lovers he was not near her she was alone the swift and poignant little drama may have lasted a minute but like a dream it had the suggestion of infinity about it transcending time as it defied place confused bemused she turned her attention to the stage determined to compose herself at all cost she sat very still and shivered she gave all her powers to her mind and succeeded by main effort insensibly the great drama doing down there resumed its hold and it was even with a slight shock that she became aware by and by of james sitting sedately by her with the eyeglass sharply set for diversion anywhere but on the scene again she remembered with secret amusement that she had not been conscious of the eyeglass whenfor reasons of his ownhe had paid his mysterious homage to love and her she kept a firm grip of herself she would not move an inch towards him she could never do that again but she passed him over the playbill and lifted the glasses to show him where they were she saw the eyeglass dip as he nodded his thanks and heard him whisper as he passed back the bill no good dark as the grave oh extraordinary james she suffered hysterical laughter but persisted against it and succeeded when the lights went up she afforded herself a gay welcome of him from gleaming happy and conscious eyes he met it blandly smiled awry and said you love it oh she sighed meaning all that she dared not say how i love it james said bravo i was very punctual youll admit that very nearly overcame her but all she said was i didnt hear you come inor go out james looked very vague at that he was on the point of frowning over it but gave it up it was a lucyism he rose and touched his coatcollar to feel that it gripped where it should lets see whos in the house he said and searched the boxes royalty as usual thats what i call devotion whos that woman in a snowleopard oh yes of course hullo i say my child will you excuse me ive just seen some people i ought to see theres lots of timeand i wont be late and he was off a very remarkable lover indeed was james mrs nugent waved her hand across the parterre francis lingen knocked and entered she could afford that and presently a couple added themselves young married people whom she liked for their poverty hopefulness and unaffected pleasure in each other she made lingen acquainted with them and talked to young mr pierson he spoke with a cheer in his voice ripping opera madge adores it we saw your husband downstairs but i dont think he knew us and through her head blew the words like a searching wind you darling you darling oh that was great love small wonder that james saw nothing of the piersons and yetah she must give up speculating and judging that had undone poor psyche young mr pierson chattered away about madge and wagner both ripping james returned bland positive dazzling the man of exclusive clubs was reminded of young mrs pierson with whom he shook hands of young mr pierson to whom he nodded and said ha and finally of francis lingen ha lingen you here francis shivered that seemed to him to ring a knell since when had he been lingen to james since this moment now why had james coldshouldered him was it possible that he had noticed too much devotion and if he had was it not certain that she must have noticed it he stopped midway of the stairs and passersby may have thought he was looking for a dropt sixpence not at all the earth seemed to be heaving beneath his feet but a wave of courage surged up through him pooh no woman yet ever disregarded the homage of a man he would send some roses tomorrow without a card she would understand and so it went on wagner came back to his own on this occasion after this second great adventure lucy had no conflict with fate thankfully she took the gift of the god she took it as final as a thing complete in itself a thing most beautiful most touching most honourable to giver and recipient it revived all her warmth of feeling but this time without a bitter lees to the dram and she was immensely the better for it she felt in charity with all the world her attitude to james was one of clear sight oh now she understood him through and through she would await the fulness of time sufficient for the day was the light of the day she was happier than she had been for many years halfterm was approaching when she would be allowed to go down and see lancelot in these days she felt spring in the air february can be kind to us and show a golden threshold to march she had a letter from mabel telling her of mr urquharts feats in the hunting field hes quite mad i think and mostly talks about you and lancelot he calls you proserpine as for his riding my dear it curdles the blood he doesnt ride he drives sits well back and accelerates on the near side he brought his own horses luckily for ours and his neck they seem to understand it he hunted every day but one and then he rushed up to town to keep some appointment and came back to a very late dinner driving himself in his motor he is a tempestuous person but can be very grave when he likes he talked beautifully one eveningmostly about you lucys eyes smiled wisely over this letter she liked to think that she could induce gravity upon a hunting party she had never quite approved of the peltry atmosphere hard riding seemed to involve hard living and hard swearing she had once heard laurence let himself go to some rider over hounds and had put him on a back shelf in her mindhim and his peltry with him a prude no she was sure she was nothing of the sort but she liked people to keep a hold on themselves a gay little dinnerparty one of hers as she told james finished a month of high light the young pierson couple some warreners a mrs treveer and jimmy urquharteight with themselves the faithful francis lingen was left out as a concession to james and love in the dark she noticed with quiet amusement how gratified james was he was so gratified that he did not even remark upon it now jamess little weakness or one of them let us say was that he could not resist a cutting phrase when the thing did not matter thereforeshe reasonedfrancis lingen absurdly enough did matter that he should that anything of the sort should matter to james was one more sign to her of the promise just as the weather was one the spring was at hand and soon we should all go amaying so we dined at one table and had a blaze of daffodils from wycross and everybody seemed to talk at once pierson told her after dinner that madge thought urquhart ripping as she had thought wagner and certainly he was one to make a dinnerparty go he was ridiculous about laurence corbet and his sacred foxes dont shoot that thing god of heaven what are you about oh i beg your pardon i thought are you out of your senses that must be torn to pieces by dogs he was very good at simulating savagery but had a favourite trick of dropping it suddenly or turning it on himself he caught mrs treveer a lady of ardour not tempered by insight she agreed with him about hunting oh you are so right now cant something be done about it couldnt a little paper be writtenin that vein you know not by me said urquhart im a hunting man you see mrs treveer held up her fan but took no offence lucy with mabels letter in mind gave her guest some attention but for the life of her could not see that he paid her any beyond what he had for the others or for his dinner he joined pierson at her side and made no effort to oust him he did not flatter her by recalling lancelot he seemed rather to muse out loud james with his coattails to the fire was quite at his easeand when urquhart offered to drive her down to westgate for the halfterm which she herself mentioned it was james who said capital that will be jolly for you but you wouldnt come would you my child it is that i couldnt come a motor in march i should die besides he added as you know i have to be at brighton that sunday she had known it and she had known also that brighton was an excuse one of the bogies she kept locked in a cupboard was jamess ennui when lancelot was to the fore could this too be jealousy ill tell you what ill do jimmy urquhart said the run down would be rather jolly but the run back in the dark might be a bore the nugents have got a house at sandwich why shouldnt you go there you know my sister nugent as they used to say yes of course i do lucy said but i couldnt really but she is there my dear maam thats the point ill drop you there on my way back i wish i could stop too but thats not possible shell arrange it james thought it an excellent plan but lucy had qualms odd that the visit of eros should a second time be succeeded by a motorjaunt to go motoring again with a mr urquhartoh but she owned that she was absurd james did not conceal his sarcasms she either fears her fate too much he quoted at her she pleaded with him darling she saidand he was immensely complacent over thati suppose its a sign of old age but after all why shouldnt i go by trainor in our own car if it comes to that firstly said james through his eyeglass because urquhart asks you to go in hisa terror that destroyeth in the noonday compared to ours and secondly because if you dont want it i should rather like to go to brighton in mine oh said she then you dont mind motoring in march not in a closed car said jamesand not to brighton this acted as an extinguisher of the warmer feelings let mr urquhart do his worst then chapter ix sundry romantic episodes a little cloud of witness assembled at will like seagulls out of the blue inane would come about her in after years that madly exhilarating rush to westgate for instance on a keen march morning and that sudden question of hers to urquhart what made you think of asking me and his laconic answer given without a turn of the head because i knew you would like it you did before you know and that was january there was one another connected with it was her going alone up to the schoolhouse and her flush of pleasure when lancelot said oh i say did he bring you down goodthen well go immediately and see the car perhaps its a new one she could afford to recall thatafter a long interval they had had a roaring day all over the place as lancelot said afterwards to a friend and then there had been her parting with urquhart in the dark at the open door of queendon court arent you going to stop no my dear she remembered being amused with that arent you even coming in i am not goodbye you enjoyed yourself oh immensely thats what i like he had said and pushed off as his own phrase went atop of that the return to james and to nothingness for nothing happened except that he had been in a good temper throughout which may easily have been because she had been in one herselfuntil the easter holidays when he had been very cross indeed poor james to get him to begin to understand lancelots bluntness intensity and passion for something or other did seem hopeless they were at wycross on her urgent entreaty and james was bored at wycross she sometimes thought because she loved it so much jealousy a mans wife ought to devote herself she should love nothing but her husband he had spent his days at the golf course not coming home to lunch urquhart was asked for a sundayon lancelots accountbut couldnt come or said so at least then on the saturday when he should have been there james suddenly kissed her in the gardenand of course in the dark she hadnt known that he was in the house yet he had contracted the habit of having tea at the clubhouse and talking on till dark he did that as she believed because she always read to lancelot in the evenings she gave up the holidays entirely to him well lancelot that afternoon had been otherwise engagedwith friends of a neighbour she had cried off on the score of seeing something of father at which lancelot had winked but james was not in to tea and at sixand no sign of himshe yielded to the liquid calling of a thrush in the thickening lilacs and had gone out there she stayed till it was dark in a favourite placea circular garden of her contriving with a pond and a golden privet hedge so arranged as to throw yellow reflections in the water standing there it grew perfectly darkdeeply and softly dark the night had come down warm and wet like manifold blueblack gauze she heard his quick light step her heart hammered but she did not move he came behind her clasped and held her close oh youve comei wondered oh how sweet how sweet and then my love had been said and she had been kissed in a moment he was gone she had stayed on motionless enthralled by the beauty of the actand when she had withdrawn herself at last and had tiptoed to the house she saw his lamp on the table and himself reading the spectator before a wood fire recalling all that she remembered the happy little breath of laughter which had caught her if it wasnt so perfectly sweet and beautiful it would be the most comic thing in the world she had said to herself a telegram from jimmy urquhart came that night just before dinner arriving tomorrow say tenthirty for an hour or so urquhart it was sent from st jamess street lancelot had said stout fellow and james took it quite well she herself remembered her feeling of annoyance how clearly she foresaw an interrupted reverie and a hampered sundayand also how easily he had falsified her prevision there had been an animated morning of garden inspection in the course of which she had shown him with a softly fluttering heart and perhaps enhanced colour the hedged oval of last nights romance a pony race a game of single cricket in the paddocklancelot badly beaten lunch and great debate with james about aeroplanes wherein lancelot showed himself a bitter and unscrupulous adversary of his parent finally the trial of the new car an engine of destruction such as lancelot had never dreamed of it was admittedly too highpowered for england you were across the county in about a minute and then he had departed in a kind of thunderstorm of his own making lancelot preternaturally moved said to his mother i say mamma what a maneh she lightly yes isnt he wonderful and lancelot with a snort a man ten rather small meneasily and james poor james saw nothing kissable in that it hadnt been till may of that year that lucy began to think about urquhartor rather it was in may that she discovered herself to be thinking about him mabel assisted her there mabel was in cadogan square for the season and the sisters saw much of each other now it happened that one day mabel had seen lucy with urquhart walking down bond street at noon or thereabouts and had passed by on the other side with no more than a wave of the hand it was all much simpler than it looked really because lucy had been to jamess office which was in cork street and coming away had met jimmy urquhart in burlington gardens he had strolled on with her and was telling her that he had been waterplaning on chichester harbour and was getting rather bitten with the whole business of flight im too old i know but im still ass enough to take risks i think i shall get the ticket he had said what ticket the pilots ticket or whatever they might call it i expect you are too old she had said and then how old are you by the way he told her we call it fortytwo exactly jamess age and exactly ten years older than me yes too old i think i wouldnt he had laughed im certain i shall it appeals to me then he had told her the first time i saw a man flying i assure you i could have shed tears she remembered that this was out of his power odd thing whats gravitation to me or i to gravitation a commonplace whereby i walk the world never mind there was that young man breaking a law of this planet wellthats a miracle i tell you i might have wept and then i said to myself my man youll do this or perish then she and have you done it and he i have not but im going to she had suddenly said no please dont his quick look at her she remembered and the suffusion on his burnt face oh but i shall do you wish to know why because you dont mean it because you wouldnt like me if i obeyed you she said gravely you cant know that yes but i do you like meassume that lucy said you may and he i do you like me because i am such as i am if i obeyed you in this i should cease to be such as i am and become such as i am not and never have been you might like me morebut you might not no thats too much of a risk i cant afford it she had said thats absurd but she hadnt thought it so mabel came to her for lunch and rallied her i saw you my dear but i wouldnt spoil sport all rightyou might do much worse hes very much alive anyhow he doesnt wear an then lucy was hurt oh mabel thats horrid you know i hate you to talk like that mabel stood rebuked it was beastly of me but you know i never could stand his eyeglass it is what they call antisocial in their novels really you might as well live in the crystal palace then she held out her hand and lucy took it after some hesitation but mabel was irrepressible almost immediately she had jumped into the fray again with youre both going to his place in hampshire arent you then lucy had flushed and mabel had given her a queer look thats all right she presently said he asked us you know but we cant i hear that vera nugent is to be hostess i rather liked her though of course you can never tell how such copious conversation will wear i dont think she stopped talking for a single moment laurence thought he was going mad it makes him broody you know like a hen he rubs his ears and says his wattles are inflamed it was either that day or another such dayit really doesnt matter which day it wasthat mabel drifted into the subject of what she called the james romance did james had james and where were we standing now lucy whose feelings upon the subject were more complicated than they had been at first was not very communicative but she owned there had been repetitions mabel who was desperately quick to notice judged that she was mildly bored i see she said i see butthats all all cried lucy yes indeed mabel said again i see lucy who certainly didnt see was silent and then mabel with appalling candour said i suppose you would have it out with him if you werent afraid to lucy was able to cope with that kind of thing nothing would induce me to do it i shouldnt be able to lift my head up if i did it would not only bewell horrible but it would be very cruel as well i should feel myself a brute on mabels shrug she was stung into an attack of her own and whatever you may say to me i know that you couldnt bring yourself to such a point no woman could do it who respected herself mabel had the worst of it in the centre but by a flanking movement recovered most of the ground she became very vague she said as if to herself after all you know you may be mistaken perhaps the less you say the better mistaken and the less you say lucys grey eyes took intense direction please tell me what you mean my dear do you think im out of my senses do you really think ive imagined it all no no said mabel quickly and visibly disturbed no no of course i dont i really dont know what i meant its all too confusing for simple people like you and me lets talk about something else lucy to whom the matter was distasteful agreed but the thought persisted mistaken and the less you say chapter x at a worlds edge it was after that queer look after her too conscious blush that she began to envisage the state of her affairs she was going to martley thicket for whitsuntide it was an old engagement comparatively old that is she did want to go and now she knew that she did well how much did she want to go ought she to want it what had happened questions thronged her when once she had opened a window what did it matter to her whether urquhart qualified as an aviator or not what had made her ask him not to do it how had she allowed him to say assume that you like me the short dialogue stared at her in red letters upon the dark assume that you like me you may assume it i do she read the packed little sentences over and over and studied herself with care no honestly nothing jarred there was no harm she didnt feel any tarnish upon her and yetshe was looking forward to martley thicket with a livelier blood than she had felt since easter when james had kissed her in the shrouded garden a livelier blood hazarding the lookingglass she thought that she could detect a livelier iris too what had happened well of course the answer to that question was involved in another how much was she to assume how much did urquhart like her she hoped against conviction that she might have answered these questions before she met him againwhich would probably be at martley just now stoutly bearing her disapproval he was doubtless at byfleet or elsewhere risking his neck she answered a question possibly arising out of this by a shrewd smile of course i dont disapprove he knows that i shiver but i know hes perfectly right he may be sure the meeting at martley would at the very least be extremely interesting she left it there for the moment but having once begun to pay attention to such matters as these she pursued her researchesin and out of season it was a busy time of year and james always laid great stress on what he called the duties of her station she must edge up crowded stairways behind him stand at his side in hot and humming rooms where the head spun with the effort not to hear what other people were sayingso much more important always than what your partner was jamess height and eyeglass seemed to give him an impartial air at these dreadful ceremonies behind his glass disk he could afford to be impertinent and he was certainly rude enough to be an undersecretary without that shining buckler of the soul he would have been simply nobody with it he was a demigod here then under the very shadow of his immortality lucy pursued her researches what of the romantic hidden eponymous james where did he stand now in her regard since easter at wycross james had not been her veiled eros but the possibilities were all there he was not a garden god by any means nor a genius of the spring january and onslow square had not frozen his currents february and the opera house had heightened his passion at any moment he might resume his devotional habiteven here in carlton house terrace and what then welland this was oddthis ought to have produced a state of tension very trying to the nerves and wellit hadnt thats all at that very party in carlton house terrace with a band braying under the stairs and a fat lord shouting in her ear her secret soul was trembling on a brink she was finding out to her halfrueful dismayit was only halfthat she was prepared to be touched prepared to be greatly impressed but not prepared to be thrilled as she had been if james should kiss her again she was prepared in fact to presentas statesmen do when they write to their sovereignher grateful humble dutyand no more in vain the band brayed in vain lord j crimson by her ear roared about the weather in the west of ireland lucys soul was peering over the edge of her old world into the stretches of a misty new one this was bad enough and occupied her through busy nights and days but there was more disturbing matter to come stirred up to cloud her mind by mabels unwonted discretion mabel had been more than discreet she had been frightened pushing out into a stream of new surmise she had suddenly faltered and hooked at the quay lucy herself was at first merely curious she had no doubts certainly no fears what had been the matter with mabel when she hinted that perhaps after all james had never done anything what could mabel know or guess or suspect lucy owned to herself candidly that james was incomprehensible after thirteen years or was it fourteensuddenlywith no warning symptoms to plunge into such devotion as never before when everything had been new and he only engaged men were like that when they were engaged they arent certain of one and leave no chances but james even as an engaged man had always been certain he had taken her and everything else for granted she remembered how her sisters not only mabel but the critical agnes now mrs riddell in the north had discussed him and found him too cocksure to be quite gallant kissed her of course he had kissed her good heavens yes but not as he had that night at the opera you darling you darling now james had called her my darling as often as you pleasebut never until then you darling theres a world of difference anybody can see it and thenafter the beautiful the thrilling the deeply touching episodethe moment after itthere was the old indifferent slightly bored james with the screwed eye and the disk not a hint not a ripple not the remains of a flush it was the most bewildering the most baffling jigsaw of a business she had ever heard of you would have said that he was two quite separate people you might have saidmabel would have said at oncethat james had had nothing to do with it but she had said so the discovery stabbed lucy in the eyes like a flash of lightning left her blind and quivering with a swim of red before her hurt vision that was why mabel had been frightened and now lucy herself was frightened francis lingen absurd mr urquhart ah that was quite another thing she grew hot she grew quite cold and suddenly she began to sob oh no no not that a flood of tossing thoughts came rioting and racing in flinging crests of foam like white and beaten water she for a time was swept about a weed in this fury of storm she was lost effortless at deaths threshold but she awoke herself from the nightmare walked herself about and reason returned it was nonsense unwholesome nonsense why that first time he was in the library with james and francis lingen his second visit to the house why when she was at the opera he had been at peltry with the mabels and as for wycross he had wired from st jamess in the afternoon and come on the next day absurdand thank god for it and poor francis lingen she could afford to laugh at that francis lingen was as capable of kissing the duchess of westburyat whose horrible party she had been the other nightas herself she felt very safe and enormously relieved so much so that she could afford herself the reflection that if hardihood had been all that was wanting jimmy urquhart would have had plenty and to spare oh yes indeed butthank god againhe was a gentleman if ever there was one nobody but a gentleman could afford to be so simple in dealing having worked all this out she felt that her feet at least were on solid ground a spirit of adventure was renewed in her and a rather unfortunate contretemps provoked it before she knew where she was she was up to the neck as urquhart would have said in a turbid stream francis lingen that elegant unfortunate was certainly responsible if you could call one so tentative and clinging responsible for anything he had proposed the flower show to which she had been as an earnest gardener early in the morning by herself with a notebook she did not want to go with him at all and moreover she had an appointment to meet james at a wedding affair in queens gate however being ridiculously amiable where the palehaired hectic was concerned go she did and sat about at considerable length he had only cared to look at the sweetpeas his passion of the hour and urged a chair upon her that he might the better do what he really liked look at her and talk about himself so he did and read her a poem and made great play with his tenderness his dependence upon her judgment and his crosses with the world he pleaded for tea which ordered did not come then hunted for the motor which finally she found for herself she arrived late at queens gate the eyeglass glared in horror james indeed was very cross what any chance victim of his neighbourhood may have endured is not to be known so far as lucy could see he did not open his mouth once while he was there he refused all nourishment with an angry gleam and seemed wholly bent upon making her selfconscious uncomfortable and finally indignant upon this goodly foundation he reared his mountain of affront he made himself a monument of matteroffact impassivity during the drive home his arms were folded he stared out of window she thought once she heard him humming an air but he didnt smoke as he certainly would have done had relations been easy he kept her at a distance but not aggressively lucy was by this time very much annoyed her apologies had been frozen at the front by his angry glare she had no intention now of renewing them nor did she care to justify herself as she might have done by pointing out that while she was halfanhour late he was probably a quarter of an hour too early this would have been a safe venture for his fussiness over an appointment and tendency to be beforehand with it were quite well known to himself she kept the best face she could upon the miserable affair but was determined that she would force a crisis at home come what might arrived at onslow square james strode into the library and shut the door behind him when crewdson was disposed of on his numerous affairs lucy followed her lord he turned he stared and waited for her to speak lucy said i think that you must be sorry that you have treated me so i feel it very much and must ask you how you justify it james did his best to an easy calm apologies should be in the air i should have looked for one myself an hour or so ago you should have had it she said if you had given me time but you stared me out of countenance the moment i came in anger before you had even heard me is not a nice thing to face james turned pale he used his most incisive tones i am ready to hear your explanation perhaps i had better say that i know it lucy showed him angry eyes if you know it there is no need for me to trouble you with it you must also know that it isnt easy to get away from a great crowd in a minute but he seemed not to hear her he had another whip in waiting which nothing could have kept him from the use of i think that i must trouble you rather i think i should be relieved by hearing from you where the crowd was of which you were oneor two indeed she discovered that he was white with rage though she had never seen him so before what do you mean james she saidand he i know that you were at the flower show you were there with lingen yes said lucy i was indeed and why shouldnt i be i have told you before this what my views are about that i dont intend to repeat them at present i think you must be mad said lucy do you mean to tell me that you object to francis lingen to that extentto the extent of such a scene as this he faced her from his height i do mean that then she said out of herself you are insulting me i dont think you can intend to do that and i should like to say also that you of all the men in the world are the last person to be jealous or suspicious of anybody where i am concerned she hadnt meant to say that but when she saw that he took it as a commonplace of marital ethics she determined to go further still he took it in fact just so it seemed to him what any wife would say to any indignant husband i beg your pardon he said you dont quite follow me i agree with you that i should be the last person but i beg to point out to you that i should also be the first person and i will go on to add if you will excuse me that i should be the only person no person at all said lucy has the right or the reason to suspect me of anything or to be jealous of any of my acquaintance you didnt understand me i suppose because you are too angry what i meant you to remember was how much how very much you are bound to believe in menow of all times in our life here then was a psyche with the lamp in her hand here was lucy on the limit of a world unknown here she stood at her feet the tufted grasses and field herbs dusty homely friendly things which she knew beyond her beyond the cliffs edge were the dim leagues of a land and sea unknown what lay out there beyond her in the mist what mountain and forest land lay there what quiet islands what sounding mains but it was done now james gazed blankly but angrily puzzled into her face i havent the faintest notion what you mean he said evidently he had not she must go on though she hated it you are very surprising i can hardly think you are serious let me remind you of the operaof the walkuere he gave his mind to it explored the past and so entirely failed to understand her that he looked rather foolish i remember that we were there then he had a flash of lightand shed it on her god knows i remember also that lingen was in the box oh lingen are you mad on do you not remember that you were there before lingen yes i do remember it he stood poor fool revealed lucys voice rang clear very well if that is all that your memory brings you i have nothing more to say she left him swiftly and went upstairs in the possession of an astounding truth but rapt with it in such a whirlwind of wonder that she could do no more than clutch it to her bosom as she flew she sent out word that she was not coming down to dinner and locked herself in with her truth to make what she could of it chapter xi anteros macartney was no fool in his own world where a perfectly clear idea of what you want to do combined with a nonchalant manner of take it or leave it had always carried him through the intricacies of business if he was a fool in supposing that precisely the same armoury would defend him at home there is this excuse for him that lucy had encouraged him to suppose it when she dashed from the room at this recent moment he sat for some time with his eyes fixed upon his foolscap but presently found himself reading the same sentence over and over again without understanding one word in it he dropped the document rose and picked himself out a cigar with deliberation and attention disproportionate to the business he cut stabbed and lighted the cigar and stood by the mantelpiece smoking and gazing out of window he had overdone it he had stretched regime too far there had been a snap now just where had he failed was it with francis lingen perhaps he must admit though that some good had come out of the trouble he felt reassured about francis lingen because as he judged women dont get angry in cases of the kind unless the husband has nothing to be angry about he felt very worldwise and shrewd as he propounded this women like their husbands to be jealous especially if they are jealous with reason because then they say to themselves well anyhow he loves me still i have him to fall back upon at all events capital he gave a short guffaw and resumed his cigar but lucy was angry obviously because he had wasted good jealousy on a mere fancy damn it he had overdone it the next thingif he didnt look outwould be that she would give him something to be jealous of he must calm herthere would be no difficulty in that no loss of prestige prestige that was the thing you wanted to maintain discipline be jiggeredthat might do mischiefif you drove it too hard the fact was he was a little too sharp with lucy she was a dear gentle creature and no doubt one fell into the habit of pushing a willing horse he could see it all now perfectly he had been put out when he arrived at the marchants too earlyshe was not there and then that old fool vane with his saw your wife at the chelsea thing with lingen they looked very settled that had put the lid on that was how it was and he had been too sharp well one must make mistakes he wondered what she had meant about the opera why had she harped upon that string you were there before francis lingen she had saidwell and thenshe had been furious with him he had said i know that i was and she if that is all your memory brings you and off she went he smoked hardlifted his hand and dropped it smartly to his mantelpiece no that was a thing no man could fathom a lucyismquite clear to herself no doubt well hed leave that alone the more one tried to bottom those waters the less one fished up but he would make peace with her after dinner he heard mrs macartney is not dining this evening she has a bad headache and doesnt wish to be disturbed received it with a curt nod and accepted it simply better to take women at their word her troubles would have simmered down by the morning whereas if he were to go up now one of two things either shed be angry enough to let him batter at the door to no purposeand feel an ass for his pains or she would let him in and make a fussin which case he would feel still more of an ass ask mrs macartney if i can do anything he had said to smithers and was answered i think mrs macartney is asleep sir he hoped she was that would do her a world of good morning in the breakfastroom he faced a lucy selfpossessed with guarded eyes and if he could have seen it with implied reproach stiffening every line of her her generosity gratified him but should have touched him keenly she came to him at once and put up her face im sorry i was so cross james his immediate feeling i say was one of gratification that was all right she had come in to that succeeded a wave of kindness he dropped his glass and took her strongly in his arms dearest i behaved very badly im truly sorry he kissed her and for a moment she clung to him but avoided his further kisses yet he had kissed her as a man should she had nothing more to say but he felt it her due that he should add something while yet he held her as for poor francisi know that i was absurdi admit it frankly he felt her shake and guessed her indignation youll believe me dear you know i dont like owning myself a fool then she had looked up still in his armswhy should you be so stupid how can you possibly be you of all people there she was again but he intended to make peace once and for all my dearest i cant be more abject for the life of me i have confessed that i was an abounding ass please to believe in me ask francis lingen to tea for a month of daysand not a word from me she had laughed rather scornfully and tried to free herself he kissed her again before he let her go almost immediately he resumed his habitseyeglass morning post and scraps of comment he made an effort and succeeded he thought in being himself johnny mallet gives another party at the bachelors today i believe i go has he asked you he means to hes a tufthunterbut he gets tufts i see that the fathers in god are raving about the tithe bill i shall have jasper mellen at meand the dean too do you rememberdid you ever hear i wonder of box and cox they have a knack of coming to me on the same day once they met on the doorstep and each of them turned and fled away it must have been very comic lucy busied herself with her letters and her coffeecups she wished that she did not feel so ruffled buta walk would do her good she would go into the park presently and look at the tulips and lilacs it was horrid to feel so stuffy on such a perfect day how long to whitsuntide that was to be heavenlyif james didnt get inspired by the dark something would have to be prepared for that in her eyes sedate though they were there lurked a gleam the beaconfire of a woman beleaguered certainly jimmy urquhart liked her he had said that she liked him well and so she did very much indeed james went forgiven to his bishops and deans and to lunch with his johnny mallet and the tufted lucy her household duties done arrayed herself for the tulips of the park the grey watches of the night with their ache and moments of panic the fever and fret the wearing down of rage and emptying of wonder and dismay the broken snatches of dreamsleep and the heavy slumber which exhaustion finally gave herall this had brought downstairs to be kissed embraced and forgiven a lucy disillusioned and tired to death but schooled to patience her conclusion of the whole matter now was that it was james who had indeed loved her in the dark with an access of passion which he had never shown before and could drop apparently as fitfully as he won to it and also with a fulness of satisfaction to himself which she did not pretend to understand it was james and no other simply because any other was unthinkable such things were not done jimmy urquhartand what other could she imagine itwas out of the question she had finally brushed him out as a girl flecks the mirror in a cotillon it was james but why he had been so moved how moved how so lightly satisfied how his conduct at other times could be fitted inreally it didnt matter two straws it meant nothing but a moments silliness it led to nothing it mended nothingand it broke nothing her soul was her own her heart was her own it was amiable of him she dared say but had become rather a bore she conceived of a time at hand when she might have to be careful that he shouldnt but just now she wouldnt make a fuss anything but that he was within his rights she supposed and let it rest at that so arrayed she faced him and to let nothing be omitted on her part she herself apologised for what had been his absurd fault and so won as much from him as he could ever have given anybody as for francis lingenshe had not once given him a thought now however james away to his bishops she arrayed herself anew and went out fraiche et dispose into the park intending that she should see urquhart and so she did he was on horseback and dismounted the moment he saw her he was glad to see her she could tell but did not insist upon his gladness he admired her she could see but took his admiration as a matter of course she wore champagnecolour she had snakeskin shoes a black hat she was excited and had colour her eyes shone well he said here you are then thats a good thing i began to give you up how did you know she stopped and bit her lip i didnt but im very glad to see you you look very well where are you going she nodded her direction tulips just over there i always pilgrimise them all right let us pilgrimise them tulips are like a drug a little is exquisite and you are led on excess brings no more enchantment only nausea you buy a million and plant your woodland and the result is horror a hundred would have been heavenly thats what i find she had mockery in her look gleams of it shot with happiness to be there is that what youve done at martley i shant praise you when i see it i hate toomuchness so do i but always too late i ought to learn from you whose frugality is part of your charm one cant imagine too much lucy ah dont be sure she cautioned him ask james i shall im quite equal to that ill ask him today hes to be at an idiotic luncheon to which im fool enough to be going marchionesses and all the rest of it how can you go to such things when you might beflying earning your displeasure oh i know i know i didnt know how to refuse mallet he seemed to want me i was flattered as a matter of facti have flown alone good lord no i had an expert there he let me have the levers i had an illusion but i always do do tell me your illusion i thought that i could sing you did sing im sure i might have one miracle the more as for the machineit wasnt a machine it was a living spirit a male spirit or a female spirit female i think anyhow i addressed it as such what did you say to her i said you darling that startled her if you like she looked frightened then coloured deeply urquhart seemed full of his own thoughts hows lancelot he asked her that helped her oh he delights me another living spirit he never fails to ask after you stout chap he harps on your story the first you ever told us this time he put in his postscript how is wives and co he nodded very good i begat an immortal that tale will never die hell tell it to his grandchildren they stood or strolled at ease by the railings she within them he holding his horse outside them the tulips were adjudged names taken colours approved youll see mine he said in ten days do you realise that she was radiant i should think so that has simply got to happen are you going to have other people there vera he said and her man and i rather think considine her mans brother fat and friendly with a beard and knows a good deal about machines one way and another i want his advice about hydroplanes among other things youll like him why shall i like him because hes himself he has no manners at all only feelings nice feelings thats much better than manners yes i dare say they are she thought about it theres a difference between manner and manners oh rather the more manner you have the less manners yes i meant that but even manners dont imply feelings do they i was going to say never but that wouldnt be true you have charming manners your feelings clothes and a jolly good fit how kind you are she was very pleased now youwhat shall i say you might say that i have no manners and not offend me i have no use for them but i have feelings sometimes nice sometimes horrid i am sure that you couldnt be horrid dont be sure he said gravely i had rather you werent i have done amiss in my day much amiss and i shall do it again she looked gently at him her mouth showed the luini compassion longdrawn and longsuffering because it understood dont say that i dont think you mean it he shook his head but did not cease to watch her oh but i mean it when i want a thing i try to get it when i see my way i follow it it seems like a law of nature and i suppose it is one what else is instinct yes she said but i suppose we have feelings in us so that we may realise that other people have them too yes yesor that we may give them to those who havent got any of their own they had become grave and he at least moody lucy dared not push enquiry she had the ardent desire to help and the instinct to make things comfortable on the surface which all women have and which makes nurses of them but she discerned trouble ahead urquharts startling frankness had alarmed her before and she didnt trust herself to pass it off if it flashed once too often flashes like that lit up the soul and not of the lampholder only they parted with unwillingness on both sides at princes gate and lucy sped homewards with feet that flew as fast as her winged thoughts that you darling was almost proof positive and yet he had been at peltry that night and yet he couldnt have dared now even as she uttered that last objection she faltered for when daring came into question what might he not dare remained the first he had been at peltry she knew because she had been asked to meet him there and had refused on the operas account besides she had heard about his riding horses as if they were motors and here she stood still and found herself shaking that letterin that letter of mabels about his visit to peltry had there not been something of a call to london and return late for dinner and the opera began at halfpast six what was the date of his call to london could she find that letter and should she hunt for it or leave it vague and then she thought of martley and then she blushed chapter xii martley thicket urquhart was a man of explosive action and had great reserve of strength he was moved by flashes of insight and was capable of longsustained flights of vehement effort but his willpower was nourished entirely by those moments of intense prevision which showed him a course and all the stages of it the mistakes he made and they were many and grievous were mostly due to overshooting his mark sometimes to underrating it in the headlong and not too scrupulous adventure he was now upon both defects were leagued against him when he first saw lucy at her dinnerparty he said to himself thats a sweet woman i shall fall in love with her to say as much was proof that he had already done so but it was the sudden conviction of it which inspired him filled him with effervescent nonsense and made him the best of company for a dinnerparty throughout it at his wildest and most irresponsible his fancy and imagination were at work upon her he read her to the soul or thought so chance and lancelot gave him the chart of the terrain the switch at the drawingroom door gave him his plan the opportunity came and he dared to take it he marked the effect upon her it was exactly what he had foreseen he saw her eyes humid upon macartney her hand at rest on his arm jesuitry palliated what threatened to seem monstrous even to him god bless her i drive her to her man whats the harm in that so he went ononce more and yet again and in the meantime by daylight and by more honest ways he gained her confidence and her liking he saw no end to the affair so prosperously begun and didnt trouble about one all he cared about just now were two courtshipsthe vicarious in the dark and the avowed of the daylight he intended to go on he was full of itin the midst of his other passions of the hour such as this of the air he was certain of his direction as certain as he had ever been but now his mistakes and miscalculations began he had mistaken his lucy and his macartney too what he didnt know about macartney lucy did know what he didnt know about lucy was that she had found out james james as eros wouldnt do chiefly because such conduct on jamess part would have been incredible urquhart didnt know it would be incredible nor did he know that she did one other thing he didnt know which was that lucy was half his own before she started for martley she in fact didnt know it either she had been his from the moment when she had asked him to keep out of the air and he had declined all this is necessary matter because in the light of it his next deliberated move in his game was a bad mistake on the night before she was expected at martley being there himself he wrote her a letter to this effect dear mrs macartney to my dismay and concern i find that i cant be here to receive you nor indeed until you are on the point to go away i shall try hard for sunday which will give me one day with youbetter to me than a thousand elsewhere vera will be my curate nothing will be omitted which will show you how much martley owes you or how much i am present or absent yours j u that letter he gave to vera nugent to deliver to lucy vera wanted to know what it was all about its to say that i cant be here he said that is the fact unfortunately why my dear jimmy i thought you adored her isnt the poor lady the very latest my dear girl i do adore her leave it at that its an excellent reason for not being here the best but im going up with a star which is another reason and i hope to be here on sunday which is the most i can afford myself really thats all but you like her you say or you should i do like her shes not very talkativeto me but listens well considine will like her listeners are rare with him poor dear but you move me i didnt know you were so far gone never mind how far i am gone provided that i go said urquhart oh at this rate i will hasten you i cant be bothered with a cause celebre but what am i to tell the lady you must be practical my fine man tell her that i was sent for in a hurry hint at the air if you think proper i think i have said all that is necessary in the note the macartneys were expected to lunch urquhart left his house at noon driving himself in a motor he disappeared in the forest but didnt go very far james heard of his hosts defection with impassivity and a glance of his eyeglass wonder what jimmy has shied off for he said to lucy through the dressingroom door aeroplaning or royalty do you think the s may have sent for him i know he knows them but its characteristic he makes a fuss about you so that you think youre his life or death and then you find outnot at all you simply dont existthats all what do you think i dont think that we dont exist she said i think that something important has happened oh well said james one had got into the way of thinking that one was important oneself dd cool i call it there had been a moment when lucy knew anger but that had soon passed she knew that she was bitterly disappointed and found a rueful kind of happiness in discovering how bitterly she had reached the stage where complete happiness seems to be rooted in selfsurrender in a curious kind of way the more she suffered the more surely she could pinch herself on the chin and say my dear you are caught there was comfort in thisand martley itself house gardens woodlands the lake the vistas of the purple wolds of forest country all contributed to her enchaining luncheon passed off well under vera nugents vivacious brown eyes which could not penetrate the gentle mask of lucys manner nugent the husband was a sleepy goodhumoured giant lord considine whose beard was too long and jacketsleeves much too shortas were his trousershis socalled trousers as james put it in his scorntalked fiercely about birdsnests and engaged lucy for the whole afternoon this was not allowed him by his sisterinlaw who had other more sociable plans but the good man had his pleasure of a docile listener after tea took her for a great walk in the woods and exhibited nearly all his treasures though as he said she should have been there six weeks earlier alas if she had been she would have had a more open mind to give to the birds and their affairs after dinner when they were on the terrace under the stars he returned to his subject there were nightingales it seemed what did mrs macartney say to that it appeared that six miles away the nightingale was an unknown fowl here of course they were legionaries you might hear six at a time two triangles of them did she know that they sang in triangles she did not very well then what did she say what about shoesa cloaka shawl all these things could be brought lucy said that she would fetch them for herself and went upstairsshallow broad stairs of black oak very much admired by the experts but of them and their excellence she had no thought she did not care to let her thoughts up to the surface just then adventure beckoned her when she returned nugent had withdrawn himself to the smokingroom and james was talking to vera nugent about people one knew neither of them was for nightingales you are very foolhardy james said i cant help you with nightingales lord considine in a black spanish cloak with the staff of a pilgrim to compostella offered his arm well go first to the oak spinney he said its rather spongy im afraid but who minds a little cold water vera assured him that she did for one and james added that he was rather rheumatic come along mrs macartney said the lord these people make me sorry for them so they went down the steps and dipped into the velvet night it was barely dark skirting the lake you could almost see the rings made by rising trout and there was enough of you visible at least to send the waterfowl scuttering from the reeds beyond that again you could descry the pale ribbon of the footpath and guess at the exuberant masses of the peony bushes their heavy flowers when they were white still smouldering with the last of the sunsets fire but once in the woods you had to feel your way and the silence of it all like the darkness was thick had a quality which you discovered only by the soft close touch of it upon your cheeks and eyes it seemed to clog the ears and made breathing a deeper exercise the further in they went the greater the guesswork of the going lord considine went in front to keep the branches from her face upon that rich heavy silence the first birds song stole like a sense of tears the low tentative pensive note which seems like the welling of a vein lucy stayed and breathlessly listened the doubtfulness the strain of longing in it chimed with her own mood which was one perhaps of passive wonderment she waited as one who is to receive she was not committed but she was prepared everything was to come the note was held it waxed it called and then broke as it were into a fountain of crystal melody thereafter it purred of peace it floated and stopped short as if content but out of the dark another took up the song and further off another provoking our first musician to a new stave lucy with parted lips held her heart love was in this place overshadowing her her sightless eyes were wide waiting upon it and it came she heard a step in the thicket she stayed without motion will or thought expectans expectavit she was in the strange arms and the strange kisses were on her parted lips she knew not nor cared how long this rapture held she got and she gave james or another this was eros who had her now she heard oh lucy oh my love my love and she thought to have answered you have mewhat shall i do but she had no reply to her question and seemed to have no desire unsatisfied lord considines voice calling i say shall we go onor do you think you had better go in sounded a very homely note her eros still held her even as she answered perhaps we had better turn back now i could stop out forever on such a night it has been more beautiful than i can say approval of the sentiment expressed was stamped upon her for a moment of wild surrender she clung as she kissed then she was gently relinquished and the lord was at hand theres nothing quite like it is there he said ive heard astounding orchestras of birds in south america but nothing at all like thiswhich moreover seems to me at its best in england in granada up there in the wellington elms they absolutelymind mind heres a briarrootthey shout at you theres a brazen hardihood about them in athens too in the kings garden it is a kind of clamour of soundlike an arab wedding no no i say that we are unrivalled for nightingales the enthusiastic man galloped on and lucy throbbing in the dark was grateful to him the lights of the house recalled her to the world presently up the slope she saw vera nugent at the piano turning to say something to somebody it was james rather bored in an armchair james liked neither the society of women nor the notes of a piano but he liked still less for such things to be known of him his own social standard may perhaps be put thus he liked to appear bored without boring his companions on the whole he flattered himself that high as it was he nearly always reached it wheres my beautiful young brother said lord considine plunging in upon them asleep ill take my oath my dear vera you are too easy with him the man is getting mountainous you two little know what youve missedhey mrs macartney he was obviously overheated but completely at ease with himself what do you say we have missed vera asked of james and he now on his feet said bravely for myself a nasty chill a chillout there lucy was asked did she like it all and boldly owned all the dark is like an eiderdown bed impossible to imagine anything softer she rubbed her eyes it has made me dreadfully sleepy she said i think if you wont be horrified vera said that she should go up with her james stooped to her cheek lord considine bowed over her hand in lucys room the pair had a long talk all of which i dont pretend to report it began with im so glad that you take to poor considine you are so very much his sort of woman hes a dear simple creature far too good for most of usand a nugent freak i assure you theyve never known the like in the county of cork i like him immensely but of course hes too remote for the like of me no small talk you know and im aburst with it i talk while im thinking and he when he has thought you understand that kind evidently i suppose your clever husband is like that not that i dont get on with him we did excellentlyi think he knew everybody that i could think of and i everybody he chose to mention but jimmy likes considine you know by the way it was very disgraceful of jimmy but not so disgraceful as you might think in its way its a compliment he thinks so much of youoh i may as well tell you the shocking truth he ran away what a moth in the drawingroom ought to do but never can jimmy not at all a moth quite suddenly did my dear mrs macartney jimmy ran away from you flying i doubt it profoundly wrestling i fancy fighting beasts at ephesus you have doubtless discovered how enthusiastic jimmy is most attractive no doubt but sometimes embarrassing as once when we were in naplesin the funicolare halfway up vesuviusjimmy sees a party at the other end of the carriage mother daughter two pigtailed children and a governessquite a pretty gel jimmy was enormously struck with this governess he could see nothing else and nobody else either least of all me of course he muttered and rolled his eyes abouthis chin jutted like the bow of a destroyer presently he couldnt stand it he marched across the carriage and took off his hat with a bowmy dear to the governess poor gel i beg your pardon says he but i have to tell you something i think you are the most beautiful person i ever saw in my life and take pride in saying so wasnt it awful i didnt dare look at thembut it seemed all right afterwards i suppose she told her people that of course he was mad so he is in a way but its quite nice madness i wont say that jimmy never goes too farbut nobody could be nicer about it afterwards than jimmyno one hes awfully sorry and contrite and all that most people like him amazingly i suppose hes told you about our father he loves all the stories there are about him and so on vera nugent was a great talker lucy at her prayers lucy in her bed had large gaps in the sequence of her thoughts safety lay only with lancelot she could centre herself in him lancelot it was who with forceful small fingers and halfshy halfsly eyes finally closed down hers with a go to sleep you tired mamma chapter xiii martley thicket the day that succeeded was prelude to the night sufficient to show lucy her way into that spacious unknown by her own desire she passed it quietly and had leisure to review and to forecast she put it to herself roughly thus i may guess but i dont know who loves me so it cannot continueit shall stop this very night but this one night i must go to him if only to say that it can never be again and it wont be again i am sure of that however he may take it whatever he may be driven to he will do what i say must be as for me i dont think women can ever be very happy i expect i shall get used to itone does to almost anything except toothache and i have lancelot she put all this quite frankly to herself not shirking the drab outlook or the anguish of doing a thing for the last timealways a piercing ordeal for her as for james if she thought of him at all it was with pity poor dear he really was rather dry she ought to have been very angry with urquhart but she was not the first time he did it i understand i am sure he had a sudden thought and couldnt resist it it must have been more than half fun and the rest because it was so romantic the other times were much more wrong but im not angry with him i ought to bebut im notnot at all i suppose that is because i couldnt be angry with him if i tried not if he did much more no i am sure he doesnt hold me cheap hes not at all like that james mightonly james holds all women cheap but he doesnt i never felt at all like this about a man before onlyit must stop after this once you see he had not kindled passion in her even if there were any to be kindled lucy with a vehement imagination lacked initiative you could touch her in a moment if you knew how or if you were the right person now urquhart had never touched though he had excited her to be touched you must respond to a need of hersmuch more that than have a need of your own and to be the right person you must be empowered according to lucy urquhart was not really empowered but an usurper of course he didnt know that he reasoned hastily and superficially he thought her to be like most women struck by audacity what really struck her about him were his timelinesshe had responded to a need of hers when he had first kissed herand his rare moments of tenderness you darling oh if james could only have said that instead of my darling poor james what a goose he was it was a very peaceful day james and nugent had driven out to play golf on some firstclass course or other by the sea lord considine was busy with his secretary over a paper for the british association in the afternoon he promised lucy sight of two golden orioles and kept his promise she had leisure to look about her and find traces of urquhart in much that was original and more that was comfortable and intimate in martley thicket it was a long twostoreyed house of whitewashed brick with a green slate roof intermixed with reedthatch deepeaved and verandahed along the whole south front the upper windows had green persanes the house stood on the side of a hill was terraced and looked over a concave of fine turf into a valley down whose centre ran the lake at whose bottom was the wood and beyond that the moors and beechmasses of the forest beside the house and behind it was a walled kitchen garden whitewalled with a thatch atop on the other side were stables kennels and suchlike everything was grown to the top of its bent but there was nothing very rare no frills said lord considine and approved of it all i dare say a woman would beautify it but it would cease to be jimmys and would cease to be interesting too she would have more flowers and fewer shrubs now jimmy knows enough about it to understand that shrubs and trees are the real test of gardening anybody can grow flowers but shrubs want science lucy felt rebuked she had desiderated more flowers james who knew nothing and cared little about gardens passed approval of the house and offices it doesnt smell of money he said and yet you see what a lot it means when you look into it success in fact without visible effort one of jamess high standards he didnt know how jimmy got his money but had no doubts at all of its being there a man who could lend francis lingen l without a thought must be richissime yet jimmy had no menservants in the house and james glared about him for the reason lucy had a reason i suppose you know he wants to be really comfortable she proposed and james transferred his mild abhorrence to her comfortable without a fellow to put out his things he scoffed at her but she was rather short with him even testy my dear james mr urquharts things are things to be put on or taken offlike lord considines socalled clothes to you they seem to be robes of ceremony or sacrificial vestments james stared rather through than at her as if some enemy lurked behind her my clothes seem to annoy you may i suggest that somebody must get the mud off them and that i had rather it wasnt me as for ceremony but she had gone james shrugged her out of mind and wondered vaguely if she was rather attracted by jimmy urquhart it was bound to be somebodyat her age thirtytwo she must be when they begin to like a fling well there was nothing in it later on it occurred to him that she was looking uncommonly well just now he saw her in white cross the lawn a springy motion a quick lift turn of the head she looked a girl and a pretty one at that his heart warmed to her how could a man have a better wife than that success without effort again there it was the evening came the close of a hot and airless day the sun set heavy and red a bluish mist seemed to steal out of the forest and shroud the house the terrace was not used after dinner and when the men joined vera and her in the drawingroom lord considine who had proposed a game of chess to james at the table now came forward with board and box of men nugent as usual had disappeared hes dormant when theres no hunting his wife explained he has nothing to kill and hates his fellowcreatures then said james he might kill some of them i could furnish him with a rough list lucy felt restless and strayed about the room looking at things here and there without seeing them vera watched her saw her wander to the open window and stand there looking gravely into the dark she said nothing and presently lucy stepped out and disappeared vera with raised eyebrows and a half smile resumed her book lucy was now highhearted on her questher quest and mission it was to be this once and for the last time she followed the peony path from the lake to the thicket entered among the trees and pushed her way forward long before she reached the scene of last nights wonder she was a prisoner her lips a prize there was very little disguise left now for a full time they clung together and loved without words but then he spoke so you came i hoped i waited i thought that you might oh my lucy what a fact for me she answered simply and gently i camei had to comebut well my love ah she said but this must be for the last time this was not taken as she had meant it to be love began again then he said thats absurd no no she protested its right it must be so you would not have me do anything else and i must go yes indeed you must go now not yet lucy soon no at once she told him the last time is come and gone you must not keep me let me talk to you so for a few minutes theres everything to say no she said tell me nothing i dare not know it please let me go now a last time then lucy she yielded her lips but unwillingly for now her mind was made up the thing had to be done and the sooner the better ah he said how can i let you go easily she answered when i ask you and was unanswerable she forced herself free and stood undecided you neednt go back yet he said but she thought she must i came out alone she told him but vera was in the room so were the others i dont know what they will think nothing at all he said well everything shall be as you wish you see that you have only to name your wish i have one thing to ask youi dare not ask any more she said her voice had a wavering sound ask he said and ill tell you the truth you dont think it wicked of me to have come because i did come i thought that i must becausebecause i could never explain at any other time in any other way you dont thinklightly of me oh my dear my dear he saidand she felt him tremble though he did not touch her i think more dearly of you than of anything in heaven the world holds no other woman for me so it will always be she said quietly its very wonderful i dont understand it at all i thought perhapsi wonderedif i had been angry i deserve that and more i know i ought to be angry so i should be if well my love well but she couldnt tell him and asked him to let her go they parted at the entry of the wood with good night and lucy flitted back with a pain in her heart like the sound of wailing but women can wail at heart and show a fair face to the world her stretched smile had lost none of its sweetness her eyes none of their brightness vera nugent watched her narrowly and led the conversation upstairs she thought that she detected a pensive note but assured herself that all was pretty well thats a remarkable woman she said to herself who would rather have a heartache now than grin with misery next week after this id trust her anywhere on sunday morning urquhart made an explicit return to martley arriving at the hour of eleven in his motor of battleship grey colour and formidable foreextension behind it looked rather like a toy lucy had gone to church alone for james never went and vera nugent simply looked appealing and then laughed when she was invited that was her way of announcing her religion and a pleasant one lord considine was out for the day with sandwiches bulging his pockets nugent had been invisible since overnight he was slugging said his wife returning staidly through the wood she saw urquhart waiting for her at the wicket and saw him be it owned through a veil of mist but it was soon evident from his address that the convention set up was to be maintained the night was to take care of itself the day was to know nothing of it officially his address was easy and lighthearted am i to be forgiven can i expect it let me tell you that i do expect it you know me better than to suppose that i didnt want to be here on your first visit she answered him with the same spirit i think you might have been i must say no i couldnt there was no doubt about it i simply had to go so vera told me then she dared may i ask if you went far he tipped his head sideways too far for my peace of mind anyhow that tells me nothing i am not to know any more you are to know what you please well she said i please to forget it now i had better tell you how much i love martley james says that the house is perfect in its way but i say that you have done justice to the site and think it higher praise it is im much obliged to you the problem wasnot to enhance the site for that was out of the question rather to justify the impertinence of choosing to put any building there because of course you see that any house is an impertinence in a forest yes of coursebut not yours urquhart shrugged im not afraid of your flatteries because i know he said the most that can be said for me is that i havent choked it up with scarlet and orange flowers theres not a geranium in the place and i havent even a pomegranate in a tub though i might oh no she said warmly theres nothing finicky about your gardenany more than there is about you there was never such a man of directionat least i never met one the moment she had said it she became embarrassed but he took no notice his manner was perfect they returned by the lake and stayed there a while to watch nugent trying to catch trout the rest of the day she spent in urquharts company who contrived with a good deal of ingenuity to have her to himself while appearing to be generally available after dinner feeling sure of him she braved the talebearing woods and nightingales vocal of her sweet unease there was company on this occasion but she felt certain it would not have been otherwise had they been retired with the night she was thoughtful and quiet and really her heart was full of complaining he was steadily cheerful and affected a blunt view of life at large she did not look forward to leaving him on the morrow and as good as said so i have been enchanted here she said and hate the thought of london but james wont hear of wycross in june he loves the world urquhart said what are you going to do in august wycross no we never go there in august its too hot and theres lancelot a boy must have excitement i expect it will come to my taking him to the sea unless james consents to scotland we used to do that but nowwell hes bored there he was looking at her she felt though she couldnt see him did you ever go to norway she shook her head he said no more on that head just then i shall see you in london he told her i am going to take my certificate at brooklands next week i hope you might come and applaud no indeed said she i couldnt bear to see you in those conditions i have nerves if you have none i have plenty he said but you ought to do it some day you will have to face it why shall i he wouldnt tell her that made her daring why shall i his first answer was a steady look his second nothing stops you know things all swim to a point ebb and flow they dont go back until they reach it and then and then they mayor they may not blot it out and swim on chapter xiv the great scheme the height of her esteem for urquhart was the measure of her growing disrelish for james it was hard to visit upon a man the sense that he was not what he had never dreamed of being but that is what happened to him by how much he had risen in her eyes when she made an eros of him by so much did he fall when she found out her mistake because he was obviously no eros was he so obviously but part of a man it seemed so indeed if he discerned it theres no wonder he irritated her she found herself instinctively combating his little preparations for completeness of effectshe was herself all for simplicity in these days she could not conceal her scorn for instance when he refused to go with her to dine in a distant suburb because he would not have time to dress as if she said you eat your shirtfront trenchancy from james produced a silent disapproval as he said if she didnt sniff she looked as if she felt a cold coming on she knew it herself and took great pains but it coloured her tone if not her words too often she was merely silent when he was very much himself silence is contagious they passed a whole dinner through without a word sometimes now james had his feelings and was rather unhappy over what he called her moods he thought she did not go out enough she ought to see more people a woman liked to be admired it did not occur to him that she might have been very glad of it from him but then he didnt know how highly she had been elated with what she called thinking it really so his loveinthedarkness no macartney if ever he looked into himself found nothing wrong there he kept a wary eye through his maskingglass upon urquharts comings and goings as far as he could ascertain he was rarely in london during june and early july no doubt he wrote to lucy james was pretty sure of it yet he could not stoop to examining envelopes and had to leave that to providence and herself he mingled with his uneasiness a high sense of her integrity which he could not imagine ever losing it was or might have been curious to observe the difference he made between his two jealousies he had been insolent to francis lingen with his ha lingen you here he was markedly polite to jimmy urquhart much more so than his habit was he used to accompany him to the door when he left an unheardof attention but that may have been because lucy went thither also as a matter of fact urquhart saw very little of her he was very much away on his aerial and other affairs and did not care to come to the house unless james was there nor naturally very much when he was they mostly met in the park rarely at other peoples houses once she lunched at the nugents and had the afternoon alone with him twice he drove her to kew gardens once she asked him for a weekend to wycross and they had some talks and a walk he wrote perhaps once a week and she answered him perhaps once a fortnight not more she had to put the screw on herself to outdo him in frugality she respected him enormously for his mastery of himself and could not have told how much it enhanced her love it was really comical that precisely what she had condemned james for she found admirable in jimmy james had neglected her for his occupations and jimmy was much away about his in the first case she resented in the second she was not far from adoration of such a sign of serious strength they never alluded directly to what had happened but sometimes hinted at it these hints were always hers for urquhart was a random talker said what came into his head and had no eye for implications he made one odd remark and made it abruptly as if it did not affect anybody present its a very funny thing he said that last year i didnt know macartney had a wife and now six months later i dont realise that you have got a husband it made her laugh inwardly but she said gently try to realise it its true you wish me to make a point of it he asked her that with a shrewd look i wish you naturally to realise me as i am there doesnt seem much of you involved in it he said but she raised her eyebrows patiently it is a fact and the fact is a part of me besides theres lancelot oh he said i dont forget him you neednt think it he is a symbol of youand almost an emanation put it like this that what you might have been he is oh said she do you want me to be different he laughed bless you no but i like to see what you gave up to be made woman and i see it in your boy she was impelled to say what she said next by his words which excited her i cant tell youand perhaps i ought nothow happy you make me by loving lancelot i love him so very muchand james never has i cant make out why but it was so from the beginning that was the first thing which made me unhappy in my life at home it was the beginning of everything he seemed to lose interest in me when he found me so devoted urquhart said nothing immediately then he spoke slowly macartney is uneasy with boys because hes uneasy with himself he is only really interested in one thing and he can see that they are obviously uninterested in it you mean she began and did not finish i do said urquhart most men are like that at bottomonly some of us can impose ourselves upon our neighbours more easily than he can half the marriages of the world break on that rock and the other half on idleness she then confessed do you know what i believe in my heart i believe that jamess eyeglass stands in his way with lancelotas it certainly did with me i think you are right there he agreed but you must allow for it hes very uncertain of his foothold and thats his war armour she was more tolerant of james after that conversation and less mutinous against her lot she wondered of course what was to become of them how long she could hold him at arms length how she could bring herself to unsay what had been said in the dark of martley thicket but she had boundless faith in urquhart and knew among other things that any request she made him would be made easy for her but when at the end of june he broached to her his great scheme she was brought face to face with the situation and had to ask herself could she be trusted that he could she knew very well he had a project for a month or six weeks in norway he had hinted at it when she was at martley but now it was broached he didnt disguise it that his interest lay wholly in her coming he laid it before her she lancelot and james were to be the nucleus he should ask the corbets and their boys vera and hers nugent would refuse he knew meantime what did she say he watched her shining eyes perpending saw the gleam of anticipated delight what a plan but then she looked down hesitating something must now be said oh of course lancelot would go mad with joy and i dare say i could persuade james well but you i should live every moment of the time butsometimes life seems to cost too much he held out his hand to her and she took it very simply promise to come and you shant repent it mind you have my word on that then he let her go and they discussed ways and means she would speak to james then he should come and dine and talk it out meantime let him make sure of vera and do his best with the corbets if they were fixed up as she thought probable he might get some other people considine might like it hes very much at your disposal let me tell you you have him at your feet so it was settled and james was attacked in front she told him as they were driving out to dinner that she had met mr urquhart that afternoon i dare say you might said james but he had stiffened to attention he blazed upon me a plan for august i said i would ask you about it james said hm does it rest with me naturally it does i should not think of any plans without talking to you no i suppose you wouldnt said he then he asked and what does urquhart want you to do he doesnt want me particularly he wants all three of us i think said james youll find that he wants you most she felt that this must be fathomed and if he did she said should you object to that he kept very dry it isnt a case of objecting to that or this the question before me at present is whether i want to form one of a party which doesnt want me and where i might be in the way from what i know of mr urquhart she answered i dont think he would ever ask a person he didnt want he might if he couldnt get the person he did want in any other way said james who else is to come vera nugent and her boy and perhaps lord considine he is going to ask laurence and mabel and all the boys too it will be a kind of schooltreat said james i own it doesnt sound very exciting where are we to go to to norway he knows of a house on the hardanger fiord a house in a wood he wants to hire a steamer to take us up from bergen and means to bring a motorboat with him there will be fishing of sorts if you want it i dont said james then held up his chin is my tie straight she looked perfectly what am i to say to mr urquhart he said ill talk about it well discuss it in all its bearings i dont think im so attracted as you are but then its very evident you arent lucy said and no more she felt in a prickly heat and thought that she had never wanted anything so much in her life as this which was about to be denied her she dared not write to lancelot about it but to urquhart she confessed her despair and hinted at her longing he replied at once ask me to dinner ill tackle him vera and child will come not considine the corbets cantgoing to scotland yachting we neednt have another woman but vera will be cross if there is no other man up to you to find one this again she carried to james who said let him comeany free night tell me which you settle will you james had been thinking it out he knew he would have to go and was prepared with what he called a spoke for jimmys wheel incidentally it would be a nasty one for lucy and none the worse for that he considered that she was getting out of hand and that urquhart might be a nuisance because such a spiny customer to tackle but he had a little plan and chuckled over it a good deal when he was by himself he was as usual excessively urbane to urquhart when they met and himself opened the topic of the norwegian jaunt urquhart took up the ball i think you might come your wife and boy will love it and youll kindle at their joy they for life only you for life in them to flout the bard besides you are not a fogey if im not i believe our ages tally you shall climb mountains with me macartney and improve the muscles of your calves you dont fish i think nor do i i thought i should catch your brotherinlaw with that baitbut no as for mine hell spend the month in bed somewhere is your sister coming james asked urquhart nodded and her youngster osborne boy and a good sort lancelot and he have met theyll fight said james and mrs nugent and lucy wont speak vera would speak im sure said lucy and as for me i seldom get a chance a very true saying said urquhart i dont believe the last judgment would prevent vera from talking well macartney what says the man of the world if you mean me said james i gather that you all want to go lucy does but thats of course lancelot will equally of course but i have a suggestion to make might not the party be a little bigger it might and it should said urquhart in fact i asked considine to join us he would love it but he has to make a speech at a congress or read a paper and he says he cant get out of it the corbets cant come ill ask anybody else you like james who was now about to enjoy himself said i leave the ladies to lucy and mrs nugent their choice would no doubt be mine but i certainly think we want another man much as you and i esteem each other my dear urquhart if theres walking to be doneserious walking i think we shall be better three than two i dont at all agree that three is no company where men are concerned i think it better than two or four if only to give a knee or hold the sponge and with more than four you become a horde we want a man now i think so too urquhart said well whos your candidate james meditated or appeared to meditate well he said looking up and fixing urquhart with his eyeglass what do you say to francis lingen lucy likes him i am used to him and you will have to be some day lucy was extremely annoyed that was evident she bit her lip and crumbled her bread she said shortly francis couldnt walk to save his life let us put it another way said james enjoying his little coup let us say that if he did walk he might save his life urquhart marked the breeze and sailed into it i leave all that to you all i know about lingen is that i have done my best to oblige him in his private affairs i confess that i find him mild not to say insipid but i dare say hes the life of a party when hes put to it oh said james not averse from disparaging an old rival oh poor chap he hasnt many party tricks id back him at catscradle and i dare say he plays a very fair game at noughtsandcrosses besides hell do what hes told and fetch things for you youll find him a handy and obliging chap to have about sounds delightful said urquhart pleasantly he turned to lucy well give him lingen shall we she said by all means it doesnt matter in the least to me so james had his little whack after all chapter xv james james hardly knowing it was bracing himself for a serious situation he had a keen eye for a man a feeling for style in his judgment urquhart was momentous so much so that he could not afford to be irritated jealousy to him was a weakness only pardonable when the cause was trivial it had been trivial with poor lingen fishing in heavy water a skipjack snaps at your fly and you jerk him out to bank with a devil take you but the swirling shoulder the long ridge across the pool and the steady strain you are into a twelvepounder and the devil is uninvoked he asked jimmy to lunch at his club and took the candid line about the norwegian project lucy was desperately tired he said so he was pleased with the scheme the poor dear girl was run down the fact was you are very good for her i believe you exhilarate her she forgets her troubles she admires audacityfrom the bank ill be as audacious as you please said jimmy oh you wont take me in james said im an old hand i know my urquhart but lucy will expect feats of strength you are a champion d your eyes said urquhart to himself the boy is one of your slaves too i cant tell you how contented i am that you approve of him hes all right said urquhart who didnt like all this james on the contrary liked it awfully he became a chatterbox hes more than that in his mothers esteem but lucys a wise mother she moves with her finger on her lip and that mind you without coddling shell risk him to the hairsbreadthand never a word but she wont risk herself not she why she might be wanted but there it is women can do these things god knows how its men who make a fuss well wellbut i babble my dear man said urquhart not at all its a thing you never do thus encouraged james plugged onwards he talked more of himself and his affairs than he had ever done in his life before expatiated upon his growing business assumed his guests contentment in his happiness invited praise of his lucy and was not rebuffed at their denial urquhart at first amused ended by being annoyed he felt as if james was a busy dwarf engaged in tying him up in lengths of black cotton round and round he went coil after coil was added before luncheon was over he could move neither hand nor foot it was rather ludicrous really reduced to speechlessness he sat and stared blankly at a voluble james prattling away about things which didnt matter he found himself even admiring things about him the way he could bite pullbread for instance the relish he had for his food but all this chatter he was too uncomfortable to see that jamess present relish was chiefly for that the stilton and biscuits the glass of port were but salt to the handling of jimmy urquhart for james was a good fighter when he had a good man against him his parting words were these now i shouldnt be surprised if she found herself out of conceit with this beano before we start shes like that you know in such a case its up to you to do something you and lancelot between you thats an irresistible pair i defy a gentlewoman and a mother to lose heart come in when you can tell us tales of far cashmere sing us songs of araby i wont promise to join in the chorusif you have choruses but i shall revel in my quiet way now dont forget i count upon you bybye d your eyes oh d your eyes said jimmy shouldering the hill as he went his way really he began to lose nerve a littleand for such a sanguine man a little was much it was as if he was on the downward slide of the wave no longer cresting the flow which surged on ahead of him carrying him no longer the fact was that he was now at the difficult part of an enterprise which had been so far too easy at the moment it was not obvious to him what he was to do james was aware that was plain and james had a strong handif he knew that too he had an unassailable hand but did he urquhart thought not he chuckled grimly to himself as he saw his complacent host taken at his word he looked at his wrist halfpast three d him ill go and see her now but lucy as james had truly put it held firmly to the bank glad of him she certainly was amused by his audacities but not tempted to plunge he saw very soon that he must be careful with her a reference to the hardanger woods at night to the absence of nightingales absence of the darkshe veiled her eyes with blankness and finally shut down the topic dont lets talk of what is not in norway tell me what is there i have to keep lancelot supplied you know no man has so little selfesteem as to suppose that a woman can definitely put him away urquhart had plenty and preferred to think that she thrust him more deeply within her heart quite right he said and exerted himself on her amusement james coming home early found him on the hearthrug talking really well about his flying nobody could have behaved better than james he took his cup of tea listened was interested smoked a cigarette then touched lucys shoulder saying i leave you to your escapades he went to his own room with nothing to do there and sat it out he fought his nervousness refused to see his spectres sat deep in his chair grimly smoking he heard the drawingroom door open urquharts voice yes it will be all right leave all that to me lucy said something he could not tell what his heart beat faster to hear her tones urquhart let himself out she had not gone with him to the front door was that a good sign or a bad one he frowned over that intricate question but kept himself from her until dinnertime she might have come inhe half expected her but she did not what was she doing in there by herself was she thinking where she stood so pretty as she was so innocent such a gentle sweetnatured creature alas alas in short james was growing sentimental about lucy man of fashion as he was with that keen eye for style and the mode it may well be that urquharts interest in her was a kind of cachet a hallmark however that may be james looked at her more curiously during that july than he had done since he saw her first in the garden of drem house yes lucy was pretty more than that she had charm he saw it now she moved her head about like a little birdand yet she was not a little woman by any means tall rather for a woman but there was an absence of suspicion about lucyor rather of fundamental suspicion for she was full of little superficial alarms which was infinitely charmingbut how pathetic it was deeply pathetic it made him vaguely unhappy and for a long time he did not know why tears swam into his eyes as he watched her over the top of his evening paper or was aware at the tail of his eye of her quick and graceful motions before her dressingglass studying his feelings deeply as never before he found himself out it was that he was to lose her had perhaps lost her just as he had found out how inexpressibly dear she was to be and amazement came upon him and dismay to realise that this sweetness of hers this pliancy of temper this strength within beauty were really there in her apart from him as if he had believed that they lay in his esteem no indeed they were her own she could bestow them where she pleased but he couldnt touch hernow he would die sooner than touch her and he couldnt say anything to her that would have been to throw up the game she should never pity him and give him for pity what would have become in the very giving negligible to herself he knew himself well he could never ask for a thing no but could he get her to ask for something ah then she might find out whom she had married a man he judged of spendthrift generosity a prodigal of himself yes that was how it must be if to be at all he kept his eyes wide and followed her every movement with a longing to help which was incessant like toothache at the same time he was careful to keep himself quiet not a tone of voice must vary not a daily action betray him that hand on the shoulder now when urquhart was last here too much there must be no more of it though he could still feel the softness of her in the tips of his fingers thus he braced himself he held good cards but he didnt know how good chapter xvi amari aliquid lingen was exceedingly gratified by lucys letter james had thought the invitation should come from her and as the subjectmatter was distasteful to her sooner than discuss it she had acquiesced few pinpricks had rankled as this one she had never had any feeling but toleration for lingen james had erected him as a foible and that he should use him now as a counterirritant made her both sore and disgustful she wished to throw up the whole scheme but was helpless because she could neither tell james who would have chuckled nor urquhart either to have told urquhart whether she told him her reason or left him to guess it would have precipitated a confession that her present position was untenable in her heart she knew it for the heart knows what the mind stores but she had not the courage to summon it up to table it and declare this robe is outworn stretched at the seams ragged at the edges away with it just now she could not do it and because she could not do it she was trapped james had her under his hand therefore she wrote her dear francis and had his grateful acceptance and his solemn elation visible upon his best calling face i cant tell you how happy you have made me it is beautiful even for you to make people happy that is why you do it what else could you do life is made up of illusions i think let me therefore add to the sum of mine that you have desired my happiness this sort of thing which once had stirred her to gentle amusement now made her words fall dry you mustnt forget that james has desired it too oh said francis lingen thats very kind of him really it is mr urquharts party he invented it did he desire my happiness too asked lingen provoked into mockery of his own eloquence by these chills upon it at least he provided for it said lucy and that you shouldnt be uncomfortable i have asked margery dacre to come lingen felt this to be unkind but he closed his eyes and said how splendid that was the fact it had been an afterthought of hers and partially countered on james margery dacre also had accepted she had said how too delicious james when made aware that she was coming ducked his head it is true but made a damaging defence is she he said why shell make our number a square one she replied to begin with and she might make it more pleasant for the othersfrancis lingen and mr urquhart if she hadnt been selfconscious she would never have said such a thing as that jamess commentary i see and the subsequent digestion of the remark by the eyeglass made her burn with shame she felt spotted she felt reproach she looked backward with compunction and longing to the beginning of things there was now a tarnish on the day yet there was no going back clearly she was not of the hardy stuff of which sinners must be made if they are to be cheerful sinners she was qualmish and easily dismayed urquhart was away or she would have dared the worst that could befall her and dragged out of its coffer her poor tattered robe of romance between them they would have owned to the gaping seams and frayed edges then he might have kissed herand goodbye but he was not at hand and she could not write down what she could hardly contemplate saying never in fact was a more distressful lady on the eve of a party of pleasure lancelots serious enjoyment of the prospect evident in every line of his letters was her only relish but even that could not sting her answers to vivacity i hope the norwegians are very sensible they will need all their sense because we shall have none when the pirate is there there used to be vikings in norway they came to england and stole wives and animals now we bring them a man for wives that is what for with the chill of i must have a new reel to my fishingrod the old one has never been the same since i made a windlass of it for the battleship when it was a canalboat and it fell into the water when we made a landslide and accident which was buried for three days and had a worm in the works also a v sharp knife for reindeer etc they are tough i hear and my knife is sharpest at the back since opening sardines and other tins all rather small he drove a fevered pen but retained presence of mind enough to provide for his occasions the excitement of norway may lose me some marks in terms order not many i dare say again when you are excited reports go bad i have been shouting rather kicking up a shine once there was a small fight which was twigged norway is a serious matter there was an undercurrent of nervousness discernible only to her eyes she could not account for it till she had him home and they were on the edge of adventure it was lest he should be seasick and disgrace himself in the esteem of young nugent who as a naval officer was of course seaproof i expect nugent likes it very rough he saidand then i dont you know much not for weeks at a time rather a nuisance however it was solved in the event by nugent being prostrate from the time they left the tyne between his spasms he urged his mother to explain that lord nelson was always seasick but lancelot was very magnanimous about it there was diversion in much of this and she used it to lighten her letters to urquhart which without it had been as flat as yesterdays sodawater as the time came near when they should leave home she grew very heavy had forebodings wild desires to be done with it all then came a visitation from the cleareyed mabel and a cleansing of the conscience mabel said that she was sorry to miss norway it would have amused her enormously to see you in the saddle with two led horses she always talked as if she was an elder sister i almost threw laurence over but of course i couldnt do that hes so dependent and silent and patheticbut thank goodness he hasnt found out like james the real use of wives that is to have somebody to grumble to who really minds theres your james for you he doesnt want to go a bit hed much rather be at harrogate or somewhere of that sort perhaps hed like homburg but he wouldnt go for the world hes not pathetic at all though he wants to be but he wants to be sarcastic at the same time and is cross because the two things wont go together of course he stuck in francis lingen he would as if he cared about francis lingen a kind of poodle you oughtnt to abuse james to me lucy said not very stoutly i dont abuse laurence abuse him cried mabel good heavens child i only say out loud what you are saying to yourself all day we may as well know where we are then came a pause and then i suppose you and jimmy urquhart are in a mess lucy said nothing whereupon mabel showed her clear sight and i suppose you know now who turned the light off at that terrible surmise lucy got up and stood above her sister mabel i dont know what to do i am sure you dont said mabel on the other hand you know what you have to do yes lucy replied but it isnt so easy as you would think you see i have never spoken to him about it nor he to me and it seems almost impossible to beginnow mabel was out of her depth do you mean what do you really mean i mean exactly what i say i found out the truth by a kind of accidentone day it wasnt possible to doubt well thenit went on you know of course it did said mabel well and there was no disguise about it after there couldnt be why should there be if there couldnt be mabel was at her wits end there was no disguise about it while it was going on you know but in the daytimewell we seemed to be ordinary people and nothing was said now do you see mabel did it makes it very awkward for you but feeling as you do now you simply must have it out i cant lucy said with conviction i know i cant do that no it must stop another way i mustbe hateful do you mean to make him dislike you to put him off lucy nodded something like that try it said mabel you mean it wont answer i mean that you wont my dear you are not that sort much too kind now i could be perfectly beastly if i felt it the only thing lucy was in a hard stare i dont feel kind just now james has given me a horror of things of the sort i dont believe he meant it i think he felt snappish and thought he would relieve his feelings that way but there it is he has made it all rather disgusting its become like a kind of intrigue of vulgar people in a comedy these things do when you take them out and look at them mabel said like sham jewellery they are all right in their cases the velvet lining does so much but although you may be disgusted with jamess handling of your private affairs you are not disgusted withthe other no i suppose not i really dont know he is the most understanding man in the world and i would trust him through everything i dont think he could tell me an untruth not one that mattered anyhow i could see him go away from me for a year for two and not hear a word from him and yet be sure that he would come back and be the same and know me to be the same i feel so safe with him so proud of his liking me so settled in lifei never felt settled beforelike being in a nest he makes everything i love or like seem more beautiful and preciouslancelot oh i am much prouder of lancelot than i used to be he has shown me things in lancelot which i never saw he has made the being lancelots mother seem a more important a finer thing i dont know how to say it but he has simply enhanced everythingas you say like a velvet lining to a jewel all this is trueand something in me calls for him and urges me to go to him but nowbut yetall this hateful jealousythis playing off one man against anotherfrancis lingen as if i ever had a minutes thought of francis lingenoh its really disgusting i didnt think any one in our world could be like that it spots mei want to be clean id much rather be miserable than feel dirty here she stopped on the edge of tears which a sudden access of anger dried up she began again more querulously its his fault of course it was outrageous what he did im angry with him because i cant be angry with myselffor not being angry how could i be angry oh mabel if it had been james after all but of course it wasnt and couldnt be and i should be angry with him if i wasnt so awfully sorry for him mabel stared sorry for james yes naturally hes awfully simple you know and really rather proud of me in his way i see him looking at me sometimes wondering what hes done its pathetic but thats not the point the point is that i cant get out do you want to get out mabel asked yes i do in a way it has to beand the sooner the better and whether i do or not i dont like to feel that i cant nobody likes to be tied then nobody should be married said mabel who had listened to these outbursts of speech and pauses which had been really to find words rather than breath with staring and hardrimmed eyes she had a gift of logic and could be pitiless what it comes to you know she said is that you want to have your fun in private we all do i suppose but that cant come off in nine cases out of ten especially with a man like james who is as sharp as a razor and just as edgy the moment anybody peers at you you show a tarnish and get put off it doesnt look to me as if you thought so highly ofthe other as you think you do after all if you come to that the paraphernalia of a wedding is pretty horrid one feels awfully like a heifer at the cattle show at least i did the complacency of the bridegroom is pretty repulsive you feel like a really fine article but one lives it down if one means it lucy told her to go or as good as told her sisters may be plain with each other she wasnt able to answer her though she felt that an answer there was what she had said was partly true lucy was a romantic without knowing it so had psyche been and the fatal lamp should have told her so the god removed himself thus she felt it to be he seemed just outside the door and a word a look would recall him to his dark beauty of presence that he was beautiful so she knew too well that he was unbeautiful in the glare of day she felt rather than knew the fault she suspected lay in her who could not see him in the light without the blemish of circumstancenot his but circumstance in whose evil shade he must seem smirched what could she do with her faulty vision but send him away was that not less dishonourable than to bid him remain and dwindle as she looked at him what a kink in her affairs when she must be cruel to her love not because she loved him less but rather that she might love him more but the spirit of adventure grew upon her in spite of herself the sense of something in the wind of the morning bringing one nearer to a great day it pervaded the house crewdson got in the way of saying when we are abroad we shall find that useful maam or mr macartney will be asking for that in norway as for james it had changed his spots if not his nature james bought marvellous climbing boots binoculars compasses of dodgy contrivance sandwichcases drinkingflasks a knowing hat he read about norway studied a dictionary and ended by talking about it and all to do with it without any pragmatism lucy found out how he relied upon urquhart and sometimes forgot that he was jealous of him jealous he was but not without hope for one thing he liked a fight with a good man lingen caught the epidemic and ceased to think or talk about himself he had heard of carpets to be had of bold pattern and primary colouring he had heard of bridal crowns of silvergilt worthy of any collectors cabinet he also bought boots and tried his elegant leg in a flamecoloured sock and to crown the rocking edifice lancelot came home in a kind of still ecstasy which only uttered itself in convulsions of the limbs and sudden and earpiercing whistles through the fingers from him above all she gained assurance oh mr urquhart hell put all that straight i bet youin two ticks and once it was i say mamma i wonder where you and i would be without mr urquhart james heard him and saw lucy catch her breath not very pleasant chapter xvii the shivering fit they were to start on the th of august and it was now the th packing had begun and crewdson as usual was troublesome he had the habit of appearing before lucy and presenting some small deficiency as a final cause of ruin and defeat i cant find any of the brown polish maam i dont know what mr macartney will do without it this or something like it had become a classic in the family it had always been part of the fun of going away but this year lucy was fretted by it she supposed herself run down and whipped herself to work she found herself too lingering about the house with an affection for the familiar aspect of corners vistas tricks of light and shadow which she had never thought to possess she felt extremely unwilling to leave it all it was safety it was friendliness it asked no effort of her to turn away from its lustrous and ordered elegance and face the unknown gave her a pain in the heart it was odd to feel homesick before she had left home but that was the sum of it she was homesick urquhart was very much in her mind a letter of his was in her writingtable drawer under lock and key but urquhart seemed part of a vague menace now while james though he did his unconscious utmost to defeat himself got his share of the sunset glow upon the house fanciful nervous weary of it all as she was she devoted herself to her duties and then on this fifth of august in the afternoon she had a waking vision perfectly distinct and so vivid that disembodied and apart she could see herself enacting it it was followed by a shivering fit and depression but that must tell its own tale the vision occurred while she was on her knees busied beside a trunk turning over garments of lace and fine linen and pale blue ribbons which a maid in the same fair attitude was bestowing as she received them lancelot was out for the afternoon with crewdson and a friend they had gone to the zoological gardens and would not be back till late she had the house to herself it was cool and shadowed from the sun the square muffled in the heat gave no disturbing sounds looking up suddenly for no apparent reason she saw herself with jimmy urquhart in a great empty stony place and felt the dry wind which blew upon them both all but her own face was visible of that she saw nothing but the sharp outline of her cheek which was very white she saw herself holding her hat bending sideways to the gale she saw her skirt cling about her legs and flack to get free she wondered why she didnt hold it down the wind was a hot one she felt that it was so it made her head ache and burned her cheekbone urquhart was quite visible he looked into the teeth of the wind frowning and fretful why didnt she say something to him she had a conviction that it was useless theres nothing to say nothing to say that rang in her head like a church bell nothing to say nothing to say a sense of desolation and total loss oppressed her she had no hope the vacancy the silence the enormous dry emptiness about her seemed to shut out all her landmarks why didnt she think of lancelot she wondered why but realised that lancelot meant nothing out there she saw herself turn about she cried out james james started up with a sense of being caught and saw the maids face of scare she was awake in a moment what is it maam what is it lucy had recovered her faculties nothing emily its nothing i was giddy but she was shivering and couldnt go on i think ill lie down for a minute she said and asked for the aspirin she took two tabloids and a sip of water was covered up and left to herself emily tiptoed away full of interest in the affair the shivering fit lasted the better part of an hour lucy crouched and suffered openeyed but without any consciousness something had happened was happening still a storm was raging overhead she lay quaking and waited for it to pass she fell asleep slept profoundly and awoke slowly to a sense of things she had no doubt of what lay immediately before her disrelish of the norwegian expedition was now a reasonable thing either it must be given up or the disaster reckoned with advienne que pourra but in either case she must have it out with james what did that mean jimmy urquhart would be thrown over he would goand she would not she lay picturing rather than reasoning saw him superbly capable directing everything she felt a pride in him and in herself for discovering how fine he was his fineness indeed was a thing shared she felt a sinking of the heart to know that she could not be there but the mere thought of that sickened her out of the question she must have it out with james that might be rather dreadful it might take her where she must refuse to gobut on the whole she didnt think it need the certainty that she couldnt go to norway that james must be made to see it was a moral buttress timidity of james would not prevail against it besides that deeply within herself lay the conviction that james was kind if you took him the right way he was irritable and very annoying when he was sarcastic but he was good at heart and it was odd she thought that directly she got into an awkward place with a flirtation her first impulse was to go to james to get her out in her dream she had called to him though urquhart had been there why was that she was thinking now like a child which indeed she was where such matters were concerned she was not really contrite for what she had done neither regretted that she had done it nor that it was done with she wanted to discharge her bosom of perilous stuff james would forgive her he must not know of course what he was forgiving butyes he would forgive her at six or thereabouts listening for it she heard the motor bring james home she heard his latchkey and the shutting of the door behind him her heart beat high but she did not falter he was reading a letter in the hall when she came downstairs he was very much aware of her but pretended not to be she stood on the bottom stair looking at him with wide and fixed eyes but he would not look up he was not just then in a mood either to make advances or to receive them his grievance was heavy upon him james said lucy ive been listening for you too good said he and went on with his letter i wanted to tell you that i dont thinkthat i dont much want to go to norway then he did look up keenly with a drawn appearance about his mouth showing his teeth eh he said oh absurd he occupied himself with his letter folding it for its envelope while she watched him with a pale intensity which ought to have told him and perhaps did tell him what she was suffering i dont think you should call me absurd she said i was never very certain of it but my dearest child you made me certain at any rate he told her you made everybody certain so much so that i have the tickets in my pocket at this moment im very sorry i could pay for mine of courseand im sure vera would look after lancelot i wouldnt disappoint him for the world what are you going to tell urquhart said james her eyes paled i believe that he would take it very simply she said james plunged his hands into his pockets he thought that they were on the edge of the gulf look here lucy he said hadnt you better tell me something more about this perhaps you will come into the library for a few minutes he led the way without waiting for her and she stood quaking where she was she was making matters worse she saw that now naturally she couldnt tell james the real state of the case because that would involve her in history james would have to understand that he had been believed to have wooed her when he had done nothing of the kind that was a thing which nothing in the world would bring her to reveal to him and if she left that out and confined herself to her own feelings for urquharthow was all that to be explained was it fair to herself or to urquhart to isolate the flowering of an affair unless you could show the germinating of it certainly it wasnt fair to herselfas for urquhart it may be that he didnt deserve any generous treatment she knew that there was no defence for him though plenty of excusepossibly noshe must go through with the norway business meantime james was waiting for her she stood by the library table while james back to the fireplace lifted his head and watched her through cigarsmoke he had no mercy for her at this moment suspicions thronged his darkened mind but nothing of her rueful beauty escaped him the flush of sleep was upon her and her eyes were full of trouble it isnt that i have any reason which would appeal to you she told him she faltered her tale i think i have been foolishi know that im very tired and worried buti have had presentiments james clicked his tongue which he need not have doneas he knew very well but he had not often been arbiter of late my child he said really and annoyed her of course you are impatient i cant help it all the same i am telling you the truth i dont know what is going to happen i feel afraid of somethingi dont know what run down said james looking keenly at her but kindly end of the season two days at sea will do the job for you anyhow my dear we go he threw himself in his deep chair stretched his legs out and looked at lucy she was deeply disappointed she had pictured it so differently he would have understood her she had thought but he seemed to be in his worst mood she stood the picture of distressful uncertainty hot and wavering her head hung her hand moving a book about on the table to his surprise and great discomfort he now discerned that she was silently crying tears were falling she made no effort to stop them nor to conceal them her weakness and dismay were too much for her she accepted the relief and neither knew nor cared whether he saw it james was not hardhearted unless his vanity was hurt this was the way to touch him as he was prepared to be touched my child he said why whats the matter with you she shook her head tried to speak failed and went on crying lucy said james come here to me she obeyed him at once something about her attitude moved him to something more than pity her pretty frock and her refusal to be comforted by it her youthful actfor lucy had never yet cried before him her flushed cheeks her tremulous lipswhat if i could answer the question i should resolve the problem of the flight of souls he looked at her and knew that he desired her above all things a lucy in tears was a new lucy a james who could afford to let his want be seen was a new james that which stirred himpity need desire kindnessvibrated in his tones to hear was to obey he took her two hands and drew her down to his knee he made her sit there embraced her with his arm there my girl there he said now let me know all about it upon my soul you are a baffling young woman you will and you wont and then you cry and i become sentimental i shall end by falling in love with you at these strange words she broke down altogether and sobbed her soul out upon his shoulder again he assured himself that he had never seen her cry before he was immensely touched by it and immensely at his ease too his moral status was restored to him he knew now what he wanted you poor little darling i cant bear to see you cry so there thencry away if it does you good what does me good is to have you here now what made you so meek as to come when i called you and why werent you afraid that i should eat you up so i might lucy you know for youve made me madly in love with you it seemed to her beating heart that indeed he was he held her very close kissed her wet cheeks her wet eyes and her lips she struggled in his embrace but not for long she yielded and returned his kisses so they clung together and in the silence while time seemed to stand still it really did nothing of the kind for if he gained experience she lost it he must have grown more experienced for he was able to return without embarrassment to the affairs so strangely interrupted she must have grown less so because she answered him simply like a child he asked her what had upset her and she told him a dream a dream had she been asleep no it was a waking dream she told him exactly what it was she was with mr urquhart in a horrible placea dry sandy place with great rocks in it and where did i come in you didnt come in that was why i called you you called for me did you but urquhart was there yes i suppose he was still there i didnt look why did you call for me lucy because i was frightened im grateful to you for that thats good news to me he said and then when he kissed her again she opened her eyes very wide and said oh james i thought you didnt care for me any more james master of himself smiled grimly i thought as much he said and so you became interested in somebody else lucy sat up no she said i became interested in you first that beat him you became interested in me why because i didnt care for you no she said sharply no because i thought that you did james felt rather faint i cant follow you you thought that i didnt you said lucy was now excited and full of her wrongs how extraordinary surely you see i had reason to think that you cared for me very muchoh very much indeed and then i found out that you didnt care a bit more than usual and thenwell then james who was too apt to undervalue people did not attempt to pursue the embroilment but he valued her in this melting mood he held her very close well he said and now you find that i do careand what then she looked at him divinely shy oh if you really care this would have made any man care well if i really do ah she hid her face on his shoulder i shall love to be in norway james felt very triumphant but true to type he sent her upstairs to dress with the needless injunction to make herself look pretty presently however he stood up and stared hard at the ground good lord he said i wonder what the devil then he raised his eyebrows to their height this is rather interesting the instinct was strong in him to make her confessfor clearly there was something to be known but against that several things worked one was his scorn of the world at large he felt that it was beneath him to enquire what that might be endeavouring against his honour or peace anotherand a very new feeling to himwas one of compassion the poor girl had cried before himhidden her face on his shoulder and cried to use strength male strength upon that helplessness to break a butterfly on a wheelupon his soul he thought he couldnt do it and after allwhether it was lingen or urquharthe was safe he knew he was safe because he wanted her he knew that he could not want what was not for him that was against nature true to type again he laughed at himself but owned it she had been gone but five or ten minutes but he wanted to see her againnow he craved the sight of that charming diffidence of the woman who knows herself desired he became embarrassed as he thought of it but did not cease to desire should he yield to the whimor hold himself at that moment lancelot was admitted he heard him race upstairs calling mamma mamma frightfully important that decided the thing he opened his door listening to what followed he heard lucys voice im here you can come in and was amazed was that lucys voice she was happy then he knew that by her tone there was a lift in it a timbre was it just possible by some chance that he had been a damned fool he walked the room in some agitation then went hastily upstairs to dress whether to a new james or not dinner had a new lucy to reveal a lucy full of what he called feminine charm a lucy who appealed to him across the table for support against a positive lancelot who brought him in at all points who was concerned for his opinion who gave him shy glances who could even afford to be pert he being essentially a fairweather man was able to meet her halfwayno more than that because he was what he was always his own detective the discipline which he had taught himself to preserve was for himself first of all lancelot noticed his father i say he said when he and lucy were in the drawingroom fathers awfully on the spot isnt he its norway i expect bucks him up norway is enough to excite anybody lucy saideven me oh you lancelot was scornful anything would excite you look at mr urquhart lucy flickered how do you mean lancelot was warm for his absent friend why you used to take a great interest in all his adventuresyou know you did this must be faced of course i did well well said lancelot very acutely now they seem rather ordinaryrather chronic chronic was a word of crewdsons used as an augmentive lucy laughed but faintly yes i expect they are chronic but i think mr urquhart is very nice hes ripping said lancelot in a stare james in the drawingroom that evening was studiously himself and lucy fought with her restlessness and prevailed against it he was shy and spun webs of talk to conceal his preoccupations lucy watched him guardedly but with intense interest it was when she went upstairs that the amazing thing happened she stood by him her hand once more upon his shoulder he had his book in his hand im going she said you have been very sweet to me i dont deserve it you know he looked up at her quizzing her through the detested glass you darling he said calmly and she thrilled where had she heard that phrase at the walkuere you darling he said who could help it oh but she pouted now oh but you can help it oftenif you like but you see i dont like i should hate myself if i thought that i could do let me take your glass away for one minute you may do what you please with it or me the glass in eclipse she looked down at him considering hesitating choosing poised oh i was right you look much nicer without it some day ill tell you he took her hand and kept it some day you shall tell me a number of things she did not cease to look at him but he saw fear in her eyes some day perhaps but not yet no said he not yetperhaps will you trust me i always have she sighed oh you are good i didnt know how good then she turned to go i told you i was goingand i am good night he put his book down she let his eyeglass fall he drew her to his knee and looked at her its not good night he said thats to come she gave him a startled wide look and then her lips before she fled chapter xviii the hardanger that enchanted land of sea and rock of mountains rooted in the water and water which pierces the secret valleys of the mountains worked its spell upon our travellers and freed them from themselves for a while for awhile they were as singleminded as the boys content to live and breathe that winetinctured air and watch out those flawless days and serene grey nights london had sophisticated some of them almost beyond redemption francis lingen was less man than sensitive gelatine james was the offspring of a tradition and a lookingglass but the zest and high spirits of urquhart were catching and after a week francis lingen ceased to murmur to ladies in remote corners and james to care whether his clothes were pressed everybody behaved well urquhart who believed that he possessed lucys heart james who knew now what he possessed vera nugent who was content to sit and look on and lucy herself who simply and honestly forgot everything except the beauty of the world and the joy of physical exertion she had been wofully ill on the passage from newcastle and had been invisible from beginning to end but from the moment of landing at bergen she had been transformed she was now the sister of her son a wild wilful impetuous creature a nymph of the heath irresponsible and selfindulgent taking what she could get of comfort and cherishing and finding a boundless appetite for it it was something perhaps to know in her heart that every man in the party was in love with her it was much morefor the moment at leastto be without conscience in the matter she had put her conscience to sleep for once drugged it with poppy and drowsy syrups and led the life of a healthy and vigorous animal urquhart enjoyed that he was content to wait and watch for the time james did not perceive it the beauty and freshness of this new world was upon him francis lingen born to cling threw out tentative tendrils to margery dacre margery dacre was a very pretty girl she had strawcoloured hair and a bright complexion she wore green especially in the water urquhart called her undine and she was mostly known as the mermaid she had very little mind but excellent manners and was expensive without seeming to spend anything for instance she brought no maid because she thought that it might have looked ostentatious and always made use of lucys who didnt really want one that was how margery dacre contrived to seem very simple for the moment urquhart took natural command he knew the country he owned the motorboat he believed that he owned lucy and he believed that james was rather a fool he thought that he had got the better of james but this could not last because james was no more of a fool than he was himself though his intelligence worked in a different way things flashed upon urquhart who then studied them intensely and missed nothing they dawned on james who leisurely absorbed them and allowed them to work out their own development it was very gradually now dawning upon james that urquhart had assumed habits of guidance over lucy and was not aware of any reason why he should relinquish them he believed that he understood her thoroughly he read her as a pliant gentle nature easily imposed upon and really at the mercy of any unscrupulous man who was clever enough to see how she should be treated he had never thought that before it was the result of his cogitations over recent events so while he kept his temper and native jealousy under easy control he watched comfortablyas well he mightand gained amusement as he could well afford to do from urquharts marital assumptions when he was tempted to interfere or to try a fall with urquhart he studiously refrained if urquhart said as he did sometimes i advise you to rest for a bit james calmly embraced the idea if urquhart brought out a cloak or a wrap and without word handed it to her james watching did not determine to forestall him on the next occasion and lucy as he admitted behaved beautifully behaved perfectly there were no grateful looks from her such as he would expect to see pass between lovers keenly as he watched her he saw no secret exchange on the other hand her eyes frequently sought his own as if she wanted him to understand that she was happy as if indeed she wanted him to be happy by such an understanding this gave him great pleasure and touched him too if he had been capable of it he would have told her but he was not it was part of his nature to treat those whom he loved de haut en bas he found that it was so and hated himself for it the one thing he really grudged urquhart was his simplicity and freedom from ulterior motive urquhart was certainly able to enjoy the moment for the moments worth but james must always be calculating exactly what it was worth and whether to be enhanced by what might follow it he was kinder to her than he had ever been before in fact he was remarkably interesting she told him of it in their solitary moments of greatest intimacy this is my honeymoon she said and i never had one before goose said he dont attempt to deceive me but she reasserted it its true james you may have loved me in your extraordinary way but im sure i didnt love you i was much too frightened of you well he laughed i dont discover any terrors now she wouldnt say that there were none so far as she dared she was honest we arent on an exact equality we never shall be but we are much nearer own it he held her closely and kissed her you are a little darling if thats what you mean oh but it isnt it isnt at all what i mean why you wouldnt call me little if you didnt know you were superior because im rather tall for a woman he knew that she was right and respected her for the discernment my love he said im a selfcentred arrogant beast and i dont like to think about it but youll make something of me if you think it worth while but listen to me lucy im going to talk to you seriously then he whispered in her ear some day you must talk to me he could feel her heart beat he could feel her shiver as she clung yes she said very low yes i promisebut not now no he said not now i want to be happy as long as i can she started away and he felt her look at him in the dark youll be happier when ive told you she said why do you say that because i shall be happier myself then she said and james hoped that she was right about him one thing amazed him to discoverhow women imputed their own virtues to the men they loved it struck him a mortal blow to realise that his evident happiness would give lucy joy whereas hers would by no means necessarily add to his what does give me happiness then he asked himself what could conceivably increase my zest for life evidence of power exercise of faculty so far as i know nothing else whatever a parlous state of affairs but it is the difference i presume between a giving creature and a getting one which explains all is a man then never to give and be happy has he ever tried is a woman not to get has she ever had a chance of it he puzzled over these things in his prosaic methodical way one thing was clear to everybody there but urquhart in his present fatuity lucy was thriving she had colour light in her eyes a bloom upon her a dewiness an auroral air she sunned herself like a bird in the dust she bathed her body and tired herself with long mountain and woodland walks when she was alone with her husband she grew as sentimental as a housemaid and as little heedful of the absurd she grew young and amazingly pretty the sister of her son it would be untrue to say that being in clover she was unaware of it for a woman of oneandthirty to have her husband for a lover and her lover for a foil is a gift of the gods so she took itwith the sun and green water and winebright air let the moralists battle it out with the sophists it did her a world of good chapter xix the moonspell macartney fell easily into habits and was slow to renounce them having got into the way of making love to his wife he by no means abandoned it at the same time and in as easy a fashion it came to be a matter of routine with him to play piquet with vera nugent after dinner it was she who had proposed it despairing of a quartette or even of a trio for the bridge which was a dram to her here also james would have been only too happy but nobody else would touch it lucy never played cards urquhart having better things to do said that he never did margery dacre and lingen preferred retirement and their own company lingen indeed was exhibiting his heart to the palehaired girl as if it was a specimenpiece i am really a very simple person he told her one of those who trusting once trust for ever i dont expect to be understood i have no right to ask for sympathy that would be too much to look for in a jostling marketday world like ours but i cherish one or two very fragrant memories of kindnesses done i open at need a drawer and like the scent of dry roseleaves or lavender a sweet hint steals out that there are good women in the world that life is not made up of receipted bills dont you understand the value of such treasures i am sure that you do you always seem to me so comprehending in your outlook margery said that she hoped she was it was lucys business immediately after dinner to see that lancelot was decently abed the lad took the last ounce out of himself before that time came and was to be brought by main force to the bath crimson to the roots of his hair and dripping with sweat protesting to the uttermost still panting with his final burst in the open she saw to it that he was quiet before she could be so herself then she was free and urquhart foundor looked forhis chance the woods called her the wondrous silvercalm of the northern night she longed to go but now she dreaded urquhart and dared not trust herself it had come to this that possessed as she was and happy in possession he and all that he stood for could blot the whole fair scene up in cold fog that was how she looked at it in the first blush of her new life he didnt understand that but he saw that she was nervous and set himself to reassure her he assumed his dryest tone his most negligent manner when she came downstairs from lancelot and after watching the cardplayers fingering a book or magazine drifted to the open window and stood or leaned there absorbing the glory of the nighturquhart left her and pulled at his pipe when she spoke to the room at largeoh you stuffy people will you never understand that all the world is just out here he was the first to laugh at her though he would have walked her off into that world of magic and dream straight from the window where she stood he was a wild idealist himself and was sure of her but he must wait her good time often therefore she drifted out by herself and he suffered damnably but she never went farhe comforted himself with that assurance she has the homing instinct she wont go without me and she knows that i cant comebut oh to be kissing her under those birches by the waters edge he was not the only one who was aware that she had flitted macartney was always intensely aware of it and being by this time exceedingly fond it tended to spoil his play so long as urquhart left her alone he was able to endure it then came an evening when tending to the open door she found urquhart there before her he had behaved so admirably that her fears were asleep he acted with the utmost caution saying just enough with just enough carelessness of tone to keep her unsuspicious the boreal lights were flashing and quivering in the sky very soon he saw her absorbed in the wonder and beauty of them a night she said when anything might happen yes it looks like that he agreed but that is not what enraptures you what do you think enraptures me she wished to know the certainty he replied that nothing will she waited a while then said yes you are right i dont want anything else to happen you have everything you want here in the house safe to hand your lancelot in bed your james at cards and myself at the window wonderful and you are contented yes yes i ask so little you see but you despise me for it god forbid i promised you that you shouldnt repent this trip and you dont i hope her eyes were wide open and serious no indeed i never expected to be so happy as this it never happened to me before she had no compunctions at allbut he was in the fatuous stage drugged by his own imaginings thats good shall we go down to the water i think we might she said not daring to look back into the room lest he should think that she feared him they strolled leisurely through the wood she in a soft rapture of delight at the still grey beauty of the night urquhart in a state of mind bordering upon frenzy he gripped himself by both hands to make sure of the mastery what gave him conviction was his constant sense of lucys innocency this beautiful woman had the heart of a child and the patience of the mother of a god to shock the one or gibe at the other were a blasphemy he simply couldnt contemplate what then was to be the end of it he didnt know he didnt care she loved him he believed she had kissed him therefore she must love him such women dont give their lips without their hearts but then she had been scared and had cried off well that too he seemed to understand that was where her sense of law came in he could not but remember that it would have come in before had she known who her lover was as things fell out she slipped into love without knowing it the moment she had known it she withdrew to the shadow of her hearth that was his lucy all over his lucy yes for that wasnt the solicitors lucyif indeed the solicitor had a lucy but had he a little weakness of urquharts was to pride himself on being a man of whims and to suppose such twists of the mind his unique possession all indeed that he had of unique was this that he invariably yielded to his whims whereas other people did not however he set a watch upon himself on this night of witchery and succeeded perfectly they talked leisurely and quietlyof anything or nothing the desultory fragmentary interjections of comment which pass easily between intimates lucys share was replete with soft wonderings at the beauty of the world neither of them answered the other under the birchtrees it was light but very damp he wouldnt allow her to stop there but bade her higher up the hillside there were pines there which were always dry wait you there he said im going back to get you a wrap she would have stopped him but he had gone urquhart walking up sharply to the house was not at all prepared for macartney walking as sharply down from it in fact he was very much put out and the more so because from the first james took the upper hand hulloa said the lord of the eyeglass hulloa yourself said urquhart and stopped which he need not have done seeing that macartney with complete nonchalance continued his walk seen my wife anywhere came from over his shoulder urquhart turned on his heels yes he said and walked on there was an end of one two and threeas the rhyme goes urquhart was hot with rage that bland blundering fool that glasshouse that damned supercilious ass all this and more he cried upon james he scorned him for his jealousy he cursed him for it he vowed that he would carry her off before his very eyes let her give the word lift an eyebrow and i take her across the world and the lad too bless him what did the quilldriver want of them but credit damn him he hung them up in his house as tradesmen use the royal arms he baited for his deans and chapters with them he walked far into the night in a passion of anger it never once occurred to him that james was a rival and there he was right he thought that urquhart had certainly been with lucy he knew that he was in love with her but oddly enough that stimulated instead of quelled him it enhanced her it made her love worth keeping he had a great respect in his heart of hearts for urquharts validity in a world of action which certainly comprehended the taking and keeping of hearts now he came to think of it he must confess that he had never loved lucy as he did now until he had observed that so redoubtable a champion was in the lists against him odd thing he had been jealous of francis lingen as he now was of urquhart but it was the latter jealousy which had made him desire lucy the former had simply disgusted him the latter had spurred him to rivalryand now to main desire james was no philosopher he had an idle mind except in the conduct of his business he could not attempt then to explain his state of mindbut he was very much interested soon he saw her in the dusk under the pines a slim white shape standing with one hand upon the trunk of a tree her back was towards him she did not turn she supposed that it was urquhart come back and was careful not to seem waiting for him how quick you have been she said lightly and stood where she was no answer was returned then came a shock indeed and her head seemed to flood with fear two hands from behind her covered her eyes her head was drawn gently back and she was kissed ardently on the lips she struggled wildly she broke away oh she said half sobbing oh how cruel you arehow cruel how could you dare to do it and then free of the hands she turned upon urquhartand saw james oh my love she said and ran to him and broke into tears james had secured his eyeglass but now let it drop he allowed her to cry her fill and then made the best of a rather bad business if every man who kissed his wife said he was answered like that lips would go dry she said through her tears you see i thought you were mr urquhart with my wrap oh the dickens you did said james and is that how mr urquhart usually brings you a wrap she clung to him well no if he did i suppose i shouldnt have been so angryby this time thats a very good answer james allowed ill only make one comment upon it you cried out upon the cruelty of the attack now if it had beenassume it for the momentourwell friend let us say why would it have been cruel of him shameful flagrant audacious impudent insolent all that i can understand but cruel lucy lucys cheek was upon his shoulder and she let it stay there even while she answered the moment was serious she must tell him as much as she dared certain things seemed out of the question but something she must tell him you see james she said i think mr urquhart is fond of mein fact im sure of it has he told you so not in so many wordsbut but in so many other words eh well pursue and i told him that i couldnt possibly join the partyon that account did you tell him it was on that account no said lucy i didnt but he understood that i know he understood it because he immediately said that if i would come i shouldnt repent it and i havent he has never made me feel uncomfortable but just nowwhen i was expecting himoh it seemed to me quite horribleand i was furious with him you were indeed it didnt occur to you that it might have beenwell somebody with more right her arm tightened but she said nothing the unconscious james went on i was wrong a man has no right to kiss a woman unawaresin the dark even if its his wife shell always want to know who it was and shes bound to find out and hell get no thanks for it either then it became necessary for lucy to thank him mind you my dear he told her i have no quarrel with jimmy urquhart up to now you say hes in love with you and i think that he is ive thought so for some time and i confess that i didnt relish the idea that he should be out here with us but since we are in for confessions ill make one more if he hadnt been in love with you i dont believe that i should beas i am now lucy laughedthe laugh of a woman rich then im very much obliged to him she said but urquhart was harder to convince than james chapter xx fair warning vera nugent a brisk woman of the world with a fondness for vivid clothing and a spanish air which went oddly with it took the trouble one fine day to tackle her brother look here jimmy she said as they breasted a mountain pass are you quite sure what you are up to with these people urquharts eyes took a chill tingea hard and pebbly stare i dont know what you mean he said men always say that especially when they know very well of course i mean the macartneys you didnt suppose i was thinking of the poplolly the poplolly i regret to say was francis lingen whom vera abhorred the term was opprobrious and inexact but urquhart shrouded himself in ice perhaps you might explain yourself he said vera was not at all sure that she would you make it almost impossible you know they were all out in a party and were to meet the luncheon and the boys who had gone round in the boat as parties will have it they had soon scattered lingen had taken margery dacre to himself lucy was with her husband urquhart now he came to think of it began to understand that the sceptre was out of his hands the pass worn out of the shelving rock by centuries of footwork wound itself about the breasting cliffs like a scarf below them lay the silver fiord and upon that a mere speck they could see the motorboat with a wake widening out behind her like parallel lines of railway urquhart saw in his mind that he would be a fool to quarrel with vera she was not on his side he could feel but he didnt despair of her one way of putting her off him forever was to allow her to think him a fool that he could not afford dont turn against me for a mannerism my dear he said i turn against you if at all for a lack of mannerism said vera briskly its too bad of you here i am as so much ballast for your party and when i begin to make myself useful you pretend im not there but i am there you know i was cross he said because im rather worried and i thought you were going to worry me more well maybe that i amshe admitted that but i dont like to see a sharpfaced man make a donkey of himself the credit of the family is at stake he laughed i wouldnt be the first of usand this wouldnt be the first time theres whimsy in the blood wellout with it let me know the worst vera stopped i intend to do it sitting weve heaps of time none of the others want us urquhart hit the rock with his staff thats the point my child do theyor dont they you believe vera said that lucy is in love with you urquhart replied i know that she was there you have the pull over me she answered i havent either your confidence or hers all i can tell you is that now she isnt urquhart was all attention do you mean she has told you anything good heavens vera scoffed what do you take me for do you think i dont know by the looks of her if you werent infatuated youd know better than i do my dear girl urquhart said with a straight look at her the fact is i am infatuated im sorry for you youve made a mess of it but i must say that im not at all sorry for her dont you suppose that she is the sort to find the world well lost for your beaux yeux far from that shed wilt like a rose in a windowbox id take her into fairyland said urquhart she should walk in the dawn she wouldnt feel her feet she would if they were damp said vera who could be as direct as you please if you think shes a wood nymph in a cage youre very much mistaken shes very domestic i know said the infatuate that i touched her vera tossed her head ill be bound you did you arent the first man to light a fire thats what you did you lit a fire for macartney to warm his hand at shes awfully in love with him urquhart grew red thats not probable he said vera said its certain perhaps youll take the trouble to satisfy yourself before you take tickets for fairyland its an expensive journey i believe had you thought what you would be doing about lancelota very nice boy no details had been arranged said urquhart in his very annoying way not even that of the ladys inclinations it appears well ive warned you ive done it with the best intentions i suppose even you wont deny that im singleminded im not on the side of your solicitor that made urquhart very angry im much obliged to you my dear well leave my solicitor out of account for the moment but that nettled vera who flamed upon my word jimmy you are too sublime you cant dispose of people quite like that how are you to leave him out of account when you brought his wife into it if you ever supposed that macartney was nothing but a solicitor you were never more mistaken in your lifeexcept when you thought that lucy was a possible lawbreaker at the moment and from where they stood the seascape and the coastroad stood revealed before and behind them for many a league in front it descended by sharp spirals to a riverbed vera nugent standing there her chin upon her hands her hands upon her staff could see straight below her feet two absorbed couples as it were on different grades of the scene in the first the fair margery dacre leaned against a rock while lingen on his knees tied her shoestring at a lower level yet macartney having handed his lucy over a torrent stooped his head to receive his tribute vera who had a grain of pity in her hoped that urquhart had been spared but whether he was or not she never knew no signs of disturbance were upon him at the ensuing picnic unless his treatment of macartneywith a kind of humorous savagerybetrayed him they talked of the folgefond that mighty snowfield beyond the fiord which the three men intended to traverse in a day or twos time brace yourself my friend urquhart said hearts have been broken on that ground before now james said that he had made his peace with godbut lucy looked fulleyed and serious i never know when you are laughing at us she said to urquhart be sure that i have never laughed at you in my life he said across the tablecloth he laughs at me said james behind his eyeglass but i defy him the man who can laugh at himself is the man i envy now i never could do that youve hit me in a vital spot urquhart said thats my little weakness and thats why ive never succeeded in anythingeven in breaking my neck lancelot nudged his friend patrick do you twig that patrick blinked having his mouth too full to nod conveniently cant drive a motor i suppose cant flyi dont think as to breaking your neck said james theres still a chance for you i shall make a mess of it urquhart retorted is this going to be a neckbreaking expedition that was from lingen who now had an object in life i never said so urquhart told him i said heartbreakinga far simpler affair what is going to break your heart in it please lucy asked him she saw that there lay something behind his rattle well said urquhart brazening it out it would break mine to get over the snowfieldsome eight miles of it there areand to find that i couldnt get down that might easily happen and what would you do james fixed her with his eyeglass thats where the neckbreaking might intervene he said jimmy would rather risk his neck any day than his heart heart said vera no such thing quite another organ its a case of dinner hed risk his neck for a dinner and so would any man i believe you are right said james lucy with very bright eyes looked from one to the other of her lovers each wore a mask she determined to ask james to give up the folgefond discerning trouble in the air they went home by water and lancelot added his unconscious testimony he was between urquharts knees his hand upon the tiller his mood confidential i say he began and urquhart encouraged him to say on its slightly important but i suppose i couldnt do the folgefond by any chance you are saying a good deal said urquhart ill put it like this that by some chance you might but by no chance in the world could patrick hoo said lancelot and why not pray his mother would put her foot on it splosh it would go like a cockroach i know said dreamy lancelot thats what would happen to me i expect then he added thats what will happen to my father good cockroach said urquhart looking ahead of him you think she wont want him to go lancelot snorted wont want him why she doesnt already and hell do what she wants ill bet you does he always he always does now its the air i fancy chapter xxi the departure but pout as she might she could not prevail with james whose vanity had been scratched my dear girl id sooner perish he said give up a jolly walk because jimmy urquhart talks about my heart and his own neckpreposterous besides theres nothing in it but james she said if i ask you he kissed the back of her neck she was before the glass busy with her hair you dont ask me you wouldnt ask me no woman wants to make a fool of a man if she does shes a vampire mr urquhart is very impulsive she dared to say ive known that for a long time said james longer than you have i fancy but it takes more than impulse to break another mans neck besides i really have no reason to suppose that he wants to break my neck why should he here they were up against the wall again if there were reasons he could not know them there was no getting over it yet they were to start betimes in the morning and sleep that night at brattebo which is the hithermost spur of the chain dinner and beds had been ordered at odde beyond the snowfield dinner was a gay affair they toasted the now declared lovers true to his cornering instincts lingen had told lucy all about it in the afternoon your sympathy means so much to meand margery whose mind is exquisitely sensitive is only waiting your nod to be at your feet with me i should be very sorry to see either of you there lucy said im very fond of her and i shouldnt take it at all kindly if she demeaned herself when do you think of marrying he looked at her appealingly i must have time he said time to build the nest a flat i suppose she said declining such poetical flights a flat said francis lingen really it hadnt occurred to me from lucy the news went abroad and so the dinner was gay urquhart confined himself to the two boys and told them about the folgefondof its unknown depth of the crevasses of the glacier on its western edge of certain white snakes bred by the snow which might be found there their bite was death he said frostbite said patrick nugent who knew his uncles way but lancelot favoured his mother hoo he said i expect that youd give him what for one blow of your sword and his head would lie at your feet thats nasty too said urquhart they have white blood i believe lancelot blinked beastly he said did mamma hear you youd better not tell her she hates whiteness secretlyso do i rather it was afterwards when the boys had gone to bed that a seriousness fell upon those of them who were given to seriousness james and vera nugent settled down squarely to piquet francis lingen murmured to his affianced bride i dont disguise from myselfand from you i can have no secretsthat there is danger in the walk the snow is very treacherous at this season we take ropes of course urquhart is said to know the place but urquhart is hes very fascinating said margery dacre and francis lifted his eyebrows you find that then i am distressed i would share everything with you if i could to me i dont know why there is something crudesome harsh notea clangour of metal i find him brazenat times but to you my love who could be strident you are the very home of peace when i think of you i think of doves in a nest you must think of me tomorrow then said margery he rewarded her with a look lucy for her part had another sort of danger in her mind it seemed absolutely necessary to her now to speak to urquhart because she had a conviction that he and james had very nearly come to grips women are very sharp at these things she was certain that urquhart knew the state of her heart just as certain as if she had told him of it that being so she dreaded his impulse she suspected him of savagery and as she had no pride where love was concerned she intended to appeal to him modesty she had but no pride she must leave great blanks in her discourse but she trusted him to fill them up then there was another difficulty she had no remains of tenderness left for him not a filament unless she went warily he might find that out and be mortally offended all this she battled with while the goodnights to lancelot were saying upstairs she kissed his forehead and stood over him for a moment while he snuggled into his blankets oh my lamb you are worth fighting for was her last thought as she went downstairs full of her purpose the cardplayers sat in the recess the lovers were outside urquhart was by himself on a divan she thought that he was waiting for her with a book for shield against the lamp she took the chair he offered her arent they extraordinary she said he questioned who is extraordinary do you mean the cardsharpers not at all its meat and drink to them its we who are out of the common daintier feeders no she said its not quite that jamess strong point is that he can keep his feelings in separate pigeonholes im simply quaking with fear because my imagination has flooded me but he wont think about the risks hes runninguntil he is running them urquhart had been looking at her until he discovered that james had his eye upon her too he crossed his leg and clasped the knee of it he looked fixedly at the ceiling as he spoke i should like to know what it is youre afraid of he said in a carefully literal but carefully inaudible tone he did that sort of thing very well lucy was pinching her lip all sorts of things she said i suffer from presentiments i think that you or james may be hurt for instance do you mean said urquhartas if he had been saying where did you get this tobaccodo you mean that youre afraid we may hurt each other she hung her head deeply you neednt be if you can fear that you must forget my promise he saw her eyes clear then cloud again before her difficulties james at least she said has never done you any harm it was awfully true but it annoyed him damn james none whatever he answered sharply i wonder if i havent done him any good looking at her guardedly through halfclosed eyes he saw that she was strongly moved her bosom rose and fell hastily like short waves lipping a wharf her hands were shut tight you have been the best friend i ever had she said dont think im not grateful that came better he tapped his pipe on the ashtray at hand my dear he said i intend to live on your gratitude dont be afraid of anything lascia fare a me she rewarded him with a shy look a rueful look it cut him like a knife but he could have screwed it round in the wound to get more of such pain theres no more bittersweet torment to a man than the thanks of the beloved woman for her freedom given back to her he felt very sick indeedbut almost entirely with himself for her he chose to have pity of macartney he would not allow himself to think at all danger lay that way and he did not intend to be dangerous he would not even remember that he was subject to whims the thought flitted over his mind like an angel of death but he dismissed it with an effort after all what good could come of freebooting the game was up like all men of his stamp he cast about him far and wide for a line of action for directly the folgefond walk was over he would be off to stay here was intolerablejust as to back out of the walk would be ignominious no he would go through with that somehow but from odde he thought he might send for his things and clear out it did not occur to him that he might have to deal with macartney what should macartney want that he had not he had vindicated the law but the hour was come when macartney was to know everything lucy was adorable and he simply adored her then in the melting mood which follows she sobbed and whispered her broken confession he had the whole story from the beginning he listened and learned he was confounded he was deeply touched he might have been humiliated and so frozen he might have been offended and so bitter but he was neither her tears her sobs her clinging her burning cheeks the flood of her words or the sudden ebb which left her speechlessall this taught him what he might be to a woman who dared give him so much he said very little himself and exacted the last dregs from her cup he drank it down like a thirsty horse probably it was as sweet for him to drink as for her to pour for love is a strange affair and can be its own poison and antidote at the end he forgot his magnanimity so great was his need of hers you have opened my eyes to my own fatuity you have made me what i never thought i could be i am your loverdo you know that and i have been your husband for how long your husband lucy and now your lover never let these things trouble you any more she clung to him with passion i love you she said i adore you if ive been wicked it was to prove you good to me and to crush me to the earth love me againi am yours forever later she was able to talk freely to him as of a thing past and done its very odd i cant understand it you didnt begin to love me until he did and then you loved me for what he saw in me isnt that true i couldnt tell you he said because i dont know what he did see he thought i was pretty so you are he thought that i liked to be noticed well and you do of course but it never struck you nofool that i was i love you for your foolishness yes but you didnt no she said quickly no because you wouldnt allow it you must let women love before you can expect them to be meek he laughed do you intend to be meek then it was her turn to laugh i should think i did thats my pride and joy you may do what you like now he found that a hard saying but it is a very true one the departure was made early lucy came down to breakfast and the boys but margery dacre did not appear vera of course did not noon was her time the boys were to cross the fiord with them and return in the boat lucy would not go seeing what was the matter with urquhart urquhart indeed was in a parlous frame of mind he was very grim to all but the boys he was to them what he had always been polite and very quiet in his ways with lucy he had no word for either of his companions james treated him with deference francis lingen who felt himself despised was depressed jolly party said lancelot really meaning it and made urquhart laugh but lucy shuddered at such a laugh she thought of the wolves in the zoological gardens when at sundown they greet the night it made her blood feel cold in her veins if no ones going to enjoy himself why does anybody go she said at a venture james protested that he was going to enjoy himself prodigiously as for lingen he said it would do him no end of good i jolly well wish i could go was lancelots fishing shot and lucy who was really sorry for urquhart was tempted to urge it but james would not have heard of such a thing she knew then they went with a great deal of fuss and bustle james a great stickler for the conventions patted her shoulder for all goodbye urquhart waited his chance goodbye my dear he said ive had my innings here you wont see me again i expect i ask your pardon for many thingsbut i believe that we are pretty well quits trust me with your james wont you goodbye he asked her that to secure himself against whims she could do no more than give him her hand he kissed it and left her the boat was pushed out urquhart took the helm with lancelot in the crook of his arm he turned once and waved his cap there goes a man any woman could love she told herself if she had a regret she had it not long some natural tears they shed but dried them soon they made a good landing bestowed their gear in a cart and set out for a long climb to brattebo which they reached in the late afternoona lonely farm on the side of a naked hill they slept there and were to rise at four for the snowfield chapter xxii catastrophe they were up and away before the light taking only one guide with them a sinewy dark man with a clubbed beard on his chin if they had had two it had been better and urquhart who knew that made a great fuss but to no purpose all the men were at the saeters they were told haymaking was in full swing out there there was nothing to be done urquhart was put out and in default of another man of sense made james his partner in griefs i know these chaps he said when they are alone they lose their heads the least little difficulty they shy off and turn for home i judge this man of ours to have the heart of a mouse he dont want to go at all if there are two of them they egg each other on they talk it over each tries to be the bolder man but is there going to be any difficulty james enquired surveying the waste through his eyeglass i dont see why there should be you never know urquhart said curtly but presently he was more confidential dont tell that ass lingen but it might be quite difficult to get off this place james stared about him you know best but is it harder to get off than on of course it is my dear chap said urquhart quite in his old vein of goodtempered scorn we are going up on the north side where the snow is as hard as a brick ah said james now i see and we go down on the south where its as soft where it may be as soft as a branmash or blown over into cornices james saw or said that he did in his private mind he judged urquhart of trying to intimidate him the vice of the expert but he noticed that the guide had a coil of rope and that urquhart carried a shovel it was easy going until near noon with no snow to speak about they climbed a series of ridges like frozen waves but each was higher than the last and took them closer to the clouds when they lunched under the shelter of some tumbled rocks a drifting rain blew across the desolation jolly said james but quite happily lingen shivered my dear man said urquhart just you wait ill surprise you in a quarter of an hours time he spoke in his old way as hectoring whom he tolerated james noticed it and was amused he hadnt yet had time to be angry with this rascal and now he began to doubt whether he should after all he had gained so very much more than he had lost honour oh that be jiggered something too much of his own honour why it was through urquharts attack upon lucy that he had found out what lucy was urquhart at this time was marching rather in front of him james looked him over a hardy impudent rogue no doubtwith that square small head on him that jutting chinand his pair of blue eyes which would look through any woman born and burn her heart to water yes and so he had had lucys heartas water to be poured over his feet by heaven when he thought of it he james adolphus had been the greater rogue to play the grand turk to hoard that lovely quivering creature in his still seraglio to turn the key and leave her there and jimmy urquhart got in by the window of course he did he was not an imaginative man by nature but he was now a lover and had need to enhance his mistress how better do that than by calling himself a dd fool the greatest blame he knew it follows that if he had been a fool urquhart had not impudent dog if you like but not a fool now for the life of him james could not despise a man who was not a fool nor could he hate one whom he had bested he did not hate urquhart he wasnt angry with him he couldnt despise him on the contrary he was sorry for him but now the miracle happened and one could think of nothing else as they tramped through the cold mist over snow that was still crisp and short with frost the light gained by degrees the flying fog became blue then radiant quite suddenly they burst into the sun the dazzling field stretched on all sides so far as the eye could see snow and cloud one could not distinguish them and above them the arch of hyaline a blue interwoven with light which throbbed to the point of utterance and drowned itself in the photosphere the light seemed to make the sun to climb towards the zenith to mass and then to burst in flame all three men took it in each in his fashion lingen was greatly moved urquhart became jocular well he said to macartney what do you make of that thats worth coming up for that ought to extenuate a good deal james was quick to notice the phrase oh he said you can show me things im very much obliged to you this is a wonder of the world now what the deuce does he mean by that urquhart thought to himself had lucy told him anything he didnt believe it impossible women dont tell they had seven miles of snow pretty soft by now and steadily up hill they bent themselves seriously to it and found no occasion for talk there were crevassesgreen depths of deathto be avoided their guide lighteyed for scares seemed to know them all and reserved his alarm for signs in the sky invisible to the party he mended the pace which became rather severe francis lingen was distressed macartney kept back to give him company urquhart forged on ahead with the guide by four in the afternoon one at least of them was gruelled that was lingen if we dont get down after all itll go hard with poplolly urquhart said to james james replied oh we must get down thats all nonsense urquhart said nothing and they went on they reached a point where their guide stopping for a moment looked back at them and pointed forward with his staff odde is over there he said and urquhart added that he knew whereabouts they were if it were clear enough he told them you might see it all lying below you like a map but i doubt if youll see anything they pushed on before the last slope which was now close at hand the ground became very bad the crevasses showed in every direction raying out like cracks on an old bench the guide was evidently anxious he gave up all appearance of conducting his party and went off rapidly by himself they waited for him in silence but presently urquhart said i bet you any money he wont want to go down dont he want to dine as much as we do said james he doesnt want to break his neck said urquhart thats his little weakness i sympathise with him james said but i should like to know more before i turn back youll only know what he chooses to tell you urquhart answered lingen was sitting on the snow the guide came back with firm steps his eyes sought urquharts naturally well he was asked and lifted his stock up impossible he said why impossible james asked urquhart having none of the language but guessing at the word urquhart and the man talked the latter was eloquent he says urquhart told them that theres a great cornice and a drop of forty feet or so then he thinks theres another but hes not sure of that he intends to go back i knew he did before he went out to look its a beastly nuisance james looked at lingen who was now on his feet well he said what do you feel about it lingen red in the face said youll excuse me but i shall do what the guide proposes though i admit to great fatigue i dont think it would be right under the circumstances to do otherwise i feel a great responsibility but i gather that in any case he himself would decline to go down you will think me timid i dare say no no james said thats all right of course personally i should be inclined to try the first cornice anyhow theres always a chance you know urquhart looked at him keenly do you mean that he asked him yes james said why do you ask urquhart turned away when he faced james again he was strangely altered his eyes were narrower lines showed beside his mouth temptation was hot in the mouth wed better talk about it he said and jerked his head sideways james walked with him a little way whats all this mystery he asked i wonder if you know what you are doing urquhart said i wonder if you know what this means do you know for instance that i dont care a damn whether i break my neck or not and on the whole would rather that you did than didnt you ought to know it but im asking you james kept his eyeglass to his eye i think you are talking nonsense he said but i dont suppose you intend it for nonsense you inspire me to say taking you on your face value that i shall try the first cornice if its a fortyfoot drop we ought to have rope enough urquhart peered at him you mean what you say certainly i do urquhart turned on his heel all right he said and went over to the other two macartney and i are going down he said to lingen i dont at all blame you for going back but ill trouble you to see that this man does the needful tomorrow the needful is to come out here as early as he can get over the ground to see if we want him he had better fire a gun or shout if we are alive we shall answer him if we dont answer he had better see about it i dont want to scare you but this is not a joke and i cant afford to be misunderstood now im going to tell him all that in his own lingo lingen took it very badly but said nothing urquhart spoke vehemently to the guide who raised his staff and appeared to be testifying to heaven he handed over the rope the shovel and the kit with an air of pilate washing his hands now urquhart said to james well rope and see if we can cut some steps through this thing ive seen that done james dropping his eyeglass said that he was in his hands everybody was quiet but they were all in a hurry lingen came up to say goodbye he was very much distressed nearly crying the guide on the other hand was chafing to be off if that chap calls himself a guide said urquhart he ought to be shot the guide thereupon threw up his hands with a gesture of despair lingen said that he couldnt possibly go until he had seen them down the guide who was sullen and nervous remained to help them even that seemed to be against his convictions they fixed one of the stocks in a crevasse urquhart roped then he went forward to the edge or what seemed to be the edge and having crawled on his belly so far as to be almost invisible presently was seen to be standing up then to fall to it with the shovel he seemed to be cutting steps and descending as he worked gradually he disappeared and the pull on the rope began they paid out cautiously and regularlyall seemed well he might have had twenty feet of it and then there was a sudden violent wrench at it and it came back limp in macartneys hands hes gone he said then he shouted with all his might no answer came they all shouted the echoes rang round the waste driven back on them from the hidden mountain tops in the deathlike hush which followed one of them thought to hear an answering cry lingen heard it or thought that he did and began to haul up the rope when they had the end of it in their hands it was found to be cut clean he did that himself james said then added im going down give me out this ropefor what its worth to lingen he said get back as quick as you can and bring up some men tomorrow then having secured himself he went down the flawless snow slope and they paid out the cord as he wanted it he had no particular sensation of fear he knew too little about it to have any it is imaginative men who fear the unknown true the rope had been cut once and might have to be cut again if urquhart had had to cut it was because it had been too short and now it would be shorter but there was no time to think of anything the snow seemed to be holding him he had got far beyond urquharts ledges was upon the place where urquhart must have slid rapidly down all was well as yet but he didnt want to overshoot the mark he kept his nerve steady and tried to work it all out in his mind if this were really a cornice it must now be very thin he thought he drove at it with his staff and found that it was so it was little more than a frozen crust he kicked into it with his feet got a foothold and worked the hole bigger then he could peer down into the deep where the shadows were intensely blue it looked a fearful drop but he saw urquhart lying there and went on he descended some ten or perhaps fifteen feet more and found himself dangling in the air he was at the end of the rope then ill risk it he said and got his knife out he dropped within a few yards of urquhart chapter xxiii james and jimmy macartney found him lying very still nothing in fact seemed to be alive but his eyes which were wide open and missed nothing youre hurt im afraid can you tell me anything urquhart spoke in a curiously level tone it seemed to give impartiality to what he said as if he had been discussing the troubles of a man he hardly knew back broken i believe anyhow i cant feel anything im sorry you came down after me my dear fellow said james what do you take me for those bright allseeing steady eyes were fixed upon him they had the air of knowing everything well you knew what i did take you for anyhow and so it would have been reasonable we wont talk about all that james said let me cover you up with somethingand then ill see what can be done about moving you urquhart spoke indifferently about that i doubt if you can get downand its a good step to odde four hours i dare say yes but there would be a house nearer than odde if i could get some bearerswed get you comfortable before dark oh im comfortable enough now urquhart said james thought that a bad sign he unpacked the rucksacks got out the brandyflask a mackintosh a sweater and a cape now my dear man im going to hurt you im afraid but i must have you on a dry bed and you must drink some of this liquor which will you have first the brandy said urquhart and as soon as you like he helped as much as he could groaned once or twice sweated with the effort but the thing was done he lay on the mackintosh his head on a rucksack the cape and sweater over him macartney went to the edge of the plateau to prospect a billowy sea of white stretched out to a blue infinity the clouds had lifted or been vaporised he could see nothing of odde but he believed that he could make out a thread of silver which must be the fiord it would take him too long to get out there and backand yet to stay here that meant that the pair of them would die it is but just to him to say that no alternative presented itself to him the pair of them would die well yes what else was there he returned urquhart was waiting for him intensely awake to everything old chap said james thats no go i didnt try the snow but i can judge distances its a deuce of a way down even if there is a way and its all right urquhart said there isnt a way im cornered this time but theres just a chance for youif you work at it itll begin to freezein fact it has begun already now if you can find the shovel you might employ yourself finely digging a stairway youll be up by midnight never mind about me james said im going to keep you warm first but urquhart was fretting he frowned and moved his head about no no dont begin that its not worth itand i cant have you do it you ought to know who i am before you begin the good samaritan stunt i want to talk to you while i can ive got a good deal to tell you that will be better for me than anything jimmy was prepared for something of the kind i believe it will he said go on then and get it over it had been his first impulse to assure the poor chap that he knew all about it but a right instinct stopped him he would have to hear it so urquhart began his plain tale and as he got into it the contrast between it and himself became revolting even to him a hale man might have brazened it out with a better air a little of the romance with which it had begun which indeed alone made it tolerable would have been about it still a sicker man than urquhart who made a hard death for himself would have given up the battle thrown himself at jamess feet and asked no quarter urquhart was not so far gone as that a little bluster remained he did it badly he didnt mean to be brutal he meant to be honest but it sounded brutal and james could hardly endure it he saw too as the poor chap went on that he was getting angry and doing himself harm that was so every step he took in his narrative sharpened the edge of the fate which cut him off he would have made a success of it if he couldbut he had been really broken before he broke his back and the knowledge exasperated him so he took refuge in bluster made himself out worse than he was and in so doing distorted lucy james was in torment remembering what he must he felt her arms close about his neck he felt the rush of her words and oh darling i thought it was youof course i thought soand i was proud and happythat you should like me so much i looked at myself in the glass afterwards i thought you must be rather pretty oh heaven and this mocking dying devil with his triumphs say no more man say no more broke from him i understand the rest i have nothing to say to you you did badlyyou did me a wrongand her too but its done with and she god bless her can take no harm how can she she acted throughout with a pure mind she thought that you were me and when she found that you werentwell well take your pride in that i give it up to you why shouldnt i she gave you her innocent heart i dont grudge you you neednt said urquhart since im a dead man but if i had been a living one who knows he laughed bitterly and stung the other you forget one thing said james with something of his old frozen calm for all that you knew ten minutes after you had left my house that daythe first of themi might have benefited by your actand you been none the wiser nor i any the worse off and there would have been an end of it urquhart considered the point james could have seen it working in his poor wicked silly mind but kept his face away yes urquhart said you might but you didnt then he laughed againnot a pleasant sound man said james indignant dont you see what robs me of utterance is that i have benefited by what you have done its more than you have deserved in my opinion urquhart retorted ill ask you not to forget that she has loved me and doesnt blame me and ill ask you not to forget that it is i who am telling you all this and not she it was his last bite the retort was easy and would have crushed him but james did not make it let him have his pitiful triumph he was not angry any more he couldnt beand there was lucy to be thought of what would urquhart think of a lucy who could have revealed such things as these he would have judged her brazen little knowing the warm passion of her tears ah not for him these holy moments no let him die thinking honour of herhonour according to his own code he put his hand out and touched urquharts face with the back of it let us leave it at this he said we both love her we are neither of us fit she would have taken either of us but i came first and then came lancelotand she loves the law put it no other way the law the law said the fretful smitten man the law of her nature said james he felt urquharts piercing eyes to be upon him and schooled himself to face them and to smile into them to his surprise he saw them fill with tears you are a good chap urquhart said i never knew that before macartney blew his nose no more was said but the sufferer now allowed him to do what he would he chafed his hands and arms with brandy took off his boots and chafed his feet he succeeded in getting a certain warmth into him and into himself too he began to be hopeful i think i shall pull you through he told him you ought to be a pretty hard case i suppose you dont know how you came to fall so badly well i do urquhart said dont tell me if youd rather not oh what does it matter now it was a whim james smiled another whim yesand another fiasco you see in a way i had dared you to come i admit that well i hadnt played fair i knew and you didnt that it was a bad job you cant get down this waynot when the snows like this oh cant you i think not well i ought to have told you i was tempted thats the worst thing i ever did i ask your pardon for that you have it old chap said james you can afford to be magnanimous urquhart snapped out fiercely damn it you have everything but i felt badly about it as i was going down and i thought theyll feel the break and know its all over so i cut the painterdo you see yes said james i see he did indeed see urquhart began to grow drowsy and to resent interference he was too far gone to think of anything but the moments ease james on the other hand was entirely absorbed in his patient im not going to let you sleep he said its no good making a fuss ive got the kinch on you now it was as much as he had the air was biting cold and the colder it got the more insistent on sleep urquhart became james stared about him was this the world that he knew were kindly creatures moving about somewhere in it helping each other was lucy in this place had she lain against his heart two nights ago had he been so blessed had life slipped byand was this the end which was the reality and which the dream if both had been real and this was the end of mens endeavourif this were deathif one slipped out in this curs way the tail between the legswhy not end it he could sleep himself he thought suppose he lay by this brother cur of his and slept somewhere out beyond this cold there were men by firelight kissing their wives poor chaps they didnt know the end this was the endloneliness and cold yes but you could sleep suddenly he started intent and quivering he had heard a cry every fibre of him claimed life he listened breathlessly above the knocking of his own heart he heard it again no doubt at all he turned to urquhart and shook him they are comingthey are comingwe are going to be saved he was violently moved tears were streaming down his face urquhart out of those still aware dreadfully intelligent eyes seemed to see them comingwhoever they were he too and his pitiful broken members were calling on life james on his feet shouted with might and main and presently was answered from near at hand then he saw lingen and the guide wading through the snow they have found us he told urquhart its francis lingen and the guide how theyve done it i dont pretend to guess theyve got around the cornice urquhart said it can be done i know he seemed indifferent again even annoyed again that he couldnt be allowed to sleep james thought it a pose this time lingen out of breath but extremely triumphant met james thank god he said james with lifted brows waved his head backward to indicate the sufferer hes very bad he said how did you get him to come he meant the guide flaming lingen said i made him i was desperate ive never done such a thing before but i laid hands on him you are a brick said james lingen said its something to know that you can throttle a man when you want to badly enough i hadnt the slightest idea its a thing i never did before i rather like it throttled or not the guide saved the situation he saved it undisguisedly for his own sake for he had no zest for helping to carry a bier over the folgefond they made a litter of alpenstocks and the mackintosh and so between them carried urquhart down the mountain no need to dwell on it they reached the hotel at odde about midnight but halfway to it they found help chapter xxiv urquharts apology macartney was right when he said to lucy in talking over the adventure that urquhart had no moral sense though she had not then been convinced but she was to be convinced before she had done with him he asked for her repeatedly and with no regard at all to what had happened at last he was told that if he excited himself she would leave the hotel vera nugent told him that having installed herself his nurse vera who knew nothing but suspected much guessed that macartney had had as much of her brother as he cared about as for lucy on the whole she despised her for preferring james with the law to jimmy without it in this she did little justice to jamess use of his advantage but as i say she didnt know what had happened all she could see for herself was that where she had once had a faible for urquhart she was now ridiculously in love with her husband vera thought that any woman was ridiculous who fell into that position she was not alone in the opinion however the main thing was that jimmy shouldnt fret himself into a fever if he kept quiet she believed that he would recover there was no dislocation the doctors told her but a very bad wrench he must be perfectly stilland we should see lucy was not told how impatiently she was awaited james maybe did not know anything about it he felt great delicacy in telling what he had to tell her of the events of that day but she guessed nearly everything even that urquhart had intended to break his own neck he would she said being in a stare hes like that james agreed but pointed out that it had nearly involved his own end likewise lucy stared on but said that wouldnt occur to him at the time no said james on the contrary it had occurred to him at the time that if he cut the rope he james would immediately turn for home she nodded her head several times hes like that and then she turned and hid her face its all dreadful she said i dont want to know any more it was then that james pronounced upon urquharts absence of morality and found out that she was very much interested in him anyhow she was curious about what had passed between him and james for she was sure that there had been something james admitted that it was very uncomfortable he said i cut him as short as i couldbut i was awfully sorry for him after all i had scored you see she gave him a long look yes you scored all ways because it was only when i was angry with you that ithought he might do there could be no comment on that then she said im thankful that i told you everything before he did so am i by jove said james he put his arm round her if you hadnt he said i think i could have let him die lucy shook her head no you wouldnt have done that he would havebut not you if you had been capable of that you wouldnt have called me to come to you as you didthat day he knew which day she meant and felt it necessary to tell her something about it on that day he said though you didnt know it i was awfully in love with you she looked at him wonderfully no i didnt know that what a donkey i was but i was wretched i simply longed for you if you hadnt cried you would never have had me that she understood you wanted to pity me no i had been afraid of you your tears brought you down to earth thats poetry said lucy its the nature of man he maintained she wanted to know if he minded her seeing urquhart he did very much but wouldnt say so you neednt mind a bit she told him he has terrified me im not adventurous at all besides besides no no not now she would say nothing more an expedition was made to the foot of the snowfieldfor the benefit of the boys from a distance they saw the great cornice and the plateau where james had watched by urquhart lancelot was here confronted with irony for the first time his loyalty was severely tried by rights mr urquhart ought to have rescued the lot not for a moment could he doubt of that as for his father accepted on all hands as a hero there were difficulties in the way which he could not get over he had to go very warily to work because of his mother but he went as far as he could why was it that mr urquhart was hurt and father was not when they both had the same drop lucy could only say that father dropped betteror fell better and then there was a pause what with an eyeglass he allowed himself thatwith her but with patrick nugent he was short and stern patrick had said something of the same kind as they were journeying home together why hadnt lancelots governor smashed his eyeglass when he dropped lancelot sniffed offence immediately and snorted hoo jolly good thing for him he didnt it kept the cold out of his eye its like feeding a mouse when youre a prisoner in dungeons afterwards it comes and gnaws the rope pooh any ass could see that and so much for patrick and cheek but the sick man fretting in his bed took short views to see lucy again had become so desirable that he could think of nothing else she glanced before him as a promise and his nature was such that a promise was halfway to a fulfilling as strength grew so did he wax sanguine and amused himself by reconstructing his spanish castle vera nugent gave him no encouragement and perhaps overdid it hadnt you really better let the woman alone shes perfectly happyin spite of you he could afford to laugh at this she doesnt know what happiness is she thinks it is safety i could teach her better youve made a great mess of it so far vera said he ignored that you say that shes happy i suggest that she is merely snug thats what a dormouse calls happiness well theres a good deal of the dormouse in lucy vera said if you stroke her she shines silence he cried sharply out you dont know anything at all i have had her radiantlike a moonstone when am i to see her ill tell her that you want to see herbut it would be reasonable if she refused she wont refuse he said james must be told of course he took it quietly yes on the wholeyes i dont think you can refuse him that it will try you it will be horridbut anyhow you know everything he can say he doesnt know that i do hell build on that build said lucy quickly what sort of building oh fantastic architecture bowers by bendemeer never mind are you going yes said lucy slowly yes ill go now she went to him and put her hands on his shoulders her eyes searched his face and found it inscrutable you mind she said i know you do you ought notbut im glad of it he humbled himself at once they parted as lovers part but for the life of him he could not understand how she could find the heart to go with himself now it would have been a point of honour not to go he did not see that the more a woman loves the more love she has to spare vera nugent took her into the room pausing outside the door youll find him very jumpy she said and then my dear youre so sensible lucy who knew that she meant precisely the opposite said no i dont think i am im excitable myself what do you want me to do keep cool said vera he wont like it but its important then they went in jimmy heres mrs macartney the quick eyes from the bed had been upon her from the first it was immediately evident to her that she was not to be spared she heard his at last and braced herself for what that might mean i should have come before if the doctors had approvedso would james and lancelot she said as briskly as she might he took no notice of her addition vera nugent saying dont let him talk too much then left her with him she began matteroffact enquiries but he soon showed her that she had not been brought in for such platitude he played the mastery of the invalid without hesitation oh im very sick you know they tell me that i shall be as fit as ever i was if i behavebut really i dont know ive a good deal behind meand not much beforeso that im comparatively indifferent how the thing goes look here lucy he said suddenlyand she stiffened at her namei have to talk to you at last its wonderful how weve put it offbut here it has come she said in low tones i dont see why we should talk about anything i would much rather not everything is changed noweverything urquhart began with a touch of asperity ill disguised might one be allowed to enquire scared perhaps by his pomposity he broke off no that wont do ill ask you simply what has happened you liked meto say no more now you dont no no dont protest yet leave it at that well and then theres macartney macartney didnt know you existed now he doesnt see that any one else does what has happened lucy she was annoyed at his lucy annoyed that she could be annoyed annoyed at his question and his right to ask itwhich she had given him mostly perhaps she was annoyed because her answer must sound ridiculous hateful that such should be the lot of men and wives she repeated his question what has happened i dont know how to tell you i found out before we startedjames found out please dont ask me to talk about it believe me when i say that everything is changed i cant say more than that he didnt move his eyes from her she knew they were there though she would not face them everything isnt changed im not changed i dont know that you are although you say so she faced him indeed i am i hope youll understand that he frowned his fever flushed him you cant be we can never be ordinary acquaintance i have kissed you you had no right you have kissed me you are cruel indeed i am not crueli dont pretend to excuse myself the first timeit was the act of a cadbut i worked it all out it couldnt fail i knew exactly how it would be you would of course think it was he you would be awfully touched awfully pleasedset up and you were i saw that you were when we all came into the room you went over and stood by him you put your hand on his arm i said you divine beautiful tender thing now ill go through the fire to get you lucy had covered her face with her hands but now she lifted it and showed him as it might be the eyes of an assessing angel you went through no fire at all but you put me in the fire but he continued as if she had said nothing material i had made up my mind to be satisfied i thought if i could see you exalted proud of what you had that would be enough but you found him out and then you found me out too and we never spoke of it but there it was lucy all the time and there it is still my dear her face was aflame but her eyes clear and cold no she said its not there there is nothing there at all you are nothing to me but a thought of shame i think i deserve all that you can saybut surely you have said enough to me now i must leave you if you go on with this conversation nothing whatever is there he laughed not harshly but comfortably as a man does who is sure of himself yes there is something there still i count on that there is a common knowledge unshared by any one but you and me he would have it so i was ready to tell him everything but he wouldnt hear me it was honourable of him i admired him for it but it left me sharing something with you she stared at him as if he had insulted her in the street what can you mean how could he want to hear from you what he knew already from me urquhart went pale grey patches showed on his cheeks and spread like dry places in the sand you told him everything two nights before you went he fell silent his eyes left her face power seemed to leave him that tears it he said that does for me he was so utterly disconcerted that she could have pitied him so thats why he didnt want to hear me no wonder butwhy didnt he tell me that he knew it i taunted him with not knowing he turned towards her his eyes were bright with fever if you know perhaps youll tell me lucy said proudly i believe i know he didnt want to change your thoughts of me he received that in silence then he said by george hes a better man than i am lucy said yes he is her head was very fixed her neck very stiff she was really angry and urquhart had sense enough to see it she got up to leave him really angry but unwilling to appear so you must forget all this she said and get well then you will do wonderful things he said ive been a blackguard but i meant something better oh i am sure you did she said warmly i wont see macartney if he doesnt mind tell him from me that hes a better man than i am he wont believe you said lucy oh yes he will urquhart held goodbye love to lancelot that melted her dont give us up we are all your friends now he wouldnt have it no i am a neckornothing man it cant be theres no cake in the cupboard ive eaten it send vera in if you see her about goodbye she left him she went through the hall with a word to vera who was writing letters there he asked for you vera looked up at her hes excited i suppose no not now said lucy then she went into the sittingroom and saw the party at tea on the balcony james paused in his careful occupations and focussed her with his eyeglass she went quickly to the table oh let me do it let me and then she sighed deeply hulloa said james knowing very well whats up she poured the tea only that im glad to be here glances were exchanged quick but reassuring lancelot said theres a ripping cake mr urquhart would like some i bet you lucy said he cant have any cake just yet upon which remark she avoided jamess eye and eyeglass with great care but on a swift afterthought she stooped and kissed lancelot epilogue really the only fact i feel called upon to add is the following announcement culled from a fashionable newspaper on the rd june we read at onslow square to mr and mrs james adolphus macartney a daughter that ought to do instead of the wedding bells once demanded by the average reader let it then stand for the point of my pairs pilgrimage i promised a romantic james and have given you a sentimental one it is a most unfortunate thing that it should be thought ridiculous for a man to fall in love with his wife for his wife to fall in love with him and we have to thank i believe the high romanticks for it they must have devilry it seems or cayenne pepper but i say scorn not the sentimental though it be barleysugar to ambrosia a canarys flight to a skylarks scorn it not its the romantic of the unimaginative and if it wont serve for a magic carpet it makes a useful antimacassar the macartneys saw no more of urquhart who however recovered the use of his backbone and with it his zest for the upper air he sent lucy some flowers after the event of june and later on at the end of july a letter which i reproduce quid plura i had news of you and greeted it and am gone i have hired myself to the greeks for the air i take two machines of my own and an m b if you can forgive me when i have worked out my right we shall meet again if you i shall know and keep off goodbye lucy j u the one thing i cant forgive myself was the first a wild impulse but a cads all the rest was inevitable goodbye she asked lancelot what quid plura meant he snorted hoo stale it means what are you crying about naturally who said it that letter whos it from mr urquhart i suppose yes its from mr urquhart to say goodbye hes going to greece to fly for the navy oh rather sport has he gone yes dear i think so youll write to him i suppose i might i shall too then rather i should think so the end transcribers note inconsistencies in hyphenation have been retained from the original the original text
