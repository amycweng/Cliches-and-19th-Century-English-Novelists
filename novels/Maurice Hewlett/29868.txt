chapter i onslow square this is a romantic tale so romantic is it that i shall be forced to pry into the coy recesses of the mind in order to exhibit a connected reasonable affair not only of a man and his wife prosperously seated in the mean of things nel mezzo del cammin in space as well as time for the macartneys belonged to the middle class and were well on to the middle of life themselves but of stript quivering and winged souls tiptoe within them tiptoe for flight into diviner spaces than any seemly bodies can afford them as you peruse you may find it difficult to believe that macartney himself james adolphus that remarkable solicitor could have possessed a quivering winged soul fit to be stript and have hidden it so deep but he did though and the inference is that everybody does as for the lady that is not so hard of belief it very seldom is with women they sit so much at windows that pretty soon their eyes become windows themselves out of which the soul looks darkling but preening out of which it sometimes launches itself into the deep wooed thereto or not by aubade or serena but a man with his vanity haunting him pulls the blinds down or shuts the shutters to have it decently to himself and his looking glass and you are not to know what storm is enacting deeply within finally i wish once for all to protest against the fallacy that piracy brigandage pearl fishery and marooning are confined to the wilder parts of the habitable globe never was a greater if more amiable delusion fostered to serve his simplicity by lord byron and others because a man wears trousers shall there be no more cakes and ale because a woman subscribes to the london institution desires the suffrage or presides at a committee does the bocca baciata perde ventura believe me no there are at least two persons in each of us one at least of which can course the starry spaces and inhabit where the other could hardly breathe for ten minutes such is my own experience and such was the experience of the macartney pair and now i have done with exordial matter the macartneys had a dinner party on the twelfth of january there were to be twelve people at it in spite of the promised assistance of lancelot at dessert which lucy comforted herself by deciding would only make twelve and a half not thirteen she told that to her husband who fixed more firmly his eyeglass and grunted i'm not superstitious myself he may not have been but certainly lucy told herself he wasn't very good at little jokes lancelot on the other hand was very good at them twelve and a half he said lifting one eyebrow just like his father why i'm twelve and a half myself then he propounded his little joke i say mamma on the twelve and halfth of january because the evening is exactly half the day twelve and a half people have a dinner party and one of them is twelve and a half isn't that neat lucy encouraged her beloved it's very neat indeed she said and her grey eyes glowed or seemed to glow it's what we call an omen at school said lancelot it means oh well it means lots of things like you're bound to have it and it's bound to be a frightful success or an utter failure or something of that kind he thought about it developments crowded upon him i say mamma all this was at breakfast macartney shrouding himself in the morning post yes lancelot it would be awfully good awfully ingenious and all that if one of the people was twice twelve and a half she agreed yes i should like that very likely one of them is lancelot looked extremely serious not mr urquhart he said no said lucy i am sure mr urquhart is older than that but there's margery dacre she might do lancelot had his own ideas as to whether women counted or not in omens but was too polite to express them is she twenty five do you think she's rather thin lucy exploded and had to kiss the unconscious humourist do you think we grow fatter as we grow older then you must think me immense because i'm much more than twenty five she said here was a vital matter it is impossible to do justice to lancelot's seriousness on the edge of truth how much more are you really he asked her trembling for the answer she looked heavenly pretty with her drawn back head and merry eyes she was a dark haired woman with a tender smile but her eyes were her strong feature of an intensely blue grey iris ringed with black poising to tantalise him adoring the fun of it suddenly she melted leaned until her cheek touched his and whispered the dreadful truth thirty one i wish i could do justice to his struggle politeness tussling with pity for a fall but tripping it up and rising to the proper lightness of touch are you really thirty one oh well that's nothing it was gallantly done she kissed him again and lancelot changed the subject there's mr lingen isn't there he asked adding he's always here much more than twenty five said his mother very much aware of mr lingen's many appearances in onslow square she made one more attempt at her husband wishing as she always did wish to draw him into the company it was not too successful lingen oh a stripling he said lightly and rustled the morning post like an aspen tree father always talks as if he was a hundred himself said lancelot who was not afraid of him he had to be content with miss dacre after all the others the judge and lady bliss aunt mabel and uncle corbet the worthingtons were out of the question as for miss bacchus oh miss bacchus was at least five hundred said lancelot and wished to add up all the ages to see if they came to a multiple of twelve and a half meanwhile mr macartney in his leisurely way had risen from the table cigar in mouth had smoothed his hair before the glass on the chimney piece looked at his boots wriggled his toes in them with gratifying results adjusted his coat collar collected his letters in a heap and left the room they saw no more of him half an hour later the front door shut upon him he had gone to his office or as he always said chambers he was rather bleak and knew it reckoning it among his social assets reduced into a sentence it may be said of macartney that the chief good in his philosophy was to be and to seem successful without effort what effort he may have made to conceal occasional strenuous effort is neither here nor there the point is that at forty two he found himself solidly and really successful the husband of a very pretty wife the father of a delightful and healthy son the best dressed solicitor in london and therefore you may fairly say in the world with an earned income of some three or four thousand a year with money in the funds two houses and all the rest of it a member of three very old fashioned most uncomfortable and absurdly exclusive clubs if this is not success what is and all got smoothly without a crease of the forehead by means of an eyeglass a cold manner and an impassivity which nothing foreign or domestic had ever disturbed he had ability too and great industry but it was characteristic of him to reckon these as nothing in the scales against the eyeglass and the manner they were his by the grace of god but the others he felt were his own additions and of the best these sort of investments enabled a man to sleep they assured one of completeness of effect nevertheless he was a much more acute and vigorous minded man than he chose to appear he was a solicitor it is true and had once been called an attorney by a client in a rage but he could afford to smile at that because he was quite a peculiar sort of solicitor by no means everybody's money rather he was a luxury an appanage of the great his office which he called chambers as if it was an old house in the country was in cork street his clients were landed gentry bankers peers and sons of peers the superior clergy too he handled the affairs of a bishop of lukesboro' and those of no less than three deans and chapters tall dark and trenchant with a strong nose and chin and clouded grey eyes a handsome man with a fine air of arrogant comfort on him he stood well and you could not but see what good clothes he wore to my taste i confess a little too good his legs were a feature and great play was made by wits with his trousers he was said to have two hundred pairs and to be aiming at three hundred and sixty five certainly they had an edge and must have been kept in order like razors but the legend that they were stropped after every day's use is absurd they used to say that they would cut paper easily and every kind of cheese except parmesan he wore an eyeglass which with the wry smile made necessary by its use had the marked effect of intimidating his clients and driving them into indiscretions admissions and intemperate discourse hypnotised by the unknown terrific of which the glitter of the blank surface the writhen and antick smile were such formidable symbols they thought that he knew all and provided that he should by telling it him to these engines of mastery he had added a third he practised laconics and carried them to the very breaking point he had in his time i repeat the tale gone without his breakfast for three days running rather than say that he preferred his egg poached his wife had been preoccupied at the time it had been just before lancelot was born barely a year after marriage and had not noticed that he left cup and platter untouched she was very penitent afterwards as he had intended she should be the egg was poached and even so she was afraid to ask him when the time was ripe to boil it again it made her miserable but he never spoke of it of course all that was old history she was hardened by this time but still dreadfully conscious of his comforts or possible discomforts this was the manner of the man who you may say had quizzed or mesmerised lucy meade into marriage she had been scarcely eighteen i believe that she was just seventeen and a half when he presented himself the second of three pretty dark haired and grey eyed girls the slimmest and as i think by far the prettiest the meades lived at drem house which is practically within bushey park here the girls saw much society for the old meades were hospitable and the mother meade a scotchwoman had a great idea of establishing her daughters the sons she left to father meade and his competent money bags here then james adolphus macartney presented himself and here sat smiling bleakly glaring through his glass one eyebrow raised to enclose it safely and waited for her to give herself away swaying beneath that shining disk she did it infallibly and he heard her out at leisure and accepted her that's poetry of course really it came near to that he had said to her at a garden party in his easiest airiest manner you can't help knowing that i am in love with you now don't you think that we should be a happy couple i do what do you say lucy shall we have a shot he had taken her hand they were alone under a cedar tree and she had not known how to take it away she was then kissed and had lost any opportunity there might have been that was what really happened and as she told her sister mabel some time afterwards when the engagement had been made public and there could be no question of going back you know mabel he seemed to expect it and i couldn't help feeling at the time that he was justified mabel tossing her head up had protested oh my dear nobody knows whether he was justified but yourself and lucy no of course not the question mabel went on is whether you encouraged him or not lucy was clear about that no not the least in the world he encouraged himself i felt that i simply had to do something i suspect that that is perfectly true i am sure that he did just as i said he always did and bluffed her into marriage with an eyeglass and smile awry whether or no he bluffed himself into it too tempted by the power of his magic apparatus is precisely the matter which i am to determine it may have been so but anyhow the facts show you how successful he was in doing what had to be done cosa fatta capo ha as the proverb says the thing done whether wisely or not was smoothly done everything was of a piece with that he pulled off whatever he tried for without any apparent effort people used to say that he was like a river smoothly flowing very deep rippling constant in mutability husbanding and guiding his eddies it's not a bad figure of him he liked it himself and smiled more askew and peered more blandly when he heard it small things betray men here is one his signature was invariably in full yours very truly james adolphus macartney it was as if he knew that adolphus was rather comic opera but wouldn't stoop to disguise it why bother he crowded it upon the bishop upon the dean and chapter of mells upon old lord drake he said why conceal the fact that my sponsors made a faux pas there it is and have done with it such things have only to be faced to be seen as nothings what are we reasonable beings now when lucy meade practically a child for all her sedateness and serious eyes married him two things terrified her on the day one was her husband and the other lest her friends should discover it they never did and in time her panic wore off she fought it in the watches of the night and in the glare of her lonely days not a soul not her mother not even mabel knew her secret james never became comic to her she never saw him a figure of fun but she was able to treat him as a human being lancelot's arrival made all the difference in the world to that matter as to all her other matters for even lucy herself could not help seeing how absurdly jealous james was of his offspring for a time he was thrown clean out of the saddle and as near falling in his own esteem as ever in life but he recovered his balance and though he never regained his old ascendency which had been that of a ju ju he was able to feel himself as he said master in his own house with a very real reserve of terrorism if it should be wanted the great thing macartney thought was discipline constant watchful discipline a man must bend everything to that women have to learn the virtue of giving up as well as of giving giving is easy any woman knows that but giving up let that be seen as a subtle a sublimated form of giving and the lesson is learned but practice makes perfect you must never relax the rein he never did there was all the ingenuity and patience of a woman about him by this time after twelve years and more of marriage they were very good friends or why not say old acquaintances there are two kinds of crystallisation in love affairs with all respect to m de stendhal one kind hardens the surfaces without any decorative effect there are no facets visible no angles to catch the light in the case of the macartney marriage i suspect this to have been the only kind a kind of callosity protective and numbing the less they were thrown together she found the better friends they were at home they were really no more than neighbours abroad she was mrs macartney and never would dine out without him she was old fashioned her friends called her a prude but she was not at all unhappy she liked to think of lancelot she said and to be quiet and really as miss bacchus a terrible old woman once said lucy was so little of a married woman that she was perfectly innocent but she was one and thirty and as sweet and pretty a woman as you would wish to see she had the tender dragging smile of a luini madonna grave twilight eyes full of compassionate understanding very dark eyebrows very long lashes like the fringe of rain over a moorland landscape she had a virginal shape and liked her clothes to cling about her knees long fingers longish thin feet but her humorous sense was acute and very delightful and all children loved her such charms as these must have been as obvious to herself as they were to everybody else she had a modest little court of her own francis lingen was almost admittedly in love with her one of macartney's friends but she accepted her riches soberly and did not fret that they must be so hoarded if by moments as she saw herself or looked at herself in the glass a grain of bitterness surged up in her throat that all this fair seeming could not be put out to usury well she put it to herself very differently not at all in words but in narrowed scrutinising eyes half turns of the pretty head a sigh and lips pressed together there had been nay there was lancelot her darling that was usufruct but usury was a different thing there had never been what you would call or miss bacchus would certainly call usury that indeed she would raise her fine brows compress her lips and turn to her bed then put out the light lying awake very often she might hear james chain the front door trumpet through his nose on the mat and slowly mount the stairs to his own room she thought resolutely of lancelot pursuing his panting quests at school or of her garden in mid june or of the gorse afire on wycross common and so to sleep a long chapter but you will know the macartney pair by means of it chapter ii a dinner party this was not to be one of macartney's grand full dress dinner parties the sort where you might have two lords and would be sure to have one with his lady or a cabinet minister in a morning coat and greenish tie or a squire and squiress from northumberland up for a month of the season or the dean of mells no nor was it to be one which lucy had to give to her visiting list and at which as macartney rarely failed to remark there was bound to be a clergyman and some lean woman with straw coloured hair interested in a settlement it was to be a particular kind of dinner party this one of which the first object was to bring urquhart in touch with lingen it could have been done at a club no doubt macartney admitted it yes i know i know he used his most tired voice as if he had been combating the suggestion all along you are perfectly right it might if it had not happened to be exactly what i didn't want jimmy urquhart is rather a queer fish he is apt to shy off if one is not careful it don't suit me to bring them together explicitly do you see i want them to happen on each other they can do that better here than anywhere do you see lucy saw or saw enough she never enquired into james's law affairs shall i like mr urquhart do you think she asked him the eyeglass focussed upon the cornice and glared at a fly which found itself belated there oh i think so why not well you see i don't know why not or why i should have i ever seen him james was bored no doubt you have he's very much about yes said lucy but i am not james left the fly and fixed her apparently with horror then he looked at his boots and moved his toes up and down he looks like a naval officer he said you instinctively seek the cuffs of his coat beef coloured face blue eyes a square jawed chap yes you might like him he might amuse you he's a great liar lucy thought that she might like mr urquhart on those lines the party was arranged the blisses because we owe them a dinner and i think the judge will be amused by jimmy the worthingtons make weights but she's a soft pink woman like a persian kitten does mr urquhart like that lucy asked but james who didn't like his jokes to be capped said drily i don't know then lucy's favourite sister mabel was to be allowed because james rather liked corbet he thought him good style now we wanted two women one must be miss bacchus hideous of course said james a kind of crime but very smart he meant that she mixed with the aristocracy which was true though nobody knew why the last was to be margery dacre a very pretty girl lucy put her forward and james thought her over gazing out of window i like her name he said so lucy knew that she was admitted that was all the rest was her care and he washed his mind of it very sure that she would see to it he wished the two men to meet for a particular reason in a haphazard way because it was better to drift urquhart into a thing than to lead him up to it moreover it was not at all disagreeable to him that urquhart a club and office acquaintance should see how comfortably placed he was how well appointed with wife and child with manservant and maidservant and everything that was his urquhart was a rich man and to know that his lawyer was rich was no bad thing it inspired confidence now the particular thing to be done with the two men francis lingen and urquhart was this francis lingen who might be a baronet some day and well to do was at the moment as at most moments hitherto very short of money urquhart always had plenty macartney's idea was that he might get urquhart to fill francis lingen's pockets on terms which could easily be arranged there was ample security of course francis lingen could have gone to the jews or the bank but if the thing could be done in a gentlemanly way through one's lawyer who also happened to be a gentleman in one's own set and so on well why not hence the little dinner over whose setting forth lucy puckered her brows with mrs jenkins her admirable cook and wrote many notes on little slips of paper which she kept for the purpose she knew quite well when james was particular about a party he said less than usual when he was particular over this one he said practically nothing so she toiled and made a success of it the drawing room looked charming and she herself in black over white with her pearls the most charming thing in it it wanted a week of lancelot's day for school he was to come in to dessert that was understood but the possible danger of a thirteenth was removed by their being two tables of six each james had suddenly ordered this variation of practice he did not say why and so it was to be crewdson the invaluable butler valet of the house who presided over a zenana of maids and seemed to carry his whiskers into the fray like an oriflamme was visibly perturbed at this new notion mr macartney has his reason we know but how is one gentleman's servant to split himself in halves and where does he stand mrs jenkins with tables dotted about like a cafe or an archumpelygo he knew that it was done in the highest places but he knew his own place best we are not what you call the smart set he said we are not park lane or brook street but we are solid the professions the land and the church no jinks in this house and small tables is jinks not a dinner but a kick up so crewdson thought and so he looked but his master was flint mabel came the first the lively and successful mabel two years younger than lucy she and laurence he was laurence corbet esq of peltry park wavertree and roehampton sw a hunting man and retired soldier as neatly groomed as a man may be he was jolly and adored his mabel he was county and approved by james lucy used to say of him that his smile could cure a toothache lancelot pounced upon the pair instantly and retired with them to the conservatory to show off his orange tree whose pip had been plunged on his first birthday but before long a suspicious sliding of the feet and a shout from corbet of goal betrayed the orange tree's eclipse next plunged miss bacchus with her front hair and front teeth and air of digging you in the ribs she explained that she made a point of being early lest she should be taken for an actress and forestalled macartney's assurance that she never would be which annoyed him the worthingtons she like an autumn flower bed and he pale and sleek and francis lingen came in together lingen a very elegant pale pink and frail young man with a straw coloured moustache who bowed when he shook your hand as if he was going to kiss it but remembered just in time that he was in england he lowered his voice when he spoke to women and most of them liked it lucy wasn't sure whether she did or not it made her self conscious and perverse at once she found herself wondering a whether he was going to make love to her b when he was going to begin and c how she might best cut him out all this was bewildering made her feel stupid and annoyed her but she really liked francis lingen and had been amused to discover how much he was francis in her private mind certainly he was very elegant he had an outside pocket to his dress coat and a handkerchief which you could have plugged your tooth with he had just said to lucy i'm so glad to see you it's more than a week since we met and i want your advice when crewdson like a priest announced sir matthew and lady bliss the judge and his dame were before lucy the lady had a motherly soul in crimson satin and paste the gentleman square and solid like a pillar box with a bald head that is a pretty exact description of him the judge was very square headed very shiny and very plain but he was solid and he was useful macartney used to say that he had a face like a bad egg certainly he was curdled but he shone and looked healthy lucy allowed herself to be mothered and in the meantime murmured the judge's name and miss bacchus's everybody knows miss bacchus said the gallant man and miss bacchus briskly rejoined more people know tom fool after that they got on excellently then she heard from the door mr urquhart and had time to turn francis lingen over to lady bliss before she faced the ruddy and blue eyed stranger her first thought the only one she had time for was what very blue eyes what a very white shirt front when she shook hands how d'ye do you won't know who i am he said at once oh but i do she assured him james described you to me he blinked oh did he i suppose he told you i was a great liar james's very words she nodded without speaking but laughter flickered over her face like summer lightning well said urquhart i am to him i've known macartney for years long before you did i like him but i think he gives himself airs now you can't you know when the man with you is a liar you never know where to have a liar or whether you have him or not and then you get in a fright whether he's not having you macartney saving your presence doesn't like being had lucy laughed and turned to wave her hand to lancelot in the entry of the conservatory that your boy urquhart asked but of course he's like you with his father's tricks that was perfectly true and that's your sister of course pretty woman like you too you in a sunset perfect unconsciousness robbed this open commentary of sting upon him drifted mrs worthington like a peony in the tideway urquhart bowed your servant ma'am she cried hullo jimmy you here where else why i thought you were in switzerland so i was he said all among the curates but i came back because they didn't he turned to lucy and because i was asked here she asked him were you ski ing lancelot will grudge you that he told her i was not no lonely death for me i was bobbing it you are swept off by dozens at a time there by fifties in a cave it's more cheerful then he seemed to remark something which he thought she ought to know jimmy you heard her now macartney and i are both called james but who ever made a jimmy of him she was annoyed with him the man seemed to suppose she could be pleased by crabbing james and glad of margery dacre a mermaid in sea green who swam in with apologies due to macartney's abhorrent eyeglass upon her and then they all went in to their archumpelygo where crewdson and his ladies were waiting for them rari nautes lucy's table she was between the judge and urquhart and had mabel worthington and miss bacchus before her at once took the mastery urquhart fixed crewdson with his eye and thenceforward commanded him james's eyeglass speechless with horror over lady bliss's shoulder glared like a frosty moon miss bacchus it seems was his old acquaintance she too called him jimmy and drove at him with vigour he charged her not to rally him and being between the two sisters talked to both of them at once or rather started them off as a music hall singer starts the gallery and then let them go on over his head they talked of wycross lucy's house in the country compared it with peltry which mabel deprecated as a barrack and came to hear of urquhart's house in the new forest it was called martley thicket urquhart said it was a good sort of place i've made an immense lake he said with his eyes so very wide that miss bacchus said you're making two now he described martley and the immense lake house stands high in beech woods but is cut out to the south it heads a valley lawns on three sides smooth as billiard tables then the lake with a marble lip and steps broad and low steps in flights of eight very good you know you shall see it lucy wanted to know how big was the lake really urquhart said it looked a mile but that's the art of the thing really it's two hundred and fifty yards much better than a jab in the eye with a blunt stick i did it by drainage and a dam took a year to get the water up when a hunted stag took to it and swam across i felt that i'd done something fishing i should think so and a bathing house in a wooded corner in a cane brake of bamboos you'll like it miss bacchus said i don't believe a word of it but he seemed not to hear her when will you come and see it he asked lucy she agreed that see it she must if only to settle whether it existed or not you see that miss bacchus has no doubts urquhart said she never has about anything she is fixed in certainty like a bee in amber a dull life bless you jimmy she said i thrive on it and you'll never thrive pooh said urquhart what you call thriving i call degradation what you snuggle in there out of the draughts and then somebody comes along and rubs you and picks up bits of paper with you his good spirits made the thing go and james's eyeglass prevailed not against it but urquhart's real triumph was at dessert lancelot sedately by his mother between her and the judge who briskly made way for him lancelot in his eton jacket took on an air of precocious meditative wisdom infinitely diverting to a man who reflects upon boys and no doubt infinitely provocative his coming broke up the talk and made one of those momentous pauses which are sometimes paralysing to a table this one was so and even threatened the neighbouring island upon it broke the voice of urquhart talking to mabel corbet i was out in corfu in he was heard to say i was in fact in the bath when one of my wives came to the door and said that there was a turk in the almond tree i got a duck gun which i had and went out lancelot's eyes fixed and pulsing interdicted him they held up the monologue in his hand was a robust apple but that was forgotten i say he said have you got two wives urquhart's eyes met his with an extenuating look it was some time ago you see he said and then passing it off there are as many as you like out there dozens lancelot absorbed this explanation through the eyes you could see them at it chewing it like a cud he was engrossed in it lucy watched him i say two wives and then giving it up with a savage attack he bit into his apple and became incoherent one cheek bulged dangerously and required all his present attention finally after a time of high tension urquhart's wives and the apple were bolted together and given over to the alimentary juices the turk in the almond tree was lost sight of and no one knows why he was there or how he was got out if indeed he ever was for all that urquhart finished his story to his two ladies but lucy paid him divided attention being more interested in her lancelot than in urquhart's turk francis lingen at the other table kept a cold eye upon the easy man who was to provide him with ready money as he hoped he admired ease as much as anybody and believed that he had it but he was very much in love with lucy and felt the highest disapproval of urquhart's kind of spread eagle hardihood he bent over his plate like the willow tree upon one his eyelids glimmered he was rather pink and used his napkin to his lips to his neighbour of the left who was lady bliss he spoke sotto voce of our variegated friend and felt that he had disposed of him but that one of his wives filled him with a sullen despair what were you to do with that sort of man macartney saw all this and was dreadfully bored damn jimmy urquhart he said to himself now i shall have to work for my living which i hate after dinner but he did it we'll go and talk to the judge he said to his company and led the way urquhart settled down to claret and was taciturn he answered linden's tentative openings in monosyllables but he and the judge got on very well chapter iii in the drawing room after dinner when the men came into the drawing room francis lingen went directly to lucy and began to talk to her lancelot fidgeted for urquhart who however was in easy converse with the judge and his host looking at the water colours as the talk went on and cutting in as a thought struck him lucy seeing that all her guests were reasonably occupied lent herself to lingen's murmured conversation and felt for it just so much tolerance so much compassion you may say as to be able to brave mabel's quizzing looks from across the room mabel always had a gibe for francis lingen she called him the ewe lamb and that kind of thing it was plain that she scorned him lucy on the other hand pitied him without knowing it which was even more desperate for the young man it had never entered lingen's head however that anybody could pity him true he was poor but then he was very expensive he liked good things he liked them choice and they must have distinction above all they must be rare he had some things which were unique a chair in ivory and bronze one of a set made for mme de lamballe and two of horace walpole's snuff boxes he had a private printing press and did his own poems on vellum he had turned off a poem to lucy while she was inspecting the appareil once to l m from the fount sonnets while you wait said mabel curving her upper lip but there was nothing in it because many ladies had received the same tribute he had borrowed that too from horace walpole and only wanted notice now you don't pity a man who can do these things even if he has got no money and for what else but want of money could you pity a man of taste i believe myself that both mabel and lucy overrated francis lingen's attentions i don't think that they amounted to much more than providing himself with a sounding board and occasional looking glass he loved to talk and to know himself listened to he loved to look and to know himself looked at you learned a lot about yourself that way you saw how your things were taken a poet for he called himself poet and had once so described himself in a hotel visitors' book a poet can only practise his art by exerting it and only learn its effect by studying his hearers he preferred ladies for audience and one lady at a time there were obvious reasons for that men never like other men's poetry wordsworth we know avowedly read but his own but mabel and lucy too read all sorts of implications his lowered tones his frequency his persistence my dear he caresses you with his eyes you know he does mabel used to say lucy wondered whether he really did and ended by supposing it just now therefore francis lingen flowed murmuring on his way like a purling brook rippling fluctuant carrying insignificant straws insects of the hour on his course never jamming or heaving up monotonous but soothing and as for implications good heavens he was stuffed with them like a michaelmas goose i do so wish that you could talk with her you could do so much to straighten things out for the poor child you are so wise there's a kind of balm in your touch upon life something that's aromatic and healing at once sainfoin the healing herb that should be your emblem i have always thought so by the by have you an emblem i wish you'd let me find you one old gerrard will give it me and i will give it to you some patient nimble fingered good soul has coloured my copy you shall have it faithfully rendered and it shall be framed by le notre of vigo street do you know his work you must and stand on your writing table i see you are shaping a protest frugality another of your shining qualities not of mine no no i admire it in you it is not a manly virtue a 'frugal swain' means a harassed wife now confess would you have me board i believe i would do it if you asked me not very exciting all this but if you want implications it was while this was going on that lancelot hovering and full of purpose annexed urquhart the judge suddenly aware of him between them put a hand upon his head as you might fondle the top of a pedestal which lancelot intent upon his prey endured then his moment came a decent subsidence of anecdotes and his upturned eyes caught urquhart's i say will you come and see my orange tree it's just over there in the conservatory it's rather interesting to me you know urquhart considered the proposition yes he said i'll do that and they went off lancelot on tiptoe lucy's attention strayed the orange tree was exhibited made the most of its history was related there was nothing more to say about it lancelot his purpose growing gave a nervous laugh no turk could hide in that i expect he said and trembled urquhart gazed at the weedy little growth no he said he couldn't yet but a ladybird could he picked out a dormant specimen but lancelot was now committed to action beyond recall the words burned his lips i say he said twiddling a leaf of his orange tree i expect you've been a pirate the judge had wandered in and was surveying the pair his hands deep in his trousers pockets urquhart nodded you've bit it he said lancelot had been certain of it good lord the questions crowded upon him what kind of a ship was yours she was a brigantine fifteen hundred tons oh i say with the air of you needn't tell me if you'd rather not was she a good one she was a clipper what name the dog star this was beyond everything oh good did you ever hang fellows we did many some he had expected that too he felt that he was being too obvious the man of the world in him came into use for treachery i suppose and that kind of thing yes said urquhart and for fun of course lancelot nodded gloomily i know he said so does sir matthew now he said you've led me into admissions you know you are up to the neck said the judge for a moment lancelot looked shrewdly from one to the other was it possible that no no he settled all that it's all right he's a guest you see the same as you are urquhart was looking about him i should smoke a cigarette if i had one he said lancelot's hospitality was awake come into father's room he has tons he led the way for his two friends they pierced the conservatory and entered another open glass door they were now in james's private room on the threshold lancelot paused to exhibit what he said was a jolly convenient arrangement these were two bay windows with two glass doors between them stretched the conservatory jolly convenient said lancelot what for burglars the judge asked yes for burglars and policemen and father you know i don't think said the terse lancelot why don't you think my friend says the judge and lancelot became cautious oh father won't come into the drawing room if he can possibly help it he says it's mamma's province but i expect he's afraid of meeting women i mean ladies urquhart blinked at him 'never be afraid of any one' will do for you and me he said and lancelot said deeply rather not then they went into the misogynist's study the judge and urquhart were accommodated with cigarettes and lancelot entertained them but he did not pry any further into urquhart's past a hint had been enough conversation was easy lancelot talked freely of his father father will be awfully waxy with me for not going to bed he might easily come in here hope he won't all the same but do you know what he likes he likes the same things to happen at the same time every day now mamma and i don't agree with him you see so it's rather pink sometimes i expect it is urquhart said mamma of course likes to be quiet a bit she doesn't like ructions hay and all that so i keep myself pretty close quite right said the judge i know lancelot said dreamily and then with great briskness beastly grind all the same the judge had a fit of coughing and urquhart got up and looked about then the judge said that he too should catch it if he didn't go back and make himself polite lancelot led the way back but at the entry of the drawing room where the talk was buzzing like bees in a lime tree he put his hand on the switch and showed the whites of his eyes shall i dare you to switch it off he said to urquhart who replied don't or i shall do it lancelot and he entered the room but before the judge followed there was a momentary flicker of the lights lancelot nudged urquhart he's all right he said out of one corner of his mouth oh he's all right urquhart agreed they both went to lucy and lingen looked mildly round interrupted in his flow lancelot's greeting was darling you really must go to bed he knew it it was so obvious the abhorrent eyeglass apart that he didn't even try the pathetic only a week before school he got up enquiring of his mother if she would swear to come up presently well good bye he said to urquhart and held out his hand good night to you said urquhart anyhow you know the worst but lancelot shook his cautious head no he said not the worst and then with a deep chuckle but the best hoho two wives with that he went jolly chap said urquhart and sat himself down by lucy to lingen's inexpressible weariness she warmed to his praise but denied him her conscience at work no you mustn't sit down i shall take you to talk to lady bliss you'll like her no i shan't he said i can see that and she'll think i've corrupted her husband but he had to go lingen also she recruited for service he had had a good innings and found himself able to be enthusiastic about urquhart he could bear to discuss him in possible relations with himself of course miss bacchus sized him up aloud according to her habit jimmy urquhart a good man yes he's a live man no flies on jimmy urquhart been everywhere had a bit of most things why i suppose jimmy has eaten more things than you've ever read about i've read brillat savarin said lingen modestly i dare say jimmy's had a notch out of him said miss bacchus he's what i call a blade lingen didn't ask her what she called him chapter iv after talk nevertheless the two men talked down to knightsbridge together and lingen did most of the talking he chose to expand upon macartney the nearest he dared get to the subject of his thoughts now macartney you know is a very self contained man no doubt you've noticed how he shies at expression chilling at times good in a lawyer no doubt you get the idea of large reserves but perhaps as a well as a father for instance that bright boy of theirs now you may have noticed how little there is between them what do you think of the spartan parent in these days oh i think mr lancelot can hold his own said urquhart he'll do with his mother to help i don't suppose the spartan boy differed very much from any other kind of boy mostly they haven't time to notice anything but they are sharp as razors when they do an eager note could be detected in francis lingen's voice almost a crow ah you've noticed then the mother i mean mrs macartney now there again i think our friend overdoes the repression business a sympathetic attitude means so much to women she'll get it somewhere said urquhart shortly well said lingen yes i suppose so but there are the qualifications of the martyr in mrs macartney greensickness urquhart proposed is that what you mean lingen stared it had not occurred to me but now you mention it well a congestion of the faculties eh i don't know anything about it said urquhart she seemed to me a fond mother and very properly do you mean that macartney neglects her lingen was timid by nature perhaps i went further than i should i think that he takes a great deal for granted i always thought he was a supercilious ass said urquhart but i didn't know that he was a damned fool i say lingen was alarmed i say i hope i haven't made mischief urquhart relieved him bless you not with me i use a lawyer for law he's no fool there no indeed lingen said eagerly i've found him most useful in fact i trust him further than any man i know he's a good man urquhart said and he's perfectly honest he'd sooner put you off than on any day that's very sound in a lawyer but if he carries it into wedlock he's a damned fool in my opinion they parted on very good terms lingen for the albany urquhart elsewhere meantime lancelot wriggling in his bed was discussing urquhart i say mamma he said a leading question do you think mr urquhart really had two wives no darling i really don't i think he was pulling our legs that was bad all our legs all that were pullable certainly your two perhaps he was lancelot sighed oh what happened to the turk i forgot him thinking of his wives he said 'one of my wives' you know he might have had six then i say perhaps mr urquhart is a turk in disguise what do you think lucy was sleepy and covered a yawn i don't think darling i can't i'm going to bed and you are going to sleep aren't you now yes of course yes of course did i tell you about the pirate part his ship was a brigantine called the dog star oh was it yes it was and he used to hang the chaps sometimes for treachery and sometimes for fun how horrid said lucy good night oh well came through the blankets of course you don't understand but i do good night and he was asleep at the turn of that minute james had disappeared into his room so she took herself off to bed surely he might have said a word it had all gone off so well mr urquhart had been such a success and she really liked him very much and how the judge had taken to him and how lancelot at the first stair she stopped in three quarters of a mind to go in and screw a sentence out of him but no she feared the angry blank of the eyeglass trailing up to bed she thought that she could date the crumbling of her married estate by the ascendency of the eyeglass and to think only to think that when she was engaged to james she used to play with it to try it in her eye to hide it from him well she had lancelot her darling boy that brought to mind that a week to night she would be orphaned of him the day she dreaded was coming again and the blank weeks and months which followed it true to his ideas of discipline of the value of doing a thing well for its own sake macartney was dry about the merits of the dinner party when they met at breakfast eh oh yes i thought it went quite reasonably urquhart talked too much i thought my dear james she was nettled you really are he looked up the eyeglass hovered in his hand plait il nothing i only thought that you were hard to please really because i think a man too vivacious lancelot said to his porridge bowl over the spoon i think he's ripping you've hit it said his father he'd rip up anybody lucy piqued upon her tender part was provoked into what she always avoided if she could acrimony at breakfast i was hostess you see and i must say that the more people talk the more i am obliged to them i suppose that you asked mr urquhart so that he might be amusing james's head lifted again you could see it over the morning post i asked urquhart for quite other reasons you remember i don't know what they were said lucy my own reason was that he should make things go 'a party in a parlour' she bit her lip the morning post quivered but recovered itself what was the party in a parlour mamma do tell me that was lancelot with a flair for mischief it was 'all silent and all damned' said lucy jolly party said lancelot not like yours though the morning post clacked like a bellying sail then bore forward over an even keel lucy beckoning lancelot left the breakfast room she was ruffled and so much so that lancelot noticed it and being the very soul of tact where she was concerned spoke neither of his father nor of urquhart all the morning in the afternoon the weather seemed more settled and he allowed himself more play he would like to see mr urquhart on horseback in a battle he thought he expected he'd be like henry of navarre lucy thought that he might be would he wear a white plume though much head shaking over this bareheaded i bet you he's just that sort dashing about absolutely reckless frightfully dangerous a smoking sword going like one o'clock oh i bet you what you like then with startling conviction father doesn't like him feels scored off i expect he wasn't though but he might be all the same i think father always expects he's going to be scored off don't you at any minute lucy set herself to combat this hazard which was very amusing and by no means a bad shot poor james what a pity it was that he couldn't let himself like anybody it was true it was quite true he was afraid of being scored off she husbanded a sigh poor james to pity james was a new experience she felt all the better for it and was able to afford a lighter hand when they met at dinner it may even be that james himself had thought the time come for a little relaxation of askesis or he may have had something to forestall he seldom spoke of his affairs without design at any rate he told her that francis lingen had been with him and that urquhart was likely to be of use i've written to him anyhow he will do as he thinks well urquhart is a sharp man of business lucy said he struck me so i thought that he could never have any doubt of his own mind james wriggled his eyeglass to wedge it more firmly ah you noticed that very acute of you lucy we may have a meeting before long to arrange the whole thing it's a lot of money ten thousand pounds your francis is an expensive young man or let's say ci devant jeune homme why do you call him 'my' francis she asked rather mischievous than artless the eyeglass dropped with a click and had to be sought well i can hardly call him mine could i i don't see why he should be anybody's said lucy except his own my dear girl said macartney himself is the last person he belongs to francis lingen will always belong to somebody i must say that he has chosen very wisely you do him a great deal of good that's very nice of you she said i own that i like francis lingen he's very gentle not too foolish and good to look at you must own that he's extremely elegant oh said james tossing up his foot elegant he is what his good horace would have called 'a very pretty fellow' and what i call 'a nice girl' i'm sure he isn't worth so much savagery lucy said you are like ugolino and poor francis is your fiero pasto james instantly corrected himself my besetting sin lucy but i must observe he applied his glazed eye to her feet the colour of your stockings my friend ha a tinge of blue upon my oath so it passed off and that night when after his half hour with the evening paper in the drawing room he prepared to leave her she held out her hand to him and said good night he took it waved it and then stooped to her offered cheek and pecked it delicately the good girl felt quite elate she did so like people to be kind to her half an hour later yet in her evening post was a letter from urquhart he proposed for herself and lancelot to go to the play with him the play raffles which ought to meet the case he said he added i don't include macartney in this jaunt partly because he won't want to come but mainly because there won't be room for him i am taking a nephew one bob nugent an osborne boy but very gracious to poor civilians like lancelot and me he signed himself yours to command lucy was pleased and accepted promptly and lancelot was pleased when he heard of it his hackles were up at the graciousness of the osborne kid he honked over it like a heron ho i expect you'll tell him that i'm r e or going to be he said which meant that he himself certainly would the event with subsequent modifications on the telephone proved to be the kind of evening that lancelot's philosophy had never dreamed of they dined at the cafe royal where urquhart pointed out famous anarchists and their wives to his young guests they went on to the theatre in what he called a 'bus but lancelot saw to be a mighty motor which rumbled like a volcano at rest and proceeded by a series of violent rushes accompanied by explosions of a very dangerous kind the whole desperate passage short as it was had the right feeling of law breaking about it policemen looked reproachfully at them as they fled on lancelot as guest of honour sat in front and wagged his hand like a semaphore at all times and in all faces he felt part policeman and part malefactor which was just right then they thrilled at the smooth and accomplished villainy of mr du maurier lost not one line of his faultless clothes nor one syllable of his easy utterance like treacle off a spoon said urquhart and then they tore back through the starry night to onslow square leaving in their wake the wrecks and salvage of a hundred frail taxis finally from the doorstep waved the destroyer as the boys agreed she should be called upon her ruthless course listened to the short and fierce bursts of her wrath until she was lost in the great sea of sound and then replete to speechlessness lancelot looked up to his mother and squeezed her hand she saw that his eyes were full well darling she said you liked all that lancelot had recovered himself he let go her hand his reply was majestic not bad he said lucy immediately hugged him now that was exactly what james would have said mutatis mutandis yet she would not have hugged james for it nor have loved him because of it these are our crosses mr wesley reflecting on the jaunt she warmed to the thought of urquhart who had she felt the knack of making you at ease what had he done or how done it well he seemed to be interested in what you said he looked at you and waited for it then he answered still looking at you now so many men looked at their toes when they answered you james always did yet mr urquhart did not look too much there were men who did that no not too much chapter v eros steps in when she was told that francis lingen and urquhart were coming on the nineteenth not to dine lucy said oh what a bore and seeing the mild shock inflicted on the eyeglass by her remark explained that it was lancelot's day for going to school and that she was always depressed at such times the eyeglass dropped and its master stretched out his fine long legs with a great display of black speckled sock my dear absurd as it may seem they are coming to see me i know your little way you shan't be disturbed if i may be indulged so far as to contrive that the house hold us both i had thought that it would be only civil to bring them in to you for a minute or two when they've done but that is for you to decide she was immediately penitent oh do of course i daresay they will be useful i'm very foolish to miss him so much the eyeglass ruefully stared at the fire urquhart consents said james and lingen will have his money more snuff boxes you'll find but he's had to work for it insured his life and a letter from sir giles which must have cost him something sir giles lingen was the uncle of francis a childless veteran he turned his disk upon her for a moment you like urquhart yes lucy said i do i like him because he likes lancelot ah said james who thought her weak where the boy was concerned he added urquhart gets on with children he's a child himself why do you call him that she asked with a tinge of offence in her voice james could raise the fine hairs at the back of her neck by a mere inflection he accepted battle because he only thinks of one thing at a time because to get what he wants he'll sacrifice every mortal thing very often the thing itself which he's after but lucy had heard all that before and wasn't impressed all men are like that she said i could give you a much better reason james and his eyeglass both smiled your exquisite reason he is like a child said lucy because he doesn't know that anybody is looking at him and wouldn't care if anybody was james clasped his shin not bad he said not at all bad but the test of that is the length to which you can carry it would he wear a pot hat with a frock coat that's the crux it really was to james as she knew very well she perused the glowing fire with its blue salt flames perhaps to most men probably also to mr urquhart but she felt that she would be lowering a generous ideal if she probed any further so james was left to his triumph the fatal week wore on apace one of the few remaining days was wholly occupied with preparations for the last a final jaunt together was charged with a poignancy of unavailing regrets which made it a harder trial than the supreme moment never never had she thought this bright and intense living thing which she had made so beautiful and so dear nor did it make a straw's worth of difference to the passion with which she was burdened that she felt precisely the same thing every time he left her as for lancelot he took her obvious trouble like the gentleman he was he regretted it made no attempt to conceal that but was full of little comfortable suggestions which made her want to cry you'll have no more sapping upstairs directly after dinner i suppose was one of them another was no more draughty adventures by the round pond lucy thought that she would have stood like jane shore by the round pond in a blizzard for another week of him but she adored him for his intention and was also braced by it her sister mabel who had three boys did not conceal her satisfaction at the approaching release but mabel spent christmas at peltry and the hunting was a serious matter the worst of her troubles was over when they were at victoria lancelot immediately became one of a herd and so did she one of a herd of hens at the pond's edge business was business lancelot remained kind to her but he was inflexible this was no place for tears he even deprecated the last hug the lingering of the last kiss he leaned nonchalantly at the window he kept his eye on her she dared not have a tear the train moved he lifted one hand so long he said and turned to his high affairs she was almost aghast to realise how very small how very pale how atomy he looked to confront a howling world and so to listen to the comfortable words of mrs furnivall briggs my dear they've no use for us the utmost we can do is to see that they have good food and warm socks i am untiring about warm socks that is what i am always girding my committee about i tell the vicar 'my dear sir i will give you their souls if you leave me their soles' do you see he is so much amused but he is a very human person except at the altar there he's every inch the priest well good bye i thought lancelot looked delightful he's taller than my geoff but i must fly i have a meeting of workers at four fifteen bless me i had no idea it was four o'clock the parish room alphonse a spartan mother lucy paid two calls on people who were out and indulged herself with shopping in sloane street lancelot had recently remarked on her gloves you have jolly thin hands he had said it's having good gloves i expect the memory of such delightful sayings encouraged her to be extravagant she thought that perhaps he would find her ankles worth a moment if she took pains with them anyhow he was worth dressing for james never noticed anything or if he did his ambiguity was two edged extraordinary hat he might say and drop his eyeglass which always gave an air of finality to comments of the sort but her shopping done for lancelot's sake life stretched before her a grey waste she went back to tea to a novel to a weekly paper full of photographs of other people's houses dogs children and motor cars it was dark she was bored as well as child sick dissatisfied with herself as well as heart hungry she must get herself something to do she said who was the vicar of onslow square she didn't know somehow religion to her had always seemed such a very private affair not a soul must be near her when she said her prayers except lancelot of course when he was at home she always said them while he said his last night ah she had not been able to say anything last night all her faculties had been bent to watching him at it was it bravery in him or insensibility she remembered mr urquhart had talked about it all boys are born stoics he said and all girls epicureans that's the instinct they change places when they grow up was james an epicurean it was six o'clock they would be at their meeting in james's room surely they wouldn't want tea apparently crewdson thought that they might otherwise well she would leave it to crewdson james never seemed to care for anything done by anybody except crewdson sometimes he seemed to resent it have we no servants then the eyeglass seemed to inquire she wondered if james knew for how much his eyeglass was answerable how could one like to be kissed with that glaring disk coming nearer and nearer and if it dropped just at the moment well it seemed simply to change all one's feelings oh to have her arms round lancelot's salient young body and hear him murmur oh i say as she kissed his neck at this moment being very near to tears the light was switched off she seemed to be drowning in dark that was a favourite trick of lancelot's who had no business as a matter of fact in his father's room it gave her a moment of tender joy and for another she played with the thought of him tiptoeing towards her suddenly all in the dark she felt a man's arms about her and a man's lips upon hers to wild alarm succeeded warm gratitude lucy sobbed ever so lightly her head fell back before the ardent advance her eyes closed with parted lips she drank deep of a new consolation her heart drummed a tune to which as it seemed her wings throbbed the answer the kiss was a long one perhaps a full thirty seconds but she was released all too soon he left her as he had come on silent feet the light was turned up everything looked as it had been but everything was not she was not she found herself an ariadne in a drawing room still lax from theseus' arms yes but theseus was next door and would come back to her to say that she was touched is to say little she was more elated than touched and more interested than either how utterly romantic how perfectly sweet how thoughtful how ardent of james james of all people in the world her husband of course but who knew better than she what that office had implied and who less than she what it must have hidden really was it true could it be true for some time she sat luxurious where she had been left gloating the word is fairly used over this new treasure but then she jumped up and looked at herself in the glass curiously quizzingly and even perhaps shamefaced next she laughed richly and from a full heart my dear girl it's not hard to see what has happened to you you've been not even in her thoughts did she care to end the sentence but those shining dark eyes that air of floating of winged feet ha my dear upon my word at thirty one my child really it becomes you uncommonly she found herself now walking swiftly up and down the room clasping and unclasping her hands to think that james the last man in the world had kept this up his coat sleeve for years and at last and how like the dear thing to turn the light out to save his own face of course for he must have known even he must have known that she wouldn't have cared she would have liked the light to see his eyes there had been no eyeglass this time anyhow but that was it that was a man's romance in cupid and psyche it had been psyche who had wanted to know to see women were like that such realists and as psyche was they were always sorry for it afterwards well bless him he should love her in the dark or how he pleased she stopped again again in front of the glass what had he seen what new thing had he seen to make him want to kiss her like that was she pretty she supposed that she really was she fingered the crinkled whiteness at her neck touched herself here and there turned her head sideways and patted her hair lifting her chin now was there anything she could put on something she could put in for dinner her thoughts were now turned to serious matters this and that possibility flashed across her mind they were serious matters because james had made them so by his most extraordinary most romantic most beautiful action then she stretched out her hands the palms upward and sighed out her heart oh what a load is lightened oh days to come voices in the conservatory suddenly made her heart beat violently he was coming she heard james say oh the rogue yes it's rather nice we put it up directly we came lucy's idea mind the little step at the door though urquhart francis lingen were in the room francis' topknot stood up like a bottle brush then came the hero of the evening james the unknown eros she beamed into the shining disk sweet old spyglass she would never abuse it again all the same he had pocketed it for the occasion the last time he had been in the room urquhart refused tea tea at seven o'clock at night all her eyes were for james who had sought her in love and given her heart again the eyeglass expressed its horror of tea at seven o'clock god forbid said james dear ridiculous creature mr urquhart talked at once of lancelot well he's off with all the rest of them they love it you know it's movement it's towards the unknown the not impossible the 'anything might turn up at any minute' now we don't feel so sure about the minutes do we oh don't we though she laughed and tilted her chin we feel anyhow for their minutes bless them she said and urquhart looked at her with narrowed eyes 'he for god only she for god in him' he said he added i like that boy of yours i think he understands me and pleased her there were a few minutes' desultory talk in the course of which lucy gravitated towards james and finally put her hand in his arm you should have seen the effect of this simple caress upon the eyeglass like a wounded snake it lifted its head to ask who has struck me it wavered and wagged but lucy was glass proof now urquhart said that he was going away shortly at least he supposed he should a man he knew wanted to try a new motor they were to rush down to biarritz and possibly over the frontier to pampluna but nothing was arranged here he looked scrutinising and half quizzical at her are you adventurously inclined will you try my monster it's a dragon she was very adventurously inclined as james might know but not with a mr urquhart necessarily therefore she hesitated oh i don't really know urquhart laughed be bold be bold be not too bold well there it is i start for the newmarket road at eleven to morrow but i'll fetch you for twopence ask him he jerked his head forward towards james on whose arm her hand rested lucy looked up at her romantic lord a look which might have made a man proud but james may have been proud enough already at any rate he didn't see her look but was genial to urquhart over whom he considered that he had triumphed in the library sooner her than me he said i know that she likes it and so advise her to go but i should die a thousand deaths she won't said urquhart and then to lucy well ma'am her eyes assented before she did very well i'll come i dare say it will be delightful oh it will he said still he rambled on plain grumbling easy familiar talk while lucy fumed and fidgeted to be alone with her joy and pride your handsome sister has asked me to hunt in essex don't like hunting but i do like her and there's a great deal waiting to be done at martley i don't know we'll talk about it to morrow then he asked her would she come and look at martley it seemed she had half promised she said oh yes of course nothing of that kind seemed very important but james here looked down at her which made it different we might go at whitsuntide he said she looked deeply up deeply into him so to speak very well we will if you'll come oh he'll come urquhart said and james i should like it so that was settled heavens how she wished these people would go she could see that francis lingen wanted to be asked to stay to dine but she didn't mean to have that so when urquhart held out his hand with a blunt good night to you she let hers hover about francis as if his was waiting for it which it wasn't but had to be oh good night said the embarrassed exquisite and forgot to be tender james picked up the evening paper and was flickering his eye over the leading articles like a searchlight lucy for her part hovered quick footed in his neighbourhood this was her hour of triumph and she played with it she peeped at the paper over his shoulder till he said please and moved it her fingers itched to touch his hair but very prudently refrained she was too restless to settle to anything and too happy to wish it if she had been a singing bird she would have trilled to the piano but she had not a note of music the dressing gong gave her direction there was plenty to be done the gong i'm going to make myself smart james quite smart are you coming up james had the paper open in the middle eh oh there's lots of time run away i'm rather busy you're not a bit busy but i'll go and she went with hardly a perceptible hang back at the door upstairs she rejected her usual choice with a curled lip no no too stuffy oh smithers i couldn't it makes me look a hundred no doubt she was absurd but she had been starved such a thing as this had not happened to her since her days of betrothal and then but seldom when she had satisfied herself she had a panic suppose he said comic opera he said nothing at all he was in a thoughtful mood and talked mostly of urquhart's proposal for whitsuntide i believe it's rather remarkable quite a place to be seen jimmy does things well you know he's really a rich man as rich as you lucy asked not at all interested in urquhart just now the eyeglass was pained my dear soul you don't know what you're saying she quizzed him with a saucy look i didn't say anything dear i asked something if eyeglasses shiver so did james's well well you quibble i dare say urquhart has fifteen thousand a year and even you will know that i haven't half as much she quenched her eyes and looked meek no dear i know all right he's quite rich now what does he do with it do with it james tilted his head and scratched his neck vigorously but not elegantly very often nothing at all there will be years when he won't spend a hundred above his running expenses then he'll get a kind of maggot in the brain and squander every sixpence he can lay hands on or he may see reason good and drop ten thousand in a lap like lingen's why does he do it god knows who made him he's made like that lucy said it was very interesting but only because she thought james would be pleased then she remembered with a pang of doubt that she was to be driven by this wild man to morrow but james would he he had never been really jealous and just now she didn't suppose he could possibly be so but you can't tell with men so she said james dear very softly and he looked over the table at her if you don't think it sensible i could easily telephone eh what about to whom how i don't follow you i mean to mr urquhart about his motor to morrow i don't care about it in the least in fact oh said james the motor ah i had forgotten oh i think you might go urquhart's been very reasonable about this business of lingen's i had a little trouble of course it's a lot of money even for him oh yes i should go if i were you why he might want me to go you know which would bore me to extinction but i know you like that sort of thing he nodded at her yes i should go she pouted and showed storm in her eyes all for his benefit but he declined benefit a strange dear bleak soul very well if it saves you anything i'll do it she said james was gratified as he was also by the peeling of walnuts and service of them in a sherry glass which she briskly performed as if she liked it further than that she was too shy to go but in the drawing room before it might be too late she was unable to forbear her new tenderness she stood behind him her hand fell upon his shoulder and rested there like a leaf he could not but be conscious of it he was very conscious of it and accepted it as a tribute such a tribute was gratifying lucy was a charming woman she did pretty things in a pretty way as a man's wife should but too seldom did how many men's wives after fourteen years of it would stand as she was standing now no the luck held he had a tradition of success success without visible effort the luck held like a steady wind filling a sail discipline however gentle but firm he went on reading but said most kindly well luce well adding on an afterthought how can i serve you her eyes were luminous dilating her gentle mood downcast towards his smooth black hair she sighed serve me oh you serve me well i'm happy just now that's all not fretting after the boy no no not now bless him all the same to be sure whereon at a closer touch of her hand he looked comically up her head moved ever so slightly towards him he dropped his eyeglass with a smart click and kissed her cheek she shivered and started back a blank dismay fell upon her her heart seemed to stop good heavens not so not at all so had james kissed her in the dark there wasn't a doubt about that not the shade of a doubt here had been a brush on the cheek here the cold point of his nose had pecked a little above she had felt that distinctly more distinctly than the touch of his lips whereas that other that full charged message of hope and promise oh that had been put upon her mouth soft and close and long she recalled how her head had fallen back and back how her laden heart had sighed how she had been touched comforted contented good god how strange men were how entirely outside her philosophy she strayed about her drawing room touching things here and there while he complacently fingered his punch flacking over the leaves with brisk slaps of the hand at this moment he was as comfortably minded a householder as any in london engaged solely in digestion at peace at home and abroad so unconscious of the fretting straining passionate lost soul in the room with him hovering flicking about it like a white moth as to be supremely ridiculous to any one but lucy it is difficult to hit off her state of mind in a word or in two she was fretted yes but she was provoked too she was provoked but she was incredulous it could not continue it was too much men were not made so and yet and yet james was a possible eros an eros bless him with an eyeglass and eros loved in the dark she comforted herself with this thought which seemed to her a bright solution of the puzzle and saw james rise and stretch his length without mutiny she received the taps on the cheek of his rolled punch allowed nay procured another chilly peck with no pouting lips no reproachful eyes then came a jar and her puzzlement renewed shall you be late oh my dear soul how can i possibly say i brought papers home with me and you know what that means it's an interesting case we have merridew for us i am settling the brief alas for her the infatuate even stayed to detail points of the cause much it appeared depended upon the chancellor of the diocese a very shaky witness he had a passion for qualification and might tie himself into as many knots as an eel on a night line oh might he indeed and this this was in the scales against her pride and joy she was left alone on naxos now while james went sharply to his papers there i must leave her till the hour when she could bear the room no more she had fought with beasts there and had prevailed yet unreason as she had made herself call it lifted a bruised head at the last papers papers after such a kiss oh the folly of the wise caught up she knew not whence harboured in the mind she knew not how the bitter words of an old scots song tasted salt upon her lips there dwelt a man into the west and o gin he was cruel for on his bridal night at e'en he up and grat for gruel they brought him in a gude sheepshead a bason and a towel gar take thae whimwhams far frae me i winna want my gruel standing in the hall while these words were ringing in her head she stayed after they were done a rueful figure of indecision instinct fought instinct and the acquired beat down the innate she regarded the shut door with wise and tender eyes without reproach then bent her head and went swiftly upstairs chapter vi a leap outwards she arose a disillusioned bride with scarcely spirit enough to cling to hope and with less taste for urquhart's motor than she had ever had for any duller task work nothing in the house tended to her comfort james was preoccupied and speechless the coffee was wrong the letters late and stupid she felt herself at cross purposes with her foolish little world if james had resought her love overnight it had been a passing whim she told herself that love so desired was almost an insult nevertheless at eleven o'clock the motor was there and urquhart in the hall held out his hand she can sprint he said so much i've learned already i think you'll be amused lucy hoped so she owned herself very dull that morning well said urquhart he could promise her that she should not be that she might cry for mercy he told her or stifle screams but she wouldn't stifle yawns macartney he said would sooner see himself led out by a firing party than in such an engine as i have out there she smiled at her memory james is not of the adventurous she said but wasn't he shall i be cold put on everything you have he bade her and then everything else she can do sixty you are trying to terrify me she said but you won't succeed i don't know why but i feel that you can drive i think i have caught lancelot's complaint perhaps so i know that i impose upon the young and insipient and which am i pray he looked at her don't try me too far she came forth finally to see crewdson and her own chauffeur grouped with urquhart the bonnet was open shining coils mighty cylinders were in view and a great copper feed pipe like a burnished boa constrictor the chauffeur a beady eyed swiss stared approval crewdson rubbing his chin offered a deft blend of the deferential butler and the wary man of the world she was tucked in the swiss started the monster they were off with a bound they slashed along knightsbridge won piccadilly circus by a series of short rushes avoided the city and further east found a broad road and slow traffic soon they were in the semi urban fringe among villa gardens over glazed public houses pollarded trees and country glimpses in between there was floating ice on the ponds a violet rime traversed with dun wheelmarks in the shady parts of the way after that a smooth white road deep green fields much frozen water ducks looking strangely yellow and the low blue hills of essex urquhart was a sensitive driver she noticed that the farseeing eye was instantly known in the controlling foot he used very little brake when he pushed his car there was no mark upon him of urgency success without effort the gospel of james urquhart accepted it as a commonplace and sought his gospel elsewhere he began to talk without any palpable beginning and drifted into reminiscence i remember being run away with by a mule train in ronda the first i had ever handled they got out of hand it was a nasty gorge with a bend in it where you turn on to the bridge i got round that with a well directed stone which caught the off side leader exactly at the root of his wicked ear he had only one ear so you couldn't mistake it he ducked his head and up with his heels he went over and the next pair on top of him we pulled up not much the worse well the point of that story is that the pace of that old coach and six mokes i assure you has always seemed to me faster than any motor i've ever driven it was nothing to be compared with it of course but the effort of those six mad animals the elan of the thing the rumbling and swaying about heeling over that infernal gorge of stone you can't conceive the whirl and rush of it now we're doing fifty yet you don't know it wind screen yes that's very much but the concealment of effort is more you've had a life of adventure she said lancelot may have been right he wasn't far wrong urquhart said as a fact i have never been a pirate but i have smuggled tobacco in the black sea and that's as near as you need go i excuse myself by saying that it was a long time ago twenty years i dare say that i was young at the time that i was very hard up and that i liked the fun lovely country you know that strip of shore you never saw such oleanders in your life and sand like crumbled crystal we used to land the stuff at midnight up to our armpits in water sometimes and a man would stand up afterwards shining with phosphorus like a golden statue romantic no poet could relate it they used to cross and recross in the starlight all the gleaming figures like a ballet done for a sultan in the arabian nights i was at that for a couple of years and then the gunboats got too sharp for us and the game didn't pay she had forgotten her spleen her eyes were wide at the enlarging landscape and what did you do next or what had you done before tell me anything i really don't know what i did before i went out to the chersonese from naples i remember that well i had been knocking about vesuvius for a bit keeping very bad company which nevertheless behaved very well to me but finally there was a row with knives which rather sickened me of the vesuvians so i shipped for constantinople and fell in with a very nice old chap on board he took me on at his contraband job i didn't get very much money but i got some and saw a deal of life when it was over i went to greece i like the greeks they are a fine people what did you do in greece she insisted not interested in the fineness of the people blasting first he said they were making the railway from larissa through tempe that was a dangerous job because the rock breaks so queerly you never know when it has finished i had seen a good deal of it in south america so i butted in and was taken on then i did some mining at lavrion and captained a steamer that carried mails among the islands that was the best time i had you see i like responsibility and i got it everything else was tame out there i mean i got into government service at corfu and stopped there six years or more i was all sorts of things lighthouse keeper inspector of marine works harbour master and then my wicked old father i must tell you about him some day you could write a book about him up and died in his bed of all places in the world and left me a good deal of money that was the ruin of me i really might have done something if it hadn't been for that strange thing he turned me out of the house in a rage one day and had neither seen me nor written me a letter from my seventeenth to my thirtieth birthday when he died or thereabouts but at the last when he was on his bed of death he rolled himself over and said to the priest 'there's jimmy out at his devilry among the haythen turks' he says 'begob that was a fine boy and i'll leave him a plum' and so he did i wish he hadn't i was making my hundred and fifty in corfu and was the richest man in the place and i liked the life that was where you had so many wives she reminded him so it was well perhaps i needn't assure you that the number has been exaggerated i've very nearly had some wives but there was always something at the last minute there was a girl at valletta i remember a splendid girl with the figure of a young venus and a tragic face and great eyes that seemed to drown you in dark lady macbeth as a child might have been like that or antigone with the doom on her or perhaps elektra no i expect elektra took after her mother red haired girl i fancy but there you are she was a lovely solemn deep eyed hag ridden goose not a word to say thought mostly of pudding i found that out by supposing that she thought of me then i was piqued and we parted i suppose she's vast now and glued to an upper window ledge with her great eyes peering through a slat in the shutter living in a bed gown imagine a wife who lives in a bed gown they were lunching at colchester when these amorous chapters were reached lucy was quite at her ease with her companion a wife who was always at the dressmaker's would suit you no better but i don't know that mixed marriages often answer after all so dreadfully much can never be opened between you that's quite true he said and by no means only of mixed marriages how much can your average husband and wife open between them practically nothing since they choose to live by speech but what else have we i would choose to live by touch he said if two people can't communicate fully and sufficiently by the feelers they are not in the same sphere and have no common language but speech is absurd why every phrase and nearly every word has a conventional value by touch she was set dreaming by that so she and james a james she had had no conception of had communicated not four and twenty hours ago certainly subsequent speech had not advanced the intelligence then conveyed but she resumed urquhart's affairs and do you despair of finding a woman with whom you can hold communion no he said looking at the bread which he broke i don't despair at all i think that i shall find her and then he looked steadily at her and she felt a little uncomfortable but it was over in a minute she feared to provoke that again so made no fishing comment but she was abundantly curious of what his choice would be meantime he mused aloud what you want for a successful marriage is a layer of esteem without which you will infallibly if you are a man over reach yourself and be disgusted then a liberal layer of animal passion and i only shrink from a stronger word for fear of being misunderstood which you won't have unless you have a vitality b imagination thirdly for a crown respect you must know your due and your duty and fear to omit the one or excuse the other everything follows from those three and how do you know when you have found them he looked up and out into the country a sudden glory he said a flare of insight there's no mistake possible who was the man she asked him rather mischievously who saw a girl at a ball and said 'that's a fine girl i'll marry her' and did it and was miserable he twinkled as he answered that was savage landor but it was his own fault he could never make concessions she thought him a very interesting companion on the way home he talked more fitfully with intervals of brooding silence but he was not morose in his fits and when he excused himself for sulking she warmly denied that he did any such thing i expect you are studying the motor she said and he laughed i'm very capable of that altogether a successful day she returned braced to her duties her james and his hidden up eros to go home to james had become an exciting thing to do chapter vii patience and psyche there are two ways of encountering an anti climax an heroic an unheroic lucy did her best to be a heroine but her temperament was against her her imagination was very easily kindled and her reasons much at the mercy of the flames by how much she was exalted by so much was she dashed but she had a conscience too a lively one with a forefinger mainly in evidence it would be tedious to recount how often that wagged her into acquiescence with a james suddenly revealed freakish and how often she relapsed into the despair of one sharply rebuffed when she found him sedately himself however or by means of her qualities the time cure worked its way her inflammation wore itself out and her life resumed its routine of dinner parties calls and callers francis lingen's purring and letters to or from lancelot with this difference mind you that far recessed in her mind there lay a grain a grain of promise that and a glamorous memory she was able to write her first letter to lancelot in high spirits then to tell him her little bits of news and to remind him really to remind herself of good days in the past holiday time something she may have said or left unsaid as the chance may be drew the following reply she always wrote to him on friday so that he might answer her on sunday dear mama he wrote i was third in weakly order which was rather good idt mr tonks said if i go up so fast i shall brake the ceialing bad spelling i know but still last wendesday a boy named jenkinson swalowed a button hook but recovered it practically as good as when bought or perhaps a xmas present he was always called bolter for a nickname so it was jolly convene for once he did the right thing mostly he is an utter ass how is the polligamous pirate getting on with wives c that comes from a greek word polis a city so i suppose in the country they are too conventual i like him awfully he's my sort not father's though well the term is waring away five days crost off on new diery where shall we go this time three months easter i mean wycross i hope but suppose dreery brighton hope not i must swot now kings of isereel and such like so goodby now or so long as we say here lancelot she thought that she must show the letter to urquhart when next she saw him and meantime of course showed it to james the eyeglass grew abhorrent over the spelling this boy passes belief look at this lucy c e i a ling oh don't you see she cried he had it perfectly c e i well and then a devil of doubt came in and he tried an a oh i can see it now on his blotting pad whichever he decided on he must have forgotten to cross out the other you shouldn't be so hard on your own son his first letter too james felt compunction no no i won't be hard it's all right of course he read on the polligamous pirate with wives c had to be explained she told him the story the eyeglass became a searchlight exploring her did urquhart tell that tale upon my soul it was sheer nonsense of course but oh i don't know said james you can't tell with a man of that sort he can be a march hare if he's in the mood he'd as soon shoot a turk as a monkey or keep two women as half a dozen by the by lucy and the eyeglass went out like a falling star don't let that sentimental idiot make too much of an ass of himself lucy's eyes concentrated they shone who is your sentimental idiot i haven't the least notion what you mean i mean francis lingen of course you must admit oh and he nipped her indignation in the bud i know you won't misunderstand me i am not at all a fool you are kindness itself generosity itself but there it is he's an ass and there's really nothing more to say lucy was mollified she was indeed amused after the first flash remembering the james of a week ago the eager wooer of the dark she was able to be playful with a little jealousy but if he could have known or if she had cared to tell him what she had been thinking of on sunday afternoon when francis purred to her about himself and sought her advice how best to use his ten thousand of urquhart's pounds well james would have understood that's all so she laughed poor francis lingen he is not very wise but i must say that your honour is perfectly safe with me my dear child said james frowning no no i shall go on it will do you good there is one thing you may always be quite sure of dear and that is that the more francis lingen is a goose the less likely i am to encourage him in goosery if there is such a word james pished but she pursued him mabel was announced up from the country to dine and sleep the parthian shot was delivered actually on the way to mabel's embrace but i'm flattered to see you jealous please understand that i should like you to be jealous of the chair i sit on james was hurt and uncomfortable he thought all this rank form and mabel the bright and incisive mabel with her high hunting colour made it much worse what is james jealous oh how perfectly splendid is he going to give secret orders to crewdson not to admit mr as they do in plays at the st james's oh james do tell me whom you darkly suspect caesar's wife my dear and injured man james writhed but he was in the trap you may be too trenchant it would seem and your cleaver stick fast in the block it behooved him to take a strong line this kind of raillery must be stopped he must steer between the serious and the flippant he hated to be pert on the other hand to be solemn would be offensive to lucy which he would not be for james was a gentleman mabel my dear you stretch the privileges of a guest a promising beginning he thought but lucy pitied him plunging there and cut all short by a way of her own oh mabel you are a goose come and take your things off and tell me all about peltry and the hunting and the new horse mr urquhart told me he was going to stay with you is he i'm so glad you like him lancelot and i highly approve i must show you lancelot's letter about him he calls him the polligamous pirate with two l's of course yes said james who had recovered his composure yes my dear but he gives you the accent in polis does he though i'm afraid that was beyond me she paused to beam at james that pleases you it's a sign of grace certainly so the squall blew over james was dining out somewhere so the sisters had a short dinner and a very long evening by the fire lucy dallied with her great news until crewdson had served the coffee then out it came with inordinate and delightful delicacy of approach mabel's eyes throughout were fixed upon her face and of course naturally here lucy turned away her own but nothing not a sign neither then nor since i she stopped bit her lip then broke forth i shall never understand it oh i do think it extraordinary mabel said at once it's not at all extraordinary it would be with any one else but not with james lucy lifted her head what do you mean mabel well it's difficult to explain you are so odd about james he is either the sort of being you name in a whisper or makes you edgy all over like a slate pencil but james i dare say you haven't noticed it you think he's a clever man and so he may be but really he has never grown up lucy's foot began to rock my dear girl really oh i know i know of course you're annoyed especially after such a queer experience we won't discuss it it will be useless but that's my opinion you know i think that he was completely successful according to his own ideas the battle raged i need not add that the mystery far from being undiscussed was driven up and down the field of possibility till a late hour nor that mabel held to her position in high disparagement as lucy felt of lancelot deeply involved an upshot and a shrewd one was mabel's abrupt well what are you going to do now i mean supposing he does it again lucy mused i don't somehow think he will for a long time she added naively i wish he would i like it mabel understood her you mean that you like him for doing it and dreamy lucy nodded yes that's exactly what i mean i do awfully mabel here kissed lucy dearest you're wonderfully sweet you would love anybody who loved you i don't think i would lucy said but i should certainly have loved james more if he had ever seemed to love me and i can't possibly doubt that he did that day that lancelot went back what bothers me is that he stopped there and so to it again in the manner of women tireless in speculation about what is not to be understood james restored in tone was affable and even considerate in the morning mabel studying him with new eyes had to admire his flawless surface though her conviction of the shallow depth of him was firmlier rooted than before he is he really is a tremendous donkey poor james she thought to herself as he gave out playful sarcasms at her expense and was incisive without loss of urbanity mabel was urgent with her sister to join the party at peltry when urquhart was there i do wish you would he's rather afraid of you i think and that will throw him upon me which is what is wanted that was how she put it james quite the secure backed her up i should go if i were you he said to lucy from behind the morning post it will do you a great deal of good you always choose february to moult in and you will have to be feathered down there besides it's evident you can be useful to mabel lucy went so far as to get out her engagement book and to turn up the date not very seriously what she found confirmed her i can't she said it's out of the question why what is happening mabel must know it's an opera night said lucy the walkuere is happening oh are they h'm yes i suppose i can't expect you lucy was scornfully clear i should think not indeed not for a wilderness of urquharts not all the peltry of siberia said james rather sharply as he thought and dismissed the subject in favour of his own neatly spatted foot wagner he said i am free to confess that apart from the glory of the thing i had rather marry one of mr urquhart's wives said the hardy mabel two said james quite ready for her mabel rattled away to her essex and left her sister all the better for the astringent she had imparted lucy did not agree with her by any means it made her hot with annoyance to realise that anybody could so think of james at the same time she felt that she must steady herself after all a man might kiss his wife if he pleased and he might do it how he pleased it was undignified to speculate about it she tried very hard to drive that home to herself and she did succeed in imposing it upon her conduct but she was not convinced she was too deeply romantic for conviction by any such specious reasoning that affair in the dark had been the real thing it implied oh everything let come what might let be what was that was the true truth of the mystery and to be loved like that was oh everything but she dismissed it from her thoughts with an effort of will and relations with james resumed their old position they became formal they were tinged now and again with the old asperity they were rather dreary lancelot's star rose as james's sank in the heavens his letters became her chief preoccupation but james's star fallen low though it were still showed a faint hue of rose colour some little time after this somewhere in early february she met urquhart at a luncheon party and was glad to see him he shook hands in his usual detached way as if her gladness and their acquaintance were matters of course he sat next to her without ceremony removing another man's name card for the purpose and after a few short snapped phrases about anything or nothing they drifted into easy talk lucy's simplicity made her a delightful companion when she was sure of her footing she told him that she had been saving up lancelot's letter to show him good he said i want it but it was not here as it happened so she wrote out from memory the sentence about urquhart the polligamous pirate with wives c aren't you flattered she asked him radiant with mirthful malice he frowned approval he was pleased but like all those who make laughter he had none of his own that shot told i got him with the first barrel trust a boy to love a law breaker he'll never forget me that he's my friend for life he added as if to himself hope so anyhow lucy at this had she been a cat would have purred and kneaded the carpet as it was her contentment emboldened her to flights she was much more bird than cat i wonder if you are really a law breaker she said i don't think i should be surprised to know it of you he frowned again no i should say that the ground had been prepared for that you wouldn't be surprised but would you be disturbed that's what i want to know before i tell you this had to be considered what did she in her private mind think of law breakers one thing was quite clear to her whatever she might think of them she was not prepared to tell him i'm a lawyer's wife you know that tells me nothing he said that would only give you the position of an expert it doesn't commit you to a line i'll tell you this it may encourage you to a similar confidence if i wanted to break a law very badly i shouldn't do it on reflection perhaps but i could never resist a sudden impulse if somebody told me that it would be desirable in all sorts of ways to break a man's head i shouldn't do it because i should be bothering myself with all the possibilities of the thing how desirable it might be or how undesirable but if happening to be in his company i saw his head in a breakable aspect splosh i should land him a nasty one that's a certainty now what should you say to that it happens that i want to know it was evident to her that he really did lucy gave him one of her kind compassionate looks which always made her seem beautiful and said i should forgive you i should tell you that you were too young for your years but i should forgive you i'm sure that's what i wanted to know said urquhart and remained silent for a while when he resumed it was abruptly on a totally new matter i shall bring my sister over to you after this she's here i don't know whether you'll like her she'll like you where is she lucy asked rather curious she's over there by our hostess that big black hat is hers she's underneath it lucy saw a spry black haired youngish woman very vivacious but what she herself called good james would have said smart not at all like her brother she thought and said so she's not such a scoundrel urquhart admitted but she takes a line of her own her husband's name is nugent he is south irish where we are north that boy who went with us to the play is her son he is a lively breed so it hasn't turned out amiss she's not at all your sort but as you know the worst of us you may as well know what we can do when we exert ourselves he added my old father now with beelzebub was a terror do tell me about him it would take too long he was very old fashioned in most ways they used to call him king urquhart in donegal the worst of it was that he knew good claret and could shoot that makes a bad combination he used to sit on a hogshead of it in his front yard and challenge all and sundry to mortal combat he really did duels he used to call them he said 'me honour's involved d'ye see' and believed it but they were really murders because he was infallible with a revolver he adored my mother but she couldn't do anything with him 'tush me dear' he used to say 'i wouldn't hurt a hair of his bald head' and then he'd have to bolt over to france for a bit and keep quiet but everybody liked him i'm sorry to say they gave him a public funeral when he died they took him out of the hearse imagine the great sooty plumes of it and carried him to the chapel half a mile away lucy didn't know how much of this to believe which made it none the worse he was a catholic he was and so are you he looked up eh i suppose i am if any what do you mean she insisted well he said it's there i expect you don't get rid of it she considered this to herself mrs nugent the honourable mrs nugent as it afterwards appeared made herself very amiable we both like boys she said which makes everything easy i hope you liked my pat you met him i know yours seems to be an unconscious humourist jimmy is always chuckling over him mine takes after the urquharts rather grim but quite sound when you know them my husband is really irish he might say 'begorra' at any minute the urquharts are a mixed lot jimmy says we're eurasians when he's cross with us which means with himself i suppose we were border thieves once like the turnbulls and pringles but james i planted us in ireland and there have been james urquharts ever since i don't know why that seems satisfactory but it does i saw what jimmy was saying you know she said presently he began upon me and then slid off to our deplorable father an inexhaustible subject to jimmy who really admires that kind of thing lucy smilingly deprecated the criticism oh but he does if he could be like that he would be but he wants two qualities he can't laugh and he can't cry father could only laugh internally he used to get crimson and swallow hard that was his way jimmy can't laugh at all that's the mischief of it and crying too father could cry rivers one of the best things i remember of him was his crying before mother 'damn it all meg i missed him' he said choking with grief mother knew exactly what to say 'you'll get him next time jimmy come and change your stockings now' well our jimmy couldn't do that to begin with of course he wouldn't have 'missed him' no said lucy reflecting i don't think he would miss unless he was in too much of a hurry to hit mrs nugent looked quickly at her that is very clever of you you have touched on his great difference from father he is awfully impatient all this did lucy a great deal of good james thought that she had better call on mrs nugent he knew all about her chapter viii again the second time was in late february at the opera the walkuere of all operas in the world where passion of the suddenest is seen on its most radiant spring morning james who was dreadfully bored by wagner and only went because it was the thing to do and truly also because a man must be seen with his wife could not promise to be there dressed at such an unearthly hour as half past six james i say did not go with her but vowed to be there long before seven that he undertook so she went alone and sat as she always did half hidden behind the curtain of her box on the second tier the place was flooded with dark the great wonder began the amazing prelude with its brooding its surmisals its storms its pounding hooves remorselessly pursuing and flashes of the horn like the blare of lightning she surrendered herself and as the curtain rose settled down to drink with the eyes as well as with the ears for she was no musician and could only be deeply moved by this when she saw and heard it immediately absorbed her the music of preparation and suspense seemed to turn her bones to liquor and at this moment she again felt herself possessed by man's love the strong hand over her heart the passion of his hold the intoxication of the kiss to the accompaniment of shrill and wounded violins she yielded herself to this miracle of the dark she seemed to hear in a sharp whisper you darling she half turned she half swooned again she drank and she gave to drink the music speared up to the heights of bliss then subsided as the hold on her relaxed when she stretched out her hand for her lover's he was not near her she was alone the swift and poignant little drama may have lasted a minute but like a dream it had the suggestion of infinity about it transcending time as it defied place confused bemused she turned her attention to the stage determined to compose herself at all cost she sat very still and shivered she gave all her powers to her mind and succeeded by main effort insensibly the great drama doing down there resumed its hold and it was even with a slight shock that she became aware by and by of james sitting sedately by her with the eyeglass sharply set for diversion anywhere but on the scene again she remembered with secret amusement that she had not been conscious of the eyeglass when for reasons of his own he had paid his mysterious homage to love and her she kept a firm grip of herself she would not move an inch towards him she could never do that again but she passed him over the play bill and lifted the glasses to show him where they were she saw the eyeglass dip as he nodded his thanks and heard him whisper as he passed back the bill no good dark as the grave oh extraordinary james she suffered hysterical laughter but persisted against it and succeeded when the lights went up she afforded herself a gay welcome of him from gleaming happy and conscious eyes he met it blandly smiled awry and said you love it oh she sighed meaning all that she dared not say how i love it james said bravo i was very punctual you'll admit that very nearly overcame her but all she said was i didn't hear you come in or go out james looked very vague at that he was on the point of frowning over it but gave it up it was a lucyism he rose and touched his coat collar to feel that it gripped where it should let's see who's in the house he said and searched the boxes royalty as usual that's what i call devotion who's that woman in a snow leopard oh yes of course hullo i say my child will you excuse me i've just seen some people i ought to see there's lots of time and i won't be late and he was off a very remarkable lover indeed was james mrs nugent waved her hand across the parterre francis lingen knocked and entered she could afford that and presently a couple added themselves young married people whom she liked for their poverty hopefulness and unaffected pleasure in each other she made lingen acquainted with them and talked to young mr pierson he spoke with a cheer in his voice ripping opera madge adores it we saw your husband downstairs but i don't think he knew us and through her head blew the words like a searching wind you darling you darling oh that was great love small wonder that james saw nothing of the piersons and yet ah she must give up speculating and judging that had undone poor psyche young mr pierson chattered away about madge and wagner both ripping james returned bland positive dazzling the man of exclusive clubs was reminded of young mrs pierson with whom he shook hands of young mr pierson to whom he nodded and said ha and finally of francis lingen ha lingen you here francis shivered that seemed to him to ring a knell since when had he been lingen to james since this moment now why had james cold shouldered him was it possible that he had noticed too much devotion and if he had was it not certain that she must have noticed it he stopped midway of the stairs and passers by may have thought he was looking for a dropt sixpence not at all the earth seemed to be heaving beneath his feet but a wave of courage surged up through him pooh no woman yet ever disregarded the homage of a man he would send some roses to morrow without a card she would understand and so it went on wagner came back to his own on this occasion after this second great adventure lucy had no conflict with fate thankfully she took the gift of the god she took it as final as a thing complete in itself a thing most beautiful most touching most honourable to giver and recipient it revived all her warmth of feeling but this time without a bitter lees to the dram and she was immensely the better for it she felt in charity with all the world her attitude to james was one of clear sight oh now she understood him through and through she would await the fulness of time sufficient for the day was the light of the day she was happier than she had been for many years half term was approaching when she would be allowed to go down and see lancelot in these days she felt spring in the air february can be kind to us and show a golden threshold to march she had a letter from mabel telling her of mr urquhart's feats in the hunting field he's quite mad i think and mostly talks about you and lancelot he calls you proserpine as for his riding my dear it curdles the blood he doesn't ride he drives sits well back and accelerates on the near side he brought his own horses luckily for ours and his neck they seem to understand it he hunted every day but one and then he rushed up to town to keep some appointment and came back to a very late dinner driving himself in his motor he is a tempestuous person but can be very grave when he likes he talked beautifully one evening mostly about you lucy's eyes smiled wisely over this letter she liked to think that she could induce gravity upon a hunting party she had never quite approved of the peltry atmosphere hard riding seemed to involve hard living and hard swearing she had once heard laurence let himself go to some rider over hounds and had put him on a back shelf in her mind him and his peltry with him a prude no she was sure she was nothing of the sort but she liked people to keep a hold on themselves a gay little dinner party one of hers as she told james finished a month of high light the young pierson couple some warreners a mrs treveer and jimmy urquhart eight with themselves the faithful francis lingen was left out as a concession to james and love in the dark she noticed with quiet amusement how gratified james was he was so gratified that he did not even remark upon it now james's little weakness or one of them let us say was that he could not resist a cutting phrase when the thing did not matter therefore she reasoned francis lingen absurdly enough did matter that he should that anything of the sort should matter to james was one more sign to her of the promise just as the weather was one the spring was at hand and soon we should all go a maying so we dined at one table and had a blaze of daffodils from wycross and everybody seemed to talk at once pierson told her after dinner that madge thought urquhart ripping as she had thought wagner and certainly he was one to make a dinner party go he was ridiculous about laurence corbet and his sacred foxes don't shoot that thing god of heaven what are you about oh i beg your pardon i thought are you out of your senses that must be torn to pieces by dogs he was very good at simulating savagery but had a favourite trick of dropping it suddenly or turning it on himself he caught mrs treveer a lady of ardour not tempered by insight she agreed with him about hunting oh you are so right now can't something be done about it couldn't a little paper be written in that vein you know not by me said urquhart i'm a hunting man you see mrs treveer held up her fan but took no offence lucy with mabel's letter in mind gave her guest some attention but for the life of her could not see that he paid her any beyond what he had for the others or for his dinner he joined pierson at her side and made no effort to oust him he did not flatter her by recalling lancelot he seemed rather to muse out loud james with his coat tails to the fire was quite at his ease and when urquhart offered to drive her down to westgate for the half term which she herself mentioned it was james who said capital that will be jolly for you but you wouldn't come would you my child it is that i couldn't come a motor in march i should die besides he added as you know i have to be at brighton that sunday she had known it and she had known also that brighton was an excuse one of the bogies she kept locked in a cupboard was james's ennui when lancelot was to the fore could this too be jealousy i'll tell you what i'll do jimmy urquhart said the run down would be rather jolly but the run back in the dark might be a bore the nugents have got a house at sandwich why shouldn't you go there you know my sister nugent as they used to say yes of course i do lucy said but i couldn't really but she is there my dear ma'am that's the point i'll drop you there on my way back i wish i could stop too but that's not possible she'll arrange it james thought it an excellent plan but lucy had qualms odd that the visit of eros should a second time be succeeded by a motor jaunt to go motoring again with a mr urquhart oh but she owned that she was absurd james did not conceal his sarcasms she either fears her fate too much he quoted at her she pleaded with him darling she said and he was immensely complacent over that i suppose it's a sign of old age but after all why shouldn't i go by train or in our own car if it comes to that firstly said james through his eyeglass because urquhart asks you to go in his a terror that destroyeth in the noonday compared to ours and secondly because if you don't want it i should rather like to go to brighton in mine oh said she then you don't mind motoring in march not in a closed car said james and not to brighton this acted as an extinguisher of the warmer feelings let mr urquhart do his worst then chapter ix sundry romantic episodes a little cloud of witness assembled at will like seagulls out of the blue inane would come about her in after years that madly exhilarating rush to westgate for instance on a keen march morning and that sudden question of hers to urquhart what made you think of asking me and his laconic answer given without a turn of the head because i knew you would like it you did before you know and that was january there was one another connected with it was her going alone up to the schoolhouse and her flush of pleasure when lancelot said oh i say did he bring you down good then we'll go immediately and see the car perhaps it's a new one she could afford to recall that after a long interval they had had a roaring day all over the place as lancelot said afterwards to a friend and then there had been her parting with urquhart in the dark at the open door of queendon court aren't you going to stop no my dear she remembered being amused with that aren't you even coming in i am not good bye you enjoyed yourself oh immensely that's what i like he had said and pushed off as his own phrase went atop of that the return to james and to nothingness for nothing happened except that he had been in a good temper throughout which may easily have been because she had been in one herself until the easter holidays when he had been very cross indeed poor james to get him to begin to understand lancelot's bluntness intensity and passion for something or other did seem hopeless they were at wycross on her urgent entreaty and james was bored at wycross she sometimes thought because she loved it so much jealousy a man's wife ought to devote herself she should love nothing but her husband he had spent his days at the golf course not coming home to lunch urquhart was asked for a sunday on lancelot's account but couldn't come or said so at least then on the saturday when he should have been there james suddenly kissed her in the garden and of course in the dark she hadn't known that he was in the house yet he had contracted the habit of having tea at the club house and talking on till dark he did that as she believed because she always read to lancelot in the evenings she gave up the holidays entirely to him well lancelot that afternoon had been otherwise engaged with friends of a neighbour she had cried off on the score of seeing something of father at which lancelot had winked but james was not in to tea and at six and no sign of him she yielded to the liquid calling of a thrush in the thickening lilacs and had gone out there she stayed till it was dark in a favourite place a circular garden of her contriving with a pond and a golden privet hedge so arranged as to throw yellow reflections in the water standing there it grew perfectly dark deeply and softly dark the night had come down warm and wet like manifold blue black gauze she heard his quick light step her heart hammered but she did not move he came behind her clasped and held her close oh you've come i wondered oh how sweet how sweet and then my love had been said and she had been kissed in a moment he was gone she had stayed on motionless enthralled by the beauty of the act and when she had withdrawn herself at last and had tiptoed to the house she saw his lamp on the table and himself reading the spectator before a wood fire recalling all that she remembered the happy little breath of laughter which had caught her if it wasn't so perfectly sweet and beautiful it would be the most comic thing in the world she had said to herself a telegram from jimmy urquhart came that night just before dinner arriving to morrow say ten thirty for an hour or so urquhart it was sent from st james's street lancelot had said stout fellow and james took it quite well she herself remembered her feeling of annoyance how clearly she foresaw an interrupted reverie and a hampered sunday and also how easily he had falsified her prevision there had been an animated morning of garden inspection in the course of which she had shown him with a softly fluttering heart and perhaps enhanced colour the hedged oval of last night's romance a pony race a game of single cricket in the paddock lancelot badly beaten lunch and great debate with james about aeroplanes wherein lancelot showed himself a bitter and unscrupulous adversary of his parent finally the trial of the new car an engine of destruction such as lancelot had never dreamed of it was admittedly too high powered for england you were across the county in about a minute and then he had departed in a kind of thunderstorm of his own making lancelot preternaturally moved said to his mother i say mamma what a man eh she lightly yes isn't he wonderful and lancelot with a snort a man ten rather small men easily and james poor james saw nothing kissable in that it hadn't been till may of that year that lucy began to think about urquhart or rather it was in may that she discovered herself to be thinking about him mabel assisted her there mabel was in cadogan square for the season and the sisters saw much of each other now it happened that one day mabel had seen lucy with urquhart walking down bond street at noon or thereabouts and had passed by on the other side with no more than a wave of the hand it was all much simpler than it looked really because lucy had been to james's office which was in cork street and coming away had met jimmy urquhart in burlington gardens he had strolled on with her and was telling her that he had been waterplaning on chichester harbour and was getting rather bitten with the whole business of flight i'm too old i know but i'm still ass enough to take risks i think i shall get the ticket he had said what ticket the pilot's ticket or whatever they might call it i expect you are too old she had said and then how old are you by the way he told her we call it forty two exactly james's age and exactly ten years older than me yes too old i think i wouldn't he had laughed i'm certain i shall it appeals to me then he had told her the first time i saw a man flying i assure you i could have shed tears she remembered that this was out of his power odd thing what's gravitation to me or i to gravitation a commonplace whereby i walk the world never mind there was that young man breaking a law of this planet well that's a miracle i tell you i might have wept and then i said to myself my man you'll do this or perish then she and have you done it and he i have not but i'm going to she had suddenly said no please don't his quick look at her she remembered and the suffusion on his burnt face oh but i shall do you wish to know why because you don't mean it because you wouldn't like me if i obeyed you she said gravely you can't know that yes but i do you like me assume that lucy said you may and he i do you like me because i am such as i am if i obeyed you in this i should cease to be such as i am and become such as i am not and never have been you might like me more but you might not no that's too much of a risk i can't afford it she had said that's absurd but she hadn't thought it so mabel came to her for lunch and rallied her i saw you my dear but i wouldn't spoil sport all right you might do much worse he's very much alive anyhow he doesn't wear an then lucy was hurt oh mabel that's horrid you know i hate you to talk like that mabel stood rebuked it was beastly of me but you know i never could stand his eyeglass it is what they call anti social in their novels really you might as well live in the crystal palace then she held out her hand and lucy took it after some hesitation but mabel was irrepressible almost immediately she had jumped into the fray again with you're both going to his place in hampshire aren't you then lucy had flushed and mabel had given her a queer look that's all right she presently said he asked us you know but we can't i hear that vera nugent is to be hostess i rather liked her though of course you can never tell how such copious conversation will wear i don't think she stopped talking for a single moment laurence thought he was going mad it makes him broody you know like a hen he rubs his ears and says his wattles are inflamed it was either that day or another such day it really doesn't matter which day it was that mabel drifted into the subject of what she called the james romance did james had james and where were we standing now lucy whose feelings upon the subject were more complicated than they had been at first was not very communicative but she owned there had been repetitions mabel who was desperately quick to notice judged that she was mildly bored i see she said i see but that's all all cried lucy yes indeed mabel said again i see lucy who certainly didn't see was silent and then mabel with appalling candour said i suppose you would have it out with him if you weren't afraid to lucy was able to cope with that kind of thing nothing would induce me to do it i shouldn't be able to lift my head up if i did it would not only be well horrible but it would be very cruel as well i should feel myself a brute on mabel's shrug she was stung into an attack of her own and whatever you may say to me i know that you couldn't bring yourself to such a point no woman could do it who respected herself mabel had the worst of it in the centre but by a flanking movement recovered most of the ground she became very vague she said as if to herself after all you know you may be mistaken perhaps the less you say the better mistaken and the less you say lucy's grey eyes took intense direction please tell me what you mean my dear do you think i'm out of my senses do you really think i've imagined it all no no said mabel quickly and visibly disturbed no no of course i don't i really don't know what i meant it's all too confusing for simple people like you and me let's talk about something else lucy to whom the matter was distasteful agreed but the thought persisted mistaken and the less you say chapter x at a world's edge it was after that queer look after her too conscious blush that she began to envisage the state of her affairs she was going to martley thicket for whitsuntide it was an old engagement comparatively old that is she did want to go and now she knew that she did well how much did she want to go ought she to want it what had happened questions thronged her when once she had opened a window what did it matter to her whether urquhart qualified as an aviator or not what had made her ask him not to do it how had she allowed him to say assume that you like me the short dialogue stared at her in red letters upon the dark assume that you like me you may assume it i do she read the packed little sentences over and over and studied herself with care no honestly nothing jarred there was no harm she didn't feel any tarnish upon her and yet she was looking forward to martley thicket with a livelier blood than she had felt since easter when james had kissed her in the shrouded garden a livelier blood hazarding the looking glass she thought that she could detect a livelier iris too what had happened well of course the answer to that question was involved in another how much was she to assume how much did urquhart like her she hoped against conviction that she might have answered these questions before she met him again which would probably be at martley just now stoutly bearing her disapproval he was doubtless at byfleet or elsewhere risking his neck she answered a question possibly arising out of this by a shrewd smile of course i don't disapprove he knows that i shiver but i know he's perfectly right he may be sure the meeting at martley would at the very least be extremely interesting she left it there for the moment but having once begun to pay attention to such matters as these she pursued her researches in and out of season it was a busy time of year and james always laid great stress on what he called the duties of her station she must edge up crowded stairways behind him stand at his side in hot and humming rooms where the head spun with the effort not to hear what other people were saying so much more important always than what your partner was james's height and eyeglass seemed to give him an impartial air at these dreadful ceremonies behind his glass disk he could afford to be impertinent and he was certainly rude enough to be an under secretary without that shining buckler of the soul he would have been simply nobody with it he was a demi god here then under the very shadow of his immortality lucy pursued her researches what of the romantic hidden eponymous james where did he stand now in her regard since easter at wycross james had not been her veiled eros but the possibilities were all there he was not a garden god by any means nor a genius of the spring january and onslow square had not frozen his currents february and the opera house had heightened his passion at any moment he might resume his devotional habit even here in carlton house terrace and what then well and this was odd this ought to have produced a state of tension very trying to the nerves and well it hadn't that's all at that very party in carlton house terrace with a band braying under the stairs and a fat lord shouting in her ear her secret soul was trembling on a brink she was finding out to her half rueful dismay it was only half that she was prepared to be touched prepared to be greatly impressed but not prepared to be thrilled as she had been if james should kiss her again she was prepared in fact to present as statesmen do when they write to their sovereign her grateful humble duty and no more in vain the band brayed in vain lord j crimson by her ear roared about the weather in the west of ireland lucy's soul was peering over the edge of her old world into the stretches of a misty new one this was bad enough and occupied her through busy nights and days but there was more disturbing matter to come stirred up to cloud her mind by mabel's unwonted discretion mabel had been more than discreet she had been frightened pushing out into a stream of new surmise she had suddenly faltered and hooked at the quay lucy herself was at first merely curious she had no doubts certainly no fears what had been the matter with mabel when she hinted that perhaps after all james had never done anything what could mabel know or guess or suspect lucy owned to herself candidly that james was incomprehensible after thirteen years or was it fourteen suddenly with no warning symptoms to plunge into such devotion as never before when everything had been new and he only engaged men were like that when they were engaged they aren't certain of one and leave no chances but james even as an engaged man had always been certain he had taken her and everything else for granted she remembered how her sisters not only mabel but the critical agnes now mrs riddell in the north had discussed him and found him too cocksure to be quite gallant kissed her of course he had kissed her good heavens yes but not as he had that night at the opera you darling you darling now james had called her my darling as often as you please but never until then you darling there's a world of difference anybody can see it and then after the beautiful the thrilling the deeply touching episode the moment after it there was the old indifferent slightly bored james with the screwed eye and the disk not a hint not a ripple not the remains of a flush it was the most bewildering the most baffling jig saw of a business she had ever heard of you would have said that he was two quite separate people you might have said mabel would have said at once that james had had nothing to do with it but she had said so the discovery stabbed lucy in the eyes like a flash of lightning left her blind and quivering with a swim of red before her hurt vision that was why mabel had been frightened and now lucy herself was frightened francis lingen absurd mr urquhart ah that was quite another thing she grew hot she grew quite cold and suddenly she began to sob oh no no not that a flood of tossing thoughts came rioting and racing in flinging crests of foam like white and beaten water she for a time was swept about a weed in this fury of storm she was lost effortless at death's threshold but she awoke herself from the nightmare walked herself about and reason returned it was nonsense unwholesome nonsense why that first time he was in the library with james and francis lingen his second visit to the house why when she was at the opera he had been at peltry with the mabels and as for wycross he had wired from st james's in the afternoon and come on the next day absurd and thank god for it and poor francis lingen she could afford to laugh at that francis lingen was as capable of kissing the duchess of westbury at whose horrible party she had been the other night as herself she felt very safe and enormously relieved so much so that she could afford herself the reflection that if hardihood had been all that was wanting jimmy urquhart would have had plenty and to spare oh yes indeed but thank god again he was a gentleman if ever there was one nobody but a gentleman could afford to be so simple in dealing having worked all this out she felt that her feet at least were on solid ground a spirit of adventure was renewed in her and a rather unfortunate contretemps provoked it before she knew where she was she was up to the neck as urquhart would have said in a turbid stream francis lingen that elegant unfortunate was certainly responsible if you could call one so tentative and clinging responsible for anything he had proposed the flower show to which she had been as an earnest gardener early in the morning by herself with a note book she did not want to go with him at all and moreover she had an appointment to meet james at a wedding affair in queen's gate however being ridiculously amiable where the pale haired hectic was concerned go she did and sat about at considerable length he had only cared to look at the sweet peas his passion of the hour and urged a chair upon her that he might the better do what he really liked look at her and talk about himself so he did and read her a poem and made great play with his tenderness his dependence upon her judgment and his crosses with the world he pleaded for tea which ordered did not come then hunted for the motor which finally she found for herself she arrived late at queen's gate the eyeglass glared in horror james indeed was very cross what any chance victim of his neighbourhood may have endured is not to be known so far as lucy could see he did not open his mouth once while he was there he refused all nourishment with an angry gleam and seemed wholly bent upon making her self conscious uncomfortable and finally indignant upon this goodly foundation he reared his mountain of affront he made himself a monument of matter of fact impassivity during the drive home his arms were folded he stared out of window she thought once she heard him humming an air but he didn't smoke as he certainly would have done had relations been easy he kept her at a distance but not aggressively lucy was by this time very much annoyed her apologies had been frozen at the front by his angry glare she had no intention now of renewing them nor did she care to justify herself as she might have done by pointing out that while she was half an hour late he was probably a quarter of an hour too early this would have been a safe venture for his fussiness over an appointment and tendency to be beforehand with it were quite well known to himself she kept the best face she could upon the miserable affair but was determined that she would force a crisis at home come what might arrived at onslow square james strode into the library and shut the door behind him when crewdson was disposed of on his numerous affairs lucy followed her lord he turned he stared and waited for her to speak lucy said i think that you must be sorry that you have treated me so i feel it very much and must ask you how you justify it james did his best to an easy calm apologies should be in the air i should have looked for one myself an hour or so ago you should have had it she said if you had given me time but you stared me out of countenance the moment i came in anger before you had even heard me is not a nice thing to face james turned pale he used his most incisive tones i am ready to hear your explanation perhaps i had better say that i know it lucy showed him angry eyes if you know it there is no need for me to trouble you with it you must also know that it isn't easy to get away from a great crowd in a minute but he seemed not to hear her he had another whip in waiting which nothing could have kept him from the use of i think that i must trouble you rather i think i should be relieved by hearing from you where the crowd was of which you were one or two indeed she discovered that he was white with rage though she had never seen him so before what do you mean james she said and he i know that you were at the flower show you were there with lingen yes said lucy i was indeed and why shouldn't i be i have told you before this what my views are about that i don't intend to repeat them at present i think you must be mad said lucy do you mean to tell me that you object to francis lingen to that extent to the extent of such a scene as this he faced her from his height i do mean that then she said out of herself you are insulting me i don't think you can intend to do that and i should like to say also that you of all the men in the world are the last person to be jealous or suspicious of anybody where i am concerned she hadn't meant to say that but when she saw that he took it as a commonplace of marital ethics she determined to go further still he took it in fact just so it seemed to him what any wife would say to any indignant husband i beg your pardon he said you don't quite follow me i agree with you that i should be the last person but i beg to point out to you that i should also be the first person and i will go on to add if you will excuse me that i should be the only person no person at all said lucy has the right or the reason to suspect me of anything or to be jealous of any of my acquaintance you didn't understand me i suppose because you are too angry what i meant you to remember was how much how very much you are bound to believe in me now of all times in our life here then was a psyche with the lamp in her hand here was lucy on the limit of a world unknown here she stood at her feet the tufted grasses and field herbs dusty homely friendly things which she knew beyond her beyond the cliff's edge were the dim leagues of a land and sea unknown what lay out there beyond her in the mist what mountain and forest land lay there what quiet islands what sounding mains but it was done now james gazed blankly but angrily puzzled into her face i haven't the faintest notion what you mean he said evidently he had not she must go on though she hated it you are very surprising i can hardly think you are serious let me remind you of the opera of the walkuere he gave his mind to it explored the past and so entirely failed to understand her that he looked rather foolish i remember that we were there then he had a flash of light and shed it on her god knows i remember also that lingen was in the box oh lingen are you mad on do you not remember that you were there before lingen yes i do remember it he stood poor fool revealed lucy's voice rang clear very well if that is all that your memory brings you i have nothing more to say she left him swiftly and went upstairs in the possession of an astounding truth but rapt with it in such a whirlwind of wonder that she could do no more than clutch it to her bosom as she flew she sent out word that she was not coming down to dinner and locked herself in with her truth to make what she could of it chapter xi anteros macartney was no fool in his own world where a perfectly clear idea of what you want to do combined with a nonchalant manner of take it or leave it had always carried him through the intricacies of business if he was a fool in supposing that precisely the same armoury would defend him at home there is this excuse for him that lucy had encouraged him to suppose it when she dashed from the room at this recent moment he sat for some time with his eyes fixed upon his foolscap but presently found himself reading the same sentence over and over again without understanding one word in it he dropped the document rose and picked himself out a cigar with deliberation and attention disproportionate to the business he cut stabbed and lighted the cigar and stood by the mantelpiece smoking and gazing out of window he had overdone it he had stretched regime too far there had been a snap now just where had he failed was it with francis lingen perhaps he must admit though that some good had come out of the trouble he felt reassured about francis lingen because as he judged women don't get angry in cases of the kind unless the husband has nothing to be angry about he felt very world wise and shrewd as he propounded this women like their husbands to be jealous especially if they are jealous with reason because then they say to themselves well anyhow he loves me still i have him to fall back upon at all events capital he gave a short guffaw and resumed his cigar but lucy was angry obviously because he had wasted good jealousy on a mere fancy damn it he had overdone it the next thing if he didn't look out would be that she would give him something to be jealous of he must calm her there would be no difficulty in that no loss of prestige prestige that was the thing you wanted to maintain discipline be jiggered that might do mischief if you drove it too hard the fact was he was a little too sharp with lucy she was a dear gentle creature and no doubt one fell into the habit of pushing a willing horse he could see it all now perfectly he had been put out when he arrived at the marchants' too early she was not there and then that old fool vane with his saw your wife at the chelsea thing with lingen they looked very settled that had put the lid on that was how it was and he had been too sharp well one must make mistakes he wondered what she had meant about the opera why had she harped upon that string you were there before francis lingen she had said well and then she had been furious with him he had said i know that i was and she if that is all your memory brings you and off she went he smoked hard lifted his hand and dropped it smartly to his mantelpiece no that was a thing no man could fathom a lucyism quite clear to herself no doubt well he'd leave that alone the more one tried to bottom those waters the less one fished up but he would make peace with her after dinner he heard mrs macartney is not dining this evening she has a bad headache and doesn't wish to be disturbed received it with a curt nod and accepted it simply better to take women at their word her troubles would have simmered down by the morning whereas if he were to go up now one of two things either she'd be angry enough to let him batter at the door to no purpose and feel an ass for his pains or she would let him in and make a fuss in which case he would feel still more of an ass ask mrs macartney if i can do anything he had said to smithers and was answered i think mrs macartney is asleep sir he hoped she was that would do her a world of good morning in the breakfast room he faced a lucy self possessed with guarded eyes and if he could have seen it with implied reproach stiffening every line of her her generosity gratified him but should have touched him keenly she came to him at once and put up her face i'm sorry i was so cross james his immediate feeling i say was one of gratification that was all right she had come in to that succeeded a wave of kindness he dropped his glass and took her strongly in his arms dearest i behaved very badly i'm truly sorry he kissed her and for a moment she clung to him but avoided his further kisses yet he had kissed her as a man should she had nothing more to say but he felt it her due that he should add something while yet he held her as for poor francis i know that i was absurd i admit it frankly he felt her shake and guessed her indignation you'll believe me dear you know i don't like owning myself a fool then she had looked up still in his arms why should you be so stupid how can you possibly be you of all people there she was again but he intended to make peace once and for all my dearest i can't be more abject for the life of me i have confessed that i was an abounding ass please to believe in me ask francis lingen to tea for a month of days and not a word from me she had laughed rather scornfully and tried to free herself he kissed her again before he let her go almost immediately he resumed his habits eyeglass morning post and scraps of comment he made an effort and succeeded he thought in being himself johnny mallet gives another party at the bachelors to day i believe i go has he asked you he means to he's a tufthunter but he gets tufts i see that the fathers in god are raving about the tithe bill i shall have jasper mellen at me and the dean too do you remember did you ever hear i wonder of box and cox they have a knack of coming to me on the same day once they met on the doorstep and each of them turned and fled away it must have been very comic lucy busied herself with her letters and her coffee cups she wished that she did not feel so ruffled but a walk would do her good she would go into the park presently and look at the tulips and lilacs it was horrid to feel so stuffy on such a perfect day how long to whitsuntide that was to be heavenly if james didn't get inspired by the dark something would have to be prepared for that in her eyes sedate though they were there lurked a gleam the beacon fire of a woman beleaguered certainly jimmy urquhart liked her he had said that she liked him well and so she did very much indeed james went forgiven to his bishops and deans and to lunch with his johnny mallet and the tufted lucy her household duties done arrayed herself for the tulips of the park the grey watches of the night with their ache and moments of panic the fever and fret the wearing down of rage and emptying of wonder and dismay the broken snatches of dream sleep and the heavy slumber which exhaustion finally gave her all this had brought downstairs to be kissed embraced and forgiven a lucy disillusioned and tired to death but schooled to patience her conclusion of the whole matter now was that it was james who had indeed loved her in the dark with an access of passion which he had never shown before and could drop apparently as fitfully as he won to it and also with a fulness of satisfaction to himself which she did not pretend to understand it was james and no other simply because any other was unthinkable such things were not done jimmy urquhart and what other could she imagine it was out of the question she had finally brushed him out as a girl flecks the mirror in a cotillon it was james but why he had been so moved how moved how so lightly satisfied how his conduct at other times could be fitted in really it didn't matter two straws it meant nothing but a moment's silliness it led to nothing it mended nothing and it broke nothing her soul was her own her heart was her own it was amiable of him she dared say but had become rather a bore she conceived of a time at hand when she might have to be careful that he shouldn't but just now she wouldn't make a fuss anything but that he was within his rights she supposed and let it rest at that so arrayed she faced him and to let nothing be omitted on her part she herself apologised for what had been his absurd fault and so won as much from him as he could ever have given anybody as for francis lingen she had not once given him a thought now however james away to his bishops she arrayed herself anew and went out fraiche et dispose into the park intending that she should see urquhart and so she did he was on horseback and dismounted the moment he saw her he was glad to see her she could tell but did not insist upon his gladness he admired her she could see but took his admiration as a matter of course she wore champagne colour she had snakeskin shoes a black hat she was excited and had colour her eyes shone well he said here you are then that's a good thing i began to give you up how did you know she stopped and bit her lip i didn't but i'm very glad to see you you look very well where are you going she nodded her direction tulips just over there i always pilgrimise them all right let us pilgrimise them tulips are like a drug a little is exquisite and you are led on excess brings no more enchantment only nausea you buy a million and plant your woodland and the result is horror a hundred would have been heavenly that's what i find she had mockery in her look gleams of it shot with happiness to be there is that what you've done at martley i shan't praise you when i see it i hate too muchness so do i but always too late i ought to learn from you whose frugality is part of your charm one can't imagine too much lucy ah don't be sure she cautioned him ask james i shall i'm quite equal to that i'll ask him to day he's to be at an idiotic luncheon to which i'm fool enough to be going marchionesses and all the rest of it how can you go to such things when you might be flying earning your displeasure oh i know i know i didn't know how to refuse mallet he seemed to want me i was flattered as a matter of fact i have flown alone good lord no i had an expert there he let me have the levers i had an illusion but i always do do tell me your illusion i thought that i could sing you did sing i'm sure i might have one miracle the more as for the machine it wasn't a machine it was a living spirit a male spirit or a female spirit female i think anyhow i addressed it as such what did you say to her i said 'you darling' that startled her if you like she looked frightened then coloured deeply urquhart seemed full of his own thoughts how's lancelot he asked her that helped her oh he delights me another 'living spirit' he never fails to ask after you stout chap he harps on your story the first you ever told us this time he put in his postscript 'how is wives and co' he nodded very good i begat an immortal that tale will never die he'll tell it to his grandchildren they stood or strolled at ease by the railings she within them he holding his horse outside them the tulips were adjudged names taken colours approved you'll see mine he said in ten days do you realise that she was radiant i should think so that has simply got to happen are you going to have other people there vera he said and her man and i rather think considine her man's brother fat and friendly with a beard and knows a good deal about machines one way and another i want his advice about hydroplanes among other things you'll like him why shall i like him because he's himself he has no manners at all only feelings nice feelings that's much better than manners yes i dare say they are she thought about it there's a difference between manner and manners oh rather the more manner you have the less manners yes i meant that but even manners don't imply feelings do they i was going to say never but that wouldn't be true you have charming manners your feelings' clothes and a jolly good fit how kind you are she was very pleased now you what shall i say you might say that i have no manners and not offend me i have no use for them but i have feelings sometimes nice sometimes horrid i am sure that you couldn't be horrid don't be sure he said gravely i had rather you weren't i have done amiss in my day much amiss and i shall do it again she looked gently at him her mouth showed the luini compassion long drawn and long suffering because it understood don't say that i don't think you mean it he shook his head but did not cease to watch her oh but i mean it when i want a thing i try to get it when i see my way i follow it it seems like a law of nature and i suppose it is one what else is instinct yes she said but i suppose we have feelings in us so that we may realise that other people have them too yes yes or that we may give them to those who haven't got any of their own they had become grave and he at least moody lucy dared not push enquiry she had the ardent desire to help and the instinct to make things comfortable on the surface which all women have and which makes nurses of them but she discerned trouble ahead urquhart's startling frankness had alarmed her before and she didn't trust herself to pass it off if it flashed once too often flashes like that lit up the soul and not of the lamp holder only they parted with unwillingness on both sides at prince's gate and lucy sped homewards with feet that flew as fast as her winged thoughts that you darling was almost proof positive and yet he had been at peltry that night and yet he couldn't have dared now even as she uttered that last objection she faltered for when daring came into question what might he not dare remained the first he had been at peltry she knew because she had been asked to meet him there and had refused on the opera's account besides she had heard about his riding horses as if they were motors and here she stood still and found herself shaking that letter in that letter of mabel's about his visit to peltry had there not been something of a call to london and return late for dinner and the opera began at half past six what was the date of his call to london could she find that letter and should she hunt for it or leave it vague and then she thought of martley and then she blushed chapter xii martley thicket urquhart was a man of explosive action and had great reserve of strength he was moved by flashes of insight and was capable of long sustained flights of vehement effort but his will power was nourished entirely by those moments of intense prevision which showed him a course and all the stages of it the mistakes he made and they were many and grievous were mostly due to overshooting his mark sometimes to underrating it in the headlong and not too scrupulous adventure he was now upon both defects were leagued against him when he first saw lucy at her dinner party he said to himself that's a sweet woman i shall fall in love with her to say as much was proof that he had already done so but it was the sudden conviction of it which inspired him filled him with effervescent nonsense and made him the best of company for a dinner party throughout it at his wildest and most irresponsible his fancy and imagination were at work upon her he read her to the soul or thought so chance and lancelot gave him the chart of the terrain the switch at the drawing room door gave him his plan the opportunity came and he dared to take it he marked the effect upon her it was exactly what he had foreseen he saw her eyes humid upon macartney her hand at rest on his arm jesuitry palliated what threatened to seem monstrous even to him god bless her i drive her to her man what's the harm in that so he went on once more and yet again and in the meantime by daylight and by more honest ways he gained her confidence and her liking he saw no end to the affair so prosperously begun and didn't trouble about one all he cared about just now were two courtships the vicarious in the dark and the avowed of the daylight he intended to go on he was full of it in the midst of his other passions of the hour such as this of the air he was certain of his direction as certain as he had ever been but now his mistakes and miscalculations began he had mistaken his lucy and his macartney too what he didn't know about macartney lucy did know what he didn't know about lucy was that she had found out james james as eros wouldn't do chiefly because such conduct on james's part would have been incredible urquhart didn't know it would be incredible nor did he know that she did one other thing he didn't know which was that lucy was half his own before she started for martley she in fact didn't know it either she had been his from the moment when she had asked him to keep out of the air and he had declined all this is necessary matter because in the light of it his next deliberated move in his game was a bad mistake on the night before she was expected at martley being there himself he wrote her a letter to this effect dear mrs macartney to my dismay and concern i find that i can't be here to receive you nor indeed until you are on the point to go away i shall try hard for sunday which will give me one day with you better to me than a thousand elsewhere vera will be my curate nothing will be omitted which will show you how much martley owes you or how much i am present or absent yours j u that letter he gave to vera nugent to deliver to lucy vera wanted to know what it was all about it's to say that i can't be here he said that is the fact unfortunately why my dear jimmy i thought you adored her isn't the poor lady the very latest my dear girl i do adore her leave it at that it's an excellent reason for not being here the best but i'm going up with a star which is another reason and i hope to be here on sunday which is the most i can afford myself really that's all but you like her you say or you should i do like her she's not very talkative to me but listens well considine will like her listeners are rare with him poor dear but you move me i didn't know you were so far gone never mind how far i am gone provided that i go said urquhart oh at this rate i will hasten you i can't be bothered with a cause celebre but what am i to tell the lady you must be practical my fine man tell her that i was sent for in a hurry hint at the air if you think proper i think i have said all that is necessary in the note the macartneys were expected to lunch urquhart left his house at noon driving himself in a motor he disappeared in the forest but didn't go very far james heard of his host's defection with impassivity and a glance of his eyeglass wonder what jimmy has shied off for he said to lucy through the dressing room door aeroplaning or royalty do you think the s may have sent for him i know he knows them but it's characteristic he makes a fuss about you so that you think you're his life or death and then you find out not at all you simply don't exist that's all what do you think i don't think that we don't exist she said i think that something important has happened oh well said james one had got into the way of thinking that one was important oneself d d cool i call it there had been a moment when lucy knew anger but that had soon passed she knew that she was bitterly disappointed and found a rueful kind of happiness in discovering how bitterly she had reached the stage where complete happiness seems to be rooted in self surrender in a curious kind of way the more she suffered the more surely she could pinch herself on the chin and say my dear you are caught there was comfort in this and martley itself house gardens woodlands the lake the vistas of the purple wolds of forest country all contributed to her enchaining luncheon passed off well under vera nugent's vivacious brown eyes which could not penetrate the gentle mask of lucy's manner nugent the husband was a sleepy good humoured giant lord considine whose beard was too long and jacket sleeves much too short as were his trousers his so called trousers as james put it in his scorn talked fiercely about birds' nests and engaged lucy for the whole afternoon this was not allowed him by his sister in law who had other more sociable plans but the good man had his pleasure of a docile listener after tea took her for a great walk in the woods and exhibited nearly all his treasures though as he said she should have been there six weeks earlier alas if she had been she would have had a more open mind to give to the birds and their affairs after dinner when they were on the terrace under the stars he returned to his subject there were nightingales it seemed what did mrs macartney say to that it appeared that six miles away the nightingale was an unknown fowl here of course they were legionaries you might hear six at a time two triangles of them did she know that they sang in triangles she did not very well then what did she say what about shoes a cloak a shawl all these things could be brought lucy said that she would fetch them for herself and went upstairs shallow broad stairs of black oak very much admired by the experts but of them and their excellence she had no thought she did not care to let her thoughts up to the surface just then adventure beckoned her when she returned nugent had withdrawn himself to the smoking room and james was talking to vera nugent about people one knew neither of them was for nightingales you are very foolhardy james said i can't help you with nightingales lord considine in a black spanish cloak with the staff of a pilgrim to compostella offered his arm we'll go first to the oak spinney he said it's rather spongy i'm afraid but who minds a little cold water vera assured him that she did for one and james added that he was rather rheumatic come along mrs macartney said the lord these people make me sorry for them so they went down the steps and dipped into the velvet night it was barely dark skirting the lake you could almost see the rings made by rising trout and there was enough of you visible at least to send the waterfowl scuttering from the reeds beyond that again you could descry the pale ribbon of the footpath and guess at the exuberant masses of the peony bushes their heavy flowers when they were white still smouldering with the last of the sunset's fire but once in the woods you had to feel your way and the silence of it all like the darkness was thick had a quality which you discovered only by the soft close touch of it upon your cheeks and eyes it seemed to clog the ears and made breathing a deeper exercise the further in they went the greater the guesswork of the going lord considine went in front to keep the branches from her face upon that rich heavy silence the first birds' song stole like a sense of tears the low tentative pensive note which seems like the welling of a vein lucy stayed and breathlessly listened the doubtfulness the strain of longing in it chimed with her own mood which was one perhaps of passive wonderment she waited as one who is to receive she was not committed but she was prepared everything was to come the note was held it waxed it called and then broke as it were into a fountain of crystal melody thereafter it purred of peace it floated and stopped short as if content but out of the dark another took up the song and further off another provoking our first musician to a new stave lucy with parted lips held her heart love was in this place overshadowing her her sightless eyes were wide waiting upon it and it came she heard a step in the thicket she stayed without motion will or thought expectans expectavit she was in the strange arms and the strange kisses were on her parted lips she knew not nor cared how long this rapture held she got and she gave james or another this was eros who had her now she heard oh lucy oh my love my love and she thought to have answered you have me what shall i do but she had no reply to her question and seemed to have no desire unsatisfied lord considine's voice calling i say shall we go on or do you think you had better go in sounded a very homely note her eros still held her even as she answered perhaps we had better turn back now i could stop out forever on such a night it has been more beautiful than i can say approval of the sentiment expressed was stamped upon her for a moment of wild surrender she clung as she kissed then she was gently relinquished and the lord was at hand there's nothing quite like it is there he said i've heard astounding orchestras of birds in south america but nothing at all like this which moreover seems to me at its best in england in granada up there in the wellington elms they absolutely mind mind here's a briar root they shout at you there's a brazen hardihood about them in athens too in the king's garden it is a kind of clamour of sound like an arab wedding no no i say that we are unrivalled for nightingales the enthusiastic man galloped on and lucy throbbing in the dark was grateful to him the lights of the house recalled her to the world presently up the slope she saw vera nugent at the piano turning to say something to somebody it was james rather bored in an arm chair james liked neither the society of women nor the notes of a piano but he liked still less for such things to be known of him his own social standard may perhaps be put thus he liked to appear bored without boring his companions on the whole he flattered himself that high as it was he nearly always reached it where's my beautiful young brother said lord considine plunging in upon them asleep i'll take my oath my dear vera you are too easy with him the man is getting mountainous you two little know what you've missed hey mrs macartney he was obviously overheated but completely at ease with himself what do you say we have missed vera asked of james and he now on his feet said bravely for myself a nasty chill a chill out there lucy was asked did she like it all and boldly owned all the dark is like an eiderdown bed impossible to imagine anything softer she rubbed her eyes it has made me dreadfully sleepy she said i think if you won't be horrified vera said that she should go up with her james stooped to her cheek lord considine bowed over her hand in lucy's room the pair had a long talk all of which i don't pretend to report it began with i'm so glad that you take to poor considine you are so very much his sort of woman he's a dear simple creature far too good for most of us and a nugent freak i assure you they've never known the like in the county of cork i like him immensely but of course he's too remote for the like of me no small talk you know and i'm aburst with it i talk while i'm thinking and he when he has thought you understand that kind evidently i suppose your clever husband is like that not that i don't get on with him we did excellently i think he knew everybody that i could think of and i everybody he chose to mention but jimmy likes considine you know by the way it was very disgraceful of jimmy but not so disgraceful as you might think in its way it's a compliment he thinks so much of you oh i may as well tell you the shocking truth he ran away what a moth in the drawing room ought to do but never can jimmy not at all a moth quite suddenly did my dear mrs macartney jimmy ran away from you flying i doubt it profoundly wrestling i fancy fighting beasts at ephesus you have doubtless discovered how enthusiastic jimmy is most attractive no doubt but sometimes embarrassing as once when we were in naples in the funicolare halfway up vesuvius jimmy sees a party at the other end of the carriage mother daughter two pig tailed children and a governess quite a pretty gel jimmy was enormously struck with this governess he could see nothing else and nobody else either least of all me of course he muttered and rolled his eyes about his chin jutted like the bow of a destroyer presently he couldn't stand it he marched across the carriage and took off his hat with a bow my dear to the governess poor gel 'i beg your pardon' says he 'but i have to tell you something i think you are the most beautiful person i ever saw in my life and take pride in saying so' wasn't it awful i didn't dare look at them but it seemed all right afterwards i suppose she told her people that of course he was mad so he is in a way but it's quite nice madness i won't say that jimmy never goes too far but nobody could be nicer about it afterwards than jimmy no one he's awfully sorry and contrite and all that most people like him amazingly i suppose he's told you about our father he loves all the stories there are about him and so on vera nugent was a great talker lucy at her prayers lucy in her bed had large gaps in the sequence of her thoughts safety lay only with lancelot she could centre herself in him lancelot it was who with forceful small fingers and half shy half sly eyes finally closed down hers with a go to sleep you tired mamma chapter xiii martley thicket the day that succeeded was prelude to the night sufficient to show lucy her way into that spacious unknown by her own desire she passed it quietly and had leisure to review and to forecast she put it to herself roughly thus i may guess but i don't know who loves me so it cannot continue it shall stop this very night but this one night i must go to him if only to say that it can never be again and it won't be again i am sure of that however he may take it whatever he may be driven to he will do what i say must be as for me i don't think women can ever be very happy i expect i shall get used to it one does to almost anything except toothache and i have lancelot she put all this quite frankly to herself not shirking the drab outlook or the anguish of doing a thing for the last time always a piercing ordeal for her as for james if she thought of him at all it was with pity poor dear he really was rather dry she ought to have been very angry with urquhart but she was not the first time he did it i understand i am sure he had a sudden thought and couldn't resist it it must have been more than half fun and the rest because it was so romantic the other times were much more wrong but i'm not angry with him i ought to be but i'm not not at all i suppose that is because i couldn't be angry with him if i tried not if he did much more no i am sure he doesn't hold me cheap he's not at all like that james might only james holds all women cheap but he doesn't i never felt at all like this about a man before only it must stop after this once you see he had not kindled passion in her even if there were any to be kindled lucy with a vehement imagination lacked initiative you could touch her in a moment if you knew how or if you were the right person now urquhart had never touched though he had excited her to be touched you must respond to a need of hers much more that than have a need of your own and to be the right person you must be empowered according to lucy urquhart was not really empowered but an usurper of course he didn't know that he reasoned hastily and superficially he thought her to be like most women struck by audacity what really struck her about him were his timeliness he had responded to a need of hers when he had first kissed her and his rare moments of tenderness you darling oh if james could only have said that instead of my darling poor james what a goose he was it was a very peaceful day james and nugent had driven out to play golf on some first class course or other by the sea lord considine was busy with his secretary over a paper for the british association in the afternoon he promised lucy sight of two golden orioles and kept his promise she had leisure to look about her and find traces of urquhart in much that was original and more that was comfortable and intimate in martley thicket it was a long two storeyed house of whitewashed brick with a green slate roof intermixed with reed thatch deep eaved and verandahed along the whole south front the upper windows had green persanes the house stood on the side of a hill was terraced and looked over a concave of fine turf into a valley down whose centre ran the lake at whose bottom was the wood and beyond that the moors and beech masses of the forest beside the house and behind it was a walled kitchen garden white walled with a thatch atop on the other side were stables kennels and such like everything was grown to the top of its bent but there was nothing very rare no frills said lord considine and approved of it all i dare say a woman would beautify it but it would cease to be jimmy's and would cease to be interesting too she would have more flowers and fewer shrubs now jimmy knows enough about it to understand that shrubs and trees are the real test of gardening anybody can grow flowers but shrubs want science lucy felt rebuked she had desiderated more flowers james who knew nothing and cared little about gardens passed approval of the house and offices it doesn't smell of money he said and yet you see what a lot it means when you look into it success in fact without visible effort one of james's high standards he didn't know how jimmy got his money but had no doubts at all of its being there a man who could lend francis lingen l without a thought must be richissime yet jimmy had no men servants in the house and james glared about him for the reason lucy had a reason i suppose you know he wants to be really comfortable she proposed and james transferred his mild abhorrence to her comfortable without a fellow to put out his things he scoffed at her but she was rather short with him even testy my dear james mr urquhart's things are things to be put on or taken off like lord considine's 'so called clothes' to you they seem to be robes of ceremony or sacrificial vestments james stared rather through than at her as if some enemy lurked behind her my clothes seem to annoy you may i suggest that somebody must get the mud off them and that i had rather it wasn't me as for ceremony but she had gone james shrugged her out of mind and wondered vaguely if she was rather attracted by jimmy urquhart it was bound to be somebody at her age thirty two she must be when they begin to like a fling well there was nothing in it later on it occurred to him that she was looking uncommonly well just now he saw her in white cross the lawn a springy motion a quick lift turn of the head she looked a girl and a pretty one at that his heart warmed to her how could a man have a better wife than that success without effort again there it was the evening came the close of a hot and airless day the sun set heavy and red a bluish mist seemed to steal out of the forest and shroud the house the terrace was not used after dinner and when the men joined vera and her in the drawing room lord considine who had proposed a game of chess to james at the table now came forward with board and box of men nugent as usual had disappeared he's dormant when there's no hunting his wife explained he has nothing to kill and hates his fellow creatures then said james he might kill some of them i could furnish him with a rough list lucy felt restless and strayed about the room looking at things here and there without seeing them vera watched her saw her wander to the open window and stand there looking gravely into the dark she said nothing and presently lucy stepped out and disappeared vera with raised eyebrows and a half smile resumed her book lucy was now high hearted on her quest her quest and mission it was to be this once and for the last time she followed the peony path from the lake to the thicket entered among the trees and pushed her way forward long before she reached the scene of last night's wonder she was a prisoner her lips a prize there was very little disguise left now for a full time they clung together and loved without words but then he spoke so you came i hoped i waited i thought that you might oh my lucy what a fact for me she answered simply and gently i came i had to come but well my love ah she said but this must be for the last time this was not taken as she had meant it to be love began again then he said that's absurd no no she protested it's right it must be so you would not have me do anything else and i must go yes indeed you must go now not yet lucy soon no at once she told him the last time is come and gone you must not keep me let me talk to you so for a few minutes there's everything to say no she said tell me nothing i dare not know it please let me go now a last time then lucy she yielded her lips but unwillingly for now her mind was made up the thing had to be done and the sooner the better ah he said how can i let you go easily she answered when i ask you and was unanswerable she forced herself free and stood undecided you needn't go back yet he said but she thought she must i came out alone she told him but vera was in the room so were the others i don't know what they will think nothing at all he said well everything shall be as you wish you see that you have only to name your wish i have one thing to ask you i dare not ask any more she said her voice had a wavering sound ask he said and i'll tell you the truth you don't think it wicked of me to have come because i did come i thought that i must because because i could never explain at any other time in any other way you don't think lightly of me oh my dear my dear he said and she felt him tremble though he did not touch her i think more dearly of you than of anything in heaven the world holds no other woman for me so it will always be she said quietly it's very wonderful i don't understand it at all i thought perhaps i wondered if i had been angry i deserve that and more i know i ought to be angry so i should be if well my love well but she couldn't tell him and asked him to let her go they parted at the entry of the wood with good night and lucy flitted back with a pain in her heart like the sound of wailing but women can wail at heart and show a fair face to the world her stretched smile had lost none of its sweetness her eyes none of their brightness vera nugent watched her narrowly and led the conversation upstairs she thought that she detected a pensive note but assured herself that all was pretty well that's a remarkable woman she said to herself who would rather have a heartache now than grin with misery next week after this i'd trust her anywhere on sunday morning urquhart made an explicit return to martley arriving at the hour of eleven in his motor of battleship grey colour and formidable fore extension behind it looked rather like a toy lucy had gone to church alone for james never went and vera nugent simply looked appealing and then laughed when she was invited that was her way of announcing her religion and a pleasant one lord considine was out for the day with sandwiches bulging his pockets nugent had been invisible since overnight he was slugging said his wife returning staidly through the wood she saw urquhart waiting for her at the wicket and saw him be it owned through a veil of mist but it was soon evident from his address that the convention set up was to be maintained the night was to take care of itself the day was to know nothing of it officially his address was easy and light hearted am i to be forgiven can i expect it let me tell you that i do expect it you know me better than to suppose that i didn't want to be here on your first visit she answered him with the same spirit i think you might have been i must say no i couldn't there was no doubt about it i simply had to go so vera told me then she dared may i ask if you went far he tipped his head sideways too far for my peace of mind anyhow that tells me nothing i am not to know any more you are to know what you please well she said i please to forget it now i had better tell you how much i love martley james says that the house is perfect in its way but i say that you have done justice to the site and think it higher praise it is i'm much obliged to you the problem was not to enhance the site for that was out of the question rather to justify the impertinence of choosing to put any building there because of course you see that any house is an impertinence in a forest yes of course but not yours urquhart shrugged i'm not afraid of your flatteries because i know he said the most that can be said for me is that i haven't choked it up with scarlet and orange flowers there's not a geranium in the place and i haven't even a pomegranate in a tub though i might oh no she said warmly there's nothing finicky about your garden any more than there is about you there was never such a man of direction at least i never met one the moment she had said it she became embarrassed but he took no notice his manner was perfect they returned by the lake and stayed there a while to watch nugent trying to catch trout the rest of the day she spent in urquhart's company who contrived with a good deal of ingenuity to have her to himself while appearing to be generally available after dinner feeling sure of him she braved the tale bearing woods and nightingales vocal of her sweet unease there was company on this occasion but she felt certain it would not have been otherwise had they been retired with the night she was thoughtful and quiet and really her heart was full of complaining he was steadily cheerful and affected a blunt view of life at large she did not look forward to leaving him on the morrow and as good as said so i have been enchanted here she said and hate the thought of london but james won't hear of wycross in june he loves the world urquhart said what are you going to do in august wycross no we never go there in august it's too hot and there's lancelot a boy must have excitement i expect it will come to my taking him to the sea unless james consents to scotland we used to do that but now well he's bored there he was looking at her she felt though she couldn't see him did you ever go to norway she shook her head he said no more on that head just then i shall see you in london he told her i am going to take my certificate at brooklands next week i hope you might come and applaud no indeed said she i couldn't bear to see you in those conditions i have nerves if you have none i have plenty he said but you ought to do it some day you will have to face it why shall i he wouldn't tell her that made her daring why shall i his first answer was a steady look his second nothing stops you know things all swim to a point ebb and flow they don't go back until they reach it and then and then they may or they may not blot it out and swim on chapter xiv the great scheme the height of her esteem for urquhart was the measure of her growing disrelish for james it was hard to visit upon a man the sense that he was not what he had never dreamed of being but that is what happened to him by how much he had risen in her eyes when she made an eros of him by so much did he fall when she found out her mistake because he was obviously no eros was he so obviously but part of a man it seemed so indeed if he discerned it there's no wonder he irritated her she found herself instinctively combating his little preparations for completeness of effect she was herself all for simplicity in these days she could not conceal her scorn for instance when he refused to go with her to dine in a distant suburb because he would not have time to dress as if she said you eat your shirt front trenchancy from james produced a silent disapproval as he said if she didn't sniff she looked as if she felt a cold coming on she knew it herself and took great pains but it coloured her tone if not her words too often she was merely silent when he was very much himself silence is contagious they passed a whole dinner through without a word sometimes now james had his feelings and was rather unhappy over what he called her moods he thought she did not go out enough she ought to see more people a woman liked to be admired it did not occur to him that she might have been very glad of it from him but then he didn't know how highly she had been elated with what she called thinking it really so his love in the darkness no macartney if ever he looked into himself found nothing wrong there he kept a wary eye through his masking glass upon urquhart's comings and goings as far as he could ascertain he was rarely in london during june and early july no doubt he wrote to lucy james was pretty sure of it yet he could not stoop to examining envelopes and had to leave that to providence and herself he mingled with his uneasiness a high sense of her integrity which he could not imagine ever losing it was or might have been curious to observe the difference he made between his two jealousies he had been insolent to francis lingen with his ha lingen you here he was markedly polite to jimmy urquhart much more so than his habit was he used to accompany him to the door when he left an unheard of attention but that may have been because lucy went thither also as a matter of fact urquhart saw very little of her he was very much away on his aerial and other affairs and did not care to come to the house unless james was there nor naturally very much when he was they mostly met in the park rarely at other people's houses once she lunched at the nugents' and had the afternoon alone with him twice he drove her to kew gardens once she asked him for a week end to wycross and they had some talks and a walk he wrote perhaps once a week and she answered him perhaps once a fortnight not more she had to put the screw on herself to outdo him in frugality she respected him enormously for his mastery of himself and could not have told how much it enhanced her love it was really comical that precisely what she had condemned james for she found admirable in jimmy james had neglected her for his occupations and jimmy was much away about his in the first case she resented in the second she was not far from adoration of such a sign of serious strength they never alluded directly to what had happened but sometimes hinted at it these hints were always hers for urquhart was a random talker said what came into his head and had no eye for implications he made one odd remark and made it abruptly as if it did not affect anybody present it's a very funny thing he said that last year i didn't know macartney had a wife and now six months later i don't realise that you have got a husband it made her laugh inwardly but she said gently try to realise it it's true you wish me to make a point of it he asked her that with a shrewd look i wish you naturally to realise me as i am there doesn't seem much of you involved in it he said but she raised her eyebrows patiently it is a fact and the fact is a part of me besides there's lancelot oh he said i don't forget him you needn't think it he is a symbol of you and almost an emanation put it like this that what you might have been he is oh said she do you want me to be different he laughed bless you no but i like to see what you gave up to be made woman and i see it in your boy she was impelled to say what she said next by his words which excited her i can't tell you and perhaps i ought not how happy you make me by loving lancelot i love him so very much and james never has i can't make out why but it was so from the beginning that was the first thing which made me unhappy in my life at home it was the beginning of everything he seemed to lose interest in me when he found me so devoted urquhart said nothing immediately then he spoke slowly macartney is uneasy with boys because he's uneasy with himself he is only really interested in one thing and he can see that they are obviously uninterested in it you mean she began and did not finish i do said urquhart most men are like that at bottom only some of us can impose ourselves upon our neighbours more easily than he can half the marriages of the world break on that rock and the other half on idleness she then confessed do you know what i believe in my heart i believe that james's eyeglass stands in his way with lancelot as it certainly did with me i think you are right there he agreed but you must allow for it he's very uncertain of his foothold and that's his war armour she was more tolerant of james after that conversation and less mutinous against her lot she wondered of course what was to become of them how long she could hold him at arms' length how she could bring herself to unsay what had been said in the dark of martley thicket but she had boundless faith in urquhart and knew among other things that any request she made him would be made easy for her but when at the end of june he broached to her his great scheme she was brought face to face with the situation and had to ask herself could she be trusted that he could she knew very well he had a project for a month or six weeks in norway he had hinted at it when she was at martley but now it was broached he didn't disguise it that his interest lay wholly in her coming he laid it before her she lancelot and james were to be the nucleus he should ask the corbets and their boys vera and hers nugent would refuse he knew meantime what did she say he watched her shining eyes perpending saw the gleam of anticipated delight what a plan but then she looked down hesitating something must now be said oh of course lancelot would go mad with joy and i dare say i could persuade james well but you i should live every moment of the time but sometimes life seems to cost too much he held out his hand to her and she took it very simply promise to come and you shan't repent it mind you have my word on that then he let her go and they discussed ways and means she would speak to james then he should come and dine and talk it out meantime let him make sure of vera and do his best with the corbets if they were fixed up as she thought probable he might get some other people considine might like it he's very much at your disposal let me tell you you have him at your feet so it was settled and james was attacked in front she told him as they were driving out to dinner that she had met mr urquhart that afternoon i dare say you might said james but he had stiffened to attention he blazed upon me a plan for august i said i would ask you about it james said h'm does it rest with me naturally it does i should not think of any plans without talking to you no i suppose you wouldn't said he then he asked and what does urquhart want you to do he doesn't want me particularly he wants all three of us i think said james you'll find that he wants you most she felt that this must be fathomed and if he did she said should you object to that he kept very dry it isn't a case of objecting to that or this the question before me at present is whether i want to form one of a party which doesn't want me and where i might be in the way from what i know of mr urquhart she answered i don't think he would ever ask a person he didn't want he might if he couldn't get the person he did want in any other way said james who else is to come vera nugent and her boy and perhaps lord considine he is going to ask laurence and mabel and all the boys too it will be a kind of school treat said james i own it doesn't sound very exciting where are we to go to to norway he knows of a house on the hardanger fiord a house in a wood he wants to hire a steamer to take us up from bergen and means to bring a motor boat with him there will be fishing of sorts if you want it i don't said james then held up his chin is my tie straight she looked perfectly what am i to say to mr urquhart he said i'll talk about it we'll discuss it in all its bearings i don't think i'm so attracted as you are but then it's very evident you aren't lucy said and no more she felt in a prickly heat and thought that she had never wanted anything so much in her life as this which was about to be denied her she dared not write to lancelot about it but to urquhart she confessed her despair and hinted at her longing he replied at once ask me to dinner i'll tackle him vera and child will come not considine the corbets can't going to scotland yachting we needn't have another woman but vera will be cross if there is no other man up to you to find one this again she carried to james who said let him come any free night tell me which you settle will you james had been thinking it out he knew he would have to go and was prepared with what he called a spoke for jimmy's wheel incidentally it would be a nasty one for lucy and none the worse for that he considered that she was getting out of hand and that urquhart might be a nuisance because such a spiny customer to tackle but he had a little plan and chuckled over it a good deal when he was by himself he was as usual excessively urbane to urquhart when they met and himself opened the topic of the norwegian jaunt urquhart took up the ball i think you might come your wife and boy will love it and you'll kindle at their joy 'they for life only you for life in them' to flout the bard besides you are not a fogey if i'm not i believe our ages tally you shall climb mountains with me macartney and improve the muscles of your calves you don't fish i think nor do i i thought i should catch your brother in law with that bait but no as for mine he'll spend the month in bed somewhere is your sister coming james asked urquhart nodded and her youngster osborne boy and a good sort lancelot and he have met they'll fight said james and mrs nugent and lucy won't speak vera would speak i'm sure said lucy and as for me i seldom get a chance a very true saying said urquhart i don't believe the last judgment would prevent vera from talking well macartney what says the man of the world if you mean me said james i gather that you all want to go lucy does but that's of course lancelot will equally of course but i have a suggestion to make might not the party be a little bigger it might and it should said urquhart in fact i asked considine to join us he would love it but he has to make a speech at a congress or read a paper and he says he can't get out of it the corbets can't come i'll ask anybody else you like james who was now about to enjoy himself said i leave the ladies to lucy and mrs nugent their choice would no doubt be mine but i certainly think we want another man much as you and i esteem each other my dear urquhart if there's walking to be done serious walking i think we shall be better three than two i don't at all agree that three is no company where men are concerned i think it better than two or four if only to give a knee or hold the sponge and with more than four you become a horde we want a man now i think so too urquhart said well who's your candidate james meditated or appeared to meditate well he said looking up and fixing urquhart with his eyeglass what do you say to francis lingen lucy likes him i am used to him and you will have to be some day lucy was extremely annoyed that was evident she bit her lip and crumbled her bread she said shortly francis couldn't walk to save his life let us put it another way said james enjoying his little coup let us say that if he did walk he might save his life urquhart marked the breeze and sailed into it i leave all that to you all i know about lingen is that i have done my best to oblige him in his private affairs i confess that i find him mild not to say insipid but i dare say he's the life of a party when he's put to it oh said james not averse from disparaging an old rival oh poor chap he hasn't many party tricks i'd back him at cat's cradle and i dare say he plays a very fair game at noughts and crosses besides he'll do what he's told and fetch things for you you'll find him a handy and obliging chap to have about sounds delightful said urquhart pleasantly he turned to lucy we'll give him lingen shall we she said by all means it doesn't matter in the least to me so james had his little whack after all chapter xv james james hardly knowing it was bracing himself for a serious situation he had a keen eye for a man a feeling for style in his judgment urquhart was momentous so much so that he could not afford to be irritated jealousy to him was a weakness only pardonable when the cause was trivial it had been trivial with poor lingen fishing in heavy water a skipjack snaps at your fly and you jerk him out to bank with a devil take you but the swirling shoulder the long ridge across the pool and the steady strain you are into a twelve pounder and the devil is uninvoked he asked jimmy to lunch at his club and took the candid line about the norwegian project lucy was desperately tired he said so he was pleased with the scheme the poor dear girl was run down the fact was you are very good for her i believe you exhilarate her she forgets her troubles she admires audacity from the bank i'll be as audacious as you please said jimmy oh you won't take me in james said i'm an old hand i know my urquhart but lucy will expect feats of strength you are a champion d your eyes said urquhart to himself the boy is one of your slaves too i can't tell you how contented i am that you approve of him he's all right said urquhart who didn't like all this james on the contrary liked it awfully he became a chatterbox he's more than that in his mother's esteem but lucy's a wise mother she moves with her finger on her lip and that mind you without coddling she'll risk him to the hair's breadth and never a word but she won't risk herself not she why she might be wanted but there it is women can do these things god knows how it's men who make a fuss well well but i babble my dear man said urquhart not at all it's a thing you never do thus encouraged james plugged onwards he talked more of himself and his affairs than he had ever done in his life before expatiated upon his growing business assumed his guest's contentment in his happiness invited praise of his lucy and was not rebuffed at their denial urquhart at first amused ended by being annoyed he felt as if james was a busy dwarf engaged in tying him up in lengths of black cotton round and round he went coil after coil was added before luncheon was over he could move neither hand nor foot it was rather ludicrous really reduced to speechlessness he sat and stared blankly at a voluble james prattling away about things which didn't matter he found himself even admiring things about him the way he could bite pull bread for instance the relish he had for his food but all this chatter he was too uncomfortable to see that james's present relish was chiefly for that the stilton and biscuits the glass of port were but salt to the handling of jimmy urquhart for james was a good fighter when he had a good man against him his parting words were these now i shouldn't be surprised if she found herself out of conceit with this beano before we start she's like that you know in such a case it's up to you to do something you and lancelot between you that's an irresistible pair i defy a gentlewoman and a mother to lose heart come in when you can tell us tales of far cashmere sing us songs of araby i won't promise to join in the chorus if you have choruses but i shall revel in my quiet way now don't forget i count upon you by bye d your eyes oh d your eyes said jimmy shouldering the hill as he went his way really he began to lose nerve a little and for such a sanguine man a little was much it was as if he was on the downward slide of the wave no longer cresting the flow which surged on ahead of him carrying him no longer the fact was that he was now at the difficult part of an enterprise which had been so far too easy at the moment it was not obvious to him what he was to do james was aware that was plain and james had a strong hand if he knew that too he had an unassailable hand but did he urquhart thought not he chuckled grimly to himself as he saw his complacent host taken at his word he looked at his wrist half past three d him i'll go and see her now but lucy as james had truly put it held firmly to the bank glad of him she certainly was amused by his audacities but not tempted to plunge he saw very soon that he must be careful with her a reference to the hardanger woods at night to the absence of nightingales absence of the dark she veiled her eyes with blankness and finally shut down the topic don't let's talk of what is not in norway tell me what is there i have to keep lancelot supplied you know no man has so little self esteem as to suppose that a woman can definitely put him away urquhart had plenty and preferred to think that she thrust him more deeply within her heart quite right he said and exerted himself on her amusement james coming home early found him on the hearth rug talking really well about his flying nobody could have behaved better than james he took his cup of tea listened was interested smoked a cigarette then touched lucy's shoulder saying i leave you to your escapades he went to his own room with nothing to do there and sat it out he fought his nervousness refused to see his spectres sat deep in his chair grimly smoking he heard the drawing room door open urquhart's voice yes it will be all right leave all that to me lucy said something he could not tell what his heart beat faster to hear her tones urquhart let himself out she had not gone with him to the front door was that a good sign or a bad one he frowned over that intricate question but kept himself from her until dinner time she might have come in he half expected her but she did not what was she doing in there by herself was she thinking where she stood so pretty as she was so innocent such a gentle sweet natured creature alas alas in short james was growing sentimental about lucy man of fashion as he was with that keen eye for style and the mode it may well be that urquhart's interest in her was a kind of cachet a hall mark however that may be james looked at her more curiously during that july than he had done since he saw her first in the garden of drem house yes lucy was pretty more than that she had charm he saw it now she moved her head about like a little bird and yet she was not a little woman by any means tall rather for a woman but there was an absence of suspicion about lucy or rather of fundamental suspicion for she was full of little superficial alarms which was infinitely charming but how pathetic it was deeply pathetic it made him vaguely unhappy and for a long time he did not know why tears swam into his eyes as he watched her over the top of his evening paper or was aware at the tail of his eye of her quick and graceful motions before her dressing glass studying his feelings deeply as never before he found himself out it was that he was to lose her had perhaps lost her just as he had found out how inexpressibly dear she was to be and amazement came upon him and dismay to realise that this sweetness of hers this pliancy of temper this strength within beauty were really there in her apart from him as if he had believed that they lay in his esteem no indeed they were her own she could bestow them where she pleased but he couldn't touch her now he would die sooner than touch her and he couldn't say anything to her that would have been to throw up the game she should never pity him and give him for pity what would have become in the very giving negligible to herself he knew himself well he could never ask for a thing no but could he get her to ask for something ah then she might find out whom she had married a man he judged of spendthrift generosity a prodigal of himself yes that was how it must be if to be at all he kept his eyes wide and followed her every movement with a longing to help which was incessant like toothache at the same time he was careful to keep himself quiet not a tone of voice must vary not a daily action betray him that hand on the shoulder now when urquhart was last here too much there must be no more of it though he could still feel the softness of her in the tips of his fingers thus he braced himself he held good cards but he didn't know how good chapter xvi amari aliquid lingen was exceedingly gratified by lucy's letter james had thought the invitation should come from her and as the subject matter was distasteful to her sooner than discuss it she had acquiesced few pin pricks had rankled as this one she had never had any feeling but toleration for lingen james had erected him as a foible and that he should use him now as a counter irritant made her both sore and disgustful she wished to throw up the whole scheme but was helpless because she could neither tell james who would have chuckled nor urquhart either to have told urquhart whether she told him her reason or left him to guess it would have precipitated a confession that her present position was untenable in her heart she knew it for the heart knows what the mind stores but she had not the courage to summon it up to table it and declare this robe is outworn stretched at the seams ragged at the edges away with it just now she could not do it and because she could not do it she was trapped james had her under his hand therefore she wrote her dear francis and had his grateful acceptance and his solemn elation visible upon his best calling face i can't tell you how happy you have made me it is beautiful even for you to make people happy that is why you do it what else could you do life is made up of illusions i think let me therefore add to the sum of mine that you have desired my happiness this sort of thing which once had stirred her to gentle amusement now made her words fall dry you mustn't forget that james has desired it too oh said francis lingen that's very kind of him really it is mr urquhart's party he invented it did he desire my happiness too asked lingen provoked into mockery of his own eloquence by these chills upon it at least he provided for it said lucy and that you shouldn't be uncomfortable i have asked margery dacre to come lingen felt this to be unkind but he closed his eyes and said how splendid that was the fact it had been an afterthought of hers and partially countered on james margery dacre also had accepted she had said how too delicious james when made aware that she was coming ducked his head it is true but made a damaging defence is she he said why she'll make our number a square one she replied to begin with and she might make it more pleasant for the others francis lingen and mr urquhart if she hadn't been self conscious she would never have said such a thing as that james's commentary i see and the subsequent digestion of the remark by the eyeglass made her burn with shame she felt spotted she felt reproach she looked backward with compunction and longing to the beginning of things there was now a tarnish on the day yet there was no going back clearly she was not of the hardy stuff of which sinners must be made if they are to be cheerful sinners she was qualmish and easily dismayed urquhart was away or she would have dared the worst that could befall her and dragged out of its coffer her poor tattered robe of romance between them they would have owned to the gaping seams and frayed edges then he might have kissed her and good bye but he was not at hand and she could not write down what she could hardly contemplate saying never in fact was a more distressful lady on the eve of a party of pleasure lancelot's serious enjoyment of the prospect evident in every line of his letters was her only relish but even that could not sting her answers to vivacity i hope the norwegians are very sensible they will need all their sense because we shall have none when the pirate is there there used to be vikings in norway they came to england and stole wives and animals now we bring them a man for wives that is what for with the chill of i must have a new reel to my fishing rod the old one has never been the same since i made a windlass of it for the battleship when it was a canal boat and it fell into the water when we made a landslide and accident which was buried for three days and had a worm in the works also a v sharp knife for reindeer etc they are tough i hear and my knife is sharpest at the back since opening sardines and other tins all rather small he drove a fevered pen but retained presence of mind enough to provide for his occasions the excitement of norway may lose me some marks in term's order not many i dare say again when you are excited reports go bad i have been shouting rather kicking up a shine once there was a small fight which was twigged norway is a serious matter there was an undercurrent of nervousness discernible only to her eyes she could not account for it till she had him home and they were on the edge of adventure it was lest he should be seasick and disgrace himself in the esteem of young nugent who as a naval officer was of course sea proof i expect nugent likes it very rough he said and then i don't you know much not for weeks at a time rather a nuisance however it was solved in the event by nugent being prostrate from the time they left the tyne between his spasms he urged his mother to explain that lord nelson was always seasick but lancelot was very magnanimous about it there was diversion in much of this and she used it to lighten her letters to urquhart which without it had been as flat as yesterday's soda water as the time came near when they should leave home she grew very heavy had forebodings wild desires to be done with it all then came a visitation from the clear eyed mabel and a cleansing of the conscience mabel said that she was sorry to miss norway it would have amused her enormously to see you in the saddle with two led horses she always talked as if she was an elder sister i almost threw laurence over but of course i couldn't do that he's so dependent and silent and pathetic but thank goodness he hasn't found out like james the real use of wives that is to have somebody to grumble to who really minds there's your james for you he doesn't want to go a bit he'd much rather be at harrogate or somewhere of that sort perhaps he'd like homburg but he wouldn't go for the world he's not pathetic at all though he wants to be but he wants to be sarcastic at the same time and is cross because the two things won't go together of course he stuck in francis lingen he would as if he cared about francis lingen a kind of poodle you oughtn't to abuse james to me lucy said not very stoutly i don't abuse laurence abuse him cried mabel good heavens child i only say out loud what you are saying to yourself all day we may as well know where we are then came a pause and then i suppose you and jimmy urquhart are in a mess lucy said nothing whereupon mabel showed her clear sight and i suppose you know now who turned the light off at that terrible surmise lucy got up and stood above her sister mabel i don't know what to do i am sure you don't said mabel on the other hand you know what you have to do yes lucy replied but it isn't so easy as you would think you see i have never spoken to him about it nor he to me and it seems almost impossible to begin now mabel was out of her depth do you mean what do you really mean i mean exactly what i say i found out the truth by a kind of accident one day it wasn't possible to doubt well then it went on you know of course it did said mabel well and there was no disguise about it after there couldn't be why should there be if there couldn't be mabel was at her wits' end there was no disguise about it while it was going on you know but in the daytime well we seemed to be ordinary people and nothing was said now do you see mabel did it makes it very awkward for you but feeling as you do now you simply must have it out i can't lucy said with conviction i know i can't do that no it must stop another way i must be hateful do you mean to make him dislike you to put him off lucy nodded something like that try it said mabel you mean it won't answer i mean that you won't my dear you are not that sort much too kind now i could be perfectly beastly if i felt it the only thing lucy was in a hard stare i don't feel kind just now james has given me a horror of things of the sort i don't believe he meant it i think he felt snappish and thought he would relieve his feelings that way but there it is he has made it all rather disgusting it's become like a kind of intrigue of vulgar people in a comedy these things do when you take them out and look at them mabel said like sham jewellery they are all right in their cases the velvet lining does so much but although you may be disgusted with james's handling of your private affairs you are not disgusted with the other no i suppose not i really don't know he is the most understanding man in the world and i would trust him through everything i don't think he could tell me an untruth not one that mattered anyhow i could see him go away from me for a year for two and not hear a word from him and yet be sure that he would come back and be the same and know me to be the same i feel so safe with him so proud of his liking me so settled in life i never felt settled before like being in a nest he makes everything i love or like seem more beautiful and precious lancelot oh i am much prouder of lancelot than i used to be he has shown me things in lancelot which i never saw he has made the being lancelot's mother seem a more important a finer thing i don't know how to say it but he has simply enhanced everything as you say like a velvet lining to a jewel all this is true and something in me calls for him and urges me to go to him but now but yet all this hateful jealousy this playing off one man against another francis lingen as if i ever had a minute's thought of francis lingen oh it's really disgusting i didn't think any one in our world could be like that it spots me i want to be clean i'd much rather be miserable than feel dirty here she stopped on the edge of tears which a sudden access of anger dried up she began again more querulously it's his fault of course it was outrageous what he did i'm angry with him because i can't be angry with myself for not being angry how could i be angry oh mabel if it had been james after all but of course it wasn't and couldn't be and i should be angry with him if i wasn't so awfully sorry for him mabel stared sorry for james yes naturally he's awfully simple you know and really rather proud of me in his way i see him looking at me sometimes wondering what he's done it's pathetic but that's not the point the point is that i can't get out do you want to get out mabel asked yes i do in a way it has to be and the sooner the better and whether i do or not i don't like to feel that i can't nobody likes to be tied then nobody should be married said mabel who had listened to these outbursts of speech and pauses which had been really to find words rather than breath with staring and hard rimmed eyes she had a gift of logic and could be pitiless what it comes to you know she said is that you want to have your fun in private we all do i suppose but that can't come off in nine cases out of ten especially with a man like james who is as sharp as a razor and just as edgy the moment anybody peers at you you show a tarnish and get put off it doesn't look to me as if you thought so highly of the other as you think you do after all if you come to that the paraphernalia of a wedding is pretty horrid one feels awfully like a heifer at the cattle show at least i did the complacency of the bridegroom is pretty repulsive you feel like a really fine article but one lives it down if one means it lucy told her to go or as good as told her sisters may be plain with each other she wasn't able to answer her though she felt that an answer there was what she had said was partly true lucy was a romantic without knowing it so had psyche been and the fatal lamp should have told her so the god removed himself thus she felt it to be he seemed just outside the door and a word a look would recall him to his dark beauty of presence that he was beautiful so she knew too well that he was unbeautiful in the glare of day she felt rather than knew the fault she suspected lay in her who could not see him in the light without the blemish of circumstance not his but circumstance in whose evil shade he must seem smirched what could she do with her faulty vision but send him away was that not less dishonourable than to bid him remain and dwindle as she looked at him what a kink in her affairs when she must be cruel to her love not because she loved him less but rather that she might love him more but the spirit of adventure grew upon her in spite of herself the sense of something in the wind of the morning bringing one nearer to a great day it pervaded the house crewdson got in the way of saying when we are abroad we shall find that useful ma'am or mr macartney will be asking for that in norway as for james it had changed his spots if not his nature james bought marvellous climbing boots binoculars compasses of dodgy contrivance sandwich cases drinking flasks a knowing hat he read about norway studied a dictionary and ended by talking about it and all to do with it without any pragmatism lucy found out how he relied upon urquhart and sometimes forgot that he was jealous of him jealous he was but not without hope for one thing he liked a fight with a good man lingen caught the epidemic and ceased to think or talk about himself he had heard of carpets to be had of bold pattern and primary colouring he had heard of bridal crowns of silver gilt worthy of any collector's cabinet he also bought boots and tried his elegant leg in a flame coloured sock and to crown the rocking edifice lancelot came home in a kind of still ecstasy which only uttered itself in convulsions of the limbs and sudden and ear piercing whistles through the fingers from him above all she gained assurance oh mr urquhart he'll put all that straight i bet you in two ticks and once it was i say mamma i wonder where you and i would be without mr urquhart james heard him and saw lucy catch her breath not very pleasant chapter xvii the shivering fit they were to start on the th of august and it was now the th packing had begun and crewdson as usual was troublesome he had the habit of appearing before lucy and presenting some small deficiency as a final cause of ruin and defeat i can't find any of the brown polish ma'am i don't know what mr macartney will do without it this or something like it had become a classic in the family it had always been part of the fun of going away but this year lucy was fretted by it she supposed herself run down and whipped herself to work she found herself too lingering about the house with an affection for the familiar aspect of corners vistas tricks of light and shadow which she had never thought to possess she felt extremely unwilling to leave it all it was safety it was friendliness it asked no effort of her to turn away from its lustrous and ordered elegance and face the unknown gave her a pain in the heart it was odd to feel homesick before she had left home but that was the sum of it she was homesick urquhart was very much in her mind a letter of his was in her writing table drawer under lock and key but urquhart seemed part of a vague menace now while james though he did his unconscious utmost to defeat himself got his share of the sunset glow upon the house fanciful nervous weary of it all as she was she devoted herself to her duties and then on this fifth of august in the afternoon she had a waking vision perfectly distinct and so vivid that disembodied and apart she could see herself enacting it it was followed by a shivering fit and depression but that must tell its own tale the vision occurred while she was on her knees busied beside a trunk turning over garments of lace and fine linen and pale blue ribbons which a maid in the same fair attitude was bestowing as she received them lancelot was out for the afternoon with crewdson and a friend they had gone to the zoological gardens and would not be back till late she had the house to herself it was cool and shadowed from the sun the square muffled in the heat gave no disturbing sounds looking up suddenly for no apparent reason she saw herself with jimmy urquhart in a great empty stony place and felt the dry wind which blew upon them both all but her own face was visible of that she saw nothing but the sharp outline of her cheek which was very white she saw herself holding her hat bending sideways to the gale she saw her skirt cling about her legs and flack to get free she wondered why she didn't hold it down the wind was a hot one she felt that it was so it made her head ache and burned her cheek bone urquhart was quite visible he looked into the teeth of the wind frowning and fretful why didn't she say something to him she had a conviction that it was useless there's nothing to say nothing to say that rang in her head like a church bell nothing to say nothing to say a sense of desolation and total loss oppressed her she had no hope the vacancy the silence the enormous dry emptiness about her seemed to shut out all her landmarks why didn't she think of lancelot she wondered why but realised that lancelot meant nothing out there she saw herself turn about she cried out james james started up with a sense of being caught and saw the maid's face of scare she was awake in a moment what is it ma'am what is it lucy had recovered her faculties nothing emily it's nothing i was giddy but she was shivering and couldn't go on i think i'll lie down for a minute she said and asked for the aspirin she took two tabloids and a sip of water was covered up and left to herself emily tiptoed away full of interest in the affair the shivering fit lasted the better part of an hour lucy crouched and suffered open eyed but without any consciousness something had happened was happening still a storm was raging overhead she lay quaking and waited for it to pass she fell asleep slept profoundly and awoke slowly to a sense of things she had no doubt of what lay immediately before her disrelish of the norwegian expedition was now a reasonable thing either it must be given up or the disaster reckoned with advienne que pourra but in either case she must have it out with james what did that mean jimmy urquhart would be thrown over he would go and she would not she lay picturing rather than reasoning saw him superbly capable directing everything she felt a pride in him and in herself for discovering how fine he was his fineness indeed was a thing shared she felt a sinking of the heart to know that she could not be there but the mere thought of that sickened her out of the question she must have it out with james that might be rather dreadful it might take her where she must refuse to go but on the whole she didn't think it need the certainty that she couldn't go to norway that james must be made to see it was a moral buttress timidity of james would not prevail against it besides that deeply within herself lay the conviction that james was kind if you took him the right way he was irritable and very annoying when he was sarcastic but he was good at heart and it was odd she thought that directly she got into an awkward place with a flirtation her first impulse was to go to james to get her out in her dream she had called to him though urquhart had been there why was that she was thinking now like a child which indeed she was where such matters were concerned she was not really contrite for what she had done neither regretted that she had done it nor that it was done with she wanted to discharge her bosom of perilous stuff james would forgive her he must not know of course what he was forgiving but yes he would forgive her at six or thereabouts listening for it she heard the motor bring james home she heard his latch key and the shutting of the door behind him her heart beat high but she did not falter he was reading a letter in the hall when she came downstairs he was very much aware of her but pretended not to be she stood on the bottom stair looking at him with wide and fixed eyes but he would not look up he was not just then in a mood either to make advances or to receive them his grievance was heavy upon him james said lucy i've been listening for you too good said he and went on with his letter i wanted to tell you that i don't think that i don't much want to go to norway then he did look up keenly with a drawn appearance about his mouth showing his teeth eh he said oh absurd he occupied himself with his letter folding it for its envelope while she watched him with a pale intensity which ought to have told him and perhaps did tell him what she was suffering i don't think you should call me absurd she said i was never very certain of it but my dearest child you made me certain at any rate he told her you made everybody certain so much so that i have the tickets in my pocket at this moment i'm very sorry i could pay for mine of course and i'm sure vera would look after lancelot i wouldn't disappoint him for the world what are you going to tell urquhart said james her eyes paled i believe that he would take it very simply she said james plunged his hands into his pockets he thought that they were on the edge of the gulf look here lucy he said hadn't you better tell me something more about this perhaps you will come into the library for a few minutes he led the way without waiting for her and she stood quaking where she was she was making matters worse she saw that now naturally she couldn't tell james the real state of the case because that would involve her in history james would have to understand that he had been believed to have wooed her when he had done nothing of the kind that was a thing which nothing in the world would bring her to reveal to him and if she left that out and confined herself to her own feelings for urquhart how was all that to be explained was it fair to herself or to urquhart to isolate the flowering of an affair unless you could show the germinating of it certainly it wasn't fair to herself as for urquhart it may be that he didn't deserve any generous treatment she knew that there was no defence for him though plenty of excuse possibly no she must go through with the norway business meantime james was waiting for her she stood by the library table while james back to the fireplace lifted his head and watched her through cigar smoke he had no mercy for her at this moment suspicions thronged his darkened mind but nothing of her rueful beauty escaped him the flush of sleep was upon her and her eyes were full of trouble it isn't that i have any reason which would appeal to you she told him she faltered her tale i think i have been foolish i know that i'm very tired and worried but i have had presentiments james clicked his tongue which he need not have done as he knew very well but he had not often been arbiter of late my child he said really and annoyed her of course you are impatient i can't help it all the same i am telling you the truth i don't know what is going to happen i feel afraid of something i don't know what run down said james looking keenly at her but kindly end of the season two days at sea will do the job for you anyhow my dear we go he threw himself in his deep chair stretched his legs out and looked at lucy she was deeply disappointed she had pictured it so differently he would have understood her she had thought but he seemed to be in his worst mood she stood the picture of distressful uncertainty hot and wavering her head hung her hand moving a book about on the table to his surprise and great discomfort he now discerned that she was silently crying tears were falling she made no effort to stop them nor to conceal them her weakness and dismay were too much for her she accepted the relief and neither knew nor cared whether he saw it james was not hard hearted unless his vanity was hurt this was the way to touch him as he was prepared to be touched my child he said why what's the matter with you she shook her head tried to speak failed and went on crying lucy said james come here to me she obeyed him at once something about her attitude moved him to something more than pity her pretty frock and her refusal to be comforted by it her youthful act for lucy had never yet cried before him her flushed cheeks her tremulous lips what if i could answer the question i should resolve the problem of the flight of souls he looked at her and knew that he desired her above all things a lucy in tears was a new lucy a james who could afford to let his want be seen was a new james that which stirred him pity need desire kindness vibrated in his tones to hear was to obey he took her two hands and drew her down to his knee he made her sit there embraced her with his arm there my girl there he said now let me know all about it upon my soul you are a baffling young woman you will and you won't and then you cry and i become sentimental i shall end by falling in love with you at these strange words she broke down altogether and sobbed her soul out upon his shoulder again he assured himself that he had never seen her cry before he was immensely touched by it and immensely at his ease too his moral status was restored to him he knew now what he wanted you poor little darling i can't bear to see you cry so there then cry away if it does you good what does me good is to have you here now what made you so meek as to come when i called you and why weren't you afraid that i should eat you up so i might lucy you know for you've made me madly in love with you it seemed to her beating heart that indeed he was he held her very close kissed her wet cheeks her wet eyes and her lips she struggled in his embrace but not for long she yielded and returned his kisses so they clung together and in the silence while time seemed to stand still it really did nothing of the kind for if he gained experience she lost it he must have grown more experienced for he was able to return without embarrassment to the affairs so strangely interrupted she must have grown less so because she answered him simply like a child he asked her what had upset her and she told him a dream a dream had she been asleep no it was a waking dream she told him exactly what it was she was with mr urquhart in a horrible place a dry sandy place with great rocks in it and where did i come in you didn't come in that was why i called you you called for me did you but urquhart was there yes i suppose he was still there i didn't look why did you call for me lucy because i was frightened i'm grateful to you for that that's good news to me he said and then when he kissed her again she opened her eyes very wide and said oh james i thought you didn't care for me any more james master of himself smiled grimly i thought as much he said and so you became interested in somebody else lucy sat up no she said i became interested in you first that beat him you became interested in me why because i didn't care for you no she said sharply no because i thought that you did james felt rather faint i can't follow you you thought that i didn't you said lucy was now excited and full of her wrongs how extraordinary surely you see i had reason to think that you cared for me very much oh very much indeed and then i found out that you didn't care a bit more than usual and then well then james who was too apt to undervalue people did not attempt to pursue the embroilment but he valued her in this melting mood he held her very close well he said and now you find that i do care and what then she looked at him divinely shy oh if you really care this would have made any man care well if i really do ah she hid her face on his shoulder i shall love to be in norway james felt very triumphant but true to type he sent her upstairs to dress with the needless injunction to make herself look pretty presently however he stood up and stared hard at the ground good lord he said i wonder what the devil then he raised his eyebrows to their height this is rather interesting the instinct was strong in him to make her confess for clearly there was something to be known but against that several things worked one was his scorn of the world at large he felt that it was beneath him to enquire what that might be endeavouring against his honour or peace another and a very new feeling to him was one of compassion the poor girl had cried before him hidden her face on his shoulder and cried to use strength male strength upon that helplessness to break a butterfly on a wheel upon his soul he thought he couldn't do it and after all whether it was lingen or urquhart he was safe he knew he was safe because he wanted her he knew that he could not want what was not for him that was against nature true to type again he laughed at himself but owned it she had been gone but five or ten minutes but he wanted to see her again now he craved the sight of that charming diffidence of the woman who knows herself desired he became embarrassed as he thought of it but did not cease to desire should he yield to the whim or hold himself at that moment lancelot was admitted he heard him race upstairs calling mamma mamma frightfully important that decided the thing he opened his door listening to what followed he heard lucy's voice i'm here you can come in and was amazed was that lucy's voice she was happy then he knew that by her tone there was a lift in it a timbre was it just possible by some chance that he had been a damned fool he walked the room in some agitation then went hastily upstairs to dress whether to a new james or not dinner had a new lucy to reveal a lucy full of what he called feminine charm a lucy who appealed to him across the table for support against a positive lancelot who brought him in at all points who was concerned for his opinion who gave him shy glances who could even afford to be pert he being essentially a fair weather man was able to meet her half way no more than that because he was what he was always his own detective the discipline which he had taught himself to preserve was for himself first of all lancelot noticed his father i say he said when he and lucy were in the drawing room father's awfully on the spot isn't he it's norway i expect bucks him up norway is enough to excite anybody lucy said even me oh you lancelot was scornful anything would excite you look at mr urquhart lucy flickered how do you mean lancelot was warm for his absent friend why you used to take a great interest in all his adventures you know you did this must be faced of course i did well well said lancelot very acutely now they seem rather ordinary rather chronic chronic was a word of crewdson's used as an augmentive lucy laughed but faintly yes i expect they are chronic but i think mr urquhart is very nice he's ripping said lancelot in a stare james in the drawing room that evening was studiously himself and lucy fought with her restlessness and prevailed against it he was shy and spun webs of talk to conceal his preoccupations lucy watched him guardedly but with intense interest it was when she went upstairs that the amazing thing happened she stood by him her hand once more upon his shoulder he had his book in his hand i'm going she said you have been very sweet to me i don't deserve it you know he looked up at her quizzing her through the detested glass you darling he said calmly and she thrilled where had she heard that phrase at the walkuere you darling he said who could help it oh but she pouted now oh but you can help it often if you like but you see i don't like i should hate myself if i thought that i could do let me take your glass away for one minute you may do what you please with it or me the glass in eclipse she looked down at him considering hesitating choosing poised oh i was right you look much nicer without it some day i'll tell you he took her hand and kept it some day you shall tell me a number of things she did not cease to look at him but he saw fear in her eyes some day perhaps but not yet no said he not yet perhaps will you trust me i always have she sighed oh you are good i didn't know how good then she turned to go i told you i was going and i am good night he put his book down she let his eyeglass fall he drew her to his knee and looked at her it's not good night he said that's to come she gave him a startled wide look and then her lips before she fled chapter xviii the hardanger that enchanted land of sea and rock of mountains rooted in the water and water which pierces the secret valleys of the mountains worked its spell upon our travellers and freed them from themselves for a while for awhile they were as singleminded as the boys content to live and breathe that wine tinctured air and watch out those flawless days and serene grey nights london had sophisticated some of them almost beyond redemption francis lingen was less man than sensitive gelatine james was the offspring of a tradition and a looking glass but the zest and high spirits of urquhart were catching and after a week francis lingen ceased to murmur to ladies in remote corners and james to care whether his clothes were pressed everybody behaved well urquhart who believed that he possessed lucy's heart james who knew now what he possessed vera nugent who was content to sit and look on and lucy herself who simply and honestly forgot everything except the beauty of the world and the joy of physical exertion she had been wofully ill on the passage from newcastle and had been invisible from beginning to end but from the moment of landing at bergen she had been transformed she was now the sister of her son a wild wilful impetuous creature a nymph of the heath irresponsible and self indulgent taking what she could get of comfort and cherishing and finding a boundless appetite for it it was something perhaps to know in her heart that every man in the party was in love with her it was much more for the moment at least to be without conscience in the matter she had put her conscience to sleep for once drugged it with poppy and drowsy syrups and led the life of a healthy and vigorous animal urquhart enjoyed that he was content to wait and watch for the time james did not perceive it the beauty and freshness of this new world was upon him francis lingen born to cling threw out tentative tendrils to margery dacre margery dacre was a very pretty girl she had straw coloured hair and a bright complexion she wore green especially in the water urquhart called her undine and she was mostly known as the mermaid she had very little mind but excellent manners and was expensive without seeming to spend anything for instance she brought no maid because she thought that it might have looked ostentatious and always made use of lucy's who didn't really want one that was how margery dacre contrived to seem very simple for the moment urquhart took natural command he knew the country he owned the motor boat he believed that he owned lucy and he believed that james was rather a fool he thought that he had got the better of james but this could not last because james was no more of a fool than he was himself though his intelligence worked in a different way things flashed upon urquhart who then studied them intensely and missed nothing they dawned on james who leisurely absorbed them and allowed them to work out their own development it was very gradually now dawning upon james that urquhart had assumed habits of guidance over lucy and was not aware of any reason why he should relinquish them he believed that he understood her thoroughly he read her as a pliant gentle nature easily imposed upon and really at the mercy of any unscrupulous man who was clever enough to see how she should be treated he had never thought that before it was the result of his cogitations over recent events so while he kept his temper and native jealousy under easy control he watched comfortably as well he might and gained amusement as he could well afford to do from urquhart's marital assumptions when he was tempted to interfere or to try a fall with urquhart he studiously refrained if urquhart said as he did sometimes i advise you to rest for a bit james calmly embraced the idea if urquhart brought out a cloak or a wrap and without word handed it to her james watching did not determine to forestall him on the next occasion and lucy as he admitted behaved beautifully behaved perfectly there were no grateful looks from her such as he would expect to see pass between lovers keenly as he watched her he saw no secret exchange on the other hand her eyes frequently sought his own as if she wanted him to understand that she was happy as if indeed she wanted him to be happy by such an understanding this gave him great pleasure and touched him too if he had been capable of it he would have told her but he was not it was part of his nature to treat those whom he loved de haut en bas he found that it was so and hated himself for it the one thing he really grudged urquhart was his simplicity and freedom from ulterior motive urquhart was certainly able to enjoy the moment for the moment's worth but james must always be calculating exactly what it was worth and whether to be enhanced by what might follow it he was kinder to her than he had ever been before in fact he was remarkably interesting she told him of it in their solitary moments of greatest intimacy this is my honeymoon she said and i never had one before goose said he don't attempt to deceive me but she reasserted it it's true james you may have loved me in your extraordinary way but i'm sure i didn't love you i was much too frightened of you well he laughed i don't discover any terrors now she wouldn't say that there were none so far as she dared she was honest we aren't on an exact equality we never shall be but we are much nearer own it he held her closely and kissed her you are a little darling if that's what you mean oh but it isn't it isn't at all what i mean why you wouldn't call me 'little' if you didn't know you were superior because i'm rather tall for a woman he knew that she was right and respected her for the discernment my love he said i'm a self centred arrogant beast and i don't like to think about it but you'll make something of me if you think it worth while but listen to me lucy i'm going to talk to you seriously then he whispered in her ear some day you must talk to me he could feel her heart beat he could feel her shiver as she clung yes she said very low yes i promise but not now no he said not now i want to be happy as long as i can she started away and he felt her look at him in the dark you'll be happier when i've told you she said why do you say that because i shall be happier myself then she said and james hoped that she was right about him one thing amazed him to discover how women imputed their own virtues to the men they loved it struck him a mortal blow to realise that his evident happiness would give lucy joy whereas hers would by no means necessarily add to his what does give me happiness then he asked himself what could conceivably increase my zest for life evidence of power exercise of faculty so far as i know nothing else whatever a parlous state of affairs but it is the difference i presume between a giving creature and a getting one which explains all is a man then never to give and be happy has he ever tried is a woman not to get has she ever had a chance of it he puzzled over these things in his prosaic methodical way one thing was clear to everybody there but urquhart in his present fatuity lucy was thriving she had colour light in her eyes a bloom upon her a dewiness an auroral air she sunned herself like a bird in the dust she bathed her body and tired herself with long mountain and woodland walks when she was alone with her husband she grew as sentimental as a housemaid and as little heedful of the absurd she grew young and amazingly pretty the sister of her son it would be untrue to say that being in clover she was unaware of it for a woman of one and thirty to have her husband for a lover and her lover for a foil is a gift of the gods so she took it with the sun and green water and wine bright air let the moralists battle it out with the sophists it did her a world of good chapter xix the moon spell macartney fell easily into habits and was slow to renounce them having got into the way of making love to his wife he by no means abandoned it at the same time and in as easy a fashion it came to be a matter of routine with him to play piquet with vera nugent after dinner it was she who had proposed it despairing of a quartette or even of a trio for the bridge which was a dram to her here also james would have been only too happy but nobody else would touch it lucy never played cards urquhart having better things to do said that he never did margery dacre and lingen preferred retirement and their own company lingen indeed was exhibiting his heart to the pale haired girl as if it was a specimen piece i am really a very simple person he told her one of those who trusting once trust for ever i don't expect to be understood i have no right to ask for sympathy that would be too much to look for in a jostling market day world like ours but i cherish one or two very fragrant memories of kindnesses done i open at need a drawer and like the scent of dry rose leaves or lavender a sweet hint steals out that there are good women in the world that life is not made up of receipted bills don't you understand the value of such treasures i am sure that you do you always seem to me so comprehending in your outlook margery said that she hoped she was it was lucy's business immediately after dinner to see that lancelot was decently abed the lad took the last ounce out of himself before that time came and was to be brought by main force to the bath crimson to the roots of his hair and dripping with sweat protesting to the uttermost still panting with his final burst in the open she saw to it that he was quiet before she could be so herself then she was free and urquhart found or looked for his chance the woods called her the wondrous silver calm of the northern night she longed to go but now she dreaded urquhart and dared not trust herself it had come to this that possessed as she was and happy in possession he and all that he stood for could blot the whole fair scene up in cold fog that was how she looked at it in the first blush of her new life he didn't understand that but he saw that she was nervous and set himself to reassure her he assumed his dryest tone his most negligent manner when she came downstairs from lancelot and after watching the card players fingering a book or magazine drifted to the open window and stood or leaned there absorbing the glory of the night urquhart left her and pulled at his pipe when she spoke to the room at large oh you stuffy people will you never understand that all the world is just out here he was the first to laugh at her though he would have walked her off into that world of magic and dream straight from the window where she stood he was a wild idealist himself and was sure of her but he must wait her good time often therefore she drifted out by herself and he suffered damnably but she never went far he comforted himself with that assurance she has the homing instinct she won't go without me and she knows that i can't come but oh to be kissing her under those birches by the water's edge he was not the only one who was aware that she had flitted macartney was always intensely aware of it and being by this time exceedingly fond it tended to spoil his play so long as urquhart left her alone he was able to endure it then came an evening when tending to the open door she found urquhart there before her he had behaved so admirably that her fears were asleep he acted with the utmost caution saying just enough with just enough carelessness of tone to keep her unsuspicious the boreal lights were flashing and quivering in the sky very soon he saw her absorbed in the wonder and beauty of them a night she said when anything might happen yes it looks like that he agreed but that is not what enraptures you what do you think enraptures me she wished to know the certainty he replied that nothing will she waited a while then said yes you are right i don't want anything else to happen you have everything you want here in the house safe to hand your lancelot in bed your james at cards and myself at the window wonderful and you are contented yes yes i ask so little you see but you despise me for it god forbid i promised you that you shouldn't repent this trip and you don't i hope her eyes were wide open and serious no indeed i never expected to be so happy as this it never happened to me before she had no compunctions at all but he was in the fatuous stage drugged by his own imaginings that's good shall we go down to the water i think we might she said not daring to look back into the room lest he should think that she feared him they strolled leisurely through the wood she in a soft rapture of delight at the still grey beauty of the night urquhart in a state of mind bordering upon frenzy he gripped himself by both hands to make sure of the mastery what gave him conviction was his constant sense of lucy's innocency this beautiful woman had the heart of a child and the patience of the mother of a god to shock the one or gibe at the other were a blasphemy he simply couldn't contemplate what then was to be the end of it he didn't know he didn't care she loved him he believed she had kissed him therefore she must love him such women don't give their lips without their hearts but then she had been scared and had cried off well that too he seemed to understand that was where her sense of law came in he could not but remember that it would have come in before had she known who her lover was as things fell out she slipped into love without knowing it the moment she had known it she withdrew to the shadow of her hearth that was his lucy all over his lucy yes for that wasn't the solicitor's lucy if indeed the solicitor had a lucy but had he a little weakness of urquhart's was to pride himself on being a man of whims and to suppose such twists of the mind his unique possession all indeed that he had of unique was this that he invariably yielded to his whims whereas other people did not however he set a watch upon himself on this night of witchery and succeeded perfectly they talked leisurely and quietly of anything or nothing the desultory fragmentary interjections of comment which pass easily between intimates lucy's share was replete with soft wonderings at the beauty of the world neither of them answered the other under the birch trees it was light but very damp he wouldn't allow her to stop there but bade her higher up the hillside there were pines there which were always dry wait you there he said i'm going back to get you a wrap she would have stopped him but he had gone urquhart walking up sharply to the house was not at all prepared for macartney walking as sharply down from it in fact he was very much put out and the more so because from the first james took the upper hand hulloa said the lord of the eyeglass hulloa yourself said urquhart and stopped which he need not have done seeing that macartney with complete nonchalance continued his walk seen my wife anywhere came from over his shoulder urquhart turned on his heels yes he said and walked on there was an end of one two and three as the rhyme goes urquhart was hot with rage that bland blundering fool that glasshouse that damned supercilious ass all this and more he cried upon james he scorned him for his jealousy he cursed him for it he vowed that he would carry her off before his very eyes let her give the word lift an eyebrow and i take her across the world and the lad too bless him what did the quill driver want of them but credit damn him he hung them up in his house as tradesmen use the royal arms he baited for his deans and chapters with them he walked far into the night in a passion of anger it never once occurred to him that james was a rival and there he was right he thought that urquhart had certainly been with lucy he knew that he was in love with her but oddly enough that stimulated instead of quelled him it enhanced her it made her love worth keeping he had a great respect in his heart of hearts for urquhart's validity in a world of action which certainly comprehended the taking and keeping of hearts now he came to think of it he must confess that he had never loved lucy as he did now until he had observed that so redoubtable a champion was in the lists against him odd thing he had been jealous of francis lingen as he now was of urquhart but it was the latter jealousy which had made him desire lucy the former had simply disgusted him the latter had spurred him to rivalry and now to main desire james was no philosopher he had an idle mind except in the conduct of his business he could not attempt then to explain his state of mind but he was very much interested soon he saw her in the dusk under the pines a slim white shape standing with one hand upon the trunk of a tree her back was towards him she did not turn she supposed that it was urquhart come back and was careful not to seem waiting for him how quick you have been she said lightly and stood where she was no answer was returned then came a shock indeed and her head seemed to flood with fear two hands from behind her covered her eyes her head was drawn gently back and she was kissed ardently on the lips she struggled wildly she broke away oh she said half sobbing oh how cruel you are how cruel how could you dare to do it and then free of the hands she turned upon urquhart and saw james oh my love she said and ran to him and broke into tears james had secured his eyeglass but now let it drop he allowed her to cry her fill and then made the best of a rather bad business if every man who kissed his wife said he was answered like that lips would go dry she said through her tears you see i thought you were mr urquhart with my wrap oh the dickens you did said james and is that how mr urquhart usually brings you a wrap she clung to him well no if he did i suppose i shouldn't have been so angry by this time that's a very good answer james allowed i'll only make one comment upon it you cried out upon the cruelty of the attack now if it had been assume it for the moment our well friend let us say why would it have been cruel of him shameful flagrant audacious impudent insolent all that i can understand but cruel lucy lucy's cheek was upon his shoulder and she let it stay there even while she answered the moment was serious she must tell him as much as she dared certain things seemed out of the question but something she must tell him you see james she said i think mr urquhart is fond of me in fact i'm sure of it has he told you so not in so many words but but in so many other words eh well pursue and i told him that i couldn't possibly join the party on that account did you tell him it was on that account no said lucy i didn't but he understood that i know he understood it because he immediately said that if i would come i shouldn't repent it and i haven't he has never made me feel uncomfortable but just now when i was expecting him oh it seemed to me quite horrible and i was furious with him you were indeed it didn't occur to you that it might have been well somebody with more right her arm tightened but she said nothing the unconscious james went on i was wrong a man has no right to kiss a woman unawares in the dark even if it's his wife she'll always want to know who it was and she's bound to find out and he'll get no thanks for it either then it became necessary for lucy to thank him mind you my dear he told her i have no quarrel with jimmy urquhart up to now you say he's in love with you and i think that he is i've thought so for some time and i confess that i didn't relish the idea that he should be out here with us but since we are in for confessions i'll make one more if he hadn't been in love with you i don't believe that i should be as i am now lucy laughed the laugh of a woman rich then i'm very much obliged to him she said but urquhart was harder to convince than james chapter xx fair warning vera nugent a brisk woman of the world with a fondness for vivid clothing and a spanish air which went oddly with it took the trouble one fine day to tackle her brother look here jimmy she said as they breasted a mountain pass are you quite sure what you are up to with these people urquhart's eyes took a chill tinge a hard and pebbly stare i don't know what you mean he said men always say that especially when they know very well of course i mean the macartneys you didn't suppose i was thinking of the poplolly the poplolly i regret to say was francis lingen whom vera abhorred the term was opprobrious and inexact but urquhart shrouded himself in ice perhaps you might explain yourself he said vera was not at all sure that she would you make it almost impossible you know they were all out in a party and were to meet the luncheon and the boys who had gone round in the boat as parties will have it they had soon scattered lingen had taken margery dacre to himself lucy was with her husband urquhart now he came to think of it began to understand that the sceptre was out of his hands the pass worn out of the shelving rock by centuries of foot work wound itself about the breasting cliffs like a scarf below them lay the silver fiord and upon that a mere speck they could see the motor boat with a wake widening out behind her like parallel lines of railway urquhart saw in his mind that he would be a fool to quarrel with vera she was not on his side he could feel but he didn't despair of her one way of putting her off him forever was to allow her to think him a fool that he could not afford don't turn against me for a mannerism my dear he said i turn against you if at all for a lack of mannerism said vera briskly it's too bad of you here i am as so much ballast for your party and when i begin to make myself useful you pretend i'm not there but i am there you know i was cross he said because i'm rather worried and i thought you were going to worry me more well maybe that i am she admitted that but i don't like to see a sharp faced man make a donkey of himself the credit of the family is at stake he laughed i wouldn't be the first of us and this wouldn't be the first time there's whimsy in the blood well out with it let me know the worst vera stopped i intend to do it sitting we've heaps of time none of the others want us urquhart hit the rock with his staff that's the point my child do they or don't they you believe vera said that lucy is in love with you urquhart replied i know that she was there you have the pull over me she answered i haven't either your confidence or hers all i can tell you is that now she isn't urquhart was all attention do you mean she has told you anything good heavens vera scoffed what do you take me for do you think i don't know by the looks of her if you weren't infatuated you'd know better than i do my dear girl urquhart said with a straight look at her the fact is i am infatuated i'm sorry for you you've made a mess of it but i must say that i'm not at all sorry for her don't you suppose that she is the sort to find the world well lost for your beaux yeux far from that she'd wilt like a rose in a window box i'd take her into fairy land said urquhart she should walk in the dawn she wouldn't feel her feet she would if they were damp said vera who could be as direct as you please if you think she's a wood nymph in a cage you're very much mistaken she's very domestic i know said the infatuate that i touched her vera tossed her head i'll be bound you did you aren't the first man to light a fire that's what you did you lit a fire for macartney to warm his hand at she's awfully in love with him urquhart grew red that's not probable he said vera said it's certain perhaps you'll take the trouble to satisfy yourself before you take tickets for fairy land it's an expensive journey i believe had you thought what you would be doing about lancelot a very nice boy no details had been arranged said urquhart in his very annoying way not even that of the lady's inclinations it appears well i've warned you i've done it with the best intentions i suppose even you won't deny that i'm single minded i'm not on the side of your solicitor that made urquhart very angry i'm much obliged to you my dear we'll leave my solicitor out of account for the moment but that nettled vera who flamed upon my word jimmy you are too sublime you can't dispose of people quite like that how are you to leave him out of account when you brought his wife into it if you ever supposed that macartney was nothing but a solicitor you were never more mistaken in your life except when you thought that lucy was a possible law breaker at the moment and from where they stood the sea scape and the coast road stood revealed before and behind them for many a league in front it descended by sharp spirals to a river bed vera nugent standing there her chin upon her hands her hands upon her staff could see straight below her feet two absorbed couples as it were on different grades of the scene in the first the fair margery dacre leaned against a rock while lingen on his knees tied her shoestring at a lower level yet macartney having handed his lucy over a torrent stooped his head to receive his tribute vera who had a grain of pity in her hoped that urquhart had been spared but whether he was or not she never knew no signs of disturbance were upon him at the ensuing picnic unless his treatment of macartney with a kind of humorous savagery betrayed him they talked of the folgefond that mighty snow field beyond the fiord which the three men intended to traverse in a day or two's time brace yourself my friend urquhart said hearts have been broken on that ground before now james said that he had made his peace with god but lucy looked full eyed and serious i never know when you are laughing at us she said to urquhart be sure that i have never laughed at you in my life he said across the table cloth he laughs at me said james behind his eyeglass but i defy him the man who can laugh at himself is the man i envy now i never could do that you've hit me in a vital spot urquhart said that's my little weakness and that's why i've never succeeded in anything even in breaking my neck lancelot nudged his friend patrick do you twig that patrick blinked having his mouth too full to nod conveniently can't drive a motor i suppose can't fly i don't think as to breaking your neck said james there's still a chance for you i shall make a mess of it urquhart retorted is this going to be a neck breaking expedition that was from lingen who now had an object in life i never said so urquhart told him i said heart breaking a far simpler affair what is going to break your heart in it please lucy asked him she saw that there lay something behind his rattle well said urquhart brazening it out it would break mine to get over the snow field some eight miles of it there are and to find that i couldn't get down that might easily happen and what would you do james fixed her with his eyeglass that's where the neck breaking might intervene he said jimmy would rather risk his neck any day than his heart heart said vera no such thing quite another organ it's a case of dinner he'd risk his neck for a dinner and so would any man i believe you are right said james lucy with very bright eyes looked from one to the other of her lovers each wore a mask she determined to ask james to give up the folgefond discerning trouble in the air they went home by water and lancelot added his unconscious testimony he was between urquhart's knees his hand upon the tiller his mood confidential i say he began and urquhart encouraged him to say on it's slightly important but i suppose i couldn't do the folgefond by any chance you are saying a good deal said urquhart i'll put it like this that by some chance you might but by no chance in the world could patrick hoo said lancelot and why not pray his mother would put her foot on it splosh it would go like a cockroach i know said dreamy lancelot that's what would happen to me i expect then he added that's what will happen to my father good cockroach said urquhart looking ahead of him you think she won't want him to go lancelot snorted won't want him why she doesn't already and he'll do what she wants i'll bet you does he always he always does now it's the air i fancy chapter xxi the departure but pout as she might she could not prevail with james whose vanity had been scratched my dear girl i'd sooner perish he said give up a jolly walk because jimmy urquhart talks about my heart and his own neck preposterous besides there's nothing in it but james she said if i ask you he kissed the back of her neck she was before the glass busy with her hair you don't ask me you wouldn't ask me no woman wants to make a fool of a man if she does she's a vampire mr urquhart is very impulsive she dared to say i've known that for a long time said james longer than you have i fancy but it takes more than impulse to break another man's neck besides i really have no reason to suppose that he wants to break my neck why should he here they were up against the wall again if there were reasons he could not know them there was no getting over it yet they were to start betimes in the morning and sleep that night at brattebo which is the hithermost spur of the chain dinner and beds had been ordered at odde beyond the snow field dinner was a gay affair they toasted the now declared lovers true to his cornering instincts lingen had told lucy all about it in the afternoon your sympathy means so much to me and margery whose mind is exquisitely sensitive is only waiting your nod to be at your feet with me i should be very sorry to see either of you there lucy said i'm very fond of her and i shouldn't take it at all kindly if she demeaned herself when do you think of marrying he looked at her appealingly i must have time he said time to build the nest a flat i suppose she said declining such poetical flights a flat said francis lingen really it hadn't occurred to me from lucy the news went abroad and so the dinner was gay urquhart confined himself to the two boys and told them about the folgefond of its unknown depth of the crevasses of the glacier on its western edge of certain white snakes bred by the snow which might be found there their bite was death he said frost bite said patrick nugent who knew his uncle's way but lancelot favoured his mother hoo he said i expect that you'd give him what for one blow of your sword and his head would lie at your feet that's nasty too said urquhart they have white blood i believe lancelot blinked beastly he said did mamma hear you you'd better not tell her she hates whiteness secretly so do i rather it was afterwards when the boys had gone to bed that a seriousness fell upon those of them who were given to seriousness james and vera nugent settled down squarely to piquet francis lingen murmured to his affianced bride i don't disguise from myself and from you i can have no secrets that there is danger in the walk the snow is very treacherous at this season we take ropes of course urquhart is said to know the place but urquhart is he's very fascinating said margery dacre and francis lifted his eyebrows you find that then i am distressed i would share everything with you if i could to me i don't know why there is something crude some harsh note a clangour of metal i find him brazen at times but to you my love who could be strident you are the very home of peace when i think of you i think of doves in a nest you must think of me to morrow then said margery he rewarded her with a look lucy for her part had another sort of danger in her mind it seemed absolutely necessary to her now to speak to urquhart because she had a conviction that he and james had very nearly come to grips women are very sharp at these things she was certain that urquhart knew the state of her heart just as certain as if she had told him of it that being so she dreaded his impulse she suspected him of savagery and as she had no pride where love was concerned she intended to appeal to him modesty she had but no pride she must leave great blanks in her discourse but she trusted him to fill them up then there was another difficulty she had no remains of tenderness left for him not a filament unless she went warily he might find that out and be mortally offended all this she battled with while the good nights to lancelot were saying upstairs she kissed his forehead and stood over him for a moment while he snuggled into his blankets oh my lamb you are worth fighting for was her last thought as she went downstairs full of her purpose the card players sat in the recess the lovers were outside urquhart was by himself on a divan she thought that he was waiting for her with a book for shield against the lamp she took the chair he offered her aren't they extraordinary she said he questioned who is extraordinary do you mean the card sharpers not at all it's meat and drink to them it's we who are out of the common daintier feeders no she said it's not quite that james's strong point is that he can keep his feelings in separate pigeonholes i'm simply quaking with fear because my imagination has flooded me but he won't think about the risks he's running until he is running them urquhart had been looking at her until he discovered that james had his eye upon her too he crossed his leg and clasped the knee of it he looked fixedly at the ceiling as he spoke i should like to know what it is you're afraid of he said in a carefully literal but carefully inaudible tone he did that sort of thing very well lucy was pinching her lip all sorts of things she said i suffer from presentiments i think that you or james may be hurt for instance do you mean said urquhart as if he had been saying where did you get this tobacco do you mean that you're afraid we may hurt each other she hung her head deeply you needn't be if you can fear that you must forget my promise he saw her eyes clear then cloud again before her difficulties james at least she said has never done you any harm it was awfully true but it annoyed him damn james none whatever he answered sharply i wonder if i haven't done him any good looking at her guardedly through half closed eyes he saw that she was strongly moved her bosom rose and fell hastily like short waves lipping a wharf her hands were shut tight you have been the best friend i ever had she said don't think i'm not grateful that came better he tapped his pipe on the ash tray at hand my dear he said i intend to live on your gratitude don't be afraid of anything lascia fare a me she rewarded him with a shy look a rueful look it cut him like a knife but he could have screwed it round in the wound to get more of such pain there's no more bitter sweet torment to a man than the thanks of the beloved woman for her freedom given back to her he felt very sick indeed but almost entirely with himself for her he chose to have pity of macartney he would not allow himself to think at all danger lay that way and he did not intend to be dangerous he would not even remember that he was subject to whims the thought flitted over his mind like an angel of death but he dismissed it with an effort after all what good could come of freebooting the game was up like all men of his stamp he cast about him far and wide for a line of action for directly the folgefond walk was over he would be off to stay here was intolerable just as to back out of the walk would be ignominious no he would go through with that somehow but from odde he thought he might send for his things and clear out it did not occur to him that he might have to deal with macartney what should macartney want that he had not he had vindicated the law but the hour was come when macartney was to know everything lucy was adorable and he simply adored her then in the melting mood which follows she sobbed and whispered her broken confession he had the whole story from the beginning he listened and learned he was confounded he was deeply touched he might have been humiliated and so frozen he might have been offended and so bitter but he was neither her tears her sobs her clinging her burning cheeks the flood of her words or the sudden ebb which left her speechless all this taught him what he might be to a woman who dared give him so much he said very little himself and exacted the last dregs from her cup he drank it down like a thirsty horse probably it was as sweet for him to drink as for her to pour for love is a strange affair and can be its own poison and antidote at the end he forgot his magnanimity so great was his need of hers you have opened my eyes to my own fatuity you have made me what i never thought i could be i am your lover do you know that and i have been your husband for how long your husband lucy and now your lover never let these things trouble you any more she clung to him with passion i love you she said i adore you if i've been wicked it was to prove you good to me and to crush me to the earth love me again i am yours forever later she was able to talk freely to him as of a thing past and done it's very odd i can't understand it you didn't begin to love me until he did and then you loved me for what he saw in me isn't that true i couldn't tell you he said because i don't know what he did see he thought i was pretty so you are he thought that i liked to be noticed well and you do of course but it never struck you no fool that i was i love you for your foolishness yes but you didn't no she said quickly no because you wouldn't allow it you must let women love before you can expect them to be meek he laughed do you intend to be meek then it was her turn to laugh i should think i did that's my pride and joy you may do what you like now he found that a hard saying but it is a very true one the departure was made early lucy came down to breakfast and the boys but margery dacre did not appear vera of course did not noon was her time the boys were to cross the fiord with them and return in the boat lucy would not go seeing what was the matter with urquhart urquhart indeed was in a parlous frame of mind he was very grim to all but the boys he was to them what he had always been polite and very quiet in his ways with lucy he had no word for either of his companions james treated him with deference francis lingen who felt himself despised was depressed jolly party said lancelot really meaning it and made urquhart laugh but lucy shuddered at such a laugh she thought of the wolves in the zoological gardens when at sundown they greet the night it made her blood feel cold in her veins if no one's going to enjoy himself why does anybody go she said at a venture james protested that he was going to enjoy himself prodigiously as for lingen he said it would do him no end of good i jolly well wish i could go was lancelot's fishing shot and lucy who was really sorry for urquhart was tempted to urge it but james would not have heard of such a thing she knew then they went with a great deal of fuss and bustle james a great stickler for the conventions patted her shoulder for all good bye urquhart waited his chance good bye my dear he said i've had my innings here you won't see me again i expect i ask your pardon for many things but i believe that we are pretty well quits trust me with your james won't you good bye he asked her that to secure himself against whims she could do no more than give him her hand he kissed it and left her the boat was pushed out urquhart took the helm with lancelot in the crook of his arm he turned once and waved his cap there goes a man any woman could love she told herself if she had a regret she had it not long some natural tears they shed but dried them soon they made a good landing bestowed their gear in a cart and set out for a long climb to brattebo which they reached in the late afternoon a lonely farm on the side of a naked hill they slept there and were to rise at four for the snow field chapter xxii catastrophe they were up and away before the light taking only one guide with them a sinewy dark man with a clubbed beard on his chin if they had had two it had been better and urquhart who knew that made a great fuss but to no purpose all the men were at the saeters they were told haymaking was in full swing out there there was nothing to be done urquhart was put out and in default of another man of sense made james his partner in griefs i know these chaps he said when they are alone they lose their heads the least little difficulty they shy off and turn for home i judge this man of ours to have the heart of a mouse he don't want to go at all if there are two of them they egg each other on they talk it over each tries to be the bolder man but is there going to be any difficulty james enquired surveying the waste through his eyeglass i don't see why there should be you never know urquhart said curtly but presently he was more confidential don't tell that ass lingen but it might be quite difficult to get off this place james stared about him you know best but is it harder to get off than on of course it is my dear chap said urquhart quite in his old vein of good tempered scorn we are going up on the north side where the snow is as hard as a brick ah said james now i see and we go down on the south where it's as soft where it may be as soft as a bran mash or blown over into cornices james saw or said that he did in his private mind he judged urquhart of trying to intimidate him the vice of the expert but he noticed that the guide had a coil of rope and that urquhart carried a shovel it was easy going until near noon with no snow to speak about they climbed a series of ridges like frozen waves but each was higher than the last and took them closer to the clouds when they lunched under the shelter of some tumbled rocks a drifting rain blew across the desolation jolly said james but quite happily lingen shivered my dear man said urquhart just you wait i'll surprise you in a quarter of an hour's time he spoke in his old way as hectoring whom he tolerated james noticed it and was amused he hadn't yet had time to be angry with this rascal and now he began to doubt whether he should after all he had gained so very much more than he had lost honour oh that be jiggered something too much of his own honour why it was through urquhart's attack upon lucy that he had found out what lucy was urquhart at this time was marching rather in front of him james looked him over a hardy impudent rogue no doubt with that square small head on him that jutting chin and his pair of blue eyes which would look through any woman born and burn her heart to water yes and so he had had lucy's heart as water to be poured over his feet by heaven when he thought of it he james adolphus had been the greater rogue to play the grand turk to hoard that lovely quivering creature in his still seraglio to turn the key and leave her there and jimmy urquhart got in by the window of course he did he was not an imaginative man by nature but he was now a lover and had need to enhance his mistress how better do that than by calling himself a d d fool the greatest blame he knew it follows that if he had been a fool urquhart had not impudent dog if you like but not a fool now for the life of him james could not despise a man who was not a fool nor could he hate one whom he had bested he did not hate urquhart he wasn't angry with him he couldn't despise him on the contrary he was sorry for him but now the miracle happened and one could think of nothing else as they tramped through the cold mist over snow that was still crisp and short with frost the light gained by degrees the flying fog became blue then radiant quite suddenly they burst into the sun the dazzling field stretched on all sides so far as the eye could see snow and cloud one could not distinguish them and above them the arch of hyaline a blue interwoven with light which throbbed to the point of utterance and drowned itself in the photo sphere the light seemed to make the sun to climb towards the zenith to mass and then to burst in flame all three men took it in each in his fashion lingen was greatly moved urquhart became jocular well he said to macartney what do you make of that that's worth coming up for that ought to extenuate a good deal james was quick to notice the phrase oh he said you can show me things i'm very much obliged to you this is a wonder of the world now what the deuce does he mean by that urquhart thought to himself had lucy told him anything he didn't believe it impossible women don't tell they had seven miles of snow pretty soft by now and steadily up hill they bent themselves seriously to it and found no occasion for talk there were crevasses green depths of death to be avoided their guide light eyed for scares seemed to know them all and reserved his alarm for signs in the sky invisible to the party he mended the pace which became rather severe francis lingen was distressed macartney kept back to give him company urquhart forged on ahead with the guide by four in the afternoon one at least of them was gruelled that was lingen if we don't get down after all it'll go hard with poplolly urquhart said to james james replied oh we must get down that's all nonsense urquhart said nothing and they went on they reached a point where their guide stopping for a moment looked back at them and pointed forward with his staff odde is over there he said and urquhart added that he knew whereabouts they were if it were clear enough he told them you might see it all lying below you like a map but i doubt if you'll see anything they pushed on before the last slope which was now close at hand the ground became very bad the crevasses showed in every direction raying out like cracks on an old bench the guide was evidently anxious he gave up all appearance of conducting his party and went off rapidly by himself they waited for him in silence but presently urquhart said i bet you any money he won't want to go down don't he want to dine as much as we do said james he doesn't want to break his neck said urquhart that's his little weakness i sympathise with him james said but i should like to know more before i turn back you'll only know what he chooses to tell you urquhart answered lingen was sitting on the snow the guide came back with firm steps his eyes sought urquhart's naturally well he was asked and lifted his stock up impossible he said why impossible james asked urquhart having none of the language but guessing at the word urquhart and the man talked the latter was eloquent he says urquhart told them that there's a great cornice and a drop of forty feet or so then he thinks there's another but he's not sure of that he intends to go back i knew he did before he went out to look it's a beastly nuisance james looked at lingen who was now on his feet well he said what do you feel about it lingen red in the face said you'll excuse me but i shall do what the guide proposes though i admit to great fatigue i don't think it would be right under the circumstances to do otherwise i feel a great responsibility but i gather that in any case he himself would decline to go down you will think me timid i dare say no no james said that's all right of course personally i should be inclined to try the first cornice anyhow there's always a chance you know urquhart looked at him keenly do you mean that he asked him yes james said why do you ask urquhart turned away when he faced james again he was strangely altered his eyes were narrower lines showed beside his mouth temptation was hot in the mouth we'd better talk about it he said and jerked his head sideways james walked with him a little way what's all this mystery he asked i wonder if you know what you are doing urquhart said i wonder if you know what this means do you know for instance that i don't care a damn whether i break my neck or not and on the whole would rather that you did than didn't you ought to know it but i'm asking you james kept his eyeglass to his eye i think you are talking nonsense he said but i don't suppose you intend it for nonsense you inspire me to say taking you on your face value that i shall try the first cornice if it's a forty foot drop we ought to have rope enough urquhart peered at him you mean what you say certainly i do urquhart turned on his heel all right he said and went over to the other two macartney and i are going down he said to lingen i don't at all blame you for going back but i'll trouble you to see that this man does the needful to morrow the needful is to come out here as early as he can get over the ground to see if we want him he had better fire a gun or shout if we are alive we shall answer him if we don't answer he had better see about it i don't want to scare you but this is not a joke and i can't afford to be misunderstood now i'm going to tell him all that in his own lingo lingen took it very badly but said nothing urquhart spoke vehemently to the guide who raised his staff and appeared to be testifying to heaven he handed over the rope the shovel and the kit with an air of pilate washing his hands now urquhart said to james we'll rope and see if we can cut some steps through this thing i've seen that done james dropping his eyeglass said that he was in his hands everybody was quiet but they were all in a hurry lingen came up to say good bye he was very much distressed nearly crying the guide on the other hand was chafing to be off if that chap calls himself a guide said urquhart he ought to be shot the guide thereupon threw up his hands with a gesture of despair lingen said that he couldn't possibly go until he had seen them down the guide who was sullen and nervous remained to help them even that seemed to be against his convictions they fixed one of the stocks in a crevasse urquhart roped then he went forward to the edge or what seemed to be the edge and having crawled on his belly so far as to be almost invisible presently was seen to be standing up then to fall to it with the shovel he seemed to be cutting steps and descending as he worked gradually he disappeared and the pull on the rope began they paid out cautiously and regularly all seemed well he might have had twenty feet of it and then there was a sudden violent wrench at it and it came back limp in macartney's hands he's gone he said then he shouted with all his might no answer came they all shouted the echoes rang round the waste driven back on them from the hidden mountain tops in the deathlike hush which followed one of them thought to hear an answering cry lingen heard it or thought that he did and began to haul up the rope when they had the end of it in their hands it was found to be cut clean he did that himself james said then added i'm going down give me out this rope for what it's worth to lingen he said get back as quick as you can and bring up some men to morrow then having secured himself he went down the flawless snow slope and they paid out the cord as he wanted it he had no particular sensation of fear he knew too little about it to have any it is imaginative men who fear the unknown true the rope had been cut once and might have to be cut again if urquhart had had to cut it was because it had been too short and now it would be shorter but there was no time to think of anything the snow seemed to be holding him he had got far beyond urquhart's ledges was upon the place where urquhart must have slid rapidly down all was well as yet but he didn't want to overshoot the mark he kept his nerve steady and tried to work it all out in his mind if this were really a cornice it must now be very thin he thought he drove at it with his staff and found that it was so it was little more than a frozen crust he kicked into it with his feet got a foothold and worked the hole bigger then he could peer down into the deep where the shadows were intensely blue it looked a fearful drop but he saw urquhart lying there and went on he descended some ten or perhaps fifteen feet more and found himself dangling in the air he was at the end of the rope then i'll risk it he said and got his knife out he dropped within a few yards of urquhart chapter xxiii james and jimmy macartney found him lying very still nothing in fact seemed to be alive but his eyes which were wide open and missed nothing you're hurt i'm afraid can you tell me anything urquhart spoke in a curiously level tone it seemed to give impartiality to what he said as if he had been discussing the troubles of a man he hardly knew back broken i believe anyhow i can't feel anything i'm sorry you came down after me my dear fellow said james what do you take me for those bright all seeing steady eyes were fixed upon him they had the air of knowing everything well you knew what i did take you for anyhow and so it would have been reasonable we won't talk about all that james said let me cover you up with something and then i'll see what can be done about moving you urquhart spoke indifferently about that i doubt if you can get down and it's a good step to odde four hours i dare say yes but there would be a house nearer than odde if i could get some bearers we'd get you comfortable before dark oh i'm comfortable enough now urquhart said james thought that a bad sign he unpacked the rucksacks got out the brandy flask a mackintosh a sweater and a cape now my dear man i'm going to hurt you i'm afraid but i must have you on a dry bed and you must drink some of this liquor which will you have first the brandy said urquhart and as soon as you like he helped as much as he could groaned once or twice sweated with the effort but the thing was done he lay on the mackintosh his head on a rucksack the cape and sweater over him macartney went to the edge of the plateau to prospect a billowy sea of white stretched out to a blue infinity the clouds had lifted or been vaporised he could see nothing of odde but he believed that he could make out a thread of silver which must be the fiord it would take him too long to get out there and back and yet to stay here that meant that the pair of them would die it is but just to him to say that no alternative presented itself to him the pair of them would die well yes what else was there he returned urquhart was waiting for him intensely awake to everything old chap said james that's no go i didn't try the snow but i can judge distances it's a deuce of a way down even if there is a way and it's all right urquhart said there isn't a way i'm cornered this time but there's just a chance for you if you work at it it'll begin to freeze in fact it has begun already now if you can find the shovel you might employ yourself finely digging a stairway you'll be up by midnight never mind about me james said i'm going to keep you warm first but urquhart was fretting he frowned and moved his head about no no don't begin that it's not worth it and i can't have you do it you ought to know who i am before you begin the good samaritan stunt i want to talk to you while i can i've got a good deal to tell you that will be better for me than anything jimmy was prepared for something of the kind i believe it will he said go on then and get it over it had been his first impulse to assure the poor chap that he knew all about it but a right instinct stopped him he would have to hear it so urquhart began his plain tale and as he got into it the contrast between it and himself became revolting even to him a hale man might have brazened it out with a better air a little of the romance with which it had begun which indeed alone made it tolerable would have been about it still a sicker man than urquhart who made a hard death for himself would have given up the battle thrown himself at james's feet and asked no quarter urquhart was not so far gone as that a little bluster remained he did it badly he didn't mean to be brutal he meant to be honest but it sounded brutal and james could hardly endure it he saw too as the poor chap went on that he was getting angry and doing himself harm that was so every step he took in his narrative sharpened the edge of the fate which cut him off he would have made a success of it if he could but he had been really broken before he broke his back and the knowledge exasperated him so he took refuge in bluster made himself out worse than he was and in so doing distorted lucy james was in torment remembering what he must he felt her arms close about his neck he felt the rush of her words and oh darling i thought it was you of course i thought so and i was proud and happy that you should like me so much i looked at myself in the glass afterwards i thought 'you must be rather pretty' oh heaven and this mocking dying devil with his triumphs say no more man say no more broke from him i understand the rest i have nothing to say to you you did badly you did me a wrong and her too but it's done with and she god bless her can take no harm how can she she acted throughout with a pure mind she thought that you were me and when she found that you weren't well well take your pride in that i give it up to you why shouldn't i she gave you her innocent heart i don't grudge you you needn't said urquhart since i'm a dead man but if i had been a living one who knows he laughed bitterly and stung the other you forget one thing said james with something of his old frozen calm for all that you knew ten minutes after you had left my house that day the first of them i might have benefited by your act and you been none the wiser nor i any the worse off and there would have been an end of it urquhart considered the point james could have seen it working in his poor wicked silly mind but kept his face away yes urquhart said you might but you didn't then he laughed again not a pleasant sound man said james indignant don't you see what robs me of utterance is that i have benefited by what you have done it's more than you have deserved in my opinion urquhart retorted i'll ask you not to forget that she has loved me and doesn't blame me and i'll ask you not to forget that it is i who am telling you all this and not she it was his last bite the retort was easy and would have crushed him but james did not make it let him have his pitiful triumph he was not angry any more he couldn't be and there was lucy to be thought of what would urquhart think of a lucy who could have revealed such things as these he would have judged her brazen little knowing the warm passion of her tears ah not for him these holy moments no let him die thinking honour of her honour according to his own code he put his hand out and touched urquhart's face with the back of it let us leave it at this he said we both love her we are neither of us fit she would have taken either of us but i came first and then came lancelot and she loves the law put it no other way the law the law said the fretful smitten man the law of her nature said james he felt urquhart's piercing eyes to be upon him and schooled himself to face them and to smile into them to his surprise he saw them fill with tears you are a good chap urquhart said i never knew that before macartney blew his nose no more was said but the sufferer now allowed him to do what he would he chafed his hands and arms with brandy took off his boots and chafed his feet he succeeded in getting a certain warmth into him and into himself too he began to be hopeful i think i shall pull you through he told him you ought to be a pretty hard case i suppose you don't know how you came to fall so badly well i do urquhart said don't tell me if you'd rather not oh what does it matter now it was a whim james smiled another whim yes and another fiasco you see in a way i had dared you to come i admit that well i hadn't played fair i knew and you didn't that it was a bad job you can't get down this way not when the snow's like this oh can't you i think not well i ought to have told you i was tempted that's the worst thing i ever did i ask your pardon for that you have it old chap said james you can afford to be magnanimous urquhart snapped out fiercely damn it you have everything but i felt badly about it as i was going down and i thought 'they'll feel the break and know it's all over so i cut the painter do you see yes said james i see he did indeed see urquhart began to grow drowsy and to resent interference he was too far gone to think of anything but the moment's ease james on the other hand was entirely absorbed in his patient i'm not going to let you sleep he said it's no good making a fuss i've got the kinch on you now it was as much as he had the air was biting cold and the colder it got the more insistent on sleep urquhart became james stared about him was this the world that he knew were kindly creatures moving about somewhere in it helping each other was lucy in this place had she lain against his heart two nights ago had he been so blessed had life slipped by and was this the end which was the reality and which the dream if both had been real and this was the end of men's endeavour if this were death if one slipped out in this cur's way the tail between the legs why not end it he could sleep himself he thought suppose he lay by this brother cur of his and slept somewhere out beyond this cold there were men by firelight kissing their wives poor chaps they didn't know the end this was the end loneliness and cold yes but you could sleep suddenly he started intent and quivering he had heard a cry every fibre of him claimed life he listened breathlessly above the knocking of his own heart he heard it again no doubt at all he turned to urquhart and shook him they are coming they are coming we are going to be saved he was violently moved tears were streaming down his face urquhart out of those still aware dreadfully intelligent eyes seemed to see them coming whoever they were he too and his pitiful broken members were calling on life james on his feet shouted with might and main and presently was answered from near at hand then he saw lingen and the guide wading through the snow they have found us he told urquhart it's francis lingen and the guide how they've done it i don't pretend to guess they've got around the cornice urquhart said it can be done i know he seemed indifferent again even annoyed again that he couldn't be allowed to sleep james thought it a pose this time lingen out of breath but extremely triumphant met james thank god he said james with lifted brows waved his head backward to indicate the sufferer he's very bad he said how did you get him to come he meant the guide flaming lingen said i made him i was desperate i've never done such a thing before but i laid hands on him you are a brick said james lingen said it's something to know that you can throttle a man when you want to badly enough i hadn't the slightest idea it's a thing i never did before i rather like it throttled or not the guide saved the situation he saved it undisguisedly for his own sake for he had no zest for helping to carry a bier over the folgefond they made a litter of alpen stocks and the mackintosh and so between them carried urquhart down the mountain no need to dwell on it they reached the hotel at odde about midnight but halfway to it they found help chapter xxiv urquhart's apology macartney was right when he said to lucy in talking over the adventure that urquhart had no moral sense though she had not then been convinced but she was to be convinced before she had done with him he asked for her repeatedly and with no regard at all to what had happened at last he was told that if he excited himself she would leave the hotel vera nugent told him that having installed herself his nurse vera who knew nothing but suspected much guessed that macartney had had as much of her brother as he cared about as for lucy on the whole she despised her for preferring james with the law to jimmy without it in this she did little justice to james's use of his advantage but as i say she didn't know what had happened all she could see for herself was that where she had once had a faible for urquhart she was now ridiculously in love with her husband vera thought that any woman was ridiculous who fell into that position she was not alone in the opinion however the main thing was that jimmy shouldn't fret himself into a fever if he kept quiet she believed that he would recover there was no dislocation the doctors told her but a very bad wrench he must be perfectly still and we should see lucy was not told how impatiently she was awaited james maybe did not know anything about it he felt great delicacy in telling what he had to tell her of the events of that day but she guessed nearly everything even that urquhart had intended to break his own neck he would she said being in a stare he's like that james agreed but pointed out that it had nearly involved his own end likewise lucy stared on but said that wouldn't occur to him at the time no said james on the contrary it had occurred to him at the time that if he cut the rope he james would immediately turn for home she nodded her head several times he's like that and then she turned and hid her face it's all dreadful she said i don't want to know any more it was then that james pronounced upon urquhart's absence of morality and found out that she was very much interested in him anyhow she was curious about what had passed between him and james for she was sure that there had been something james admitted that it was very uncomfortable he said i cut him as short as i could but i was awfully sorry for him after all i had scored you see she gave him a long look yes you scored all ways because it was only when i was angry with you that i thought he might do there could be no comment on that then she said i'm thankful that i told you everything before he did so am i by jove said james he put his arm round her if you hadn't he said i think i could have let him die lucy shook her head no you wouldn't have done that he would have but not you if you had been capable of that you wouldn't have called me to come to you as you did that day he knew which day she meant and felt it necessary to tell her something about it on that day he said though you didn't know it i was awfully in love with you she looked at him wonderfully no i didn't know that what a donkey i was but i was wretched i simply longed for you if you hadn't cried you would never have had me that she understood you wanted to pity me no i had been afraid of you your tears brought you down to earth that's poetry said lucy it's the nature of man he maintained she wanted to know if he minded her seeing urquhart he did very much but wouldn't say so you needn't mind a bit she told him he has terrified me i'm not adventurous at all besides besides no no not now she would say nothing more an expedition was made to the foot of the snow field for the benefit of the boys from a distance they saw the great cornice and the plateau where james had watched by urquhart lancelot was here confronted with irony for the first time his loyalty was severely tried by rights mr urquhart ought to have rescued the lot not for a moment could he doubt of that as for his father accepted on all hands as a hero there were difficulties in the way which he could not get over he had to go very warily to work because of his mother but he went as far as he could why was it that mr urquhart was hurt and father was not when they both had the same drop lucy could only say that father dropped better or fell better and then there was a pause what with an eyeglass he allowed himself that with her but with patrick nugent he was short and stern patrick had said something of the same kind as they were journeying home together why hadn't lancelot's governor smashed his eyeglass when he dropped lancelot sniffed offence immediately and snorted hoo jolly good thing for him he didn't it kept the cold out of his eye it's like feeding a mouse when you're a prisoner in dungeons afterwards it comes and gnaws the rope pooh any ass could see that and so much for patrick and cheek but the sick man fretting in his bed took short views to see lucy again had become so desirable that he could think of nothing else she glanced before him as a promise and his nature was such that a promise was halfway to a fulfilling as strength grew so did he wax sanguine and amused himself by reconstructing his spanish castle vera nugent gave him no encouragement and perhaps overdid it hadn't you really better let the woman alone she's perfectly happy in spite of you he could afford to laugh at this she doesn't know what happiness is she thinks it is safety i could teach her better you've made a great mess of it so far vera said he ignored that you say that she's happy i suggest that she is merely snug that's what a dormouse calls happiness well there's a good deal of the dormouse in lucy vera said if you stroke her she shines silence he cried sharply out you don't know anything at all i have had her radiant like a moonstone when am i to see her i'll tell her that you want to see her but it would be reasonable if she refused she won't refuse he said james must be told of course he took it quietly yes on the whole yes i don't think you can refuse him that it will try you it will be horrid but anyhow you know everything he can say he doesn't know that i do he'll build on that build said lucy quickly what sort of building oh fantastic architecture bowers by bendemeer never mind are you going yes said lucy slowly yes i'll go now she went to him and put her hands on his shoulders her eyes searched his face and found it inscrutable you mind she said i know you do you ought not but i'm glad of it he humbled himself at once they parted as lovers part but for the life of him he could not understand how she could find the heart to go with himself now it would have been a point of honour not to go he did not see that the more a woman loves the more love she has to spare vera nugent took her into the room pausing outside the door you'll find him very jumpy she said and then my dear you're so sensible lucy who knew that she meant precisely the opposite said no i don't think i am i'm excitable myself what do you want me to do keep cool said vera he won't like it but it's important then they went in jimmy here's mrs macartney the quick eyes from the bed had been upon her from the first it was immediately evident to her that she was not to be spared she heard his at last and braced herself for what that might mean i should have come before if the doctors had approved so would james and lancelot she said as briskly as she might he took no notice of her addition vera nugent saying don't let him talk too much then left her with him she began matter of fact enquiries but he soon showed her that she had not been brought in for such platitude he played the mastery of the invalid without hesitation oh i'm very sick you know they tell me that i shall be as fit as ever i was if i behave but really i don't know i've a good deal behind me and not much before so that i'm comparatively indifferent how the thing goes look here lucy he said suddenly and she stiffened at her name i have to talk to you at last it's wonderful how we've put it off but here it has come she said in low tones i don't see why we should talk about anything i would much rather not everything is changed now everything urquhart began with a touch of asperity ill disguised might one be allowed to enquire scared perhaps by his pomposity he broke off no that won't do i'll ask you simply what has happened you liked me to say no more now you don't no no don't protest yet leave it at that well and then there's macartney macartney didn't know you existed now he doesn't see that any one else does what has happened lucy she was annoyed at his lucy annoyed that she could be annoyed annoyed at his question and his right to ask it which she had given him mostly perhaps she was annoyed because her answer must sound ridiculous hateful that such should be the lot of men and wives she repeated his question what has happened i don't know how to tell you i found out before we started james found out please don't ask me to talk about it believe me when i say that everything is changed i can't say more than that he didn't move his eyes from her she knew they were there though she would not face them everything isn't changed i'm not changed i don't know that you are although you say so she faced him indeed i am i hope you'll understand that he frowned his fever flushed him you can't be we can never be ordinary acquaintance i have kissed you you had no right you have kissed me you are cruel indeed i am not cruel i don't pretend to excuse myself the first time it was the act of a cad but i worked it all out it couldn't fail i knew exactly how it would be you would of course think it was he you would be awfully touched awfully pleased set up and you were i saw that you were when we all came into the room you went over and stood by him you put your hand on his arm i said 'you divine beautiful tender thing now i'll go through the fire to get you' lucy had covered her face with her hands but now she lifted it and showed him as it might be the eyes of an assessing angel you went through no fire at all but you put me in the fire but he continued as if she had said nothing material i had made up my mind to be satisfied i thought if i could see you exalted proud of what you had that would be enough but you found him out and then you found me out too and we never spoke of it but there it was lucy all the time and there it is still my dear her face was aflame but her eyes clear and cold no she said it's not there there is nothing there at all you are nothing to me but a thought of shame i think i deserve all that you can say but surely you have said enough to me now i must leave you if you go on with this conversation nothing whatever is there he laughed not harshly but comfortably as a man does who is sure of himself yes there is something there still i count on that there is a common knowledge unshared by any one but you and me he would have it so i was ready to tell him everything but he wouldn't hear me it was honourable of him i admired him for it but it left me sharing something with you she stared at him as if he had insulted her in the street what can you mean how could he want to hear from you what he knew already from me urquhart went pale grey patches showed on his cheeks and spread like dry places in the sand you told him everything two nights before you went he fell silent his eyes left her face power seemed to leave him that tears it he said that does for me he was so utterly disconcerted that she could have pitied him so that's why he didn't want to hear me no wonder but why didn't he tell me that he knew it i taunted him with not knowing he turned towards her his eyes were bright with fever if you know perhaps you'll tell me lucy said proudly i believe i know he didn't want to change your thoughts of me he received that in silence then he said by george he's a better man than i am lucy said yes he is her head was very fixed her neck very stiff she was really angry and urquhart had sense enough to see it she got up to leave him really angry but unwilling to appear so you must forget all this she said and get well then you will do wonderful things he said i've been a blackguard but i meant something better oh i am sure you did she said warmly i won't see macartney if he doesn't mind tell him from me that he's a better man than i am he won't believe you said lucy oh yes he will urquhart held good bye love to lancelot that melted her don't give us up we are all your friends now he wouldn't have it no i am a neck or nothing man it can't be there's no cake in the cupboard i've eaten it send vera in if you see her about good bye she left him she went through the hall with a word to vera who was writing letters there he asked for you vera looked up at her he's excited i suppose no not now said lucy then she went into the sitting room and saw the party at tea on the balcony james paused in his careful occupations and focussed her with his eyeglass she went quickly to the table oh let me do it let me and then she sighed deeply hulloa said james knowing very well what's up she poured the tea only that i'm glad to be here glances were exchanged quick but reassuring lancelot said there's a ripping cake mr urquhart would like some i bet you lucy said he can't have any cake just yet upon which remark she avoided james's eye and eyeglass with great care but on a swift afterthought she stooped and kissed lancelot epilogue really the only fact i feel called upon to add is the following announcement culled from a fashionable newspaper on the rd june we read at onslow square to mr and mrs james adolphus macartney a daughter that ought to do instead of the wedding bells once demanded by the average reader let it then stand for the point of my pair's pilgrimage i promised a romantic james and have given you a sentimental one it is a most unfortunate thing that it should be thought ridiculous for a man to fall in love with his wife for his wife to fall in love with him and we have to thank i believe the high romanticks for it they must have devilry it seems or cayenne pepper but i say scorn not the sentimental though it be barley sugar to ambrosia a canary's flight to a skylark's scorn it not it's the romantic of the unimaginative and if it won't serve for a magic carpet it makes a useful anti macassar the macartneys saw no more of urquhart who however recovered the use of his backbone and with it his zest for the upper air he sent lucy some flowers after the event of june and later on at the end of july a letter which i reproduce quid plura i had news of you and greeted it and am gone i have hired myself to the greeks for the air i take two machines of my own and an m b if you can forgive me when i have worked out my right we shall meet again if you i shall know and keep off good bye lucy j u the one thing i can't forgive myself was the first a wild impulse but a cad's all the rest was inevitable good bye she asked lancelot what quid plura meant he snorted hoo stale it means what are you crying about naturally who said it that letter who's it from mr urquhart i suppose yes it's from mr urquhart to say good bye he's going to greece to fly for the navy oh rather sport has he gone yes dear i think so you'll write to him i suppose i might i shall too then rather i should think so the end transcriber's note inconsistencies in hyphenation have been
