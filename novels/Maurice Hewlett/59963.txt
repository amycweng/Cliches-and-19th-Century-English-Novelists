mr germain takes notice it was when mr john germain a gentleman of fifty and of fine landed estate in berkshead of his family deputylieutenant chairman of quarter sessions and i dont know what notwas paying one of his yearly visits to his brother james who was rector of misperton brand in somerset that an adventure of a sentimental kind presented itself to him engaged him carried him into midair upon a winged horse and set him treading clouds and suchlike filmy footing chancecaught combinations associations tenderly touchedwhat do i know he had a vision and located it he dreamed a dream and began to live it out out of a simple maid he read a young goddess into a lovers ardent form he pressed his leanness and grey hairs bluntly he a widower of ten years standing fell in love with a young person half his age and of no estate at allbut quite the contrary and after an interval of time which he chose to ignore applied himself earnestly to the practice of poetry there ensued certain curious relationships between quite ordinary people which justify me in calling my book a comedy of degrees this sudden seizure of the heart overtook him one afternoon in july on the occasion of a sundayschool feast an annual affair he had lent himself to that because while he claimed his mornings his afternoons were always at the disposition of his hostess and sisterinlaw the hon mrs james germain who naturally made the most of them she of course must be present at the affair must have a teaparty for the notables the cantacutes always came and the binghams there might be others john must really consent to be bored there would be no occasion to pass the railing which separated the revellers in the paddock from the rectory lawn all he had to do was to show himself and allow mrs bingham to talk round about him true the afternoon was very hot but the rectory garden was at its best velvetlawned shady and trim mr germain confessed that it was the very day for outofdoor merrymakingby other peopleand smilingly added that the exertion of the schoolfeasters would lend a savour to the leisure he was promised he appearedsomewhat latein a suit of summer coolness and white spats and was charming with lady cantacute an old friend perfect with mrs bingham whose fault was that she was too anxious to please in the absence of the rector and lord cantacute who were conferring on parish business these ladies made much of their cavalier he had a comfortable chair which allowed him to stretch his long legs before him at the right and only angle leisurely and measured in all that he did talking but little he was allowed to feel that his presence was the utmost that would be asked of him and that leisure and measure were at his disposal when therefore he had said all that seemed proper he adjusted his glasses gave one glance to the white spat upon the foot of his crossed leg put his elbows on the arms of his chair clasped his hands and set himself to observe the sports all was well with the world so far and hethe handsome finefeatured thin gentlemanas good a thing as this fraction of a world contained he was in the mood to receive impressions and be charitable to them this was the moment chosen by the blind god the flags drooped lazily about their poles the great elms beyond the paddock seemed muffled in their july wrappage and a swoon but over the sward the figures of the children and their friends flashed and darted and crossed each other as on a scene a stentorian curate in black and white cap directed the cricket mr germain marked his flying coattails and approved them ha my excellent friend soames he reflected aloud and added that years left no marks upon soames the swiping boys were young england at playour future was safe in their hands soames to urge them he had his own ideas about our future and called himself a liberal in politics but confessed that young england was all the better for a soames or two to guide it he was a sound churchman his benevolent eye seeking other objects of interest was now turned to the girls oranges and lemons was the cry with them a pretty game as elaborate and rhythmical as an oldworld dance with a romp interposed two of the tallest hold the gatetheir raised arms make it about the skirts of each you see the clustered bevy of her capture the doomed ones creep in a file beneath their hands the singsong swells rises grows holdsand presently falls with the blow the gatekeepers stoop they clasp they catch close some struggling prisoner hot cheek lies fast to pillowing breast laughing child to laughing maid it is the strife of love in a dream like all figuredances it figures that for what cuddling girl but mimics there the transports she is to know one day sometimes the captive breaks away and runs then must the taker give chase and as the race is swift and may be long so is the end the sweeter both for huntress and for quarry kisses mark the end you die of a surfeit of kisses the strife of love in a dreama gentle innocent parody of it whether these amiable musings were cause or consequence of what happened to catch mr germains eye more than once or twice theres no telling i content myself with recording that the most active of those young people beyond the railings was a graceful quicklimbed girl in white muslinwhose long black sashribbons and widebrimmed hat of straw marked her vividly out for his contemplation he was nearsighted and could get no details but was agreeably aware of her as the swiftest in pursuit the hardiest to catch and hold to be chased by whom and to be caught was the aim of every flying child she was the beloved it was plain her close arms the haven of choice sitting in the pleasant shade at peace with himself and all mankind mr germain found in her a stimulating vein for thought to explore and pursued it with zest while lady cantacute murmured dear things at intervals or sighed for tea and mrs bingham felt it her duty as a guest to envy the lot of misperton rectory she had envied the garden the weather the curate the cricket field and might have gone on to covet her friend her rector had not the i say aggie from her youngest daughter cecily given her a new object to admire aggie i say said cecily to her sister you knowthat girl can run mr john germain as the pivot of his thoughts was touched turned with animation to the speaker indeed yes she runs like atalanta miss cecily if you know who atalanta was miss cecily wriggled she was fifteen yes i know she raced with milanion and picked up the apple i dont think marys a bit like her she is as swift i am sure said mr germain but its true she has not yet picked up the apple perhaps that will lie in front of her some day and then shell be caught he didnt catch her said cecily she stopped and he won true mr germain replied smiling you and i mean the same thing i believe to this miss cecily had no reply but a sudden jerk of the leg mrs bingham beamed upon her hostess the earthly paradise my cecily adores it but who is their atalanta dear mrs germain mrs james germain said that she had no notion which was quite untrue aggie replied to her mother by pointing out the nymph of the chase mrs bingham clasped her hands there again your extraordinary fortune mary of coursethat nice teacher you have quite a charming person mrs germain primmed her lips very charming i believe but shes in private service do you mean shes somebodys maid constantia this came briskly from lady cantacute who knew very well what had been meant but had a kind heart mr john germain while watching the players listened i think you must know her mrs james explained she is governessi suppose you would call itto nunns family nurserygoverness i fancy is the phrase she teaches in our sundayschool it is true but that is a privilege rather than a duty at least we consider it so quite so quite so said mrs bingham you mean that one doesnt pay of course one doesnt replied the rectors wife and would have closed the discussion but her brotherinlaw reopened it by saying that she appeared to him an attractive young lady and caused mrs james to sniff i should not have said that indeed we think her plain surely enough of the young person but the conversation hung about her yet she has pretty manners lady cantacute considered and her eyes were good mrs james allowed her eyes they speak i believe upon occasion she added but i am rather deaf to that kind of language perhaps my dear constantia they dont address themselves to you said lady cantacute and mr germain stretching his arms forward to the fulness of comfort resumed his observation of oranges and lemons cecily bingham heard the click of his clasped fingers very possibly i should be the last to receive them mrs james was heard to say though i believe they address themselves otherwise impartially i am sure she is a good girl said mrs bingham and to that the lady of misperton said we all hope so a merry a warmhearted girl mr germain was confident of that when a child of her party tripped in running and fell how she picked her up and sitting cradled her upon her lap and soothed her with voice and soft cheek and quick kissing lips a pretty sight a gracious act sweetly done absorbed he lost the thread of the talk about him but awoke to hear his sisterinlaws tones of authority telling mrs bingham things which he wished to know yes middlehammary middlehamno shes three or four and twenty i believe she has been here a year or twoteaching the little nunns no no french and the merest rudiments of piano but for children of that position piano i consider absurd nunn is a most sensible manno airs at all yes she has nice ways with children they mind her and like her too really she and soames manage everythingbutthat is most tiresome mrs james sat upright i must speak to her i see that they are doing precisely what i did not intend with the tea its very stupid of mrs blain ill send somebody for her if i she looked about her vaguely offended that a footman did not emerge from the clump of pampas andcecily darling said mrs bingham cecily jumped up ill go mrs germain that is very nice of you my dear do tell mary that i want to speak to her here miss cecily vaulted her black legs over the railing and ran up the field whistling conversation unaided now by mrs germain ran a languid course but oranges and lemons stopped short and crimped tresses could be swept from shoulders and eyes the better to regard miss cecily from the rectory party presently after an eager colloquy expressive on one side of dismay and disarray miss cecily was seen returning with her convoy talking gaily the captive nymph though still busy with hat and hairpins or fanning herself with her pocket handkerchief walked confidently carried her head well and joined happily in the laugh this until within hail but then she changed her tongue was still her head was bent the least in the world and her eyes became guarded and watchful at the railing which miss cecily again neatly vaulted miss middleham paused and blushed before she climbed but she had nothing to be afraid of for mr germain was looking at his white spats when she stood before her betters however he following her example stood before her and now he observed her sedately he was struck first by a caution in her fine eyes which caused them to loom as with reproach to peer as if she doubted her colour heightened by exertion and perhaps by shyness was very becoming to her she glowed like a peach burnt by the sun she looked wholesome and healthy and her voice did not belie her appearancea fresh confident young voice she kept her hands behind heras if she were a catechumenand with her shoulders back looked watchfully at you as she listened and replied the attitude showed her figure to be charmingsoftly tenderly curved a budding figure undoubtedly she was pleasant to behold but she would have been no more to any one but a confirmed amorist had it not been for her eyes mr germain was little of an amorist by temperament though time and the hour had led him to muse over maids at play and that being so he was shocked rather than struck by the discrepancy between the playing nymph of his fancies and this healthy sunburnt girl with peering eyes it almost shocked him to see her so wary it gave her a guilty look as if she feared detection momently he thought of a squirrel in leafage of a dormouse by a treebole he thought above all of flinching of harsh treatment of the whip great god he cried to himself what a state of things is this when upon a summons suddenly flashing limbs grow stiff and sparkling eyes burn large with apprehension and then he said in his heart to woo the confidence back to such eyes to still the doubts in such a breast were work for a true man from the height of his argument to the flat of the facts is a longish drop the catechism had taken this simple form mary mrs germain had said with something but very little after all of the air of a proprietor i see that they are bringing out the tea yes mrs germain a young fresh confident voice surely it is not time tea was to be at four mrs germain oh well the rector is busy with his lordship and cannot be disturbed tea must not begin until he can say grace very well mrs germain but mr soames no doubt but i dont wish mr soames to say grace this was explained to mrs bingham mr soames is a most worthy young manwe are fortunate in him but he knows only two forms of gracebenedictus benedicat which is of course absurd and for these and all thy mercies oh said lady cantacute and wont that do mrs james looked to the treetops we think that village children should be taught to expect other things besides mercies james always says for what we are about to receive which of course might be anything i suppose it might poor things said lady cantacute comfortably and mrs bingham whispered so sensible to her eldest daughter besides the rector is the proper person on such a day see to it if you please mary very well mrs germain she lowered her eyes again directly she had spoken as she was apt to do before her notables my dear said lady cantacute suddenly you look very hot she now looked hotter but she laughed as she admitted the fact laughing became her mr germain admired her teethsmall white and so far as he could see perfect he formed a higher opinion of lady cantacutes characteran old friend to make a young girl smile and show her teeth is to use both tact and benevolencenatural benevolence it is a very hot afternoon he said as if delivering a considered judgment and as he blinked upon her she flashed him one of her hasty looks yes it is mr germain and i think you must be a most unselfish young lady oh no mr germain indeed she was quite pleased and looked very pretty when pleased but i must maintain that you are you put us luxurious people to shame now miss cecily and i will undertake to help you after tea is that a bargain miss cecily cecily looked dogged and said if he liked all well at home dear child mrs bingham asked here and made cecily snort i am afraid too that she nudged her sister agatha quite well thank you mrs she stopped her voice tailing off into breath as if she guessed that she had been using too many names just now and yet knew that from her sort the full title was expected conversation not being resumed mrs james said shortly that will do mary i think see about the tea will you miss middleham promised and retired with veiled eyes and an inclination of the head but cecily asked may i go with her mother and went without the answer their backs turned the rail safely over there was a different miss middleham to be found the sparkling audacious merry miss middleham of oranges and lemons who to cecily binghams i say i can run replied and so can i you know and egged cecily on to propose lets race to that clump of grass miss middleham flew and cecily tumbled on to her at the winning post they resumed their way close together her arm within mary middlehams cecily talked in jerks between breaths i sayold germain talked a lot about you the colour flew over marys face was reflected in her eyes no did he really i swear he did he called you atalanta he saidi saywasnt it rot of mother asking after your people she hadnt the faintest idea whether you had any and didnti suppose you have though i have indeedlots ive got four sisters oh sisters no brothers she shook her head ive got one said cecily and hes at eton all the summer jolly for him very jolly i should think now i am to tell mr soames about the tea dont run away rather not ill wait here for you i hate curates fathers got twoone tame one and one wild one we call them romulus and remus after some puppies we had once they separated with eyesignals mr soamesthe rev seymour soames bawas explicitly a curate flaminghaired crimson spectacled and boyish he was very enthusiastic and when enthusiastic could not always rely upon his voice being now told his affair he said i see very often and concluded very well miss mary ill do as im toldas you tell me you know youre the queen of this beanfeast im not above taking orders from the head of affairs you see it was indeed to be seen that he was not thank you mr soames said the mary of laughing eyes and as she went he sighed collected himself and plunged into hectoring the urnbearers miss middleham and her young friend strolled off arminarm and the last thing to be heard spoken between them was what did mr germain really say the rest was whispers ii mr germain revels sedately conversation within the rectory garden did not could not revive until the young footman released from his urnbondage could bring out the teatray punctually with that glittering apparatus came the rector and lord cantacute prosperous clean leisurely gentlemen both the peer with a huntsmans face and white whiskers a squaretopped felt hat and neatly folded white tie with a foxhead pin mr james germain thin smiling and fastidious amused at his own benevolence a little desultory talk flickered up on their approach the rector was packed off to say grace for what the revellers might be about to receive lord cantacute took his tea and asked wheres hertha miss hertha de speyne was only child of his noble house herthas gone to play tennis at the cottagein this grilling heat said her ladyship but shes to be here to tea mrs duplessis is very sadly im told ah and she put up her lorgnette here they come dear things a tall young man in white flannels accompanied a tall young lady also in white round the house what a pair murmured mrs bingham to her eldest daughter and caused lady cantacute to say rather sharply not at all theyve known each other from the cradle mr tristram duplessis was this young mana cousin of mrs james germains he was goodlooking every foot of him and there were six highcoloured light in the eye he had a profusion of fair and straight hair which he was accustomed to jerk away from his forehead and a trick of knitting his brows as if he scowled and of biting his cheek as if he was annoyed very frequently he was apart from these peculiarities his manners were easymr john germain thought much too easy one of his least pleasing habits was his way of looking at you in conversation as if you were either ridiculous or his property mr germain very sure of being neither did not pretend to like this youth he was greeted with hows your mother tristram from lady cantacute and replied i believe shes illat least she says so whereat the second miss bingham choked in her teacup and mr duplessis looked at her for a minute with narrowed eyes mrs bingham said oh i hope not with solicitude naturally said duplessis and so do i i can only tell you what she says he helped himself to bread butter and jam took the chair which had of late been mr john germains and ate in silence and complete comfort miss de speyne helped herself too her tennis dress had the air of a riding habit and her person that of a young amazon she was not only sumptuous but severe a golden beauty as nearly indifferent to the fact as a girl may be helen of troy fancyfree before paris beguiled her she had been calledbut the diana of the louvre comes readiest to mind mr john germain seeing his chair in possessionand in that of duplessiscrossed the railing and walked over the field towards the trestletables where the scholars feasted miss binghamthe eldestand duplessis were now side by side your young lady has made another conquest she told him and nodded towards the severe retreating form duplessis observed her calmly its no good mildred he said you cant get a rise out of me you know she laughed i think ive been saved the trouble i was only calling your attention to it he is greatly interested the young mans answer was to look at mr germain retreating still in a stately manner and then at mildred bingham graphic commentary enough when mr germain approached the tables miss middleham who had been very aware of his coming became instantly circumspect he advanced deliberately and stood by her side for a while without speaking he then offered himself to hand teacups and when she assured him that the work was done held to his post without any more words or seeming embarrassment he was affable to mr soames if somewhat lofty spoke of cricket and cricketers the performances of somerset and of its champion whom he was careful to call mr palairet for berks his own county he apologized he had a theory not fully worked out yet that the scandinavian blood in us produced the best athletes consider yorkshire and lancashire kent too there was an undoubted strain of the norseman in kent surrey was against himapparently but he could not admit it of course london gave the pick of everything surrey a metropolitan shire could hardly be reckoned nor by a parity of reasoning middlesex mr soames who had not hitherto considered the ethnological side of his game shook his head and said no by jingo then plunged to another table and appeared to be busy mr germain turned to miss middleham and begged to know how he could be of service i must make good my boast i rely upon the loyalty of miss cecily bingham do you play after tea she said that there would be games for instance he inquired and mr soames who was now hovering near again said we shall finish the match perhaps you would care to umpire but mr germain had picked up a small wooden implement and was turning it about like a fan bat trap and ball he supposed she laughed him yes very well then said he you shall allow me to help you in bat trap and ball cecily binghams eyes had now to be avoided at all costs the tall stiffshouldered gentleman made good his wordif that can be called playing the game where a player never hits the ball frequently himself and once with a resounding smack the boy fielding behind him grouped girls admired with open mouths but the temptation to giggle when he caught himself for the second time upon the elbow and betrayed something of the torment he suffered was not to be resisted miss middleham bit her lip but turned to rend one of her pupils gracie she said in a fierce whisper if you dare to laugh ill never speak to you again here comes tristram said cecily but miss middleham had no need to be told that she was very busy teaching a small boy how to wield the bat which mr germain now hastened to discard thank you mr germain she said sincerely its very kind of you i am delighted to have been of the least service to you he replied with a bow you set us all an example which i for one am proud to follow the games languished flickered out under the calm eyes of mr duplessis but he took no part in reviving them nor did miss middleham do more than pretend to instruct he stood hands in pockets for a while looking at nothing whistling softly to himself then strolled towards mary middleham and without looking at her said two or three words she listened to them intently without turning her head said yes and went on with her business of the moment still whistling duplessis strolled away and in passing tweaked cecily binghams straight hair mr germain after salutations of a courtly kind had returned leisurely to the rectory gardento help his sisterinlaw feel the early peaches on the wall iii mr duplessis prevaricates that evening there was a vacant place at the rectory dinnertable tristram duplessis was to have filled it but did not appear until dessert he entered then with smiles and lighthearted apologies it isnt often that i work youll say but when i do i believe im not to be restrained thanks molesworth anything will do for me this was how he put it first to his hostess next to the anxious butler each of whom knew better he chose to add for the general benefit as a matter of fact i got interested and entirely forgot that a man must eat or behave himself said the rector with lifted brows duplessis paused soupspoon in air he should no doubt thats why im so late i had to dress you see anon soames must needs come in and talk his cricket they play cromberton tomorrow and are two short will i be one and bring another man says soames the spoon was emptied and put down i half promised to bring you you know germain this was suavely addressed to mr john germain who unblinkingly received it where is your match mr germain was peeling a peach and did not look up he was told a home match and then without faltering before the you play of as rude a young man as these islands can contain replied deliberately i am very ready to oblige mr soames the hush upon the dinnertable which followed this declaration was its most eloquent commentary mrs james germain surveyed the walls as if calling them to witness her secret thoughts the rector drained his glass of sherry and took another my dear fellow you make me feel an old fogey he said do you know that ive not had a bat in my hand since i left cambridge and youll forgive me for remarking that you havent either to the best of my belief mr germain whose serenity was proof reflected before he replied that that seemed an excellent reason for having one tomorrow assuredly he said i shall rally to mr soames with whom i had a little chat this afternoon he seemed an amiable and intelligent young man i like soames the rector agreed hes a worker mrs james said sharply he needs to be and received a bow my dear it is now you who put me to shame not in the least james cried the lady you are as incapable of the feeling as i am of the action the rector twinkled shameless really my dear while soames plays cricket cousin james writes sound theology said duplessis and got the lady off the rocks mr john germain was now sedately sipping his port that was a pleasant girl you had here he said and got his sisterinlaws attention duplessis did not look up from his plate but he listened you mean i suppose i mean mrs binghams girlthe youngest of the three i had a little chat with her tooover our games i was pleased with her friendly ways they sit charmingly upon young ladies who are so apt to think that because their frocks are short their manners may be mrs james spoke to her plate i think i understand but am not altogether prepared to agree with you of course at such gatherings one welcomes help but i doubt whether it is wise to put ideas into heads which which are not capable of holding em asked the rector using his eyebrows which can have little or no use for them perhaps mr germain having given this oracle due attention pronounced upon it as if he were admonishing a poacher i am constrained to say that i did not observe a preponderance of ideas in miss cecilys conversation took the rails very neatly i thought duplessis put in but mrs james was not to be balked i dont object to her taking rails or anything else of the sort but i certainly think it a pity that she should take mary middlehams arm and walk among the children as if they were bosom friends mr germain squared his shoulders and lifted his head to reply miss middleham he said but he was a slow beginner mrs james had risen it was her husband who fired the parting shot that he would as soon take mary middlehams arm as that of any one in the parish and it was duplessis with his hand on the door who received her answering shake of the head and peered after her with quizzical eyes conversation at her exit was between those two john germain never spoke to the young man if he could help it and if he had occasion to look at him always blinked as he did so just now he had no occasion being occupied with his thoughts smiling quietly at them drumming time to them with his thin fingers on the table we must inquire into mr tristrams avowed labours and may not perhaps be surprised to find out of what nature they were they had taken him not to the study and the lamp but into lord cantacutes fine park by a wicket in the wall to a largely spreading oaktree and a seat upon the roots to elbows on knees a cigar and some moments of frowning meditation from which a light step upon the acorns caused him to look up but not to rise miss middleham very flushed and brighteyed approached she wore a cloak over her white dress watching her his eyes narrowed and as she came near hers lost much of their light good evening mr duplessis she said with careful formality he disregarded the greeting youre late my young friend then her grievance broke from her and her eyes were eloquent with reproach my heart is in my mouth i ought not to have come you ought not to expect it i dont he said i ask but i never expectand mostly i dont want whats the matter oh she sighed anythingeverything you never know who you may happen upon andif youre going to be cross with me im not my dear im only cross with things thatwell with other sorts of things come and sit down its all right now she obeyed but at some distance she arranged her skirts over her ankles and waited not without the colour of expectancy looking down at the toe of her shoe duplessis surveyed her at leisure well he said and flicked the ash from his cigar i observed your junketings at the rectory my dear you pleased she looked prim did i really you know that you did how did you find old germain he was very kind so i gathered but how was he kind he was very kind my dear girl i didnt ask you how kind he was but how was he kind i beg your pardon he praised me and you liked that she made some show of spirit of course i did we all doif we deserve it well pass the quibble welland did you deserve it he got a reproachful lookand was rewarded i did my best i got very hot and was overtired im awfully tired now if she expected pity from so naive an appeal she got none well why come out if you are tired she flamed because you asked mebecause you saidi wish i had not come with all my heart she was on the edge of tears i asked you because i thought that you would like to come i have had some reason to think so but we wont talk about it if it distresses you have you read my book she admitted that well her defences broken she looked at him for the first time it was very kind of you to let me read it but he couldnt have her praises oh kind everybodys kindto you what did you think about it that sent her eyelids down i dont suppose i understood half of it im not clever you know he chuckled im not sure about that did you like the saints walk it was beautiful it was all about you let me tell you you in that red frock you had she shook her head oh no no but i am telling you that it was it was an exercise perhapsan exercise in the scenic it may well be that there are no saintsbut either you can look the part or i can see you in it she may have had a sense that this kind of talk was intolerable and her silence may have expressed it or she may have been ashamed to find out that it was not intolerable at any rate she made no attempt to break down the arms length at which he chose to hold her while he continued to survey her and to entertain himself you cling to your saintship is that it she raised her eyebrows not her head you have just told me that i am not a saint i think that you know very well if you werei suppose you meanyou would not be talking to me under the royal oak she laughed ruefully no indeed i ought not to be here if she expected pitywas she to get it thus duplessis had no pity to bestow its not the first time we have met here is it extraordinary that to his screwing her nerves responded so faithfully there should never have been a time she said and meant it it was part of his luxury to be sure that she felt in the wrong why not he probed her airily if two people want to talk to each other what else are they to do and theres no doubt about our needs i suppose she had nothing to say to thatshe was discretion itself but the effect of her frugality was to bring him closer to where she sat do you care to keep my bookand before she could answerwell then keep it he said ill come up tomorrow and write your name in it and mine too would you like that tell me child but as she hung her head and had no words he had to tell himself his arm went about her he could feel her heart he drew her to him and her head lay on his breast thats well he said thats as it should always be you are made to be captured he had what he wanted of her after that that sense of fluttering under the hand of throbbing response to stroking phrases of which an epicure of the sort is never weary with power grew the lust of power if he could have made her see white black it would have gratified him he told her that he must soon go to london and made her lie the closer he told her that he loved her and made her sigh and cling he told her that she was that which indeed she was nota lover his little loverand felt the sweet flattery steal over her when she thrilled to it as the earth to a beam of the sun ravished by the thought of what he had to his hand he pressed her and bent over her where she crouched mary he whispered as he stooped no no she said and put up her lips that was the way of it the saying and doing not without a pathetic simplicity relished by him to the full exquisite little triumph which he was too wise to repeat he spent another twenty minutes discoursing of himself his works and plans believing her to be interestedas he was himselfhe became extremely kind forgot to be jealous of john germains notice forgot to require or exact anything from her forgot even to be rude really he parted from her with more politeness than he would have shown to one of his own classsay to miss de speyne he sought no more favours i shall see you in the distance tomorrow perhaps i play cricket for soamesi think he wants me i dont forget the book you may be sure good night it was nine oclock before he reached his mothers house and by that time miss middlehams person and his pleasure in it were absorbed into the vague physical comfort which a healthy young man feels in changing his clothes they gave a zest to his bath and clean linen quickened his brains and strung him to activity of a sort he sketched out an article for the weekly review which helped to support him chaffed soames and comfortably dressed himself for the rectory there as we know he prevaricated but there also he received some impressions which caused the image of mary middleham to visit him in the watches of the night he played with the thought of her as she now appeared to him a hint was enough she was no saint he had told her and he knew that for his purposes she was all the better for that old germain was clearly a victimold germain of all men possible how she attracted menwith her pallor and heavy lids and those peering looming speaking eyes beneath them what did she want of them love love and more loveinsatiable was sheand unappeasable a small secret pale and careworn little huntress hunting to be hunted never caught and never catching strange but there were women like that nympholeptsand wherein lay their charm for men oh well he knew he ought to know and germainold germaingreat heaven a little venusvenus toute entire and raised in a suburb earning her bread as a nurserygoverness stuff for a sonnet here he laughed and sketched it by the open window the thought was good it pleased excited him kept him wakeful a cigar into the still dark seemed reasonable she was charming her transparency was charming which made it so easy to see her little shifts and designs the casting of her homemade nets and setting of her primitive snares she betrayed her need so simply when once you had her confidence there were no more drawbacks no reticences by george she was as simply pagan as a south sea islander not a stitch on herand a scarlet flower between her teeth one might drown ones self in lovefor a seasonif one were a fool but one was not you see this simple creature this little suburban venus showed such extraordinary aptitude for the rarer thing was so susceptible to the finer shades of the business that one would need be a tearing fool if heno and it would be a shame he would never do that better on all accounts to be freebetter not commit ones self she would always be there could be counted upon he knew women he told himself they will wait for youwait for ever helped on by a little kindness its not love they want from youthey have more than enough of that themselves its tenderness once the imagination is really struck she oh there was no doubt about her she was his for all time sensitive flushing and paling creature alternately too bold and too coy bold when she ought notcoy when she need not these were flaws but he protested that they charmed him flaws there must be it was not reasonable to suppose himself pioneer in that little thicket and while the knowledge must cheapen yet it endeared her to him some subtle excitation of sense was stirred by that what now he probed but gave over the analysis damn it im too curious he said sonnets dont come this way i must compose her not dissect but there was to be no more composition of sonnets he had warped his mood so threw away his cigar and went to bed iv a miss and a catch as for mr germain whatever his nightly meditations or dreams may have been he was as good as his word and stoutly took the field on the morrow when misperton brand having lost the toss spread itself over the greensward under mr soamess eye and imperative hand mr soames was a bowler and desperately in earnest to see him marshal his field was a study in statesmanship knowledge of men went to it can you throw he had asked the stately gentleman who had somehow to be accounted for and when mr germain replied that he would do his best to oblige himverbum sap he said afterwards to duplessis i knew what that meant all right and put him cover he only missed two catches you know and one of em was old blacklock who simply has to make a run i dont call that so bad the game was played in the rectory field where the tent and trestletables and in truth some of the baked meats of a recent festival did duty for today behind the railings as before sat mrs james and her cantacutes miss de speyne was not there but mrs duplessis wasa carefully preserved lady handsome and fatigued on the further side of the field were benches and here also spectators clusteredfarmers ladies the doctor and his wife mr nunn the retired solicitor who lived at the sanctuary and employed miss middleham to look after his children young perivale the auctioneers son from townham the misses finch of stockfield peverel the misses wake and mary middleham was undoubtedly there with white sunshade her young charges about her or running from her to papa and back as needs might be and to miss middleham it undoubtedly was that mr germain on an occasion of attempting to retrieve a slashing cut by the butchers manand fruitlessly seeing he was outpaced by the second gardener from the rectorypaid the distinction of a salute before he returned leisurely to the fray she had been standing with a group of acquaintances of whom miss kitty wake miss sally wake and miss letty wakeall of whiteacre farmformed three and young perivale a fourth upon these young people the courtesy smote like a puff of wind perivale blinked and gracious whos that escaped miss sally and was caught and expounded by her sister kitty stupid its mr germain the rectors brother then he bowed to you mary said miss sally and as mary blushed young perivale ground his heel into a dandelion i dont wonder said this youth whose complaint was not hard to diagnose but the compliment was ignored by the misses wake whatever makes him play village cricket why his lordship never does nor the rectorand mr germain could buy up the pair of them i hear dont you call it singular mr perivale i do doesnt make much of it does he says perivale drily no certainly not why should he an old gentleman like that friendship required a protest and so miss kitty cried oh sally hes not a bit old marys corroboration being called for she said that she should not call him old well whatever he is hes very polite that bow of his my dear you might have been miss de speyne however did he know it was you at this distance perhaps he took his hat off to you sally mary said but miss sally would have none of that he looks straight at you as if he knew you by heart and then stiffens himself and off with his hat cricket hes no cricketerbut hes a gentleman so much all must admit mary mildly elated had no objection to further inquiries the former encounter mr germains deliberate advance into the schooltreat these wonders were revealed rolled on the tongue absorbed young mr perivale took a stroll and fiercely in the course of it asked a small boy what he was looking at hey but more wonders were to come mr germain refreshed himself with the players during the tea interval introduced himself to mr nunn of the sanctuary patted the heads of his brood and meeting miss middleham by the trestletable shook hands with her and held her in talk he deprecated his cricket with simplicity i reflect that it is fiveandtwenty years since i chased a cricket ball but you may see the force of your example miss middleham had you not inspired me to effort the other day i should hardly have embarked upon todays adventure she was prettily confusedher friends eyes upon her but he ambled on in his kindly way i put myself in the hands of my friend mr soames i was sure of his charitable discretion therefore when he asked me whether i could do this or that i did not tell him the facts because i did not know them and was so confident that he did i said that i should be happy to serve him which was perfectly true i based myself upon a famous french exemplar you know the anecdote a gentleman of that nation was asked whether he could take the violin part in a quartette he said that he did not know but that he would try one may admire his courage miss middleham was in this difficulty that she did not know whether the anecdote was amusing or not i suppose that he was not sure of the part she said no mr germain corrected her he meant that he did not know how to play the violin then she laughed more to cover her confusion than because she was tickled i like his attitude of mind i must say mr germain continued talking in the air the sonata doubtless mattered as little as this cricket match but neighbourliness is the great thing we have too little of that in england we segregate too willingly i fear i have no notion ofi beg your pardon while i have no notions you have no tea pray allow me to get you some he was a long time on this errandfor short sight and a complete absence of assertion do not help one to tea in a crowd but nobody dare engage miss middleham while she stood there so to speak earmarked for the great mans mr nunn her employer kept his flock carefully about him duplessis was over the railings in the rectory garden mr soames was exercising the hospitalities due from a captain to his rival the perivales wakes finches could but look on respectfully that they did her cup of tea her plate of bread and butter were handed to her with another fine bow but even then her cavalier did not consider himself discharged he stood to his post tall unperturbed using his pincenez to observe with gentle interest the audience which stood about not for a single moment realizing that it was an audience indeed but as he talked his amiable commonplaces he was very conscious of the young woman object of his attentions little escaped him there it was evident to him that she was pleased softly quietly thrilled by them and it gratified him extremely to feel that he could confer pleasure upon her while he took his own pleasure you see costs nothing therefore it is priceless it cannot be bought and yet can only be got by giving the distinction seemed to him material but he could not remember to have remarked it until the other day when lady cantacutea kind womanby a trivial remark had made this child forget her wariness and smile enchantingly since that moment he had pursued the thought and verified it he was verifying it now there was no possible doubt that he was giving and taking pleasure had there been anyof this you may be surehe would have known it he was sensitive in such matters he would have retired with a fine bow and resumed his isolation and his dreams the nursing of his secret fire i shall have described mr germain ill if i do not make it plain that he was perfectly honest simple very solemn rather dull a gentleman from the bone outwards miss sally was quite right there it was i am sure rather his education than his breeding which made him look upon his world his village native land the continent he happened to be visiting as either in his employment like his valet or a negligible quantity the same straightness of categories with an offensive twist has been observed in mr duplessis and is common to gentlemen by inheritance mr germain had that sickness mildly but unmistakably take the weather if the day was fine he was not insensible to that he wore white spats and took abroad a silverheaded cane he snuffed the genial gale said ha and perhaps gave sixpence to a little boy all was as it should be he was excellently served but if the morn broke stormily with a wailing wet west wind with scudding rain or whirling snow all that escaped his lips was provoking he ordered the brougham and you may think that in effect these things are what any gentleman may do and yet not be exactly right other gentlemen may damn the rain but mr germain more in sorrow than in anger gave nature a months warning if there is offence to miss mary middleham in likening her to the weather i am sorry for it theres no doubt that that is how she stood in mr germains regard though he would have gone to the stake denying it no misgiving therefore disturbed his serenity while he talked to her of the art of teaching which he understood she practised it was truly he thought one of the great arts to give it no prouder title what more wonderful material could be put under the hands of any artist than humanity more plastic than paint more durable than the potters clay or the builders stone more subtly responsive than the vibrations with which the musician must cope he had been reading the other day a very excellent life of vittorino da feltre a great italian educationist he should be happy to send it to miss middleham the man was as proud as a prince and to the credit of the princes of italy it must be said that he was treated as their peer a remarkable career full of suggestion a certain scare faintly discernible in miss middlehams open eyes recalled him from so wide a cast he told her that he had been renewing acquaintance with mr nunna worthy friend of some years standingand had received that gentlemans testimony to her value to the affection which all his children had for her he had a great respect for mr nunna widower with six young children i said he am a widowerbut yet i can envy mr nunn i am childless and much alone you are fond of children miss middleham she owned to that gladly i was sure of it he said you betrayed yourself at the schooltreat not so much by what you didthough you worked noblyas by what was done to you i watched the children they could not let you alone they must touch youchildren express themselves by their antenn again i envy you miss middleham at this point mr soames most happily if abruptly intervened we were to go in mr germain started had for his mental balance poised so for an uncertain moment and then broke away as desired my stout commander ha yes i am ready lead leader and i follow he bowed to his late captive left her rosily confused and bent himself to his duty in the field he faced the bowling of the lower end with carefully adjusted glasses and a resolute chin he outlived four balls and actually hit two of them but forgot to run the firstto the discomfiture of wilcox the saddler who did run for it and lost his wicket the second he ran when he should not though soamess hand and no no pealed coming disaster and then he walked back to the tent and thence to the rectory garden while duplessis joining soames made vigourous practice of the cromberton bowling his enthusiasm held out to the end he marked every ball cheered every notch he was impartialthe fall of soamess wicket received his plaudits the hundred on the telegraph got no more for so sedate a personage he was in great spirits he rallied the rector on his timidity urged lord cantacute to put james to the blush he went so far even as to congratulate duplessis upon his not out and when all was over reverted more than once during a leisurely stroll among the boxedged walks to the pleasures of village life he deplored his great shutup southover we were too fond of our fenced enclosures according to tacitus the trick must be inveterate but just now there were signs of its losing hold our american kindred would have none of ita parkpale even a garden hedge was an offence against public conscience over there the convenience of appartements was gaining upon london and in the country allotments were recalling the old days of the common fields well he was good liberal enough to welcome the breaking down of our grudging defences why should an englishmans house be his castle while england surrounded by its briny moat was sufficient castle for us all merry england england might be merry enough if englishmen could forget themselves and remember each other mrs james did not agree with him and shortly said so but lord cantacute who may have seen further than she cared to look said it would never do its been tried over and over again you know you cant mix people up because they wont meet you if you go and make a fuss with a fellow youll gratify him you know but what will he do will he make a fuss with his nextdoor neighbour not he hell kick him youve made him feel that hes somebody dyou see so he can afford himself the luxury no no germain i wish you were rightyou ought to bebut youre not theres a queer kind of fellow his lordship went on while mr germain seemed to be holding his opinion firmly in his clasped hands behind his back who lives in a tiltcart and mends kettles when the fancy takes him paints a good picture too and has plenty to say for himself hertha found him at that the other day out ridingbut the kettles were not far off and the sawder bubbling in a pot on a fire from what she says hes come as near to your standard as any one no hedges there and hes a gentleman mind you hertha says thats clear but look at the difference he steps down you see you are for pulling em up that dont do as i say mr germain explained himself i deny the imputation i cannot admit the possibility pulling up my dear cantacute how can you pull up when there is no eminence i spoke of enclosures of artificial barriersa very different matter same thing said my lord we didnt plant em they grew i met today again said mr germain pointedly to his sisterinlaw your miss middlehama charming girlwith whom i gave myself the pleasure of some little talk during the interval allowed me by my stalwart friend soames i became a hedgebreaker my dear constantia deliberatelylord cantacutes shrewd eye being upon him he turned to the attackand i can assure you that i found her in every respect worthy of my homage in every respect we discussed her art whats that asked the lord the art of teaching my dear friend i maintained that it was the finest artand miss middleham quite agreed with me mrs james asked him tartly what else mary middleham could have done or been supposed to do lord cantacute contented himself by saying that he believed she was a nice young woman there are at any rate no hedges about her said mrs james v how to break a hedge mr john germain of southover house in berkshiresince it is time to be particular about himwas five years older than his brothera man of fifty of habits as settled as his income and like his income too mostly in land yet he had literary tastes a fine library for instance of which the nucleus only had been inherited and the rest selected bound and mostly read by himself he was said to have corresponded with the late mr herbert spencer and when he was in town invariably to lunch at the athenum sometimes in the company of that philosopher in person he was tall distinguished very erect very lean nearsighted impassive and leisurely in his movements one could not well imagine him running for a trainand indeed the appointments of his household service must have precluded the possibility his coachman had been with him fiveandtwenty years his butler thirty and the rest to correspond i believe there was not an upper servant in his employ who had not either seen him grow up or been so seen by himself he lived mostly in the country upon his estate and there fulfilled its duties as he conceived them to bewas chairman of quarter sessions deputylieutenant had been sheriff was chairman of the board of guardians at these things he worked to lesser incumbencies he stooped to meet them halfway and no moreas if he deprecated the fashion which insisted on them thus he was patron of sport rather than sportsman subscribed liberally to the hounds but never hunted offered excellent shooting to his county but never handled a gun a very dignified manwith his high fastidious faceyou had to look hard to discern the character he was he masked his features as he subdued his movements to express deliberately measured advance and yet in his own way and within his own limits he had never failed of having what he wanted as he wanted it and if he had to pay as we mostly do he paid without turning a visible hair i say that with the remembrance of his marriage to lady di wymondesley in my mind that had at first seemed a stroke of fortune with which he was not to cope he had married herwhen she was the fashion of the day the days last expressionearly in life so soon as he had gone down from cambridge and entered upon his inheritance she had brought him little moneybut he wanted none of her money he wanted her as every enthusiast for the ideal then did a beautiful haggard swift violent creature tearing life to tatters that she might find some excitement in the lining there came a year when clytemnestra threatened to be her proper namethat year when her husband returned from a solitary tour in palestine syria and the trojan plain and when gisthus they say had not been wanting to make the trio of them but he this immovable triplearmoured man of thirtyhe was no morehad shown what his fibre was when he had lived gisthus down lived him out of berks out of his clubs out of london out of england and then had set himself to work to live the devil out of his clytemnestra what he suffered will never be known for he took good care of that and what she may have suffered can hardly be guessed for she talked too much and too bitterly to be believed theres no doubt that these were terrible years there were fifteen of them and of every one you would have sworn it must be the last providence finally justified that wonderful grit in the manthat panoply of esteem which no sword could bite onby breaking lady dis back in the huntingfield he had been forty when that crowning mercy came to him and had spent the ten following years in getting his affairs into order changing outwardly none of his habits such as his yearly visit to london his yearly visit to misperton rectory he was none the less conscious of a departed zest his panoply was frayed if not rent and wherever he was during those ten orderly years carried his hope about with hima treasured if dim a real if undefined presence he called it hestia and wrote verses about it in secret he had a positive taste for certain forms of poetrythe court pastoral the shepherdinsatin beribboned lamb sort of poetrybut not a soul knew that not even his butler hestia was not a womanat least she had no members she appeared in his verses unwooing and unwooed she was rather the vision of an influence she was an aura a rhythm a tone she involved implied a domestic calm which had never been his though southovers walls were fair and many she was a melodious beat added to his ordered goings at her touch the clockwork of southover chimed silvern instead of steely the hope of this hestia if i may say so he carried always about with him at the halfcock it was the secret of his life you would never have suspected him of a musical ear yet there it was you would have said that any spring of poetry in him would have been sealed at the fount by that panoply which could turn a swordedgebut no the eye of such a man may never betray its content and his heart be incapable of voicing its desire but what heart covets eye will hold and ear strain after the man will burn within and make no signto fellow man and now the stateliest hedgebreaker that ever surely wrought in somerset mr germain proceeded on his declared purpose with an absence of parade which while it robbed it of all sting must also have threatened its value unless you shout liberty as you trample barriers down the prisoners may well remain within their pinfolds there was no shouting in misperton brand it was mr germains habit to take breakfast in his own room and keep a solitary morning he was not visible to the rectory party until luncheon time after tea he was accustomed also to withdraw himself until dinner during these times of seclusion as i collect he devoted himself to the emancipation of miss middleham sobered as such a young lady could not fail to be by the unimpeachable testimony of thursdays school treat and saturdays cricket it was on the monday following that a series of encounters began which struck excited and ended by enthralling her walking to her work in the mornings she must needs overtake him returning late in the evenings behold him strolling a few yards in front of her this may be done once and be a transient glory twice and be for remembrancea comfort when things go awry let it happen three times and you will be frightened after that it may colour each day beforehand as it comes miss middleham had reached the stage where her heart began to beat as she approached the corner of lovelane at the end of which stood the sanctuary behind its defences of laurela white gates and laurustinuswhen another shock was given her one of those shocks which you get when you put two and two together as the saying is it did not take her a second to do the sumbut it had to be done on this occasion lessons had been rolling for an hourlong enough to discover how hot it was and how interesting a bee in a window could make himself more than long enough for tommy to yawn and squeak his slatepencil for elsie to sigh and look appealingly at miss middlehamwhen the door opened and papa appeared and behind papa tall and benevolent mr germain the great gentleman from the rectory at this sudden invasion of her sanctuary miss middleham rose startled in her place and her hand unconsciously sought her side as dian surprised with her nymphs might have covered her unveiled breast so she her heart at least so the visitor interpreted the act if the children stared cleareyed miss middlehams fine eyes were misty altogether a pretty commotion without and within mr nunnmr t albert nunn as he was pleased to sign himselfwas a hale elderly and plump gentleman in colouring rather like a greenhouse plant so vividly white and feathery was he in the whiskers so fleshily pink in the cheeks he now showed considerable elation though modesty rode it as it were on the curb miss middlehampray let me not disturb you mr germain sir our preceptress miss middlehamwho is so kind as to take charge of my nestlingsha sir my motherless babes as he waved them into acquaintance with each other miss middleham became deeply suffused but mr germain was ready to help her miss middleham and i are old acquaintances he said indeed i presume upon that at the moment he turned to her excusing himself mr nunn assured me that we should not disturb you and i hope you will support him you know my interest in educational matters yes mr germain she said faintly you have spoken of it i thought it due to you when i learned what an honourable charge you profess that you should know me an admirer of it from afarunfortunately from afar your little pupils too i have met mr nunn who had a good ear for sentiment had his cue my motherless ha miss middleham what can we show mr germainwhat have we of interest my gertrude now writes a good essayi have heard you say so hey very good indeed mr nunn said miss middleham while miss gertrude swallowed hard i should enjoy a sight of it of all things said mr germain so the essay was producedin all its round and becapitalled script with miss middlehams corrections in red ink the character of john lackland king of england mr germain read between the lines studied the corrections and mused as he read at the end it happened there was a model essay in the teachers hand not hard to discover as the teachers composition he read this too and interpreted it in the light of his vision of the girl he read into it her confident natural voice saw behind it her trim figure her expressive eyes and softly rich colour the entire absence of anything remarkable in itself gave him no dismay he was not looking for that but for confirmation of his emotions for a reasoned basis to them it was clear to him in a moment that the kings of england were counters in a gamea game to the teacher only a shade less dreary because much more familiar than to her pupils this was what he wanted to find it corroborated his first vision the vision held had she shown talent to say nothing of genius for her profession he would have been greatly disconcerted handing the book back he patted miss gertrude on the head for a quick little pupil and her beaming parent on the back in a manner of speaking for possessing her you are happy mr nunn he said in your childrens promise and i am sure that their instructress may be satisfied with their performance you are very good sir replied mr nunn it is naturally gratifying to mehighly gratifyingwhen a gentleman in your position takes notice of my little brood ha my little seedplots as i may truly say miss middleham reports favourably of progresssteady progress i hear that little margarets sewing is somewhat remarkable but mr germain did not pursue his researches having no need heaven and earth he thought as he had intended all along to think were ever labours more jejune compelled upon a fresh and budding young life was ever yoke more galling laid upon yearling shoulders to set a being so delicate at liberty there can be no hammer and pick laid to the barrier nay it must be rather by enlarging from within the butterfly lies so in a prison house his iris wings closefolded to his sides break into the shell you either crash the filmy thing or usher it untimely into a chill world no no breathe tenderness shed warmth about the lovely prisoner it grows in grace and strength to free itself then be at hand to see the dawning of life share in the contemplative ecstasy of a god rejoice with him in a fair workbehold it very good what is exquisite here he told himself as he thought of mary standing at her work is the bending to the yoke and the resiliency the strain for release which is irrepressible in so ardent and strong a nature i remember the proud youths in the panathenaic frieze the noble maidens bearing baskets on their heads obedience willingness patience on the curbcan anything be more beautiful you ride a perfect horse he throbs under your hand a touch will guide him but brutality will make a mad thing of him the gentle hand the gentle hand he who is privileged enough to have that in his gift within his faculty is surely blessed above his fellows and does not that quality of beauty indeed depend upon the curb can it exist as such without it no the head cannot bow so meekly without the burden laid the neck cannot spring until it has been bent ah but the curb is wielded by the hand and must never be in unwise or brutal employ here there is not brutality but a stupidity beyond belief something horrible to me and deeply touching that one so young so highly graced so little advantaged should be drudging to prepare for others a lot no better than her owndrudging without aptitude without reason without hope to realize or ambition to gratifydesiring merely to live and grow and be happy horrible most horrible surely so fair a spirit should be more thriftily expended transplant that sweet humour that really beautiful submissiveness into a room more gracious an atmosphere more appreciative and how could it fail to thrive to bear flower and fruit flower and fruitah me there leapt up in his heart an answering fire and he cried to himself hestia the hearth vi miss middleham is invited to confirm a vision the object of these sentimental and persistent excursionscircular tours in fact since however far they wandered whether to the parthenon or to the shrouded hestia of the hearth they always returned to their starting placeby no means filled the scene at misperton brand which when she crossed it at all approved or disapproved according to taste and opportunity lady cantacute had no doubt but she was a good little soul and young perivale would confidently wager her a girl with whom you could have fun her pupils adored her miss de speyne had not yet realized her existence tristram duplessis believed her waiting for him the rector had once called her a sun child it appears and that sounds like a compliment but her good looks were denied yet sun child is apt from a friendly tongue her colour was quick to come and go no doubt she was burnt becomingly by the weather she hadhe might have saida dewy freshness upon her rather the appearance of having been newly kissed no doubt she had a figure no doubt the hot full eyes of the south here her soul if she had one spoke to those who could hear excitement made her eyes to shine like large stars apprehension opened them like a hares reproach made them loom upon you all black if you interested her they peered they filled readily with tears and could laugh like wavelets in the sun but you cant build a beauty upon eyes alone and a beauty she had no claim to be and yet she was well finished offwith small hands and feet pointed fingers small ears quick nostrils a smooth throat running from dusk to ivory as the sun held or fainted in his chase then she had pretty waysadmittedand theres enough title for your sun child but the rector you see liked her while his wife disapproved of her fundamentally pretty ways forsooth shes a flirt james and i have no patience with mr soames the eastward position is perfectly harmless of course many clergymen adopt itlord victor for one but it was never done here as you know very well until mr soames discovered that he could see the sundayschool benches that way the rector shrugged with his eyebrows scandalum magnatum my dear and dire nonsense at that soames is a good fellow with a conscience and may say his creed in my church to whatever wall he finds helpful mrs james retorted that a magnet was quite out of place in a church and set him gently chuckling that as she knew was final for the day but she kept her eye steadily upon miss middleham and had her small rewards what was not discoverable could be guessed at by what was she lighted by chance upon one crowning episode when on a sunday afternoon she found her cousin tristram declaiming shelleys prometheus under the apple tree in the garden of marys lodgingnot to the apples and birds of the bough but to the young person herself snug in an easy chair her sunday pleats neatly disposed no ankle showing to speak of butand this did stamp a fatal air of domesticity upon the whole exhibitionbut without a hat this if you come to think of it means the worst kind of behaviour a perverted mind shelley was an atheist and his prometheus was probably subversive of every kind of decencybut that is nothing beside the point of the hat which might be missed by any man but by no woman for consider if a little nursery governess were to be read to by the cousin of a person of good familya young man who might be engaged to a peers daughter by a nod of the headone might think little of it had there been evidence of its being an event but there had been nonefar from that mrs james knew her misperton brand very well events there were hailed by young persons in their best hats here nothing of the kind on the contrary there was an everyday air about it which showed that the girl was at home with tristram tristram much at home with the girl that tristram should be at ease was nothing it would have been ridiculous had he not beena nursery governess but was it not disastrous flippancyto say no harsher thingin mary that she too could be at ease hatless in a rocking chair not rocking herselfno not that but able to rock at any moment the enormity was reported and the rector said that so long as young women wore their hats in his church he cared nothing what they did with them elsewhere he threatened to chuckle so no more could be said but to mrs james what had been dark surmise before was now garishly plain the girl was but all this takes us far from the schoolroom where miss middleham was blamelessly expounding the plantagenet kings of england or from the shady limetree walk where mr germain was rhapsodizing upon yokes submissiveness and young necks resilient he met her as had now become his habit on the next morning and the next the same bewildering gentle monologues were deliveredor he paced by her side without speaking without constraint or any sign that betrayed he was not doing an everyday thing he was doing a thing which held her spellbound but shortly afterwards he did another which made her brain spin he proposed a little walk in the course of that afternoonlet us say at six oclock if that would be perfectly agreeable to you an appointment it must needs be agreeable perhaps it was he called for her at her woodbinecovered lodging asked for her by name and stood uncovered in the porch until she appeared and then they walked by fieldways some couple of miles in the direction of stockfield peverel upon this occasion she was invited if not directed to talk it was a little catechism mr germain asked her of her family and prospects and she replied readily enough there was neither disguise nor pretence about what she had to tell him she was what mrs james would have thoughtand did thinkfrankly canaille her father was cashier in the london and suburban bank at blackheath and her mother was alive this mary was the second child of a family of sixall girls janewe call her jinnywas the eldest and a typewriter in a city office we shall never be anything more than we are now because we arent clever and are quite poor jinny was sevenandtwenty then came herself mary susan twentyfour years ago a hiatus represented two boys who had died in infancythey mean more than all of us to motherand then in succession four more girls the eldest sixteen and finishing ready to go out in the world just as i did she knew nothing of her fathers father but had heard that he had come from the west country gloucestershire she thought her mothers maiden name had been unthank really that was allexcept that she had been much what she was nowa nursery governesssince she was seventeen seven yearsyes a long time but one gets accustomed to it he tried but could get no more out of her concerning herself and he remarked upon it that so surely as she began to talk of her own affairs she compared them with jinnys and allowed them to fade out in jinnys favour he judged that as a child she had been overshadowed jinnys beauty accomplishments audacity were much upon marys tongue jinny knew french and could sing french songs she was talla head taller than menot engaged to be married but able to be so whenever she chose not easy to please however father thinks a great deal of jinny we are all proud of her perhaps you might not admire her style everybody looks at her in blackheath mr germain thought to himself that in that case he should not admire her style it is not to be denied that these details had to be digested under protest they were perfectly innocent but they did not help the ideal she was much more attractive when she was fluttered and whirled off her feet rather breathless with a good deal of colour rather scaredas she had been at first now however she was at ease tripping by his side full of the charms of a dashing jinny at blackheathand it came into his mind with a pang that at this rate shethe ideal firstseen shemight disappear altogether behind that young ladys whisking skirts this he could not afford his inquiries became more personal and she immediately more coy there came almost naturally into his attitude towards her an air of patronagetender diffident very respectful patronage under which she soon showed him that his interest in her was moving her pleasantly a man of more experience than hewho had nonewould have seen in a moment that the attention of the other sex was indeed her supreme interest the mainspring of her being would have noticed that every filament in her young frame was sensitive to that a man of gallantry and expertise could have played upon her as on a harp mr germain could not do this but his feelings were strongly attracted so young so simple so ardent a creature he said to himself andgod be good to all of usliving breathing delicately exquisitely daintily indeed before my eyes upon sixtyfive pounds a year this fact had truly taken his breath away sixtyfive pounds a yearmere wagesfor the hire of a girl like a flower it was a great rise for me she had said i had never expected to earn more than jinny herself only gets a pound a week and french is required in her office but mr nunn said that he would pay me more than his usual allowance for governesses because it would not be convenient to have me in the house and i must therefore pay for a lodging in the village so i must think myself a very fortunate girl to have my evenings to myself and a year into the bargain mr germain reflecting upon the wages of his butler valet cook headhousemaid headgardener headkeeper headcoachman felt himselfthough he did not know itknocked off his feet this comes of mingling interests under glamour the beglamoured would wiselier postpone practical inquiries but as it was his interest in the young girl was quickened by admiration and pity to a dangerous height he more than admired he respected her to make so gallant so enchanting a figure on sixtyfive pounds a year and oh the scheming and shifts that the effort must involve his fine lips twitched his fine benevolent eyes grew dim he blinked and raised his brows summer lightning seemed to play incessantly over his pale face my poor child my poor brave child he murmured to himself but aloud he said you interest me extremelyi am greatly touched somewhat moved believe me i value the confidence you have shown me i do believe i shall not be unworthy of it i must thinki must take time to considera little time to see whether i cannotwhether i might presumesixtyfive pounds a yeargod bless me it is astounding then to complete the enchantment she looked quickly up at him gave him a full quiver from those deep homes of wonder her unsearchable eyes its wonderful to me she said simply without any pretence that you should interest yourself in me i cannot understand it he schooled himself to smile to be the patron again what do you find so wonderful in that my dear that you should find timethat you should caretake noticeoh i dont know how to say it im only a poor girl you know a nursery governess and a dunce i was so terrified when you came into lessons that morningi couldnt tell you really my knees knocked he felt more at his ease that was very foolish of your knees my dear i was greatly interested and pray do not think me inquisitive that is not one of my vices it is far from my wish toto patronize one for whom i have so high a respect your poverty is as it may beat any rate you earn your bread and in that you are a head and shoulders above myself and if you are a dunce which i cannot admitwell that can be mended you know are we not all dunces i remember a very wise man saying once that we know nothing until we know that we know nothing do you understand that yes i think so but even thenoh no it is very wonderful i think and then as he looked down at her smiling he received again her fullorbed attack and she said in a low voice thank you for being so kind to me he had to turn away his head lest he should betray himself and wreck what was to him a moment of ridiculous happiness he could not trust himself to speak at the turnstile between the smithy and the rising sun beershop their ways should have diverged but although he had fallen entirely silent he accompanied her to orient cottage where she lodged at the gate he held her hand for a minute while he somewhat breathlessly committed himself let us if you will be so good repeat our little walk the day after tomorrowthat is on saturday i leave this place on monday and should value another conversation with you on saturday you will be free i think shall we then say the morning at eleven she would not allow him to see her eyes now she murmured her yesthank you and he went on it is very kind of you i may have something to saybut be that as it may to an old fogy of my sort the companionship of a young lady is flattering i hope i may believe that i have not wearied you since you are willing to indulge me again no indeed mr germain i shall be proud to come and then he let her hand go and she slipped through the gate as she entered her door she looked over her shoulder a shy goodnight he saluted her and paced slowly back to the rectory combustible matter had been handled had she been less simple or he more sure theres no saying what might not have been ablaze as it was he betrayed by no outward sign at all how stirred he was though he was not very talkative at the dinnertable the rectory people dined at the park tristram it was told was off again he had gone to pau at a moments notice with young lord branleigh vii miss middleham has visions of her own as for mary middleham it behoved her to cool her hot cheeks and quench the fires in her eyes as soon as she might for within a few minutes of mr germains departure she must set out again she had been bidden to the wakes for supper and the wakes lived five miles away without changing her dress she mounted her bicycle and was off she rode fast but her thoughts outstripped her she tried to look cool but the fire throbbed and gleamed it was not possible but she must recall every stage in the journey of the week that was passinga week in which there had not been a day without some signal mark of mr germains attention he had noticed her he had noticed her and her peddling affairs every day since the schooltreat his interest had increased and was increasing she could not credit it but still less could doubt it what in the world did the good gentleman mean what did he see in her what want of such as she was things of the sort had happened before mr duplessis was a gentleman but he was different quite different he was to say the least of it a younger gentleman and age was a leveller fun was to be expected from such as he but no more her conscience had to be put to sleep where mr duplessis was concerned but mr germain was good and great wise andwell middleageda landlord almost a nobleman there was no question of fun there or of conscience eitherit was all wild surmise could he mean anything one answer to that only he must then what under heaven could he mean but one thing and that was flat absurdityimpossible of belief and yet so her little careful mind scared out of its bearings beat and boxed the compass as her heart drove it she had a shrewd eye for that form of flattery which girls call attentions for the education of her world cultivates the fibres of sense and she had been upon it from her seventeenth to this her fourandtwentieth year never a year of the seven but her wits had been strung by some affair or another scarcely one but she had supposed herself within hail of that hour of moment had seen before her a point beyond which there was no seeing if he asks me i must answer him and how mostly he had not and after a drowning interval she had presently discovered herself heartwhole conscienceclean with no wounds visible no weals or bruises to ache their reminders then it had all begun againda capo she was very woman to the extremities nothing more feminine than she had ever been taken from the side of man or been more strongly inclined to go back again nothing else in life really interested her but the attitude of menof this man or that mantowards her that was why work was taskwork and daily intercourse without an implication like meat without salt instinct had swallowed her up her mind was a slave her heart not yet born she knew nothing whatever of passion nobody had ever evoked that she had been touched interested flattered excited but never in love in her whole life love indeed in its real sense was a sealed book but curiosity absorbed her and she was as responsive to the flatteries of attention as a lookingglass to breath though she was what we call a coquette by nature she had no vanities no vulgar delight in flaunting her conquests before the envious on the contrary she was secretive hoarded her loveaffairs preferred to be wooed in the dark her philosophy was really very simple and i say perfectly innocent she loved to be loved sought out desired if she was pretty it was good to be claimed if she was not it was better so all was for the best sitting erect in her saddle with squared shoulders openbreasted to the fanning airs it was clear that she was pleased and that throbbing heart and coursing blood became her she had never looked so well or so modest her lips were parted but her eyes were veiled by those heavy lids and deep lashes which to duplessis spoke strongly of desire and to mr germain of virgin bashfulness a smile lay lurking at the corners of her mouth ready to flash and dart as her thought was stirred she was not thinkingperhaps she was incapable of itshe was playing with thought what had he been doing with her today what was he going to do with her the day after tomorrow it was all very extraordinary he liked her he tried to please herand so far well but he was not like mr duplessis never looked at you as he did as if he was angry that you were not a morsel it wasnt that at all well then what was it the milestones flew by between misperton and whiteacre she was received by the buxom miss wakes with kisses and smiles but her questions were not solved and her excitement must vent itself in sallies so it did young mr perivale the auctioneers son was dumb before her went down like a stricken steer she teased him dazzled him inflamed his face and tied his tongue she chattered sang snatches of songs scribbled on the piano flashed and loomed dared greatly to a point and then turned to fly she sat on sallys lap and ate apples allowed letty to whisper secrets in a corner and quarrel with kitty who should have her next sedately conscious of her good looks she sat downcast all of a sudden and let herself be adoredand then of the suddenest she fled them all and went with mr wake to visit a sick mare to pity and to serve to hold the twitch for him while he administered a ball the end of such flights may be imagined a pursuit a capture in the shrubbery her waist a prisoner and a panting declaration from young perivale of the state of his feelings she seemed heartless to him she escaped his arm and oh no mr perivale i really couldnt she told him when he asked could she care for him and looked to snatch a kiss which did she meanthat she couldnt both it seemed she handled him lightly but she thoroughly understood the game and her ease was that of a skilled practitioner mr perivale was hurt and it may be forgot himself he told her fairly that her head had been turned thats what it is he said with hot eyes and a sore tongue were not good enough for you now the great folks have taken you up you think they mean somethingand perhaps they do but its not what you think it is i think nothing about it i assure you she cried with her head high you think nothing of mr germain in the cricketfieldlike a codfish on a bank nothing of mr duplessis glaring at you fit to break you you think these very fine attentions youll excuse me miss middleham but i know the world oh you may believe what you please of me said she flushing up but i hope youll believe what ive told you just now ill accept it whether or no said mr perivale and bade her goodnight left to herself in the shrubbery she shed some tears spret injuria form the result of the scene was a supper eaten in subdued silence and the prospect of five miles home unescorted she disliked being about in the dark imagination pictured beauty defenceless and man ranging hungrily there was a moon which made it worse you can only see how dark it is on a moonlight night no question however but she must go she made her farewells and set out her spirits quelled her little joys all dashed by the quarterhours strife and a victory which seemed not worth the having the wind had died down it was a perfectly still night close and hot the very moon seemed hotheavy full and burnt yellowmidway up its path soon she too was hot and walking up faraway hill got hotter her hair loosened and sagged on her neck her thin muslin gown clung about her knees she felt tumbled and blowsed was as near cross as she could ever be and had spirits like leadno elation to be got out of the wonderful week no highheart hopes for the day after tomorrow no wild surmises atop of the great hill she stopped for breath fanned herself with her handkerchief and put up her hair again then she mounted and began the short descent to cubbingdean she had not gone a hundred yards before she felt the dull shock and gritty strain which betokens a punctured wheel this seemed too much but dismounting she found it too true disaster on the heels of discomfort here she was with four fine miles to walk alone in the dark the scorn and reproof of a young perivale and part of her way led over mere common where gipsies often encamped and lay abroad at this season of the year sleeping lurking with dogs doing wickedness in couples her heart began to beat at the thought of all thisand what wickedness they might do and how the dogs would scuffle and tear but there was no help for it she had passed this way but three hours agoand how gay it had looked in the golden sunlight of the late afternoon ah but then her thoughts had been golden and music in her heart a snatch came back of the song which had been on her lips stale jingle it seemed to her now there had been no gipsies though on the common comfort in that after cubbingdean where a little river runs over the road you climb again between hedgerows and orchards then comes a piece of woodland on either side and beyond that you are on mere common which is more than a mile across and half as much again in length mary tiptoed through the wood with a knocking heart and taking breath addressed herself to the proof before her she had not so far met a living soul unless pheasants have souls and hares these lightfoot beasts had made her jump more than enough and set the pulses at her temples beating like kettledrums her mind was beset by terrors she had to bite her lip sharply to keep herself to her task the wooded road opened the trees thinned out now she was on the common indeed and saw the ghostly lumps of furzeeach in its shroudon either hand with the mist irradiate upon them she saw the ribbon of white road tapering to a pointand midway of that beside it dead in her way a bright and steady light at this apparition she stopped short gazing in panic her eyes wide lips apart somebody was there somebody was thereand what could she do she had plenty of spirit for the ordinary encounters of daylight overconfident young mr perivale impudent sunday scholars young men who took liberties found their level mrs james herself would not care to go too far but in the dark her imagination rode her she then became what indeed she seemed to one at least of her admirersthe hunted nymph cowering in covert appealing only for the mercy of men so now before this terrible light glimmering there steady and on the watch her knees began to shake her eyes to grow dim she dared not pass itso much she confessed she must make a wide cast and slip by it through the furze she plunged desperately in and struck out to the left of the road almost immediately the furze was level with her head often over it and she had but one arm free to fend it off it scratched her cheeks tore her frock pulled her hair all about her shoulders she felt the hairpins part and fall as for the accursed bicycle it seemed to be battling on its own account like a mad thing contesting every inch of ground clinging to every root sticking in every hollow her breath went and her strength after it but still she fought and panted amazing contrast between what she had been at seven oclock and was now at halfpast ten impossibly fair seemed the spent day impossibly serene her panic heart bitter regret for what was so lovely and so far away started the tears again she bit her lip forced herself on but at last pushing with all her might between two ragged clumps she was caught up sharp felt a stinging pain on her shin her ankle gripped by something which cut to the bone she tottered and fell forward upon her bicycle and as she went down the ring of fire holding her ankle bit and burnedand mary shrieked she had done herself no service by her dtour for she heard a man cry hulloaim coming and resigned herself to utter fate god send him kindwhat were these terrible teeth at her ankle she felt out to reach ita wire she was in a harewire set no doubt by this ruffian who was coming to her now she heard him labouring through the bushes and held her breath and then again he calledwhere are you dont be afraid that was a good voice surely that was a young mans voicenot a gipsys comforted perhaps interested she crouched holding her caught ankle and waited viii friendships garland the beam of a lantern enveloped her and her gossamered surroundings presently it blazed full upon her discovered her flushed and reproachful face curtained in hair she saw a tall person bareheaded in what seemed to be white clothes and by a chance ray that he was sallow blackhaired smiling and had black eyes a young man she had no fears left she was on her own ground again what under the sky are you doing here he said she almost laughed im caught in a harewire it hurts very much it would you know let me look he knelt beside her and then his quick fingers searched for the wire as they touched hers she felt them cool and nervous ive got it i say its nearly through your stocking no wonder you criedbut now you know why a hare cries quiet nowill have it off in a minute he dived for a knife talking all the time i dare say you think that i set that wire for a hare and caught you youre quite wrong i dont kill hares and i dont eat em too nearly related to us i believe one minute more and he nipped the wire thereyou are free you can leap and you can run perhaps youd care to tell me why you battle in these brakes tearing your frock to ribbons and scratching your eyes out when you might walk that road like a christian lady just as you pleasewhy good lord youve got a bike it beats cockfighting but dont tell me unless you care to perhaps its a secret she stiffened her shoulders for the fray i wish to tell you because im ashamed of myself now of course its not a secret i have punctured my bicycle and have to walk homethree miles more and i saw your light in front of me and was frightened his eyes were as bright as her own but much more mischievous frightened he said what of the light no no of course not but some one must have lit it do you mean to say that you were frightened of me the most harmless creature on gods earth she laughed how could i know how harmless you were i thought you were gipsies i couldnt be gipsies perhaps i am a gipsyim not sure that i know what i am my father might poor manand hes an alderman that light let me tell you was going to cook my supper and now it shall cook yours if youll have some an invitation suggested in that way can only have one answer from a young woman no thank you i must go on if i can its dreadfully late he reflected its late but its not dreadful at all these summer nights are made to live in look at the moon on those misty bushes nothing lovelier can be dreamed of by poets than the hours from now to dawn sightseers always go for daylightand in july everythings blotted up in sap green theres no drawing in julyi say you might get up dont you think yes i might she tried and sat down again with a wry face it hurts awfully he had watched the performance i guessed it would well look here ill help you he put out his two hands met hers and pulled her gently up by the wrists lean on my shoulderlean as hard as you like so she did because she must she limped by his side through the brake and he talked on it seemed to her afterwards that she had never heard so much talk in her life singular talk tooas if to himselfno hint of her in itno affected gallantry or solicitudeno consciousness of her presence not even of her contact and yet when she stumbled and clung to his shoulder he took her round the waist and supported her whole weight with his arm and so held her until he had her safely by his fire he made her sit down upon his rug took off her shoe and told her to take her stocking off while he got a rag she obeyed without question and presently had her ankle in a bandage which smelt aromatic and stung her but gave strength and was pleasant she was very grateful and entirely at her ease i think im glad that i was afraid of you she told him do you know that ive never been so taken care of in my life he was putting her shoe on at the moment pulling tight the laces i dont believe you he said you are the sort that was made to be taken care ofabominably feminine the odds are that youll put my picture out of my head for at least three daysso i shall have to stop here until it comes back again then im very sorry she began but stopped as if puzzled you need not be i shall be perfectly happy and it will give you a chance of biking out here to report yourself was this an invitation did he no it was never done in that tone i shall certainly come she said perhaps youll show me the picture are you an artist he nodded busy preparing a dish for the fire a little silver dish into which he was breaking eggs im going to make an omelette you are to eat half of it im an artist in omelettes i do believe yes im a sort of artist a bad one you know but were all bad unless were the best of alland theres only one best however its all the same you have your fun but she was looking about her with animationbut where do you i mean do you he chuckled but mostly with his black eyes i know what you mean everybody asks the same questions and breaks them off at the same point ill tell you i live here at this moment i do travel in that cartand this is my tentand that ghost over there is my white horseand hulloa youve woken bingo a lithe grey dog came delicately forward into the light with lowly head and lowly wagging tail he was like a terrier with hounds ears soft and sleek and silver grey he sniffed at marys dress and feet sneezed over the bandage and edging up put a cool nose against her neck and then a warm tongue oh what a darling she cried softly and made much of him hes a bedlington said his owner above the sizzling eggs a beauty and a devil he likes you evidentlyand reasonably he wont curl up like that on every ladys skirts i assure you dont talk though or i cant beat up this thing talk to bingo hes my friend this friendly cooltempered young man was she thought very odd to look atlong in the body and thin in the leg he was quite new to her experience gentlefolk she knew and other folk her own and all the infinite gradations betweencounty clergy professional retired military down to commercial and even lower this was a gentleman certainlyand yetwell there was mr duplessis for instance with whom you were never to forget that he was a gentleman and you were village mr duplessis was very easy until you were easy toothen he got stiff directly and back you must go but this strange gentleman didnt seem to notice such things he seemed too full of what he was thinking about or doingand if he looked at you by chance as often as not he didnt seem to see you and when you looked at him he never noticed it at all she adjudged him foreign and to be sure he had a narrow foreign face very swarthy with a pair of piercing black eyes a baffling smile and quick sudden ways of turning both against you as if he had that moment found you out and was amused at other times as she came to learn those eyes of his could be fathomless and vacant could stare through you as if you were a winter hedge his hair was jetblack and straight and his moustache followed his mouth and curled up when he smiled she had never seen a man so deft with his fingers or so light and springy on his feet those long eager fingersshe could still feel them at her ankle and marvel at their strength and gentleness as they sought about and plucked free the biting wire his dress too was extraordinarya long white sweater with a rolling collar a pair of flannel trousers no socks but sandals on his feet long and bony feet they were beautifully made she said whatever he was or was not certainly he was kind and interesting and perhaps the most baffling quality about him was his effect upon herselfthat she was entirely at home in his company and had no care to know what he thought about her he served her with omelette hot and poured her out a glass of pale wine which smelt like flowers and was stronger she found than it seemed a picnic at midnight it was great fun she glanced at her host and was answered by a gleam he was enjoying it too do you know what im going to do next he asked her breaking the first silence he had kept since the encounter i shall catch that absorbed ghost which is really a horse and take you your three miles in my cart before that i shall mend your puncture for you she wouldnt allow that please not i can mend it quite well tomorrow and wont have you spoil your supper i have had mine you must remember and if i am to have another i insist upon your company he laughed all right and fell to again perhaps her wine made her talkative but i think that she had leisure of mind to be interested at any rate she volleyed him a string of questions about himself at all of which he laughedbut she found out mostly what she wanted to know as thusthat cart contained his whole worldly property its my house or my bed or both its my carriage and pair my bank studio library forcinghouse pottingshed bathroom bedroom as i choose it when its wet i can be dry in there when its fine i leave it alone its all i have and its more than enough ive pared it down to the irreducible minimum and yield now to one man onlythe tramp him i believe to be the wisest son of man for he has nothing at all now you know the less you have of your own the more you have of everybodys the whole world is the tramps but it cant be mine because of that shell on wheels i am as the snail to the harebut what are you pray and the rest of your shackled generation theres a tent in that cart which will go up in ten minutesanywhere and the materials of my trades are thereive several i scratch poetryand paint in watercoloursand aint bad at tinkering at this she gazed with all her eyes but he assured her ill mend you a kettle as soon as your bike i learnt sawdering from a drunken old welshman under the shadow of plinlimmon he died in my arms presently and left me his tools as well as his carcase you need not be shocked i do it because i like iti dont say that i should be ruined mind you if i gave it up but one cant paint against the mood still less write ive done this sort of thingand gardening im a bit of a gardener toofor nine years or more and shall never do anything else why should i im perfectly happy quite harmless and i do believe useful in my small way i could maintain that i think before a judge and jury he had no need certainly to maintain it at length before his present hearer who was very ready to believe him but he seemed to feel in the vein to justify himself you see im selfsufficient i renounced my patrimony on deliberation and support myself and a little bit over tinkering dont go far i ownsometimes i do it for love too but i sell a picture now and then to a confiding poor devil who only asks to buy em and do very well i destroy most of em because they dont come off if i had the nerve to sell those i should have more money for plants she stopped him here plants she said puzzled but he quizzed her you look for my conservatory my herbaceous border i defy you youll never find them if you could the game would be up all the same all my superfluous pence find their way to the nurserymennurserymen of sorts as she did not press him he resumed his monologue mind you i say that i have the best time of any man on this earth but youre judging me i know the women are always the worst they think it such shameful waste of time when one might be dressing ones person or looking at theirs she wasnt judging him at all she was drinking him uphim and his wisdom for the first time in her life she was really interested in something in a man which did not reside in his sex or which it is perhaps kinder to say had no relation to her own so absorbed was she that his cut at her kind did not affect her if she heard it but she noticed at once that he had stopped please go onplease tell me more about yourselfabout your way of life i mean oh i think you are extraordinary she had completely forgotten herself her eyes had not for a moment left searching his face her hands cupped her cheeks her knees supported her elbows and all about her arms and shoulders her loose hair streamed and rippled her face was hot her eyes like wet stars she had never looked so pretty perhaps because she neither knew nor cared anything about it whether she looked well or whether he thought so it was plain that he had other things to think ofand one thing is plainer that if she had not her hair would have been up long ago he laughed at her wonderment oh i dont know that im extraordinary at allon the contrary everybody else seems extraordinary to me its so simple i dont doubt but i could make you see what a great life i leadthats my business as an artist but it would do you no sort of goodand im not a proselytizer the thing is to get your fun out of what youre obliged to door if you prefer it to make it your business to do what you like the socialists say so and so do i after that we differ we differ as to ways and means they say that people can only be made happy by dynamite dynamite first act of parliament afterwards mr wells tones down the dynamite talks about a comet its dynamite he means thats where hes wrong you can shred peoples morals by blowing their neighbours upbut not their characters their morals will go to pieces because character remains you dont want that at all morals will always follow character and thats what you must get at but not by dynamite well how are you going to develop character i say by poverty prides purge theres my nostrum for the worldsicknesspoverty poverty poverty in fact im a franciscanby temperament and opinion and not because im in love with the virgin mary i have nothing and possess all things im rich because im destitute im always filling myself because im always empty do you see she looked doubtfully frowned a little then took her eyes from him no i dont see i dont understand you i know that you are not laughing at me but i think you will now never mind youve been very nice to me my dear young lady he said his glass in midcareer i assure you that im not laughing at all im telling you what i believe to be literal truth perhaps one of these days you will be really poor and then youll agree with me how can you fill yourself if youre full already and where do you find any pleasure in life except in wanting a thing and getting it cant you distinguish between having and using cant you see that to possess this common fenced and guarded by keepers and varlets of sorts would be exactly the same as to use it as i do now with all the hamper of the stake in the county added on to it she looked at her toes frowned tried to thinkthen raised her eyes yes yes perhaps i see that but you must know that i am quite poor and yet ah he said youre not poor enough you cant allow yourself to be it isnt pence that you must hoard but opinion my friend the sound opinion of your neighboursand of yourself too look here apply what ive been saying about this common to every blessed thingfrom god to groundsel from the kingdom of heaven to your villa at putneyapply it to religion to rank to marriage to murder and blazesand youll see but you shall work it out at home for im going to take you to bed he rose here and stretched himself his hands deep in his pockets her eyes pleaded please let me think of something first think away well talk presently but now im going to raise the ghost he went lightly after his cropping horse and mary sat by the fire how all this tilted her balances he little guessed what deeps he had stirred within her simple soul deeps why what fisherman had ever yet dropped his hook below the pretty surface what evidence had she or any one that deeps there were oh the great views at his will and pleasurethis gentlemantinkers who made omelettes in the middle of the night and talked like a ruler of men putting down and setting up with unfaltering voice altering respects changing relationships like a lawgiver povertydestitutionto go beggared of opinion as well as pence and to be the richer for it she might well pout her lips and wrinkle her little nose as she applied all this to her own concerns her heart sank to view her own belittling gossip flirtation little quarrels and harsh judgments a nod from mrs james a smile from miss de speyne dresses a new blouse young perivale mr duplessis mr no no not mr germain even now there was a faint throb of the heart as she thought of the day after tomorrow and hugged the comfort of an excitement to come ready if you are she heard and rose to join her host the gentlemantinker was in the road with his horse and cart passing the reins along bingo snorting and stretching his hind legs was very ready for the frolic hows the ankle much better too much better nonsense thats one of the things we must have i dont preach abstinence from limbs she laughed no of course not but i think that i should have liked to be kept in for a dayor two and i know that i cant be youre better out i suspect im not sure nowsince you have been talking you have made me think youll find it hard work meantime you had better get upits gone midnight that sent her up with a little shocked cry he lifted in the bicycle and mounted beside her nowwhere are we going she told him misperton brand was the first village he came to oh i know it he said i had adventures there ages ago i encamped in a parklord somebodys parkand they turned me out but i met that lord afterwards and he proved to be rather a good sort of man hes lord cantacute do you know the rector mr germain no i dont get on with rectors they seem to think that i should go to their churches but i never do i dont ask them to mine why should they ask me to theirs theres an obliquity about christianity which beats me whats his name germain any relation of lord georges i wonder celebrated man to whom the americans ought to put up a statue he gave them their country i believe gave it away to them you might put it she knew nothing of lord george theres a mr john germain she said not quite ingenuously who is head of the family he considered mr john germain i believe ive come against him too somewhere germaingermainshotawayshotover thats itshotover housebig red and white place with a pediment and a park near reading yes i was turned out of that too solemn old boy thin with glasses she flushed up in the dark hes very nice hes staying here i know him hes kind her companion looked round do you mean that hes kind to you or kind all round he wasnt very kind to me he said that i fostered contempt for my class i admitted it and he got angry why shouldnt i if i believe it contemptible hes very kind to me she replied seriously hes a gentleman you know and and youre a lady well thats not necessarily kindto you but she said you dont let me finish i am not a lady you knownot ofwell not of his class thats why i think him kind im sure i hope you are right her friend said how does his kindness show itself she made haste to justify mr germain well to begin with in his being interested in me at all he talks to mehe asks about my work what is your work she was shortly asked teaching she told him she was a governess he looked at her now strange man with real interest are you though by heaven then theres a chance for you yet youre above us all he may well be kind with the next generation depending entirely on you teachers and mothersno parson can beat that is germain a schoolmaster she began in a shocked voice oh no hes a gen but was drowned in laughter he threw his head up and laughed to the sky youre a wonder i must say i beg him ten thousand pardonsi forgot of course hes a gentleman mary was piqued thats not very kind of you she said with reproach in her tones and he humbled himself at once im very sorry but ill confess the whole the fact is youve jumped into a little pit which i had dug for youheadlong upon my word i beg your pardon but dont you know that these classboxes into which you plump every mothers son of us and are at such pains to keep guarded lest one of us should step out are the very things im vowed to destroy why god be good to us what are we to do in our boxeswith all this going on he stretched his arm outthis dappled earth singing and spinning like a great dusty ball through starspace oh i must talk to you again about all thisyou with children in your two hands to be made into men and women but not nowits too serious when are you coming to report your ankle and tell me that im forgiven she smiled upon him ive quite forgiven you it was i who was foolish i am sure you must be right may i come on sunday thats my free day i should like to talk to youabout lots of things delighted to see you he said come by daylight this time and come by road heres your village opening he set her down at the top of the street since she would not allow him further prepared to thank him with her prettiest the words died on her tongue not a bit not a bit he cut them down i love company ive enjoyed myself immensely orating away youre a rare listener you seem as if you had never heard it before goodnight she held him up her handhe touched itturned the horse and was gone when she had lighted her candle the first thing she did with it was to hold it up that she might look in the glass her hot eyes and burning cheeks were ignored for more serious disorders my hair and then she laughed he would not know whether i had any hair late as it was and tired as she was sleep was long in coming ix the welding of the bolt poetry lord cantacute was saying at dinner is like a windeggaberration in the producer useless for consumption you dont attempt to eat a windegg it is remarkable perhaps but once gaped at you had best leave it to the parent fowl that will be glad of it you encourage cannibalism asked the rector with a lifting eyebrow really lord cantacute saw nothing against it perhaps it was a matter of tastebut so was poetry and who else could thrive upon the stuff since all this was apropos of the absent tristram whose talents and fluency were admitted while their trend was deplored mrs james could not fail to remember a thriving consumer of his wares had she not caught him administering windegg by spoonfuls to a hatless young lady the excursion was closed with a flash by miss hertha de speyne who from her golden throne said that poetry was very well if the mortal poet did not practise what he sang no other art she thought had that grain of vice in it now we were not ready to practise poetry mr germain contributed nothing to the game but ate his dinner or gazed solemnly at one speaker after another this was unusual he was fond of abstract discussion and had his ideas about poetry he had his favourite practitioners toovirgil pope gray poetry for him must be elegant above all things elegant fastidious deliberately designed dante he could not admire petrarch and tasso were the italians their conceits not conceited for him he had evenbut this was a profound secretpitched a slender pipe of his own and was now resuming the exercise his vein was the courtlypastoral the nymph mero let us say was sought by the god sylvanus who wooed her in a wellwatered vale or a young shepherdesscall her marinawas the dear desire of cratylus the mature who offered her with touching diffidence the wellfound hearth the stored garners the cellar for whose ripe antiquity alas he himself could vouch the maid was not cold it was himself who doubted whether he were not frigid he besought her not to despise his silvering beard the furrow on his brow boys urged he are hot and prone but the woodfire leaps and dies while the steady glow of the wellpressed peats endures until the morning and a little breath revives all its force thus cratylus to marina in his heart the inexpert poet is not content with numbers as miss de speyne had said he is apt to probe what he expounds also by a merciful provision of our mother no man is permitted to think himself ridiculous nor indeed is necessarily so the poets are right there the intentions of mature cratylus may be as honourable his raptures as true his sighs as deeply fetched as any of beardless corydons only when desire fades in us o gods name let us die our friend here cried in his heart that his had never bloomed before spellbound to a beautiful vision he walked enraptured in the light of it travelling up the path of its beam sighing not that it should be so long but that his steps should lag so short of his urgency and to the lips of his heartas it wererecurred and recurred the dear familiar phrases true once and true now to who so love the wellfound hearth and one beside it surely happily there denied him for so long now in full sight the buffeting windy world outside the good door barred the ruddy fire the welcoming arms the low glad voice happy studious eveningsan arm within an arm a petition implied and a promisea heldout hand a little hand caught within ita prayer an exchange of vows a secret shareda secret a wonderful hope happy cratylus happy poet nay it was not too late for thatnot too late please god in his now exalted mood every faculty shared the high tension his reasoning was exalted and told him that his deep distrust of his own class proceeded from deep experience the fierce querulous and dead beauty of lady diana passed over the scene palely and feverishly she hunted her pleasures and gisthus stalked behind attentive to whisper in her ear at the offered moment no hopes could be justified under the white light of that torturing memory he knew very well he told himself that no woman of his daily acquaintance could give him what he longed for in her degree each and every one must be for him a diana wymondesleywith her friendships connexions thousand calls this way that way every way any way with her flying restless crowded life winters in cairo summers in cowes scottish autumns sicilian springs when could she be at home and he with his longings for the hearth that infinitely holy place must stand be courteous play the great gentleman flog himself to cairo biarritz algiers and feel behind the mask he wore the taloned bird rake at his vitals never never more life is to be lived once and to each his appointed way appointed if you must chosen if you can ah me if choice were his at this late hour his heart was beating high as he rose in his place for the ladies to leave the diningroom miss de speyne presuming on familiar use or her prerogative sailed out first a very juno mrs james lingered for a parting shot at her rector you may be right jamesit is not for me to contradict you but tristram is better at pau than here and i have good reasons for saying so the rector bowed to his wife and for once approved herthas easy manners returned to the rectory when the rector had gone to smoke his cigar mr germain had a little conversation with mrs james if he did not deliberately seek he deliberately provoked the turn it took but it began innocently enough she asked him his time of departure on monday supposing that he must go and tailed off into tomorrows engagements it was now that his face went a thought greyer and that a shade more stiffening thrilled his spine a visit to certain manwarings was proposed for the afternoon your morning you claim i imagine she had said no he replied i gladly make it yours tomorrows that is and there he paused and she waited he took up his tale greatly on saturday my morning is arranged for i have as you know taken upon myself to be interested in the concerns of your miss middlehamhe marked but chose not to remark the flash in the ladys eyes her miss middleham tomorrow i am to be allowed yet further into them matters of moment perhapsi know not that is for saturday at eleven oh said mrs jamesand the vowel held a volume held it tightly really she ought to be very much obliged to you not at all the obligation in my view is quite the other way at my time of life my dear constantia we are apt to plume ourselves upon the confidences of the young i should not venture the confidences of that particular young person said mrs james with pointa dry pointare likely to be modified on this occasion but if she should happen to be unreserved i could wish you would use your influence for her good doubtless he agreed that is my sincere desire if you could suggest to me any direction in which my services mrs james looked at him and he while meeting her gaze must needs remark upon her hardrimmed eyes it was as if they had been set in metal we spoke of tristram at dinneri dont know whether you heard i said that he was better even at pau with poor lord bramleigh just now than here you may not have heard me mr germain blinked i am not sure that i should have conceived you had i overheard the remark you paint misperton in dark colours if what i have heard of young bramleigh be true andto resume the first subject of our conversation unfortunately the subjects are connected said mrs james and saw him flinch tristram is old enough to look after himself but surely you will agree that his companionship is not the best for a girl in her position he had not for nothing worn a mask some twenty years of his life wearers of these defences become very expert by use and can turn them against themselves at will mrs james got no joy out of her revelation and he little pain he gave her a stately bow i entirely agree he said of course of course she accepted him but went on we cannot but regret it those of us who take an interest unfortunately i can hardly speak to her upon such a subject since i have no authority over herand james will not he is pleased to be diverted at what i have to tell himyou know his way i dont know how far your kindly inquiries we have hardly reached her matrimonial projects said mr germain so simply that mrs james lost her head matrimony a nursery governess my dear john pray dont misunderstand me he continued to blink urbanely at her master now of the position i wish to avoid precisely that little claim as i have to discuss such matters with miss middleham i should certainly ask her to pause if i believed that she could accept the addresses of a young man like tristram perhaps i am prejudicedbut tristram said mrs james tartly is as likely to marry mary middleham as you are is he though he said with a little jocularity but he blinked again from the chamber of the beglamoured cratylus i may pass to that of his meroor marina if you prefer itwho with no manwarings in prospect to afford distraction had a day of routine to go through before the interview could be reached there was little in this to fix her mind or woo it back from straying into the vague it is not surprising therefore to find her on the morrow of her midnight adventurea note of apology and excuse despatched to the sanctuarysnug in her bed at an unwonted hour nursing her cheek and remembrances together as much alive to the fact that she had been interested yesterday as to those which promised her that she was to be absorbed tomorrow and then as she lay wideeyed dreaming wondering softlysmiling quickbreathing her wide horizons opened up to her by flashes or were clouded up suddenly enfolded in the rosy mists of conscious pursuit to know as she must that her company was desired courted deeply considered by a considerable gentleman could not but give a tinge of rose to her dreamsenses the warm fleeces enwrapped her hugged her they could be felt they made her cheeks tingle as her blood coursed free against this passive ecstasythis rapture of the chasethere rose in strife a new feeling a dawning sense of power to judge and weigh a discretion imparted a dignity of choice and as this prevailed and her mind leapt back to her friend of the night see the mists thin and part and grow pallid see her caught breath and brightening eyes as she strained to watch the farstretching plains of life the distant seas blue hillswonderful vistas beholding which she seemed to lay her hand upon the pivot of the world the battle raged over her form supine like a dormouse in her nest she lay but within her breast within her mind the armies engaged swept forward and back a day of this must not be and could not she must have stimulant she must have excitants must do something or go mad she recollected with a thumping heart that she might see her friend again she was to report herself and her ankle he had asked her and she had promised to come there was an appointment true it had been for sundaybut what were sundays to him it might be today as she dressed she dallied with the temptation and before she had finished she knew that she had fallen early in the afternoon she sprang into her saddle eager for the encounter her ankle was forgotten she felt strong and exulting in her strength cleared the miles with that sense of delighted effort which a bicycle only can givebecause it replies so readily her heart beat high as from chidiocks that suburb of misperton she saw the white hill atop of which the common began she walked it deliberately holding herself back that she might play with the pleasure promiseda pleasure none the worse mind you for being perfectly lawful this man was her friend and she had never had a man for a friend before she felt good and very strong there then was the white peak of the tent there too was the tiltcart so he was waiting for her promise to be kept there again was the back of the prowling ghost bingo ran on three legs across the roaddear bingo and there was her friend yes but he was not alone she was dismayedhad not expected that a horseman talked to him from the roada horseman ah no it was a horsewoman and her friend if she might continue to think him so stood there in an animated discussion and declaimed upon a paper in his hand her heart fell far but she pressed on nothing in the worldneither tact nor delicacy nor fear of detectioncould have stopped her she must know more at any cost she went as far as she dared by the road and then dismounting moved on to the turf and dropped her bicycle screened by furzebushes she got to within fifty thirty twenty yards and there stopped knelt down and watched with intensely bright eyes the mounted lady was miss de speyne the honourable hertha de speyne proud daughter of the cantacutes a personage so far out of her reach that her least act was acceptable as a stroke of great fatea sunstroke or a thunderbolt alas for her joys but her friend no less easy by day than by night in one company than another held in his hand a drawingas she guessedand talked vehemently of it she could hear his wordsits not badits not at all badi admit it and thanks very much for allowing me but if you say that of a drawing you say the cruellest worstunless you call it clever it wants breadth it wants matrise it wants as all halfart wants the disdainful ease of nature to produce what nature can never produce theres a fine line in baudelairewell never mind that noive done better than this i did some savernake things which pleased metrees and glades evening things we had some yellow skies shot greenwonderful wonderful i got some poetry into them but thishe gave it a flick of the fingersthis is rather smug you know i dont think it smug said miss de speyne with her great air of finality i like it glad of that anyhow was the artists thanksgiving your praise is worth having ive worked very hard the lady said but im afraid i can talk better than i paint ah we all do that yes she said thats the worst of it they paused she patted her horse he looked with narrowed eyes into the weather presently she said i suppose you couldnt come and see my thingsand bring some of your owncould you do you think my people would be delighted he looked at her considering so should i becharmed yes ill come if you mean it when of course i mean it miss de speyne rejoined could you come to luncheon the day after tomorrow thats sunday i know it is he said with a laugh what a heathen you think me yes ill certainly come butwhere are you exactly misperton brandmisperton park you go through the village and a little way beyond the rectory you come to a lodge oh i know it then he laughed at his memories ill tell you afterwardsafter luncheon thanks ill come but i must be back pretty early in the afternoon your own time of course she gathered up her reins till sunday she said with a nod he bowedhatless as before miss de speyne pushed homeward and mary middleham with hot splashes of colour in her cheeks returned to her fallen bicycle and never looked behind how much the grave benevolence of mr germain may have gained by this little contretemps we may guess broad vistas after all are very well indeed for the robust they are bracing and tonic but if i am to be snug give me rosy mists x cratylus with marina the incredible word upon the day designed by highest heavenas we are led to supposethey took the way of misperton park the enamoured gentleman and the lady they sat under the famous royal oaka shade with which she was we know familiarcratylus talked marina sat modestly listening if he saw her the spirit of the treethe peering dryad mero caught and held to his words its all one her simple allure her dainty reserves had ravished his senses the tinge of sunburn in her cheeks the glint of conscious pride in her eyes beat back like blown flame upon his blood that fired his brain in a word he loved therefore he believed he spoke of himself today of his youth and marriage lady diana was not named but her knife under the cloak was implied sadly yet without complaint he related the ossifying of all his generous hopes this he said was long ago but the dead cannot all at once be hidden under the turf i have been ten years long at a burying and now have done what remain to me of years i know not truly but they will be the more precious if they are to be few i believe that i am very capable of happinessperhaps even of bestowing it my affairs are in good order i have been fortunate as you know in worldly respects a childless widower i pick up my life again at fifty where i left it at fiveandtwenty and i tell myselfi have told myself but newlythat i may not be too late to this sort of soliloquy to the grave voice that rehearsed it she had nothing to say he found that he must import her bodily into his conversation for one thing he continued after a pause of exploration i now have leisure as you have seen to interest myself in my neighbours and have derived so much pleasure from it that i am deeply grateful to those who have indulged me you are one i think that you must have remarked what happiness your society and your confidence have been to me her shamefastness which tied her tongue compelled him to probe have you not seen that she murmured that he had been very kind that she was grateful not so my dear said he but the persons must be transposed the kindness is yours the obligation upon me come can you not tell me that you have understood me can you not let me be satisfied that you realize your own benevolence if you cannot i must withhold what i was about to say to you i should want for courage i must ask for your assurance you will not refuse it exciting mystifying talk she dared not look upbut she asked him what it was that she was to tell him he luxuriated in her bashfulness why my dearest child he said very near to her i want to know whether you believe me happy in your company she would not look at him but she said i hope that you like mei do hope that then he took her hand and held it in both of his own he gazed tenderly down upon her hanging headnot one meek beauty of her escaped him neither of burning cheek curved lashes of heavy eyelids rising breast then dear child i will tell you plainly that i love you most sincerely that you have my heart such as it is in your little handsjust as certainly as one of those hands is here in mine i have told you the truth about myselfwhat i hoped to be what i was what i am become and now if you can repay that confidence with a confidence i shall be satisfied indeed but i must ask you again can you value the love of a man twice your age remember i shall not be hurt if you tell me that you cannot i shall respect your confidence whatever it may be and shall never trouble you again what do you tell me now mary she had started visibly at the word love and had been revealed to him for a flash which gave him the value of her wide eyes and of the flying colour which now left her very pale then lapped her in flame again and showed her like a red rose a flash only for immediately after she had bowed her head so deeply that her chin nearly touched her bosom and she could have smelt the knot of carnations fastened there her hand was still his prisoner but she would have freed it if she could for now she was startled indeed though she had been forewarned her armour was not on this word was a dart and stabbed her deep the incredible thing had come to pass she had been prepared for unbounded sentiment for tenderness for the captured hand she had foreseen a breathless moment or so a stoop and a kiss such a string of episodesjust that string of themwould not have been strange to her by any means and would have satisfied her anticipations perfectly she would have been elated would have made much of it in her mind might possibly after some interval in some tender hour have confided it to a bosom friend on many dull days it would have shone like a lamp assuring her of substantial things of honour done of a positive achievement of hersto have won such condescension from a great gentleman here had beenyou may saya creditable triumph for the middlehams but a declaration in so many wordslove offered and asked again what could this mean but one astounding thing she was frightened and thats a fact frightened out of her wits the averting of her head which so enchanted mr germain was of a piece with ostrich strategy if she could have run and hidden underground she would have done it for what can that word love from such a man mean but marriage i beg the ladys pardon for leaving her hand in so embarrassing a case her head so downcast her breath so troublesomebut her difficulties must be faced marriage as she had been taught this worlds economy is the beall and endall for women here it is almost a disgrace and quite a disaster for a girl to slip into womanhood and not be wedded the enormous seriousness then of the affair all men talk to women of love and a girl had need be quick to discern which kind is the staple which kind is aimed at lipservice which at lifeservice there will be both to reckon with the two rarely coincide many a young man will seek the flower of a girls lips sup of it at ease and content himselfah and content her too whereas your serious wooer with his eye upon comfort a foothold a mother for his children and a stay for himself may well have other things to think ofa promotion a partnership a chance abroad a legacy a desirable corner house care will tighten his lips too hard for kissing the future will be all that he reads after in your eyes if he kisses it will be by custom as likely as not dont i say that he will have other things to think of now mr germain had not kissed mary though to be sure he had spoken of his love and yetand yetyes he wanted to marry her frightened yes she was frightened but she was full of thought too she knew very well that her ways were not those of the world above her the world of the upper air where honourable mrs germains cantacutes duplessis and the like talked familiarly together of parties and public affairs there as she saw the heights the women were so obviously desirable that there was nothing for them to do but pick up their happiness as they chose and as their due there could surely be no anxiety there no whispered debates over what he meant or had looked or was thinking their lives were full to brimming point from girlhood up everything fell into their laps or could be had for money nothing surprised her more in the lives of her betters than the frequency with which they boughtexcept the case of the transaction one even paid for work if one happened to be in the mood to workas when miss de speyne desiring to paint hired an artist to go about with her open a white umbrella here and there and paint beside her grey grey and hard seemed her outlook beside theirs when as now she was driven to compare them and hereo wonderful fatewas this brimming crowded life opening to her to her mary middleham who had worked for pence a year and fended for herself and had adventures from her seventeenth to this her twentyfifth summer terrible wonderful thing she had neither a word to say nor a connected thought she wanted to hide her burning cheeks felt that she must never look up againand all this while mr germain held her cold hand it felt dead to her and what must he be thinking of her he was very patient well my dear well was the note he harped upon and how he could read you poor child so i have terrified you this idea seemed in some way to please him for he expressed it several times and as he held her hand in one of his patted it with the otherhoping it would seem to make her as comfortable as he was himself am i to be answered mary have you nothing to say to me she had not for her life she must have time this she forced herself to explain i dont know what to say to youi dont indeed but he seemed to find this quite as it should be he leaned a little towards her shall i leave you he asked would you wish to think it over i will do all i can to make it easy for you yes pleaseno i mustnt trouble you i meanoh mr germain what ought i to say the russet wonder of her eyes was upon him filled his being he saw her quivering lip wet from biting dearest child he urged her dearest child consult your heart if you think that you can be content with meif you can believe what i tell you she looked at him now as though he had hurt her i mustnt believe youi ought noti know i ought not i am not fit for younot good enough she stammered reproached him with her great eyes for a beating secondand then the storm broke and swept away her little defences she cried in his arms for he took her there he tasted her tears for he began to kiss them away at first she tried to disengage herself but soon gave over the struggle not daring to prolong a losing game and it was a comfort too you see to have strife done with she hid her face however in his arm he kissed her hair when she was quieted he talked to herif you can call that talk which a man might use to a pretty dog a leveret or if he were with it alone to a baby foolish affectionate happy nonsense it was charged full with pity for a creature so young and so simple he soothed and touched her both never had she dreamed of such kindness as this nor of the comfort of it so presently she lay still looking wistfully out upon the green curves of the park the dark masses of the summer trees the tall deep bracken and afar a herd of deer feeding twinkling their scuts as they moved slowly across the sunlit turf above her head she heard the murmur of his kind voice hardly distinguished the words he used but judged them generally to be all love and gentleness what misgivings she may have had fell from her as this peace claimed its rights she thought that she could have stayed like this for ever she thought that thus indeed it was to be this this was love this how gentlemen loved what a life was to be hers she sighed and snuggled more deeply into her luxury his heart beat to feel the pressure of her to doubt himselfwhether he would fail of utter love and devotion for a confidence so exquisite as thiswould have been a blasphemy my darling girl my darling love my mary and as she looked timidly up and shyly smiled her trust into his face he bent over her transported met and kissed her lips she thrilled responsive and smiling still closed her eyes god helping me he said with a sob you shall never regret this day for their loitered progress homewards he put her hand into his arm and it lay there so long as they were safe within the park she hardly spoke and only looked at him for seconds at a time her responses when he called her by fond names or breathed some assurance of his love and happiness were little pressures of the arm flutterings of the eyelids ghosts of smiles scarcely to be seen but he was perfectly satisfied the good man sailing along upon his clouds which were rosy and golden at the edges he took her stoutly to her own door and left her therewould not venture himself within the sacred threshold i shall see you again before i go my dearest tomorrow i will comeah but you have given me wonderful tomorrows you have made me happier than i ever dared hope to be i will write to you of course from londonand do you write me again write me fullyconfide in mehave no anxieties which i may not share i call upon your parents in the course of the week dearest will you not love me she was now much moved he might have seen her struggle to express herselfher bosom heaved in tumult and distressa cry escaped her oh you are good you are good how can i help likinghow can i like you enough love she dared not say respect for her held him in check he must content himself with her hand which bareheaded he kissed i am more than happyi am exalted adieu my love adieu thank god your days of servitude are over bid me goodbye now and i will go she hung her head bashful again he had to invite her once more to draw her nearer to stoop and to whisper her name blushing and glowing she swayed caught by the hand and then as a sudden surge of gratitude swept over her she put her hand upon his shoulder and leaned to him looking up i shall try to be good i am sure that i love you she faltered and he swept out of propriety by her emotion and his own in confluence took her in his arms and kissed her at first she clung to him and gave him kiss for kiss but suddenly she stiffened and tried violently to get free he felt that and released her at once instantly himself again in a flash she vanished he kept his hat in his hand until he was beyond the wicketgate then walked back slowly to the rectory luncheon he had had no eyes for the passing of a tall loosely clad young man whose black straight hair was uncovered and his black eyes sideways upon everything like a fauns he had had other things to do with his eyesbesides he was nearsighted but mary had noticed indeed and was now standing in her little dark parlour in a stare her finger at her lip her heart in full and open riot he had seen her he must have seen herkissing being kissed whatever happened he must hear her explanation xi cool comfort saturdays wonders sunday thrillswith her declared lover monumentally in the rectory pew and his relatives all unconscious that they were soon to be hers hers mary middlehams o altitudodid not release her in her own mind from the promise of sunday afternoon not only had she promised not only had she something to tell him a solid base for her feet from which to regard him and a sanctuary in which to hide from which to emerge at will ready for any encounter not only so but she must put herself right with him he had seen her must have seen her in a delicate situationnothing to him of course but somehow everything to her she could not she said afford that he should deem her a girl of the sortto be kissed in a doorway by anybody gentleman or no gentleman there were reasonsspecial reasons for it and since as the fact was these reasons did not now seem as cogent as they had yesterday there was nothing for it but to cry them over and over to herself engaged to be marriedengaged to be marriedto mr germainto mr germain of southover house and he loves me dearlyand i love him so she pedalled and sang racing with her thoughts the bicycle took her to the common of mere that blazing sunday afternoon his eyes looked up from their work twinkled and laughed at her so its you then i thought you wouldnt come he was mending the sole of a shoe and resumed his cheerful taptapping directly he had greeted her she stood leaning on her bicycle watching his work her new estate sat in full possession of her eyes yes ive come i couldnt come earlier he paused hammer in air it was as well you didnt ive been out lunching she knew that very well and with any other man would have pretended that she did not some pretty fishing would have followedwith him out of the question at the park she saidturning up the statement into a question by habit precisely there said he and returned to his shoe no fishing in such waters as hisbut he looked up again presently with a laugh in his eyes i met your mr germain he told herand she flamed i wanted to tell youi felt that i must i ami was with him when you he nodded over his shoe leather so i supposed that was mr germainyou know i know i recognized him i had been to reconnoitre the park she could not perhaps have accounted to herself for her next question do you like miss de speyne he frankly considered it for a while looking at the questioner without discomfortto himself at least yes yes i think i do shes a fine young woman and shes simple shes herself yes i like her very much she can paint flowersnothing else but she paints flowers well so much for the honourable hertha de speyne may i sit down mary was quite at her ease again he jumped up with apologies and brought her cushions bingo came up wagging his back and being caressed sat up stiffly beneath her hand she watched her friend fill his pipe and collected herself for her affair then she lowered her eyes and began hardening her voice i came because i wanted your opinion as i hopedi mean as i thought i possibly might you remember that i said i should like to talk to you well i didnt know thenfor certainwhat i should have to say but she stopped there but now you do is that it yes shall you think it strange of me i dont knowbut its very unlikely if i do ill tell you go on its about mr germain do you remember that i told youhed been kind to me his eyes were narrow but upon her critically upon her he smoked slowly as if he enjoyed every fibre of the weed on fire yes i remember he was so kindhe went so out of his way to be kind that i was puzzled i could not help fancying naturally well she plunged he has asked me to marry him her friend took his pipe out of his mouth looked long at it and put it back again i saw that he hadyesterday he might have seen pride shine in her eyes at that compliment but instead of looking for that he asked and is he going to i dont know she answered pondering but does he think he is she fondled bingo who threw up his head eyed her gratefully and accepted the compliment then she answered him yesi believe he does during the ensuing pause their eyes met for a moment hes very much in love with the idea said the gentlemantinker he was highly uplifted todayanybody could have guessed he added as if to himself it may do it sometimes does she considered this then threw up her head and was eloquent it wont doit cant that makes me unhappy instead of happy i know that it is not rightwhatever you may say ofof there being no classes i feel that there are classes more than enough perhaps but there they are and we cant help them whatever you may say about specimens in boxes mr germain is a gentleman and my father is not and his first wife was a ladya lady diana somethingand his second if its me wont bebut just a little ignorant person who has worked for her living since she was sixteen and seen all sorts of peopleandanddone all sorts of things no no it cant be rightfor him at any rate how am i to satisfy him try as i will why theres mrs james at the rectoryshe terrifies me i feel like a lump of earth

dont know whether i darei promise you i dont he watched her gravely nodding his head from time to time and at the end he smiled doubtfully well he said and i dont know whether you dare i dont know you know but i should say that you could dare most things you had set your heart on her eyes quickened my heart is not set on it i was very excited yesterdayany girl in my position would beoh most wonderful butif i couldif i dared i should run away i promise you he regarded her kindly well then he said run she staredtheir eyes methers fell first no no i mustnt he expects me nowbesides he hasno i belong to him nowif he wants me the gentlemantinker got upappeared to be annoyed he took a stride or two up and down the road this is against consciencegood god its against nature its why i loathe marriage why i would never marry its all feudalits the law of real property you are in a markethe buys you with a kind word and alook here now and he faced her frowning will nothing teach you your valuewill nothing give you respect for yourself he turned away abruptly i beg your pardon ive no right to talk to you like this she forgot to be involvedforgot that she was involvedin his condemnation please talk to meplease to make me understand she said but he wanted a good deal of persuasion no no it has nothing to do with him he should only make mischiefhad made too much already and said he finally i cant afford it i am rather prone i believe to get interested in other peoples affairsand it interrupts my own confoundedly im very sorry she said prettily contrite he bit his cheek not your fault of courseall mine i got interested in you when i found you in the wirehighly romantic that sort of thing andandso its gone on well he looked at her anxiously well i shall do harm im certain but ill tell you what i think if you insist on it she clapped her hands glowed and sparkled like a diamond she looked bewitchingly pretty please please i wont speak a word until youve done he sat and began slowly i stick to my opinion of classes of course you arent in a position to judge youve never had a ghost of a chance as far as men go there are only two classesmen who can behave and men who cant my father taught me when i was a boy to call all men men and all women ladies there was the man who swept the crossing and the man who sat on the bench but i remember that i got into a row for talking about the woman who sold matches all women are ladies unless you know to the contrary said my father dont you ever forget that and i never did if youll forgive me theres nothing in what you say about your own unworthiness and germains magnanimity except one thingand that is that you who have everything to gain are the last person to admit what is so obviously true and you are not quite honest you dont fear yourself reallyyou are confident in your inmost heart that you can learn what you suppose to be solemn duties but he collected himself for his but while she hung her detected head but he mind you is persuadedand its you who are helping him to believethat he is a superior person doing you an enormous honour he calls it kindness of course and so do youoh so do you and thats what hes in love with mostlythe idea of exalting you putting you on a pedestal kneeling making sacrifice burning incense hes full of ithe was trembling with it todayand hell do it im certain and then retire into his inner chamber and beat his breast and cry to his soul how lovely she ishow sensitive to these wonderful honours i put her there o god i did itunder thee lord i thank thee for this glorious work which is mine i suppose you think im a maniac im frightfully sane hell be as happy as a king like his betters before him cophetua i cophetua iithe whole dynasty thats his point of view you know and its not a bad one its very artistic old tennyson saw that but before you lend yourself to ita girl likewell any girl you pleasei do think you should ask yourself where you come in how much worship can you stand how long can you be sensitive to benefits and honours how long before they become matters of course how long before you want the real thing because i need not tell you that there is a real thing had he not broken off here she would not have met his eyesnor he hers the saying would have been merged in the general drift of his harangue which was serious enough but she caught at the break caught at the words caught at the sense looked at him seriously looked at him full his eyes being upon her met hers and held them she was confounded that moment of interconsciousness was fully charged it is much to his credit that he slipped out without abruptness he took a turn up and down the road before he went on a man will go through life possessed with an idea and be absolutely happy with it dont have any fears on his account it is all that he wants the womans only business is to lend herself to it but were considering the womanand theres this great difference they dont like ideas at all they like thingsthat they can touch stroke handle nurse wash and dress if you find such things you are all right but if you dont and then he stoppedin spite of her she tried him with a well what then but could get nothing more from him oh i hope you will lets hope so was all he would say she nursed her chin with her hand he at his length beside her plucked at the turf too many confidences had passed for her to be reticent now you say you will never marry she began never he said the states impossible wrong from the beginning it puts the woman hopelessly in the wrong its monstrous then you thinkyes i believe you are right at any rate i mustnt let mr germain he sat up look here he said germain will make you a very good husband hes a true man she was busy with bingo to bingos quiet satisfaction yes im sure of that but her tongue was tied and so now was his the ensuing silence was not comfortable to either and the instinct of a good girl made her end it at any price rising sedately she held out her hand goodbyeand thank you very much you have made me think he laughed as he shook hands you have made me think too goodbye all happiness she did not reply to that but said we meet again i hope sure to he said this is an island then she must needs go of the two of them the man was the more perturbedbut he had his remedy after a frowning quarterhour he was up and packing his tent within the hour he was on the road with her no revolt against what was to be there is no revolt visible under the sun for the poor when mr germain called the next morning to bid her farewell she received him with all the virginal airs of the consciously possessed he measured her fourth finger a pretty ceremony xii alarums revolt is as it always has been within easy reach of the great but a rectors wife should attend upon her lord the hon mrs germain watched her jamess eyebrow waiting for the lift it came and her cry broke from her james james this cannot be possible she saw her fair realm in earthquake and eclipse the rector no less disturbed could not for the life of him avoid his humour alas my dearone eyebrow made a hoop in his foreheadall things are possible to amorous man amorous she whistled the word johnand that minx you use horrible words hardly so my dear not horrible in a mans regard for his wife the state is sanctioned she was beyond his quibbles what are we to do heavens and earth what can we do he eyed his brothers letter ruefully upon my word he said this is a facer i could have believed anything of any man sooner than this of him old john exactly double her ageand she a quiet little mouse of a girl out of a cottage woodbine cottage eh thats it you know woodbine cottage and white muslin have done it do you remember the valentines of our youthgauffred edges a pathway to a porchthe linked couple and the little god in the air pink as a shell white muslinfatal wear he sees her so to all eternity enskied and sainted in muslin and a sash confound it constantia i feel old she was beyond his whimsies you may be thankful that you do this appears to me disgusting have we used him so ill that he should slap our faces the rector indulged his eyebrows again diana he said she did not defend that dead lady but even another lady diana seemed more tolerable to mrs james pecca fortiter she could have said had she had a head for tags lady diana sinning de race would have been intelligible say to the cantacutes but here was no sin but merely a squalid enchantment a doting gentleman a peering little nobody in muslinhow should this be put say to the cantacutes aberration chivalry romance never romance precisely because that was just what it waspitiful romance james had hit it off exactly it was the washy facile romance of a sixpenny valentine of a thing that housemaids drink with their eyes saponaceousheavens and earth mrs james lifted her hands and let them fall to her lap i simply cannot hold up my head in the village she said james think of the cantacutes why on earth should i think of the cantacutes he was testy under his trouble i have my brother to think of hes been hasty over thiswhich is most unlike himand secret as well i had no notion any such thing was going on not the least in the world it was mrs jamess duty to confess that some notion ought to have been hers and she did confess it so happens that i was speaking to him of this girl the night we dined at the park he told me that he was interesting himself in her and i asked him to say something about tristram about tristram says the rector sharply what about tristram pray she could not but remember former warnings i think you will do me the justice james you have been told that tristram has chosen to amuse himself with her who has not i remember telling you about it when as usual you laughed at me i begged john to influence the girlto induce her to respect herselfand with this result the rector pushed his chair away you speak more truly than you know he said rose and took a turn about the room now i understand the haste he had been hovering poor foolish fellowsingeing his grey wings but it was you constantia drove him to plunge take my word for it dear dear dear this is really a great bore i dont know what to do upon my word i dont i shall speak to the girl of course said mrs james gathering up letters and keys it is doubtful if her husband heard her he had stepped through the window into the garden before she had risen the rectors walk a pleached alley of nut trees received him for more than an hour he might have been observed pacing it with lowered head and hands behind his back but mrs germain went about her duties of the day with tight lips and eyes aglitter at intervals her anguish betrayed itself in cries monstrous monstrous to her it was monstrous for she saw the girl without glamour standing amid the wreckage of a fair realma little governess wickedly demure the germain banner was rent the germain character blotted that carefully contrived dual empire which she shared with the cantacutes was threatened her authority as a county lady as rectors wife toppling her throne wanting a leg she saw herself pitied her husbands family the object of lifted brows and she had been a loyal wife and knew it because she had honestly admired the marks of race in the germains herself a telfer she was of that famous norman house which lost first blood at hastings and she never forgot it least of all when she had married into the germains who were county and good blood but not noble she remembered she always remembered thatbut she was a loyal wife without and within he and she were a strong contrasthe frosty dry and deliberate she fiery impulsive stormdriven not above the aid of tears he lean and pale she a plump woman and a pink his instinct was to approve at first blush hers to disapprove they were good friends and had never been more there were no children that had been a grievance of hers until she got into the way of saying that the germains were a dwindling race andlook at poor john germain i wish the reader to note the subtle change from complaint to complacency in mrs jamess outlook it marks her character to be a barren wife through no fault of your own and to take comfort in saying that your husband comes of a dwindling stock shows that you have an eye for outline in a family it is rather like excusing your black wyandottes which give you no breakfast eggsyes but thats the mark of the breed so hereeither i have children or my husband is no germain here was strong character exhibited and all may be forgiven to strength but weaknessmere dotagemere desire a landed gentleman of fifty and a girl in muslinmonstrous monstrous cried mrs james in her bitterness when mary home from the sanctuary heard the click of the wicket and the swish of a silk petticoat over the flagstones she knew what was coming upon her her colour fled and returned redoubled and a scare showed in her quick eyes in a moment she called up her defencesher more than one lettershe had received a third that morning i shall see your father that said an hour after you receive this my mary if i know anything of his daughter he will not fail to confirm the signal trust which she has shown me she had not been very sure what he meant by signal trust it must certainly be something which any girl might be proud to have and she had something more wonderful than a lettera ring the most splendid she had ever seena great sapphire set in a lake of brilliants she glanced at it now as hearing the lady at the door she slipped it off and put it in her pocket mrs james knocked like a postman and with a wild heart mary went to meet her enemy in the gate ah goodevening mary may i come in thank you she preceded her dependant into the little parlour sat in the chair which had most the similitude of a throne and began at once upon her subject i have called to see you in consequence of a letter which the rector received this morning from mr germain may i inquire if you guess no indeed i see that i need not the girls face told the tale her eyes were cast down inquiry of the sort was absurd i think mary that you have strange ideas i do indeed and am sorry to have to add that i know where you have obtained them but mary had spirit it seemed i obtained them from mr germain she said with a certain defiance which may have been very natural but had been better away i obtained them from him they were not mine i assure you mrs germain opened her mouth and shut it with a snap she opened it again a little way to say the thing is impossible and another snap followed so i told mr germain said mary my impression is very strong continued mrs james ignoring interruption that you have misunderstood mr germains kindness and strangely so that being the case marys eyes flashed i beg pardon mrs germain but that is not the case mr germain has gone to see my parents today he writes me word you will kindly allow me to finish i believe that you misunderstood something mr germain may have said to yousome advice or inquiry or offer of help that he may have seen your error and regretted it while he was too chivalrous to undeceive you i consider that you may be preparing a great unhappiness for yourself and for him and i am in a position to say i beg your pardon mrs germain said mary but nobody is in a position to say anything to me of this but mr germain himself now this was so obviously true that even mrs james accepted it she had been too hasty and while she was swallowing her chagrin mary took her opportunity i must tell you please that you cannot be more surprised than i was when mr germain spoke to me as he did i had never dreamed of such a thing it is not likely that i should he had been all thats kind to me ever since the schooltreateven now i can hardly believe that any one could be so kind but when hewhen he spoke to measked me if i could care for himin that wayi vow to you i could not answer him i was most stupidi was confused and could not collect my thoughts and i never did collect them she cried with a sudden burst of confession and never answered him at allexcept by crying which any girl would have done i think and then hewell then he k mrs james shut her eyes tight i know what you are going to say no no be silent i beg mary put her hand to her throat as if she was being choked her eyes shone like jet i hope that you will be just to me mrs germain i do hope so i know that you put all the blame on me but it is unfair to do that what could i do if he spoke to me kindly must i not answer kindly if he came to see me how could i refuse to see him if he invited me to walk with him what could i say or do and thenwhen he asked me did i care for himandandoh i must say itkissed ah said mrs germain with a spasm oh wicked wicked mary flamed i am not wicked mrs germain and i must ask you not to call me so mr germain would not like it at all you cannot believe him to be wicked and if he did what he did he had good reason and now i will tell you that i never answered his question and have not known how to answer it answer it girl you prevaricate answer itin the face of his letter to my husband mr germain has been more than kind said mary losing ground andand and mr duplessis has been more than kind i believe said mrs jamesand her words were knives the girl quailed pray how much more kindness is my family to show you mary was now very cold one member of it she said will show me nonewill not show me even justice mr duplessis has no claim claim cried the great lady red as fire what claim should he wish to make i think you have lost your senses she may well have lost patience courage and a good sense she stamped her foot i wish you would leave me alone mrs germain you are cruel to me and unjust i have done you no harmno but always my duty and you know that very well you drive me into cornersyou make me say thingsi am very unhappyplease leave me she covered her eyes to hide the tears which pricked her mrs james was not to be melted by such a device if you are to be impertinent i shall certainly leave you she said this matter however cannot be left as it is the rector must see you about it goodevening but when the unaccountable rector received the report from his wife he was pleased to show temper i think you have acted foolishly constantia and morei think you have acted with great want of consideration i had almost said with want of respect for my brother you have read his letter you know how he stands towards mary and you rate her as if she were a servant caught in a fault really that wont do i must make amends preposterous that my brothers affianced wife should be treated like a kitchenmaid you have no rightno earthly rightto say to her what you would not dream of saying to my brother heavens to john germain head of one of the best families in england tst tst i am very vexed he must have been for he went early to the cottage and asked for mary when she appeared before him flushed and with all her defences out he held out his hand to her drew her towards him and kissed her so we are to know you in a new capacity my dear he said i shall be very ready for that her tears gathered one brimmed over and fell but did not scald oh mr germain she beganand ended there with a choke my dear ill tell you thisyou have won a true man i know my brother better than you do at present and you may take my word for that thank you thank you was all that she could say one thing more you will be welcome at the rectory you mustnt take anything that has been said to you amiss you know that when we are taken aback sometimes we dont alwayswell ill ask you has anybody ever made you jump eh somebody has very well werent you rather cross for a minute confess that you were my dear we all are but it dont mean anything no no indeed oh mr germain i dont know what to do about all this your duty my dear to god and man itll be before you every day all you have to do is to take it up yes yes i know butmr germain im frightenedreally im ignorant and stupidand of course im different from youve a pretty way of confessing it at any rate said the rector it will all come right i hope you are very quick i can tellyoull learn your lesson in no time i know you are a charming young lady and believe a good one theres not much more than that in any one that ive ever seen in these parts now dont be offended with me if i say that you are going to have a good husband and ask you to deserve him oh mr germainher tears fell freelyi do want to be goodi do mean to try bless you my dear im quite sure of that said he and gave her another kiss he told his wife that evening definitely that they must make the best of it and gave her to understand that johns wife must be taken at johns valuation if john chose to marry a kitchenmaid that kitchenmaid was ipso facto on the germain level so also if john had selected an archduchess a germain could pick up or pull down said the rector in effect but he also announced that he should go to town on the morrowwhich weakened his decree so he did and was away two daysan interval of time during which mary went grimly about her duties and mrs germain faced the problem of the cantacutes this lady may be pitied who felt her crown slipping and throne rocking on its degrees her loyalty to the family into which she had been married was sapped she did not see how germain character was to be admired if it betrayed a germain into such a vagary her husband her temperate frosty james was involved for the first time in her life she was tempted to work against him she could do that mind you she had the weapon to her hand a doubleedged tooltristram a hint to tristram at pau and he would be hereand once here should he look upon mary as she believed he would as the lion on a lamb printed by his paw why what chance had john germain against him that villainy she could practise if she chose but she knew it was a villainy and that she was no villain then there was another way not villainousnay was it not a duty she could tell john germain what she knew of tristram and hint at more than she knew a germain would shiver at such a tarnish on his idealshe could see john shut his eyes as the spasm passed over him but there was this difficulty about it that she could not write to him without her husbands knowledgenay without his approbationwhereas what more natural than that she should deplore with her cousin laura duplessis this miserable state of affairs mrs james was no villain she was merely a proud woman touched on a raw her security her comfort her authority her selfesteem were all threatened by an act of dotage what else was this infatuation of john germains pray and there are sophistries to help the very best of us had there been nothing between tristram and mary mrs duplessis would have been invited to sympathize and there was nothing after all tristram with his high connexions his talents and his superb airand a little sly teacher the thing was absurd fully convinced of its absurdity mrs james marched down to the cottage and found her cousin duplessis arranged on a sofa with a white lace mantilla over her head her handbell in easy call and a smellingbottle attached to her wrist by a little chain mrs duplessis had been handsome and remembered it everything about her person reminded her of thather languor her elegance her thin hands her fine complexion her tall son how i survived the birth of that great boy passes my comprehension my nerves you know my dear hector all fire as he was had the tact of a woman mamie he said never again or i accuse myself of murder henceforward i am a monk he kept his word but it killed him do not men die for women my poor brave hector apart from these tender reminiscences she had her poverty to cherish to tinge with dignity to show burnishedwith a lovely patina like old lacquer we live wretchedly as you can see my dear soul but we pay our way and hold our heads up we only owe to ourselves and are indulgent creditors tristram i suppose will marry il doit se ranger vraiment but he says that we can afford leisureour only luxury the good cantacutes are most kind and hertha a really charming girl why is it that young men cannot see where their fortune lies cynicism arrogance ingratitude i ask myself these questions she was enormously interested in the news and gratified my poor soul what a blow john germain of all humdrum persons in the worldand the girl not even pretty you say clever though have you broken it to emily cantacute i dont envy you that task its not done yet said mrs james grimly oh my dear but it is her cousin replied acutely john germain is just the man to be in opposition pride you know we all have that he would call it chivalry do you know how far tristram might be concerned in this mrs james inquired shortly mrs duplessis narrowed her eyes and slowly shut them tristram never gives confidences she said in a carefully fatigued voice on such a matter i had rather he did not mrs james would have none of this my dear laura we are alone i think i know tristram well enough to say that he has interested himself in the girl no doubt he has flattered her i think she has been grateful it would not be surprising if he were unprepared for such a change of affairs on the contrary said mrs duplessis judging by what you seem to think of her i should imagine that he might be prepared for anything to be sure there is john germain john germain and tristram are not good friends i happen to know ah said mrs duplessis that throws some light perhaps it does mrs james returned but i should not like to say where it throws it she had a shrewd suspicion that she and her cousin might be in the beam there was a taint in all this the rector came back that night greatly bothered more than once in the course of the evening he threw up his hands my poor good brother heaven help us all i found him inalterably fixed he told his wife and perfectly complacent his serenity confounded me put me to shame he sees his happiness as clearly before him as you see his misery he loves the child for the very things which you dislike in her you say that she is common and i cannot contradict you he says that simplicity can grace any station ignorant we call herhe says it shall be my privilege to teach you call her sly he protests but so is the hunted hare he says that the thought of a young girl struggling singlehanded with a world of satyrs from her sixteenth year freezes his blood you class her with them all satyrs together you say constantia i tell you that his folly is more noble than our wisdom i boast myself a christian but what am i in truth if not a very pharisee lord i thank thee that i am not as one of these is this christian it seems to me common gratitude said his wife pray did you tell him that the girl was compromised the rector frowned naturally i did not since i neither knew it nor believed it compromised constantia that is a dangerous word to use that involves a good name it does indeed james it involves ours i tell you that the girl is stale she might as well have shot himshe had never done herself more fatal mischief he seemed hardly able to look at her nor did she know him when he did do you dare speak so of any woman born to the brother of this girlsdo you dare you have shocked me beyond expression she was certainly frightenedbut she had her duty to do i am sorry to have displeased you i spoke advisedly i hope that i always do that his pride was stinging him he spoke now as if he were her enemycoldly as if he hardly knew the woman if as i am bound to believe you are speaking with knowledge which i do not possess i must ask you to let me share it this is a very serious matter both to john and to mary with whom do you say she is compromised two and two make four of coursebut two shadows and two cannot make four plump facts mrs james knew that she had gone too far she had little but suspicion behind her i think that tristram has made love to her she said and rehearsed the scene of the garden as she put it now the rector made a wry face this at its worst is discreditable to tristram i see your point now mary you suggest has had experiences all girls have them i suppose and certainly are not always the worse for them you must have something worse than this to excuse your strong words mrs james had she poured out all the garner of a years eyeharvest this young man and that young mana moonlight encountergod knows what not andmrs seacox told me she said that mary used to be a great deal in the company of young rudd she had seen them kissing a sudden flood of disgust engulfed the rector of misperton brand he turned shortly on his heel and paced the carpet midway back he stopped i cant tell you how i sicken at all this gossipthis traffic of nods and winks it amounts to little at its worst i will have no more of it it is my duty to believe the best of my neighbours i have not the eyes of mrs seacox nor i hope her understanding i believe mary to be a modest and virtuous young woman and you have told me nothing to vary that opinion such mattersmatters they are nothing but nasty surmisesare intensely distasteful to me i will hear no more he went into his study and shut the door all the germains were squeamish rather hard on mrs james and so was felt to be the result of her elaborate disclosure to the cantacutes this was that hertha de speyne went down in person and invited the girl to teaand that lady cantacute called her a nice little thing xiii what they said at home in obedience to one of those traditions before which the british parent lies prone the moment that mary middleham was asked for and granted the utmost care was taken that she should see as little as possible of the man with whom she was to spend her life spotless must she be brought out by the contractors spotless be transferred to the purchaser she was sent for from home and home she went after a month of clearing up there had been much to do goodbyes to say some to avoid saying if so it might be mr nunn making her a presentation and a speech before his assembled seedplots also made her cry but mrs james germain in the course of an icy teaparty whereat the girl was present unexplained unaccounted for and ignored until the late entry of the rector on the scene very nearly made her defiant she had a spirit of her ownand there are ways of showing persons their place which spirited persons may not endure at that teapartyunder mrs jamess politeness and the chill insolence of mrs duplessisthe prosperity of mr john germains love was like that of a bubble on a tobacco pipeits iris globe throbbed towards inward collapse his brother saved it to soar he was charmingeasy homely cool and obviously glad to have her there touched profoundly she became at once buoyantas all young people must be if they are to liveand meek when the company was gone he had her into his library and discussed her affair as a settled happily settled thingending rectorwise with a little homily in which he delicately but unmistakably showed her that she was going into a very new world and had better go in clean raiment let there be no drawbacks to your future happiness my dear of your own providing marriage is the happiest of all states so long as it is a clear bargain that is not always possible with two people of an age much may be taken for granted you are young and your husband is not he is wiser than you are and asks nothing better than to help you make him your friend before he makes you his wife you will never regret it and you may begin i believe by making a friend of his brother she replied brokenly lamely but she was deeply gratefuland he knew it atop of that came miss de speynethe honourable hertha de speynein a fast dogcart to her cottage door with an invitation to tea at the park she wentand had the sense to go in her simplest dress manner and looks appealedhere am i the girl as he found me as i pleased him make what you please of meif you please lady cantacute could make no mistake in a matter of the sorther manners were as fine as her instincts his lordship even more finely varied nothing from his habits and his daughter could not there was no company and all went well after tea better miss de speyne invited her to walk they sat in the rosegarden byandby came a question i think you know a friend of minemr senhouse this had to be explained mr senhouse it appeared was the gentlemantinker of mere common mary sparkled as she admitted her acquaintance and after that all was well indeed his acts and opinions were debated miss de speyne thought him cynical and hinted at some unhealed wound miss middleham could not admit that she believed him sound if not spearproof he spoke to me of my engagement but not as anybody else would have done did he like it mary blushed i could hardly say he spoke very highly of mr germain he had met him here he told me yes i wanted them to meet miss de speyne saidand mary wondered he told me in the course of conversation that he should never marryshe said presently but miss de speyne older than her new friend held her peace at parting the tall splendid young woman clasped hands with her warmly goodbye it was nice of you to come i wish i had known you beforebut were such fools in the country mary said i hope you wont forget me after im she felt delicate about this astounding marriage but miss hertha reassured her when youve settled down ask me and i shall come and see you of course youll be asked herebut you neednt come unless you like this was bracing she began to believe in herself to say that she had nothing to fear and to believe it but she found out her mistake within a little when in midaugust she left misperton brand crossed london and found her sister jinny awaiting her on the blackheath platform jinny the tall the pert the very fair strikingly attired despising all mankind and ignoring all womankind sailed to meet her intending to be patroness still it was soon to be seen that her claim was not disputed well molly so here you are hand out your traps and for heavens sake child put your hat straight do you want all the world to know that youre engaged mary laughed her hands to her hat its all right my dear she said ive come down alone if youd come down with your mr germain i should never have accused him of it i assure you miss jinny tossed her head too much the gentleman by half is that all you have the rest in the van i suppose well child you look well enough i must say so he agrees with you they kissed each other on both cheeks in the fly jinny enlarged upon the recent visit of mr germain my dear he fairly scared poor father it was yes sir no sir from him all the timeand any arrangements you wish sir i dont see that sort of talk myselfbut father was always a worm what he made of me i really cant sayyou know my way with gentlementake me or leave me alone is my rule well he left me alone and i managed to get over that as you see im still the same height in my stockings so you mean to be an old mans darling molly every one to her taste i suppose oh jinny hes not old he could be your father my deareasily hes not going to be i assure you well well see i should hope not of course one things as plain as my nose your people wont see much of you when youre boxed up with that old jinny please oh if you want me to tell falsehoods my dear ill do my best to oblige you ill call him young to myself until it comes easy practice makes perfect they say why here we are this horse must have the glanders or something perhaps he thought mr germain was after you theres a lot of sense in brute beasts all this which shows the rights of elder was meekly received homecoming was nevertheless a sort of triumph the younger girlsall tidied upallowed her to kiss them as if she had become an aunt father and mother made much of her she must see in their faces a sort of anxious wondercan this be our mary then can i have begotten this young lady can these breasts have nourished a mrs germain she was to have tea in her hat which jinny refused to do but elaborately removed it and administered the kettle the muffins the slices of bread the jampot blushing and successful as she showed mary would have put an end to this splendid isolation if she could it was not possible until tea was over but then when her father made her a kind of speechclearing his throat and frowning at one of the girls who was speaking the deaf and dumb language to another under the tablethen indeed mary upset all ceremonial by jumping up and knocking down her chair by throwing herself upon her mothers lap her arms around her mothers neck by hiding her face upon her mothers breast and anointing that dear cradle with tears mr middlehams little speech ended in a choking fit the girls looked all their misery and jinny sniffed and hardened her heart mary had unbent but she was made to see that all her people knew that it was a condescension the sisters slept together as of old and jinny must be wooed for natural reasons mary must have jinnys approbation must coax and kiss and strain for it jinny was not easily won but after a passionate while allowed the back of her mind to be seen she sat up in bed and asked a series of questions they were answered in low murmurs by a hiding molly molly how did you get off from misperton quite well hm glad to hear it no scenes mrs germain was rather awful she always hated me the rector was sweet to me and oh there was miss de speynei cant tell you how kind she was certainly we had a friend in common but thats not what i mean you can manage them i should hope i know that i could the rectory indeedand you to go out before her molly did you see him before you went who do

gentlemen do you mean to tell me that trthat he is not a gentleman that was quite different he meant nothing butit was all nonsense i advise you to find out whether mr germain thinks it nonsense of course i shall tell him everything i dont want ever to see mr duphim again that was all foolishness mary sat up in bed and clasped her knees her eyes staring at the bright light were stored with knowledgeas if the soul within were shining through them at last i have a frienda real wise friendwho has told me this muchthat there is a real thing i believe that i do indeed jinny stared then yawned im sleepy thats real enough for me just now what do you mean child i mean that one might give up everythingrisk everythingif one were sure quite sure but if one isntif one knows that one is a trifle a plaything to ato a person and that to another person one may be much morethenoh jinny jinny please marys arms were now about jinnys neck and jinny allowed herself to be pulled down mary snuggled and put up her lips after an instant she whispered darling old jinny will you do something for me what is it promise what is it if trif he comes herewill you see him for me oh please please why cant you no no i cant you know i cant why he looks at me as if i belonged to himas if he had a right and when he does that when he frowns and looks through you and waitsand says nothingi know what he means and if he said one word or moved towards me or beckonedshe shivered and hid her face i simply mustnti darent oh jinny darling please after a time jinny promisedbut marys peace was broken up a shadow haunted her outdoors and in mr germain drove down to blackheath to greet his bride her shy welcome with gladness behind to make it real charmed him altogether the family after a respectful interval left him the parlour for which he was grateful it would have no doubt to be explained that in marrying mary he had no intention of taking charge of her people admittedly they were impossible but it is very odd that he loved the girl of his selection the more for being simply and unaffectedly one of them he respected her for it but there was more than that at the bottom of his heart he knew that if she were to lose sight of her origin his love would suffer it was absolutely necessaryhe felt itthat she must masquerade for life be a sweet little bourgeoise playing county lady but playing it with sincerity and obediently doing her best because she was told the unvoiced conviction lay behind what he now had to say to her he told her for instance that he hoped she would see as much of her family as she pleased after she was married though of course she would have the duties of her new station to consider and to reconcile with others he did not suppose he told her that it would be reasonable or even true kindness to ask them often to southover i esteem your father highly my dearest he is in all respects what i should have expected your father to be your mother too is i am sure worthy of your love and gratitude your sisters seem to me happy and affectionate girls i doubt however if they would be comfortable among our friends at southover mary here said at once that she was sure they would not they are different from youquite different we are quite poor peopleyou would call us middleclass people wouldnt you i suppose that i should he admitted but would that hurt you my love no no not at all there is no harm in that and we cant help itbut he leaned put his arm round her waist and drew her to him well my darling well tell me of what you are thinking i was wonderingif you can see that they wouldnt do at southover what made you think that i should do there either he held her closer ill tell you my love it was because i knew what i should feel if you were ever to be there it was because my heart was full of you so that i could never look on any scene that i loved without seeing you in it and loving it the more for your presence there when i thought of southover i saw you its little sovereign lady and myself waiting upon you showing you all the things about it which have been so dear to me in spite ofmuch unhappiness and my heart beat high i said to myself you must be a miserable and lonely man my friend unless you can promise yourself this joy of service does my mary understand me he stooped his head to hers and asked her again did she understand yes yes she said but she sighed and turned her face away then he must needs kiss her then she did try to speak meaning if possible to lead herself up to a confession she told him that she feared to disappoint him that he rated her too highly i can tell you truthfully that your love has made me very proud and very happy i must assure you that i shall do everything in my power to prove to you how proud i am i will do my duty faithfullyyou must tell me of the least thing which is not just as you like i cant do more than that can i nobody in the world could do more than that he told her but theres something else mrs germain at misperton doesnt like me at all he nodded sadly i know my dear i know she is a foolish arrogant woman but there are excuses oh of course there are she sat upon his knee i expect that she is right and that you are wrongin a way then her eyes opened widely upon him the hour had come but she thinksshe says that i ambad he turned grey oh no my love you misjudge her good heavensbad she held her face back from him that she might look at him seriously she does you knowbut she makes no allowances i have always tried to be a good girli assure you please believe that he held her to his heart my dearest my dearest you distress me good who is good if you are not purest of the puremy mary but she shook herself free in a hurry no no indeed you mustnt say that thats absurd i am just an ordinary girl who likes to be happy and to be admired and to have fun when i can of course of course oh my beloved do not reproach yourself then she turned in his arms put her hands on his shoulders and looked gravely and imploringly into his face promise me one thing she said one thing only i will ask you nothing more than that she could not have been resisted by the assessing angel speak my adored one whatever you hear of meagainst meask me what i have to say before you condemn me promise me that my love and my life he said fervently and she pouted her lips for a kiss thus she justified herself in this regard and by a sophistry of her sex came in time to feel that she had made him a full confession she told jinny as much we were now in late august the wedding was to be quietly at blackheath at the end of september and the exciting business of the trousseau must be undertaken mrs james it seems had so far reconciled herself to the inevitable as to have consented to come to town and see to things which the child must have her own people being out of the question mary was to stay with her in hillstreet which was one day to be her own house and do her shopping a liberal sum was in mrs jamess hands for the purpose there was to be no white satin but jinny was to be allowed to walk as bridesmaid there was no way out of this her dress was to be chosen for her and then she must come to london to be fitted but she was not to be asked to hillstreet xiv the news reaches the pyrenees pau in august being what no man could be expected to stand duplessis and his friend lord bramleigh went into spain and lounged at san sebastian here on a blazing noon of midseptember as they were breakfasting at leisure a budget of letters was delivered lord

emptied his tumbler then he asked whats up no trouble i hope he had a gloomy stare for his first answer and for secondno i dont say that i dont know thats why i am offto see a mans pleasure is a matter of course to your bramleighs the moral and social order must accommodate itself to that thats all right said lord bramleigh therefore when do you go tomorrow i go this evening the effect of this was to raise lord bramleighs scalp a shade higher we swore wed go to madame sops tonight you know madame sop was a madame sopwith a lady of uncertain age and oriental appearance who gave cardparties duplessis said you must make my excusesif she wants em im going a woman of course said bramleigh tapping a cigarettebut had no answer duplessis caught the sun express and travelling straight through reached misperton brand in less than two days on the afternoon of the third day he was at the door of the little house heath view in blackheath the door was open and within the frame of it stood a tall young woman with hair elaborately puffed over the ears and a complexion heightened by excitement goodafternoon says duplessis miss middleham at home yes says jinny she is will you come in he followed her into the parlour and was offered a chair thanks very much he said but did not take it he stood by the window and jinny middleham stood by the door presently jinny said i am miss middleham you know or perhaps you didnt know it duplessis stared then recovered i beg your pardon no i didnt grasp that but youre not my miss middleham i didnt know that you had one said jinny its the first ive heard of it he laughed youll think me very rude in a minute but ill explain to you it was your sister i wanted to see she isa friend of mine my name is duplessis she may have told you jinny was as stiff as a poker i have heard my sister speak of you certainly i understood that you werean acquaintance duplessis nodded easily put it at that i suppose i may see her shes away said jinny shes staying in londonwith the honourable mrs germain he began to bite his cheek can you give me mrs germains address its not hillstreet i suppose jinny was very happy just now i suppose that a letter to mrs germain at misperton would find her you are related to her i believe my dear miss middleham said duplessis candidly lets keep to the point it seems to me that you dont want me to see your sister oh says jinny it dont matter at all to me he knit his brows then you mean i mean said jinny that my sister is going to be married to mr germain thats what it comes to duplessis bowed i see thank you very much than i think if youll allow me he bowed again and went towards the door the scene was to be over jinny put her hand upon the latch where are you going she said very short of breath there was a thrill yet to be got out of this what was sport to her mortified him to death really i dont know that i need trouble you any more he said you will give my kind regards to your sister i hope but jinny kept the doorhandle in possession mr duplessis she said i ought to tell you that my sister would rather be excused from seeing you at least she says so she said so to me you best know why that may be he ill concealed his mortification we wont talk of your sisters affairs i think i am happy to have made your acquaintance jinny tossed her head up my acquaintance as you call it is for them that want it my sisters is her own business i tell you fairly mr duplessis that she may be very unhappy he flashed her a savage look good heavens i believe that why the things monstrous you might as well marry her to a nunnery the fellows frozenstark cold jinny steadfastly regarded him you know very well that you never meant to marry her she said he grew cold instantly once for all i must tell you that i decline to discuss your sisters affairs with any one but herself and since you tell me that i am not to see her i will ask you to let me bid you goodafternoon i am very sorry to have given you so much trouble it was over there was but one treatment for such a cavalier in jinnys code of manners she opened the door wide goodafternoon she said he bowed and went out with no more ceremony he felt spotted and was furious that such a squalid drama should have engaged him a fluffed shopgirland tristram duplessis filthy filthy business but he went directly to hillstreetwhither a telegram had preceded him terse and significant according to jinnys sense of the theatre look out it said that sent the colour flying from marys lips and lighted panic in her eyes she crushed it into a ball and dropped it then she went directly to mrs james and asked leave to go home for a few days she shook as she spoke she said she was feeling very tired and unlike herself she wanted her mother she said simply and as her lip quivered at the pathetic sound of that her eyes also filled mrs james not an unkind woman by any means was really sympathetic my dear child i quite understand go home of course and get strong and well although you may hardly believe me i care very much for your happinessand john would wish it if he could have been here i know he would have taken you you shall have the carriage now when would you like to at once please mrs germainat once mrs germain rang the bell and ordered the carriage mary could hardly wait for it she spent the lagging moments pacing her room and before it was fairly at the door she was on the doorstep she took no luggage crouched in one corner of the hatefully dawdling thing she stared quivering out of the window at the corner of the square by lansdowne house she gasped and cowered a cab passed her in which sat scowling and great tristram duplessis his arms folded over the apron did he no no thank god he had not seen her she was safe in the ladies waitingroom but the traverse of the platform was full of peril not until the train moved did she feel herself safe she hungered for jinnys arms as never in her life before the brave the capable the dauntless jinnymercy of heaven to have given her such a sister in whom to confide but mrs jamesthe sweeping eye having lighted upon the ball of papermrs james wrote to her brotherinlaw that night my dear johnin case you may be hurrying back to town i think i should tell you that mary has gone to her people for a few days she will write me the day and hour of her return there is nothing serious but she complained of being overtirednot to be wondered at even young ladies may find the pleasures of shopping a tax it is possible i think that family matters of which i know nothingas i am not in her confidencemay have called her home she left this telegram here blackheath is on the stamp you will notice mary spoke of her mother to me when she said that she must go and seemed unhappy i put this down to her being overwroughtand no doubt you will hear from her by the post which brings you this most of my work is done here i am happy to say i hope you will be pleased with marys things i must say that she looks charming in her wedding gown but ninon may be trusted for style james is getting restive without me soames is no doubt at his tricks again i shall be glad to be at my post your affecte sister constantia germain pstristram is back from san sebastian i had a visit from him this afternoon some three minutes after mary left he asked after her you know that they were old acquaintances lord bramleigh remains in spain he seems in no hurry to greet his bride she is staying with the gospertons at brenchmore they expect him there from day to day next day mr germain presented himself in hillstreet nothing varied in his deliberate urbanity he had not heard from mary he said in reply to a question there had been no time for a letter to reach southover and the absence of a telegram was reassuring he intended to go to blackheath in the course of the afternoon no doubt she had overtired herself he applied himself to other topics and said nothing of duplessis nor of the blackheath message until luncheon was over then as mrs james went by him through the door which he held open for her he said i had forgotten you have tristram back if he should happen to call pray tell him that i should be glad to see him if he could spare me a moment mrs james stopped in her rustling career but i dont think it at all likely he will callagain she said no very well perhaps i shall encounter him somewhere or i could write quite so said mrs james it is easy to write then she shimmered away up the stairs he went into the library and after some pacing of the floor sat down at his desk wrote signed and sealed a paper he rang the bell i wish you and gutteridge to witness a paper for me jennings he said to the man fetch him in here please the two functionaries signed the sheet as he directed them sign there if you please jennings and gutteridge below your name that will do thank you he put the paper and a crumpled telegram together in a long envelope sealed it and wrote shortly on the outside he locked it in his desk then resumed his pacing of the room as he walked his lips moved to frame wordsimpossible puritys self her eyes ray innocence but he knew tristram and could not get his leisurely image away and tristram had been much at misperton and had a way ofhis lips moved againmy darling from the lions from the power of the dog he went back to his desk took out the envelope he had sealed and would have torn it acrossbut did not instead he put it in his breastpocket and left the house in the little parlour of heath view he stood presently awaiting her jinny had seemed relieved to see him when she opened the door mary had been lying down she said and would come when she was tidy he smiled and said he would wait he was noticeably white and lined in the face she came into the room presently flushed and very brighteyed he thought that she stood there like a mouse sensing the air for alarms prompt to dart at a pinfall his heart beat to see the youth and charm of her his pain was swallowed up in longing for his treasured bliss he almost sobbed as he held out his arms marymy childmy love and when she ran in and clung to him with all her force he clasped her in a frenzy whatever darksome fears his honest mind may have harboured whatever beasts he may have fought there were none after such a greeting as this he poured out his love like water upon her kissed her wet cheeks and shining eyes and with there my little lamb there my pretty one be at rest be at peace with me he soothed her and felt the panic of her heart to die down then sitting he drew her to his knees and let her lie awhile with her head on his shoulder she whispered in his ear oh it was sweet of you to come i wanted you dreadfullyyou dont know no my precious one i dont indeed but i am well content that you should have needed me i pray that you always will and that i may never fail you she lifted her head back to look at him she smiled like an april day you fail me oh no youll never do that and of her own accord she kissed him the good man simply adored her now will you tell me what upset you so much he asked her but she shook her head roguishly and said that she didnt know it was my stupidityi was frightenedsuddenly frightened of all the grandeurthe great rooms the butler and footmenthe people in carriages who called she stopped here her large eyes full upon his own she breathed very fast then she said thats partly the truthbut theres more he could not bear it he could not face what she had to say he knew that he was a coward but he could not despised himself but could not he clasped her close tell me nothing more darling child you will reproach yourself and i cannot bear it she struggled to be free oh listen listen to me please he kissed her with passion my life is yours would you rob me of it i cannot listen to you she gave over and lay with hidden face until she dared to look up again then when both were calmer she showed her serious face playing with his eyeglasses she did relieve her mind of one of her fears do you know she said unless you are with mealwaysi am sure that i shall do something mad or bad run away from it allhide myself she nodded her head sadly yes im quite sure he could afford to look at the future not the past why then my love i shall be with you alwaysnight and day do you hear me night and day how will you like that she hung her head peered up at him for a second and hung her head again he could do nothing but kiss her after that he stayed to tea which she prepared with her own quick hands she and jinny entertained him and he had never liked that pronounced young woman so well it was her birthday jinnys birthday he was told a few days only from mine he said with a fine smile to mary which made her understand him and blush twentynine today said jinny candidly cutting cake this is my cake mr germain i suppose youll give mary a better one i shall give her the best i can miss jinny you may be sure he said heartily and she nodded to him her confidence in his love he treated her with grave politeness which lost all its distance by the evident interest he took in her affairs she gave herself no airs or graces was neither pert nor sniffing for offence nor airy nor merely odious germains own manners were so fine so based upon candour and honesty that one could not fail to respond even jinny middleham forgot herself and as for mary she sat quietly on the watch really happy really at ease about the dread futureand whatever terrors she may have owed to tristram she had none now yet she was to have one more chance at parting she clung to him again and begged him not to leave her for long im safe with youi feel that oh how did you make me like you by liking you myself i expect little witch im not a witch im a dunce and you know that i am but listen i listen dearest i am going to be the best girl in the world im going to do everything that you tell mealways beloved i am sure wait you havent forgotten what you promised me what was that you have forgotten oh but you must never forget it it is importantto me tell me again it wasalways to ask me before you believe anything against me that was itand you promised he took her face between his hands and looked long into her eyes my dearest heart he said ill promise you better not only shall i never believe anything against youbut i shall never even ask you of the fact never never she searched his faceher eyes wandered over it doubting judging considering i had rather you asked me she told him but his answer was to kiss her lips she went with him to the garden gate seemed most unwilling that he should go farewells spoken her ringhand kissed she stood watching him down the terrace and then as he never looked back walked slowly into the house and shut the door had she stayed a moment longer she would have seen an encounter he had at the corner where you turn up for the station perhaps it was better as it was i dont know he had paused there to hail a fly with his umbrella and having faced round towards his way saw duplessis advancing towards him he felt himself turn cold and sick the fly drew up wait for me where you are he said and went to meet the young man duplessis saw him on a sudden his eyes blue by nature grew steely and intensely narrow goodevening tristram said germain constantia told me of your return duplessis dug the pavement with his stick did she well it is true you see i do see you are going to pay mary a visit i suppose shes not very well im sorry to saya little overtired otherwise i am sure she would have been delighted duplessis made no reply and the other continued i told constantia that i hoped to see youto tell you a small piece of news i am about to be married again mary has been so kind as to confide her future happiness into my hands perhaps you wont misunderstand me if i say that some little fraction of that happiness depends upon her not seeing you for the moment when she is rested we may hopethe wedding will naturally be a very quiet one her people wish it and my taste agrees with theirs otherwise we should have liked to have you among our guests we promise ourselves the pleasure of seeing you at southover in the near future i think the place will please you you must give an account of my pheasants in december thats very good of you germain said duplessis looking him full in the face mr germain turned to his waiting fly have you other engagements in blackheath none said duplessis no then perhaps i can offer you a seat in my carriage thanks said duplessis im walking nodded and went forward the way of the heath the station said mr germain he could thank god at least that she had not meant to deceive him he could thank god at least that she had done with the past but he had received a mortal wound and after his manner concealed it his lovely image was soiled the glass of his life to come dimmed already he saw nothing more of mary until the wedding day though he wrote to her in his usual fashion and on his usual days my dear child and yours with sincere affection she did not guess that anything was amiss could not know what they had cost him to write them twice a week his brother and sisterinlaw noticed his depression mrs james indeed was tempted to believe that at the eleventh hourbut the rector knew him better all his forces were now to put heart in the bridegroom he spoke much of mary xv a philosopher embales that young man with the look of a faun at once sleepy and arch the habit of a philosopher and the taste for gardening at large whom we have seen very much at his ease in society quite various was by name senhousepatronym senhouse in the faith john to the world of his familiars jack senhouse and to many mad jack but madness is a term of convenience to express relations and to him it may well be the world was mad he thought for instance that lord bramleigh was mad to whom we are now to hear him talking as much at his length and as much at his ease as of late we saw him in the company of miss mary middleham or of miss hertha de speyne of the cantacute stem perhaps he was more at his ease he lay at any rate before his tent full length upon his stomach his crookd elbows supported his face which was wrinkled between his hands his pipe grown cold by delay lay on the sward before him one leg from the knee made frequent excursions towards the sky and when it did discovered itself lean and sinewy bare of sock his sweater was now blue and his trousers were grey it was probably he had no more clothing upon him upon a campstool near by sat lord bramleigh of the round face corded and gaitered highcollared and astare to express bewilderment he whistled concerned he smiled well he said presently i think you might were short of a gunive told you so my dear man said the other i shoot no birds id as soon shoot my sister thats rot you know jack to me its plain sense

leopard stalking from a bough horses in a windy pasturewhatever you like of the sort has been done and well donebut a bird in flight never theres no greater sightand youll flare into it with your filthy explosives and shatter a miracle into blood and feathers beastly work my boy butchers work rot said bramleighbut of course youre mad why are my cartridges filthier than your pots of paint hey well i make something you seeor try to and you blow it to smithereenshowever we wont wrangle bramleigh youre a nice little man after all those ramondiasit was really decent of you much obliged said

sort of way i blieve companion or somethinghe played aboutand now shes been picked up by a swell connexion of hisold germain of southover be shot if hes not going to marry her the lengthy philosopher smiled to himself but gave no other sign of recognition until he said i know that lady browneyed sharpeyed quick sleek mouse of a girl dessay said lord bramleigh they know their way about the philosopher threw himself upon his back and gazed into the sky yes and what a way good lord idolhuntingpanting after idols maims herself and expects heaven as a reward i dont suppose that she has been herself since she left her mothers lap and now with an alternative of being sucked dry and pitched away she is to be slowly starved to death i only saw her onceno twice she had what struck me as unusual capacities for happinesszest curiosity healthbut no chances of it whatsoever ignorantoh lord they make me weep that sort so pretty and so foolish but there if i once began to cry i should dissolve in mist oh come said lord bramleigh i dont think shes doin badly for herself she was nobody you know and old germainwell hes a somebody hes a connexion of mine through his sisterinlawshe was constantia telferso i know hes all right ill do her the justice to say senhouse reflected aloud that she didnt sell herselfshes not a prostitute shes a babypure baby she was dazzled and misunderstood the sensation she thought she was touched shes positively grateful to the mandidnt see how she was to refuse shes a donkey no doubtbut she had pretty ways she could have been inordinately happybut shes not going to be shes in for troubles and im sorry i liked her shed better look out for tristram i can tell you said bramleigh hes an ugly customer if he dont have his rights not that there were any rights so far as i knowbut that makes no difference to tristram is she worth his while i doubt it she will be germains rich besides tristram sticks up for his rightstenacious beggar should have been kicked young quoth the philosopher and sped lord bramleigh on his way mary middleham o mary of the brown eyes and pretty mouth i should like to see you married he thought as he packed his tent theres a woman inside you my friend you werent given her form for nothing you are not going to be married yet awhile you know itll take more than a going to church to do that youve got to be a woman

green water theres a palette to have given old england mauve wet black and seagreen i have the very place for you out of reach of any save god and the seamews and me but even with them you wont have a

lord when the beast in a man gets informed by the mind of a godtheres no ecstasy beyond the sun to compare with it two things worth the world power and giving when a girl gives you her soul in her body and you pour it all back into her lap you are spending like a king why do women mourn christ on his cross where else would he choose to be a royal giver to have the thing to giveand to give it all he was to be envied not mourned old germainwhats he doing but playing the king on the cross he feels itwe all feel itbut has he got anything to give its an infernal shame hes bought the child

her after travail shell be born to school to duplessis is he to school her poor wretch what are his rights squatters rights you may suppose so shes to be a doll for germain to dandle or an orange for duplessis to suck and betwixt the feeding and the draining a womans to be born wife whos no wife mistress for an hourand a pretty flower with the fruit unformed if i bedeck the bosom of england and star it with flowers do i do better than germain with his money or duplessis with his rights and if i were to court her bosom oh my browneyed venturer in deep waters i could serve you well go to school go to school missyand when you are tired theres halfway house that evening under the hunters moon he struck his camp he had told young bramleigh that he was soon for the west where he preferred to winter i shall be in cornwall by november he had said and thats time enough and this being late september it is clear that he projected a leisurely progress from northamptonshire where he now was to the cornish sea he had indeed no reason for hurry but many for delay that fairest of all seasons to the poets mindthat close bosomfriend of the maturing sun was to him fostermother whether her drowsy splendours fed him or he felt the tonic of her chill afterbreath he worked out he said in winter what he had dreamed in the autumn and he could afford to lose no hours from her lap loafer deliberately incurably a tramp he was never idlewhether mending kettles or painting masterpieces for he had a knack of colour which now and then warranted that word his real interest was in watching life and in establishing a base broad enough or simple enough to uphold it all he was not too proud to learn from the beasts nor enough of a prig to ignore his twolegged neighbours but for the life of him he could not see wherein a lord bramleigh differed from a ploughboy or a mary middleham from a hen partridgeand it was a snare laid for him that he was constantly to be tempted to overlook the fact that they differed at least in this that they had the chance of differing considerably he would have been greatly shocked to be told that he was a cynic and yet intellectually he was nothing more he did himself the honour of believing most people to be donkeys if they were not why under the sun did they not do as he was doing the answer to that was that if they did he would immediately do something else and find plenty reasons to support him he had not worked that outbut its true it was also trueas he had told mary middlehamthat he lived from hand to mouth his father alderman senhouse jp of dingeley in the northern midlands was proprietor of the famous dingeley main colliery and extremely rich his mother had been a battersby well connected therefore he had been to rugby and to cambridge just as duplessis had been and at the same times like duplessis he idled but unlike him he cost no man anything for his needs which were very simple he could make enough by his watercolours a portrait here and there an essay a poem thenand that was true toohe had the art and mystery of tinkering at his disposition he had earned his place in the guild of tinkersa very real bodyby more than one battle he was accepted as an eccentric whose whim was to be taken seriouslyand as such he made his way he had never asked his father for a sixpence since he left cambridge and was on very friendly terms with him his brothers took the world more strenuously one was partner at the colliery another in parliament a thirdthe first bornwas recorder of towcester so much for his talentsnow for his accomplishments he was an expert woodman a friend to every furred and feathered thing could handle adders without fear and was said to know more about polecats where they could still be found and when than any man in england he had seen more badgers at ease than most people and was infallible at finding a fox all herbs he loved and knew their virtues a very good gardener in the west said that the gentlemantinker could make a plant grow theres no doubt he had a knack as the rockfaces between lands end and st ives could testifyand may yet he had a garden out there which he was now on the way to inspect but he had many gardensthat was his passion he was but newly come from one in cumberland he said of himself that he was a pagan suckled in a creed outworn and that he was safely weaned there was a touch of the faun about him he had no selfconsciousness and occasionally more frankness than was convenient the number of his acquaintance was extraordinary and in a sense so was that of his friendsfor he had none at all accessible as he was up to a point beyond that point i know nobody who could say he had ever explored senhouse that was where the secretiveness of the wild creature peeped out nobody had ever said of him that he had loved either because nobody knewor because nobody told yet his way with women was most effective it was to ignore their sex i liked her he would say meditatively of a womanand add she was a donkey of course you could make little of a phrase of the sortyet one would be glad to know the womans opinion we have seen that he could be a sympathetic listener we know that he could be more in moments of difficultyand there we stop lastly i am not aware that he had any shame he seems always to have done exactly as he pleaseduntil he was stopped by some guardian of custom or privilege this frequently happened but so far as i can learn the only effect upon senhouse was to set him sauntering elsewhereto do exactly as he pleased he never lost his temper was never out of spirits drank wine when he could get it but found water quite palatable he was perfectly sincere in his professions and owned nothing in the world but his horse and cart bingo the materials of his trade and some clothes which had not been renewed for five years we leave him at present pushing to the west xvi the wedding day saint saviours church was by many sizes too large for the partya modern edifice in the gothic taste carried out in pink brick with white facings it was large and smelt of damp the bridegroom wore his overcoat throughout the ceremony it was distinctly high and mrs jamess hands were many times up and her eyes all about for witness of the frippery they beheld stations of the cross were affixed to the pillars of the nave lamps twinkled in the sanctuary dimly in an aisle she made out the plaster effigy of a beardless young man in the capuchin habit pink cheeks and a fringe who carried lilies in a sheaf the hermaphrodite mrs james did not scruple to call him for his pains can we not have some of these things taken out she had asked her lord but the rector was precise that they must have a faculty and that they were ten minutes late as it was he was to officiate that was one comfort but it diminished the bridegrooms party by one that occupied barely the front pew on the right the brides company that of the left mrs james lady barbara rewish an old friend miss germain a pale sister mr gradeley qc who was best man and smiled at his own thoughts and the right hon constantine jess like a large comfortable cat who had been president of the board of trade and hoped to be again that was allbut it was too much for the middleham connexion which shrank into a row of ciphers as the rite proceeded jinny middleham whose shyness was taken for impudence would have made a very handsome appearance if she had not been so painfully aware of it the bride shorter by a head looked like a child she wore pale grey cloth and feathers and had a black hat all that art could do for her had been done her slight figure was enhanced her little feet seemed smaller her gloves were perfectand yet as mrs james recognized with lead in the heart if john had picked her up in her poppies and white muslin and married her then and there one could have understood it a man might love a milkmaidbut a little doll in a smart frock a suburban miss in masqueradeah the pity of it and yet the girls eyes were like stars and her face if it was pale was serious enough it wont doit will not do said mrs james to herselfi despair she despaired from the moment of the brides entry upon the arm of her little anxious whiskered fatherwhen she saw old lady barbara raise her lorgnette upon the group for one minuteand drop it again and snuggle into her lace theres nothing in itnot even romance that look told mrs james its ridiculousits rather lowbut here i am and germains an old friend lady barbara rewish alone among his equals sometimes called mr germain jack that anything possibly low could be set beside mr germain seemed incrediblebut if credible then tragic he wore race in every span of his tall thin figure in every line of his fastidious patient face his simplicity was manifest his courtesy never at fault the slight stoop towards her which he gave his bride as she drew level with himthe humble appeal the hope and the askingshould have struck the word from his old friends mind thus a man defers to a queen she might have saidand yet in that she did not she was wiser perhaps in her generation than the children of light germain was really now and throughout the ceremony revelling in the sthetic the position in its pathos and its triviality at once appealed to the sensual in him how lovely her humility how exquisite how pure his pride benevolence behold i stoop and pick for my breast this hedgerow thing see it for what it is in all this statesee it trembling here upon the edge of a new world is not this to be loved indeedwhere i only give and she must look to me alone to be sought as a mother by a frightened child to be source and fountain of all to givethis is to be happy and incapable of expressing it by a sign he was at this moment supremely happy and though he would have been aghast at the thought supremely luxurious he was in fact indulging appetite in the only way possible to him the rector of misperton safe behind his panoply of shrugging eyebrows hardened too by use and wont administered the rite with calm precision the words were saidi john take thee mary susan i mary susan take thee johnhow she murmured them and how he loved herthe book was signedbut mr gradeley qc had no pleasantries at his command and mr constantine jess had never had any old lady barbara kissed the cold bride and hoped she would be happy im sure hes in love with you she said and you must be good to him ive been in love with him myself any time these ten years but he wouldnt look at meand i dont wonder im such a wicked old woman she told the tale on the way to the wheatsheaf hotel where the bride was to be sped of how poor old lord morfiter had married his cookshe was a vienneseand of course they are wonderfulsuch tact or is it the stays theres a place in wigmorestreet at any rate it worked very well and really there was nothing else to be done no one understood him so well as she hadno one she always cooked for him when they were aloneor had one or two people dining perhaps itll be all right here mr jess bowed i sincerely hope so butforgive medo i understand was mrs germain lord bless us no cried lady barbara i dont suppose she ever saw a cutlet off a dish a bath bun and a cup of coffee is her standard you may be sure of course shell be different in a year you know shell drop her people and all that quite so quite so said mr jess and get what you call tact oh shes dressed herself beautifullyor ninons done it for her shell pay for dressing i call it a pretty figure charming and shes got fine eyes lady barbara replied thats what did it no doubt constantia tells me that tristram duplessis mr jess grew animated a clever young fellow duplessis i have had him under observation lately my secretary is leaving me and there has been talki hear by the way that the cabinet is hopelessly divided breaking upreally you know on the rocks so poor lord quantock was telling me last night with tears in his eyes then you come in it seems well well said mr jess soothingly we shall see what we shall see no doubt said lady barbara bored with mr jess the reception was rather ghastly lady barbara supposed we ought to mingle and gallantly tried it upon mrs middleham who had her daughter marys fine eyes crystallized as it were in her head stiffened into glass and intensely polished mr germain seconding his friends effort while rigidly ignoring that an effort was to be made performed the introductionahdo you know lady barbara rewish mrs middleham and departed not without hearing mrs middleham say that she did not know her ladyship such a pretty wedding said lady barbara she looked delicious mrs middleham who was not without character said that mary was a very good girl she had her back up as her daughter jinny said and neither gave nor took any odds lady barbara replied that we were all good at that ageand then found herself stranded to see jinny with mr gradeley qc had been a cure for the spleen she ignored him till he perspired in her service mary was cutting the cake while mr germain was engaged in the very unpleasant task of watching his sisterinlaw put things on a proper footing before mr middleham he could tell by the quivering eyelids of the poor man that things were being put there with vigour no madam no mr middleham was heard to say i dont know that we could fairly expect more than that nor do i said mrs james with the air of one who adds i should think not mr germain has been more than kind he ventured to proceed princely indeedand we should not presume of course not said mrs james and was echoed somewhat to her discomfiture by mrs middleham who had escaped from lady barbara by the simple means of walking away i think that mrs germain may take for granted that nobody from our house will intrude where he is not wanted said mrs middleham with dignity whenever mary comes to see us she will be welcome that she knows we shall go where we are welcomeand nowhere else then we quite understand each other i see said mrs james i hope we do said the other it shant be my fault if we do not mr germain was very uncomfortable but there was now none too much time for the train according to his calculations while mary was changing her hatas it was putthe wedding party rigidly segregated stood astare each at its window upon the gusty vagaries of a late autumn day mary was at the glass flushed and on the edge of tears her hands were at her hat while her eyes searched jinnys stony pair for a sign of melting but jinny was immovable in vain did the pretty bride turn this way and that invite criticism invoke it jinnys disapproval persisted this was not to be bornewith a little whimper the victim turned clasped medusa round the waist with one hand to her chin she coaxed for kindness she stroked jinnys cheek tiptoed for a kiss presently she fairly sobbed on jinnys bosom oh you are unkind to meyou hurt me dreadfully what have i done that you wont love me done cried jinny hear her then with blazing wrath she scorned her sister ill tell you what youve done my dear youve married a gravestone sacred to the memory of john germain esquirethats what youve sold yourself totake your joy of that the price of a kissed hand youll find out before morning my beauty if i marry a crossingsweeper he shall be a man you liked him you know you liked him yes for a grandfather my dear but for a husband if you please ill have a man and so might youover and over youve been as good as promised halfadozen times jinny you know thats not true she was ruthlessly put away to arms length but it is true there was ruddwhat do you say of him rudd must be owned to so far off he showed so dim a speck in the distance there seemed nothing in it young staineryou forget him too i suppose stainer said poor mary he was a boy jinny he had a pair of arms i believe and i should like to hear your opinion of fred wimple you were never at folkestone in your life i suppose you never talked to sandgate by moonlight never met any one in your life by moonlight the remembrance of a meeting by moonlight more recent than any at folkestone enabled mary to consider mr wimples case i dont think you need drag up flirtations against me youre not very generous jinny of course i flirted did you flirt with mr ambrose perivale was that what made him follow you home across england did you flirt with mr dup but now mary clung to her stop jinny oh stop if ive been wicked i must pay for itits always the girl that pays but i have never been wickedyou know it oh you must know it of your sister ive told him everything jinnyall that he would hear but hes too good to believe anything against me hell protect me hell never let me come to any harm oh jinny jinny dont be cruel to me any more if ever a girl meant to do her duty in life i mean it now dearest you must help meim afraid of him you know jinny folded her arms tightly over her chest yes i can believe itand you may be afraid of your husband before longfor the same reason you go out of your own walkand you get lost your tristram duplessis who looks at a girl as if he wanted to eat her you cant be expected to understand such ways and its my belief that your john germain esquire is no betterexcept for one thing that he hasnt any teeth if you ask me i would rather be eaten any day by mr duplessis hed make a cleaner job of it mary was not crying on the contrary her eyes were hard she was pale and serious i know that ive done a thing which you dont approve you think that im going to leave you all for good i hope that i shall show you soon that you are wrong do me justice jinny you have never seen me try to get out of my station i shall do whatever mr my husband wishes of coursebut i will never turn my back on my people nor would he ask it of mebe sure of that i cant say any moreexcept that you have hurt me by what you have saidand that five minutes after ive gone away youll be sorry then she choked down something and jinny was sorry molly ive been a brute no no but i have im proud of you reallyyou looked quite a beauty in your french clothes jinny beside you im a little brown mouse youre not my dear youre as sharp as any needle youll be one of them in a month and theyll be the first to own it i could see that old lady rewish look you overand nod her wicked old head she knows bless you little moll forgive your tiresome sisterkiss me now darling jinny darling jinny they clung wept and kissed and presently a radiant bride went down to meet her lord goodbyes were said in haste jinny promised there should be no rice a momentary flush of cordiality warmed the unhappy guests lady barbara kissed the bride on both cheeks jinny hovered about her eager now to show her contrition wonder of all mr germain saluted her fair cheek jinny was seen to blush riceless slipperless they went their wayand the party dissolved like smoke it was afterwards agreed at blackheath that mr germain and the rector were gentlemen xvii the wedding night torquay was the place for the honeymoon but exeter was to be the end of that days stage mr germains valet put them into the train handed his master the tickets mary her jewelcase took off his hat and retired to an adjoining compartment everything was very easy done with an absence of enthusiasm which might have chilled a more resolute heart than this brides it was done she reflected as if a wedding was a matter of every day why a budget of evening papers punch truth and other things had been laid in order upon the opposite seat was he going to read all these it was almost incrediblebut after the events of the afternoon she could have believed anything she felt her ring to make sure and then her eye caught sight of the paper on the windowreserved to exeterj germain esquire perhaps great people always reserved carriages when they travelledperhaps a carriage would always be reserved for her when she went about alone there would have been a maid if she had chosen it had been proposed to her she had laughed and said of course not but he had taken his manservantand how could he on his wedding journey had he taken him before this was his second wedding she remembered anxiety as to whether the train could be caught might account for the bridegrooms silence during the carriage journey his watch was open in his hand for some time too after the train moved he kept silence she found herself looking soberly at the little pointed toe of her shoe when her thoughts were broken in upon by the capture of her hand the sudden attack made her heart beat she blushed hotly lost her command of experience as if it had been the first advance he had ever made she dared not raise her eyes she must be wooed from the beginning if she was to be won this was the way to charm him he was charmed he called her his mary and asked of what she was thinking she didnt know couldnt say was she thinking of their coming life together no not then i think constantly of that he told her and put his arm about her she let him draw her closer as he developed his plans for their joint happiness calm spaces for work together my lovethere is so much in which your help will be a pride to meand something i do believe in which i can be useful to you we must keep up our languagesfrench italian even spanish quite worth your while for cervantes sake i do think i can help you there then your musici could not bear you to abandon that i have a little surprise for you when i bring you to southoveryou shall see then riding i think you dont ride you shall be under musterss care musters is an admirable fellowyou will like him we ride together daily i hope will you like that yes yes i shall like everything it will all be very wonderful to meall quite new he smiled as if tolerant of a simplicity which could find daily horseexercise wonderfuland she felt it in her present state of acute sensibility she needed anything but this treatment he should have taken her as an adorable dunce and laughed at her outright between his kisses or he should have whirled her off her balance in the torrent of his ecstasy but mr germain never laughedit was not a germains habitand ecstasy at four in the afternoon was not possible to him he liked his cup of tea at a quarter past and when that hour came proposed to mary that she should give it him from her tea basketlady barbaras present she was thankful for the relief and almost herself again in the bustle of preparation she forgot her dumps and when he burnt his fingers and said tuttut she fairly laughed at him and took and even returned his kisses things were better but he very nearly imperilled the position thus hardly won by wiping his mouth with a silk pocket handkerchief true she had been eating bread and butterbut was this a time they chatted after teafirst of berkshire where her home was to be he spoke of his riverine property she could almost see the edge of his estate as they slipped away from the ragged fringe of reading then by natural stages he was led to reflect upon the society she would meet about southover the chaveneyshe thought she would like the chaveneys they were her nearest neighbours five miles off sir george was asthmatica sufferer but lady chaveney was a charming woman a woman of the world she had been a scrope of harfleet the girls were quite pleasant young women and there was a sonrather wildan anxiety occasionally then there werebut her eyes were wide five miles off were those the nearest people she had thought there was a townwas not farlingbridge the post town he considered farlingbridge yes farlingbridge was a mile and a half from the park gatesa market town of souls there was a vicar a worthy man of the name of burgess he met burgess of courseon the board of guardians for instance there was a colonel dermott too yes he had forgotten dermott nobody else her oh i see was his reproof he was ashamed of himself two thousand other people of course everybody will be delighted to see you my dearest dont misunderstand me they wont call probablyfoolish old customs die hard with us but there wont be a door in farlingbridge which wont be open to you i shall go with you if you will allow me i have long wished to know more of my neighboursbut you know how sadly i have lived he drew her closely to himhow i have lived so long without my mary passes my comprehension do you remember that last july was not the first time i saw you she was pleased and showed that she was she questioned him shyly had he seen her before this year what had he thought what made him notice her this time his answers were in the right vein he was allowed to be the loverand so the moments passed and swindon with them the train swung slowly by a crowded platform he released her silence succeeding she relapsed at once into her desponding mood she was embarked indeedbut on what a cruise the chaveneysfive miles awaysir george and lady chaveneyshe knew what that meant how the county reckoned from one great house to another why if a colonel dermott a reverend burgess were as nothingfrom what a depth of blackness had she been dragged up a toy an old mans plaything jinny had called her picked out of a village and put in a great house five miles from anybody during this time of long silence of reverie in the which though his arm embraced her and his hand was against her side his eyes were placidly shut while hers gazed out of window fixed and sombre at the flying country she suddenly started and became alert misgivings faded a wash of warm colouras of setting sunsstole comfortably about her for a moment it may be she was conscious again of wide horizons the train was rolling smoothlyso smoothly that its swiftness had to be felt forover an open common backed by a green down furzebushes dotted it clumps of bramble there was a pond a dusty road geese on the pond a cottage by the road with a woman taking linen from the hedge along the road pushing to the west went a cart drawn by a white horse the driver sat on the tilt smoking his elbows on his knees a grey dog ran diligently beside could this be could it be other oh the great free life oh the beating heart oh the long long look mary strained against the arm of her husband his hand felt her heart beat he opened his eyes looked at her and smiled to see her eager gazing but what mystery of change in women the next moment she had turned to him her eyes filled with wet she turned she looked wistfully upon him her lip quivered my darlingand then she flung herself upon his breast oh take me take me keep me safe she cried i will be good to you i will i will but you must love me always my sweet wife can you doubt it what has frightened my pet she hid her face on his shoulder nothingnothingonly thoughts im not good you know i told you sooften he pressed her closely to him who is good who dares to ask for love we ask for mercynot love but we can always give it it is our blessed privilege you have the whole of mine he kissed her hairall that he could reach of her and she lay with hidden face for a long time the unknown resumed its chilly gripthe horizon narrowed again the fog hung about the hedgerows which hemmed it in but the outlook was not quite the sameor the outlooker was changed the tiltcart was journeying to the west and so was the train but mr germain exulted in every mile which he could watch out with that dear head upon his shoulder the tired child slept exeter my love he awoke her with a kiss she blushed looked dazed and snuggled to him in an adorable way but for that unlucky servant of his it is possible that the day might have been saved yet but inexorable order resumed its hold and she chilled fatally between station and hotel a carriage and pair was waiting for them a cockaded coachman touched his hat the porters touched theirs the luggage followed with villiers up the stairs of the hotel there was quite a stately procession they were shown their rooms sittingroom diningroom two bedrooms all en suite mr germain disappeared with anxious villiers a gigantic chambermaid old stately with a bosom fit for triplets superintended the unpacking of madams trunk which was plundered by two smart underlings with velvet bows very far back upon their sleek heads would madam require a dresser madam said oh no thank youand then had to ring in confusion for somebody to fasten her bodice madam looked charming when all was done in a gown of dangerous simplicity and madam knew itbut there beat a wild little heart under the tulle and a cry had to be stifled a cry to a friend on the open roadfor good fellowship sage counsel and trust to float between eyes and eyes her treadings had wellnigh slipped she felt herself to be drowningas it were in three feet of water she sat at his table and ravished his delicate fancies with her pretty embarrassments her assumed dignity her guarded eyes and lips king cophetua lived again in this honest man who had no need to protest to heaven that he would cherish his elected bride he was now perfectly happy wallowing in sentiment bathing every sense the exquisite antithesis he had made from nothing she was become this sweet before and now all dainty sweet rare unknown now known to be the rarest her white neck with a jewel upon it her scented hair with a star rings glittering on her fingers her gown as dainty as her untried souland through the clouded windows of her eyes that shrinking soul looking outwistful appealing crying for help ah what loyal help should be hers complacent benevolent gentleman she sipped his champagne she watched everything missed nothing gave no chances knew herself on her trial she was strung up to the last pitch and staked all her future upon the hazard of this night if she was cold in her responses slow to take up quick to abandon positions in the talk she may be excused she could be bright enough when she was at easebut who is at ease with his honour at proof great honour had been done her she knew and it required all her honour in return that prompted her to a curious requital she burned to cry out to this courteous gentleman in black and fair white and to these noiseless prompt attendantslook at me welli am nothing a shred from the wilderness he has chosen me for his breast decked me outi am a slavegirlmy ignorance is hired how dare you wait upon me you who would pass me in the street and nudge and tell each other with a wink what i was and how you found my looks was i so low that i must be thus lower can you not spare me this she burned with shame was dangerously near to panic more than once she must bite her lip to hold back these wordsand as she bit he looked at her and adored her splendid colour and lovely frugality of glance and speech she left him to his port and sat alone in the drawingroom a prey to all the misgivings when he took her in his arms and struggled with himself to tell her all he had found in her of excellence and beauty she could only hide her face but she clung to him at last sobbing out her protest that she would serve him utterly oh you are good to me you are good oh help me to be what you wish i am so ignoranti cannot tell you she broke off here and holding herself stiffly in his arms looked strangely in his face do you knowhave you thoughtthatthati cannot be what you think me she said and when she saw that he was taken aback listen she said let me sit by you he took her on his knee and held her swinging hand her eyes were veiled as she tried to speak to him i have beeni began to work you know when i was sixteen i went away from home she caught him unawares or she hit by some fatal telepathy the centre of his thought he flinched at the blow but she could not know that being too full of her own affair she must discharge her heart at all costsand at this eleventh hour if so must be now let him be generous if he is to be accounted wise once too often he was tried this time at the crisis he did not respond generosity which is loves flag of victory was not at command the hand that shaded his eyes made a deeper shadow his voice was small and still yes my dear yes she lifted her head and looked up not at him but over the room she went on as if she was reading her story off the wall but she was reading it from jinnys eyes of scorn you must know me as i really am before youbefore tomorrow i was engagedoncebefore i knew you he was a farmers sonmr rudd he thoughti thoughthe gave me a ring that was soon after i had gone to misperton i was twentytwo he sat very still hiding his face it looked as if he were crouching from a storm yes yes my child why not she was pitiless oh but i have more to tell you he seemed to shrivel you wish to speak of these things you were very young and yet his voice said tell me allall at sixteen yes of course i was very foolish there had beenbefore you went to mr nunnsbefore you went to misperton she left his knee and sat opposite to him upon a straight chair she folded her hands in her lap and began her tale as if she had been in the dock she rehearsed her poor tale he neither stirred nor spoke she made no excuses did not justify herself nor accuse herself she did not sayit never entered her head to sayyou too have made mistakes there was a lady diana for your bitterness but she knew what she was doing only too well and a force within her said go onspare nothinggo on whatever it cost you be done with it no peace for you else i must tell you that there was a gentlemanyou will not ask me his name i think that you know it he gave me a bookandother things i have not seen him sincesince you spoke to me at the schoolfeast he stirred but did not look up i will ask you not to see him i will never see him i have refused he has tried to see you i took care that he should not i dont wish to seem unreasonable he said slowly i cannot bear to seem so to you butit would be for our happiness i assure you that i have no intention i hope you will believe me his lips moved but he did not look up she rose i am very tired she said i think i will go now he got up immediately the fog seemed in the room she came and stood before him be patient with me she said be kind to me i shall try to do everything you wish he made as if he would take her but she drew back quickly i should have told you all this before if i could have thought you would carewould allow it indeed i have tried more than once but younow i am glad that you know mebut i am very tired mary he said and held out his hands to her she looked into his face then shut her eyes i am very tired please let me go goodnight he held open the door for her book ii i in which we pay a first visit to southover the housesouthover house farlingbridge berksstands terraced above formal gardens in the italian taste ribbony borders edged with white stone form a maze of pattern urns on pedestals statues of nymphs and fauns stone seats stone cisterns gleam among the carpeted flowers beyond these is the great park with a wall they tell me six miles round the herd of fallow deer is praised by cotton in his famous book mr germain used to show you the passage the mansion built by wyatt is classical an exact rectangle of pink brick faced with bath stone it has a pediment and a balustrade with white statues at intervals along the garden front within it is extremely proper having narthex and atrium or if you please vestibule and hall the reception rooms open out of this last and above it a gallery gives on to the chambers about whose doors the valets are to be seen collected at seventhirty or so of an evening they wait for their masters while they observe and comment in monosyllabic undertones upon the doings of their betters below surprising how much a manservant can get into how little from april to june from september to november the hall is used for tea and afterdinner lounging it is the core and heart of the house during the summer months tea should be on the terrace unless nature is willing to see mr germain vexed in wintertime it is always in the little library where the murillo hangs i choose the time of tulips for our visit when southover has had a new mistress for two years come the fall of the leaf the family as they say down here has been abroad this year has not long returned it went to the riviera directly after christmas to mentone was in rome in february and studying churches in the rhone valley in march it eastered in seville going thither by barcelona and granada and came home by madrid and paris now it is midmay and the italian gardens glitter with tulips tea is served according to custom in the hall at a quarter before five the footman on dutyhis service passed by the butlerhas retired but the statelier functionary stands at his post tapping his teeth with a corkscrew the hour is now fivegone five silver chimes have proclaimed it to an empty hall there he stands a solemn florid personage full of cares regarding in an abstracted manner the glittering array of covered dishes cups and covered jugs now and again he adjusts a teaspoon now and again humours a spiritflame at a quarter past five mr germain enters the hall from the library his secretary young mr wilbraham at his heels the butler with a careful hand placed a rack containing three triangles of toast upon a little table he poured a cup of chocolate from a porcelain jug and added that to the feast the afternoons post upon a salver was held for mr wilbraham these things done he waited until mr germain was in his deepseated chair the ladies are not returned sir he said and went his noiseless way mr germain who looked white and had faded eyes munched his toast in silence young mr wilbraham quick gentlemanly pleasantly alert demolished envelopes and their contents while he ate muffin three or four letters he handed to his patron those look to me personal he said mr germain having adjusted his pincenez inspected the envelopes and put them unopened into his pocket toastmunching was resumed and silence once or twice mr germain looked at his watch once compared it with the hallclock but made no other sign wilbraham poured more tea spread himself honeycomb on bread and butter and went on with his letters he broke the silence the association has written again to know whether you have decided they hope you will come forward sir gregory has gone to madeira they say hes quite made up his mind mr germain blinked solemnly at space without reply and ive a note here from mr jessrather from his secretary there was a meeting at the reform on monday your name was mentioned mr jess hopes that he hasnt been indiscreet he referred to the possibility mr germain without turning his head or ceasing to munch asked here who was mr jesss private secretary duplessis said brisk mr wilbraham adding as if to himself clever beggar after a pause mr germain got up i shall rest for a little wilbraham we will consider these things before dinner meantime i will ask you to remember that they are between you and me strictly so oh of course quite understood the friendly young man nodded the master of the house had his hand on the library door when a step on the flags of the vestibule caused him to look quickly round there was a moment during which he could have been observed to hold his breath in suspense a tall and sumptuously fair lady freemoving deepbosomed robed in whiteall her dresses robed hercame into the hall she wore a broadbrimmed tuscan hat which set about her like a halo and carried flowers this was the honourable hertha de speyne the last of the cantacutes mr germain turned away from his refuge and stood attentive wilbraham jumped to the upright shall i have in some more tea he asked at large this has been here since five not for me said miss de speyne i hate it but the others are coming i saw them in the bottom theyve been on the lake i think and you this was from mr germain with a courtly inclination oh ive been painting of course happily i hope miserably deplorably ive scraped out everything and come away at least with a clean canvas few painters can say as much of a days work few would confess it ah ive been taught the blessing of an uncharged heart mr senhouse taught me that last year what i was trying to do was perfectly impossible one knows too much one has botany flowershows catalogues behind one fields of asphodel but suppose you had been shown how asphodel grows have i fields of asphodel here mr germain looked his polite misgivings you have a glade of poets narcissuslike a swiss valley mr senhouse could have done itan impressionist its not for me i see them stiff in vases i know that they have stalks so surely does mr senhouse indeed he does he knows that they have souls but hes ruthless with his brushes he forgets their souls and his own science and you im so proud of mine that i could never forget it she looked out into the vestibule to the sunlight beyond here comes mary do get some tea for them she urged wilbrahamwho flew to the bell mr germain remained where he waslong enough to see his wifes eyes dilate at the sight of him there long enough to hear the laugh falter upon her lips and then he turned and slowly gained the library he shut the door behind him mrs germain with a high colour and gleam of light in her fine eyes came quickly to the teatable she was followed by two young men in flannelsselfpossessed assured curtspoken young men with very smooth heads oh were dreadfully late she cried hertha have you been in long have you had everything in a much lower key she asked haswashe here when you miss de speyne looked kindly at her friend he was just going when i came in but he stayed and entertained me it was awfully kind of him i know hes very tired mary stood by the teatable fidgeting a cup by the handle she looked uncomfortable im frightfully sorry hertha i meant to be in by a quarter to five its all right you know said one of the young menthe youngest of themlengthily at ease in a chair youre only an hour slow i call that good she made no answer but went on fidgeting the teacup the entry of butler and footman with supplies did not move her young lord gunner stood to his muffin and confidently explained its my fault you must know i was diving after halfcrownsand getting em too he was though said mr chaveney from his chair i ought to know they were my halfcrowns well then of course i had to change im not a mermaid as it happens not yet my boy said the loser of halfcrowns so i sent a chap up for my chap with some things and changed in the chlet thats why were late if you must know miss de speyne was pouring out tea i see and the others reckoned up their losses words to that effect said mr chaveney lord gunner put down his cup dont know what they did but ive brought them safe to port wilbraham ill play you squash rackets before dinner itll do you good youre overdoing it you know and youre not used to it youll get a hemorrhage or a nervous breakdown and we shall have to give you a restcure chaveney shall score cant said mr chaveney ordered my trap my people are going to take me out to dinner they wont be denied england hath need of him said wilbraham come along gunner my things are in the court im due at the desk at seven mr chaveneyvery young very fair and very flushed with long and light eyelasheswas now at the piano he swayed as he played do you like that he said looking at mrs germain who was still pensive its carmen beg pardon said lord gunner it sounded like chaveney the youth ran up a scale go and play rackets gunner and leave me to my art im going hell stay to dineyou see if he dont was lord gunners passing shot he was answered by a crashing chord miss de speyne regarding the pianists back said in a gentle voice hes in the library youd better go to him for a minute mrs germain had the knack of making her eyes wide and round so that you got the fullorbed splendour of their brown light i expect hes asleep ill see him before dinner her friend shook her head hes walking up and down hell rest after you have been do you think soreally im sure you had better go mrs germain stayed no longer but went quickly holding her head stiff she stood in the doorway of the library inside the closed door a charming figure for all her anxious eyes she was in blue linen with a wide straw hat was sunburnt and fresh looked ridiculously young mr germain paused in his pacing of the long carpet and waited for her to speakwhich presently she did rather breathlessly oh she said i was afraid you might be resting or i should have come he shut his eyes for a moment no it is not possible just nownor desirable i have much to think of she went quickly to him and held out her hand a little way arent you well may i stay with you i meant to have been in early but but it was not convenient you would say no not that i couldnt get them to leave the water they were absurdlike children one was throwing money in for the other to dive after i did trybut they went on just the same did you expectdid you want me i promise you that i tried to come i tried hard something of the sort had been what his selfesteem exacted of her something of the sort must have been tendered him or he had been really ill he was now softened he smiled took up her offered hand my little love he said drew her near and kissed her forehead for a moment she urged towards him but then having glanced timidly up and seen his averted eyes she sighed and looked to the floor her hand still held he led her to his escritoire put a chair for her beside it and sat in his own constantia writes to me mary that she and james would like us to pay them a visitin july as usual what do you say she considered this for some moments her head was bent towards her hands in her lap she looked at her weaving fingersa habit of hers that would be to the rectory i suppose obviously said mr germain you will remember that it was a yearly custom of mine she had every reason to remember it but he must hear her say so you will not have forgotten that mary no oh no of course i havent she looked at him for a momenttrouble in her eyes and flame in her cheeks last year he resumed i had southover to show youand there were reasons why i should not take you back so soon this year there could be no such reason i think that you might be pleased to see misperton again more particularly since you and hertha de speyne have struck up such a happy friendship she is a noble young creature in every way nothing could have pleased me more constantia will of course write to you but being my sisterinlaw and happening to have other matters of which to speak she mentioned it to me in the first event i can assure you that there has been no want of respect she flashed him another reproachful lookreproachful not that he should think her offended but that he should pretend to think her so oh of course not how could you imagine such a thing it is absurdreally absurd he made no reply was evidently waiting for her decision she gave it reluctantly we will go if you wish it she said he was immediately piqued that is hardly cordial is it i am not sure that i should or could wish it on those terms she had reasons of her own for disliking it extremely but she kept her counsels in these days i will tell you exactly how i feel if you will be patient with me she said i am sure that the rector would be glad to have me there with you and of course hertha would like it if there was nobody else i should love to go i shall remember misperton as long as i live wonderful things happened to me there dont think that i can forget them for an hour but mrs jamesconstantia i meandoesnt like me at all why should we disguise it she disapproves of me doesnt trust me thinks me a nobodywhich i am of course i beg your pardon my love he would have stopped her but she saw what in particular had offended him and ran on i am your wife i know but i am a person too and i own that i would rather be with people whowho respect me for what i am in myself as well as for what you have made me forgive me for saying so it is rather natural i think and it happens that i should like to see my parents again and my sisters it is six months since i was at blackheath so that would be an opportunity and a reasonwhile you were at the rectory you wish me to go there alone she could guess at the scalding spot beneath his armourplate i should love to go with you she said ifif it could be managed i may mention to you he said coldly that you will not find an old acquaintance there since his mothers death my young relative tristram duplessis has bestirred himself he has sold the cottage she had not been prepared for an attack in flank and blenched before it then she told her fib my reason against going with you had nothing to do with mr duplessis she said and watching her he did not believe her he turned to his papers it shall be as you wish my love he said i will write to constantia it may well be that i shall not care to resume a broken habit are you going up to dress if so and if you should happen to see wilbraham would you tell him that i am ready she hovered about his studious back as if on the brink of speech but thought better of it and went slowly out of the room intensely conscious of her going he cowered at his desk looking sidewaysuntil he heard the door close then he began to read with lips pressed close together in the hall mrs germain almost ran into the arms of wilbraham who scarlet in the face and wet as with rain was racing to his room by jove i beg your pardon mrs germain you only made me jump she laughed have you been playing all this time i know i know it was gunners fault upon my honour it always is lord gunners fault mr germain asked me to tell you that he was ready good lord cried the unhappy youth and im swas hot as anything go and change she said kindly ill go back to him he was fervent you are an angel but ive told you that before their eyes met they laughed together he pelted upstairs mr wilbraham will be with you in a second she said entering the library again had she seen him spring round as she came in no doubt of it i left my book down by the lakeand i know you dont like that do you no dearest no i confess the foible his eyes invited her nearer she advanced to his table and stood by him her hand touched his shoulder he was inordinately happy though he made no immediate sign but presently his arm went about her waist and then she bent down and leaned her cheek for his kiss they remained together saying nothing until she heard wilbraham coming down three stairs at a time then she slipped away and just caught him outside the door i had to tell a fib she told him i said that i had left my book by the lake well he looked at her ill bet thats not a fib no she laughed but it was meant to be now im going to get it myself you are an angel he said dont ill go presently i should love to no i shall go myself i deserve it you deserve he stopped himself look here he said send gunner no hes changing send young chaveney she opened her eyesfatal use is mr chaveney here i thought he said wilbraham chuckled did you suppose hed go when it came to the point not he why before wed played half a set he came to borrow some clothes off me he glided smoothly into the library mrs germain fetched her book ii reflections on honeymoons and suchlike the years fly we know and come not again and theres balm in that for the wounds they leave for we forget a good deal and hope is a faithful lover and never quits us for long together and then theres honest useandwont surely our friend because you were a fool yesterday youre wise today and if youre a fool tomorrowwhy the alternation is established theres a progression it is like the rotation of crops theres a mort of healing in a brace of longish years the county which had found little mrs germain stiff when she came home from her honeymoon now looked to her for stiffness when it felt relaxed her idiosyncrasy was accepted you see once admitted to be a person she became a personage and discovered by the county she discovered herself she found out that she had a character she had never known that before nor had any others who had had to do with her mrs james to wit miss de speyne her husband the process of these discoveries ought to entertain us for a chapter and its resolution shall be attempted but the county learned it first when it came to rely upon her stiffness the chaveneys the gerald swetebredes the trevorwaynes the perceforest people before the two years were over forgot that they had ever eyed each other with brows inquiring colonial or spelling hopeless my dear such looks had passed but now on the contrary they leanedsome heavily lady chaveney was one she is charming with guy she said more than once quite charming an influencein the nicest way she added once as if the news was sacred i believe hes told her everything guy was the chaveney heir the florid assured youth whom we met just now on our visit he had been pronounced wild by mr germain and he had told her everything she took herself quite seriously with guy in the eldersister fashion mr germain at first approving as at first he had approved every sign of her making way he came before the end of two years to feel differently lost touch with the sense of his benevolence felt to be losing grip of many things but in the early days he had approved theres no doubtin those days of stress and taut nerves when returning from a honeymoon by much too long she had found mrs james pervading the great orderly house and had without knowing it braced herself for a tussle and unawares found herself in it and amazingly the winner her husband had backed her up there in his quiet way short quick breathless work it had beena fight in spasms she had been crossing the hall when the great lady came out of the little library ah marya mrs burgess has called i seewife of some one in farlingbridge she called while you were out a politeness very natural under the circumstancesbut not the custom here i think lady diana i happen to know neveri suppose you will send cards by the carriage that would answer the purpose very well we have never known the townspeople you knowin that sort of way there is a tenants party in the summer they come to that mary had listened she was pale but her eyes smouldered i cant do that mrs germain i mean i must return the call ah it will be against my recommendation i am very sorry i asked mrs burgess to call when i met her the other day at waysford really waysford one would meet her there i suppose a sale of work yes but i asked her to call upon me it was kind of her to come so soon mrs james pressed her lips together so soon why the woman would fly does my brother know of this may i ask i dont know said mary out of breath she was scared but meant to go on it will be better that he should be told if you think it will interest himyes mary said and went upstairsto stare out of window clench and unclench her hands mrs james reported the case to her brotherinlaw and mary drove the next day to farlingbridgeher husband with herand returned the call nothing more was said nor when the visit of a colonel dermott vc and his lady townspeople too had to be witnessed was a word of warning uttered but mrs james left within a fortnight of her rout staying only for the first dinnerparty at southover that was how she learned that mary middleham had character it shocked her and it was annoying too that she could expect no sympathy from james the houseparties for the winter shooting and those dinnerparties for the county had to be gone through with somehow she set herself squarely to the task and was glad enough to believe towards the end of her two years that she was learning the business there was little to do indeed but be agreeable but she found that more than enough agreeable she could be when she felt happy her nature was as sweet as an apple but if she felt hurt she must show it and she discovered that that was a cardinal sin then there was the language to master the queer impertinent leisurely laconics of these peopleexpensive perfectly complacent incredibly idle young men old men without reticence airy freespoken women and girls who unaffectedly ignored her to cope with such as these she must be even as they were or seem so the quickness of their giveandtake in conversation the ripple and flow the ease of the thing asked an alertness of her which excited while it tried her to death perpetually flagging at the game she spurred herself perpetually for she discovered that there is no more deadly sin in the code than an awkward pause that being all of a piece with the end and aim of livingwhich is smooth running a woman should die sooner than drop a conversation or murder it she was at her best with the men as perhaps she might expect she could run she could walk all day chatter laugh outright seem to be herself they paid her the compliment of approving looks but among the women she knew that she must be herself a very different thing she felt infinitely small illdressed illmannered clumsy and a dunce it was from them however that she gained her reputation of being stiff she had them to thank for that it had come to her in a flash of spirit one day in the summer of her first year that if ignoring was in the wind she could ignore with the best she chose to ignore mrs chilmarke mrs ralph chilmarke a beauty a dainty blonde and a wit she did it steadily for three days at what a cost she could never have guessed when she began it and her reward was great mrs chilmarke respected her for it and the duchessa duchess was in the housewas frankly delighted and said so she had watched out the match and had backed the brune under such exertions as these character will out while it may slumber through years of pedagogy but she worked hard at her lessons directly she had found out what she wanted and was tolerably equipped for her tour in france and italy when the time came she made no way with latinmr germain had to give that up and english literature made her yawn she insisted on botany for reasons unknown to the good gentleman and became great friends with the head gardener a scotchman who made the initial mistake of supposing her a little fool and was ever afterwards her obedient servant shall we do wrong in putting this study down to senhouses credit i think not quietly and methodically after a method all her own mary germain began to find herself as they say but before she did that her husband had to find her and he poor gentleman who had had to begin upon their wedding day was at the end of his discoveries before he was at the end of his honeymoon so far he struggled but after that he suffereddumbly and in secret within his plate armour the fact is there had been too much honeymoon his evident discomfort had made her selfconscious killed her ease threatened her gratitudeupon which he had proposed to subsistand turned him from an improbable mate into a rather unsuccessful father of his wife october is a bad time for honeymoons the evenings are so long nevertheless at torquay her mind had been fairly easy about him he had liked the hotel at saltcombe he had been pretty miserable much on her conscience he had taught her chess it seems and if she had known what she was about chess might have done pretty well but unfortunately she took to chess and began to beat him at it by audacious combinations and desperate sallies quite unwarranted by science that vexed him sadly he abandoned the game telling her frankly that he could not help being irritated to see skill outvailed by temerity one plays you see my love for the pleasure of playing not to win that is the first condition of a pastime she told him she was very sorry and he kissed her but after that villiers used to lay newspapers and reviews on the sittingroom table while they were dining she consoled herself with the remembrance of that kiss on the lips it was nearly the last of them he selected her forehead from saltcombe onwards or her cheek from saltcombe they went down into cornwalltruro penzance sennen st ives there it was that she learned to be happy in her own company she spent hours alone scrambling among the rocks watching the sea her life was filling her vistas opening this was great gain to feel the triumph of discovery she had never been so far afield before and the wild splendours of rocks and seas made her at times like a thing inspired she was amazed at herselfat the stinging blood in her which made her heart beat she used to get up early at sennen steal hatless out of the sleeping inn and fleet over turf to the edge of the cliffs there she stood motionless with unwinking eyes and parted lips while the wind enfolded her all was pure ecstasy she was like a nymphbarebosomed ungirdled unfilletted in the close arms of the country god from such hasty blisses she returned drowsyeyed glossed with rosecolour with a sleek bloom upon her and ministered to her husbands needs dressed with care with the neatness which he loved she sat quietly by him hearing but not heeding his measured tones dreaming of she knew not what save that the dreams were lyric and sang of freedom in her ears they took more tangible shape as they waxed bolder in outline and scope there was a tumbledown white cottage on the cliff beyond the coastguard station two rooms and a washhouse below green eaves it faced the open sea but lay otherwise snugly below a jutting boulder and was so much of a piece with rock and turf that the seapinks had seeded in the roof and encrusted it with emerald tufts her fancy adorned this tenement she saw herself there in a cotton gown alone with wind and sea what a life the freedom of it the space the promise not a speck could she descry upon the fair blue field of such a life childlike she built upon the airy fabric added to it assured herself of it some day some day she would be therefree the thought made her perfectly happy she felt her blood glow mr germain complained of the damp cornish air and took her to st ives and newquay on the way to southover once on the homeward path he had no eyes for her in cornwall all his hopes were now set upon the feast he should have of her queening it there in his hallqueen by his coronation she for her part was all for lingering goodbyes to her glimpses of the wild she went obediently but carried with her the assurance that she should see her cottage again and by some juggling of the mind in the picture of it which floated up before her at call she came to see always near it the tiltcart and its occupant her friend of the open common a community down there the tiltcart stood in a hollow of the rocks within sound and sight of the sea the ghost cropped the thyme above it bingo ran barking out of the tent and seeing her lowered his head and came wriggling for a caress above them all dominant stood her friend bareheaded to the buffeting gale so clearly at times that she could see the wind bellying his white trousers or flacking the points of his rolling collar his face unfortunately was not always to be seen a mist over it baffled her but egged her on for a flash for a passing second his bright quizzing eyes might be upon her she could hear the greeting of the dawn laugh from them and feel her bosom swell as she answered it and knew the long day before themand every long day to come what a comradeship that might bewhat a comradeship she came to thank god daily that she had such a friend and to declare stoutly to herself that she had no need to see him friendship was independent of such needs the necessities of touching eyeing speakingwhat were these but fetters lovers might hug such chains and call them leadingstrings poor lovers could not walk without them but friends had their pride in each other and themselves each stood foursquare in the faith of his friend the independence of each was the pride of the other so far was she from loving mr senhouse that she learned without a pang of his visit to the cantacutes in the following summer of his painting days with hertha de speyne and was surprised at herself it drew the two girls closer together it gave zest to letterwriting and brought miss hertha more than once to southover senhouse was the presiding genius of their fireside talks between hertha and senhouse mary began to find herselfa person with a reasonable soul in human flesh her weddingday and the days that followed it had dismayed the flesh she could not be one to whom marriage was a sacred mystery to be unveiled to piercing music she had cried herself to sleeponce but she cried no more if she had been in love with her husband even if she had ever been in love with anybody she might have been won over by pity or by passion but poor mr germain was incapable of the second and somewhat to her surprise she found herself unpersuaded though she was touched by the first she did pity him she pitied him deeply but she could not help him esteem she gave him gratitude obedience meekness respect but herselfafter that oncenever never for that discharging of her conscience of its poor little trivial human load had been forced upon her by pure generosity on her part she knew it and had cost her an agony of shame and it had chilled him to the boneshe had seen his passion fade before her eyes such passion as he had her generosity had stultified her played the traitor she never taxed him with want of magnanimity didnt know the wordbut she found herself resolute and was as much surprised as he was what dismay she had as the honeymoon wore on was brought her by her own position not by her husbands that a girl such as she with undeniable proofs to hand of her attractiveness of face and person with experience of men and their ways should find herself daughter to her husband an indulged courted only daughter if you pleasebut certainly a daughter here was an anticlimax to say the least of it and her dismay endured through the honeymoonuntil cornish cliffs gave her happier things to dream of it disappeared as the great red flank of southover house filled up the scene tussles with mrs james the sweets and perils of victory ordeals of shootingparties dinnerparties household cares and above all routinesuch drugs as these sent her heart to sleep by the time she had been eighteen months a wife she had forgotten that she had never been other than a maiden now what of cratylus poor cratylus the mature who clasping his simple mero or marina to his heart found that he had to reckon with her character first good honest man he had never supposed her to have one and the bitter thing was that the finding of her character woke up his own he saw himself again in full platearmour cowering behind it hiding from himself as well as from the world a terrible deformityan open sore in his selfesteem which could never be healed again which at every chance of her daily life must bleed and ache oh the pity of it on how light a spring all this had dependeda hair a gossamer exeterfatal day of exeter he had believed himself young again as she clung to him halfsobbing after dinner he had pressed her to his bosom called her his bride his wife she had not dared to look at him had bowed her head hidden her face in his shoulder let him feel the trembling the wild beating of her heart then her broken confessions pitiful pitiful what did they amount to when all was told but they and what followed upon themhis own conduct his own curse and her conduct and her cursewere his nightmare he had found out that he could not live if he must remember them he fought literally for life and after a six months toil had succeeded in living he spent himself in benevolence and care gave her everything she could want before she asked taught her prayed for her watched over her she was never out of his thoughtsand poor girl without knowing it she stabbed him deeply every day he had his benevolence to fall back upon he could be king of southover of the cophetua dynasty he could dazzle her take her breath away and have the delight which he had promised himself of seeing her misty eyes and cheeks flushed with wonder yes yes but the sthetic nerve you see dulls with use and the worst of a kings homage to a beggar maid is that the more obsequious the homage the less beggar is the maid if you set a coronet in her hair she will blush deliciously for a week but in two years time it will be there as a matter of course put there nightly by her womanand bang goes your joy of that so with all the other enrichments of society travel booklearning the more she had of them the more she was able to take for herself he who put her in the way of knowledge could not grumble if she acted upon what he had taught her such gifts as his destroy themselves it had filled his eyes with tears to see his wilding in the great terraced house to watch the little airs of dignity of matronhood wifehood alas poor gentleman flutter about her and like birds take assurance and alight her cares were charming too it was pretty to see her knit her brows over some tough nugget of dantes exquisite when she came faltering to him coaxing for help but then naturally the more help she had the less she came it grew to be her pride to get through aloneher pride and his disaster no tristram duplessis had been wiser in his generation than he if you love to fill a thing you must take care to keep it pretty empty thus it was that king cophetua kneeled in vain he had kneeled too low but theres a balm in the passing years for cratylus as well as for marina the musical clockwork of southover which he had promised himself became his he went about his duties as landlord county magnate patron of reasonable things tolerably sure of a welcome home from a pair of kind brown eyes kisses might be his if he chose to call for them clinging arms a warm and grateful heart such things had to be his solace and sometimes they were and he still fought for his treasure against all the odds with his teeth set hard if he had lost grip it was because her muscles were more practised he must try another and another if he would whirl her in the air he must impress her anew prove to her that he was a man honourworthy and loveworthy his ambitions were rekindled that was the result of his musings in the spring of the year when the tulips blazed in the italian gardens and mary middleham had been mary germain for a good eighteen months we heard him speak with young mr wilbraham of sir gregory and the farlingbridge division of the county there was a chance of lighting up the wonder again in a pair of brown eyes he hoarded the thought for the month and by june had made up his mind then he broke it to his mary i will gladly put my experience at the service of the country he told her and convince you if i can that i am not too old for a public career she had told him that he wasnt old at all and had kissed his forehead they happened to be alone for a few days just then so that he could draw her down to his knee and talk to her about himself and the part she would have to play for him in london the house in hillstreet must be reopened iii matters of election the country showed the periodic symptoms the moment parliament was dissolved the marketplace of farlingbridge hummed with rumour farmers in gigs pulled up to discuss the affairs of the nation with farmers on horseback with hedgers ditchers tinkers anybody class flowed over class and the reverend stephen burgess vicar of the town exchanged evening papers with reverend samuel rock congregational minister blue and red were in the air mr germain had long sittings with young mr wilbraham presently a deputation attended by leave at southover and was received in the library the seat was to be contested it seemed the honourable leopold levitt intended to fight now would mr germain fight him in a weighed speech of twenty minutes mr germain declared his loins to be girded pompous old boy said mr tom blyth the liberal harnessmaker to mr peake the liberal agent but hes good enough for the honourable levitt mr peake thought he was just good enough it was to be a narrow thing a closerun thing the addresses of the candidates showed as much those great institutions to which this country of ours cried the honourable mr levitt in ink those institutions to which this great country of ours was the peroration of mr germain there was to be very little in it mr peake the agent said that the ladies would do the trick the honourable mrs levitt was stout and twenty years older than her leopold the writs were out in august the election was to be in october mary who had begun to lose colour during the summer heats grew animated again at the prospect of the bustle she had been getting introspective too had been sometimes fretful sometimes glum she thought more than was good for her about things which could not be helped but for a flying sunday visit she had not seen her own people since her wedding day for mr germain had given up misperton once more and seemed to dislike the notion of her leaving him at such a time as this here then was a chance for her to be useful she told her husband that she felt sure of farlingbridge and when he shook his head despondent she told him why they like me there you know she said blushing and laughing i know they do besides mrs blyth told me so oh and colonel dermott stopped me yesterday and said that you might be easy hell speak for you wherever you want him colonel dermott was an introduction of hers to the penetralia of southover a fiery irishman with a turn for sarcasm what he had really said to her was that hed go to the stake for her but that it wouldnt be necessary he admired her unaffectedly as the campaign progressed on its roaring way mr germain became conscious that greater efforts than his own were necessary the honourable mr levitt was untiring he drove his own drag and seemed to have a speech on the tip of his tongue for every village green to mr germain speeches were matters of enormous preparation literary and economic he balanced his periods as carefully as his convictions he polished them gave them form but he could not fire them because he had no fire we must give it em hot mr germain we must indeed said peake the agent mr germain knew very well that he gave it them cold the charming spectacle of his young wife in red cloth driving her ponies in red harness a red bow on her whip and red roses in her bosom far from kindling him whitened the ashes of his hearth she was pretty she was gay she went again and again to the attack and coaxed for votes as a child for sweets one great sensation was when guy chaveney ratted and wore red another when levitt publicly alluded to her as his fair enemy and was drowned in the cheers of his own party colonel dermott swept her into debate with his hand heres the lady we follow and serve gentlemen and he turned to her where she sat glowing on the platform by the powers gentlemen id run her up to westminster by myself he went on but well share in the enterprise if you please a little more of that and we were in said mr peake help from on high was promised of an exciting kind the right honourable constantine jess president once of the board of trade now secretary of state apparent offered to come down and help his old friend he offered i assume in such a way that he could not be refused for his approach was announced to mary one morning over the breakfast table and received by her with the calmness proper to county ladies but there had been more he brings tristram his private secretary you remember tristram duplessis mary she managed it yes she said i remember him very well mrs hartleymrs leonard hartley i meansaid that she had heard him speak he reminded her of mirabeau sir james plash had asked which mirabeau and driven mrs leonard into a corner oh carlyles of course she answeredand the talk flowed over tristram duplessis but behind her fortification of silver urns and coffeecups she did remember him her eyes wide sombre and brooding made no sign it is the prerogative of county eyes to be still and of married eyes to be indifferent she did not smile at her thoughts nor betray that they were not of a smiling kind but she felt her heart quicken its beat knew that she was to be put to the proof and that her husband had chosen it to be so to the racing rhythm in her head ran the refrain i knew he must come he never forgets notes must be written and answers received his was very short dear mrs germaini am very glad to come and help you certainly we must bring him in yrs sincerely tr duplessis it required sharp scrutiny to read between the lines of such a letter and sharp scrutiny was appliedmore than once she pinched her lip over it as she sat alone and carried it with her as she walked the parkbut when she found herself doing that she tore it up i am very glad to come and help you that you was an afterthought certainly we must bring him in that we proved it she knew better than most how tristram could imply himself in a note he had forgotten nothing never would forget anything no no more had she forgotten of all her former lovers this was the one man who could cause her any disquiet or have evoked any sensation she could never have recalled herself as she had been two years ago by any other aid than his john rudd ambrose perivale it is doubtful if she would have known them again sharper memories a sharper fragrance clung about tristram of all of them it was with him that her relations had been the least explicit but it had been he also who had thereby implied the most he was master of implicationthat delicate art which leaves it to the imagination of the object to read what precisely is implied had tristram implied love she never knew that made tristrams dealing so exciting of course he had admired her his savage looks as if she stung and vexed him had assured her of that her presenceher near presenceseemed always to make him angry her absence angrier still since he always came after her and never forgot to let her see how angry he had been yes he admired her but admired other things more much more his books his scholarship the power he had and vastly more himself he was endlessly interested in himself only liked her as showing him himself in new aspects but she accepted that as a part of him like the cut of his clothes and there was no doubt as to her own feeling she had admired tristram on this side adultary just on this side tristram intended to be somebody he used to tell her so in a way which made her understand that he knew her to be a little nobody all the same he couldnt keep his eyes off her or his steps from turning to where she was or was like to be in a sense then she had drawn tristram duplessis and thats an exciting thing for a little nobody to do if he had been her lover as well it had been in a way of his own he had told her often and often that he disapproved of herof her too speaking eyes for instance which could and did speak in those days of her little affairs with dick or tom as to which he had given himself the trouble to be exactly informed of her lack of ambition and because she was a dunce and she had laughed or blushed or been offendedshe had never been hurt and had allowed herself to be put under the rod of his tongue or the gibe of his eyes again and again she thought nowwith hot cheeksthat she ought to have felt herself insulted and with hotter cheeks that it was doubtful even now whether she would feel herself so to have a book thrown into her lap with the inference that she couldnt read it to be kissed without leave asked or to kiss again without notice takenthese should have insulted mary middleham but would they insult mary germain tingling cheeks were no answer tristram had indeed been very exciting he had been unaccountable arbitrary splendid to have attracted his scowling looks had been one of her triumphs it had been a triumph even that misperton brand knew all about it and that part of it had been scandalized yetand for all thatthinking over it now with his coming again so close at hand she knew perfectly well that she had not been in love with him and was not in love with him now he had treated her in too lordly a fashion altogether dimly she could guess that love was another affair it might be possible for a girl to worship a man as a godbut that was never love she knew better than that now but certainly she must confess even now to a tenderness for her reminiscences of tristram who had singled her out of a herd watched followed engrossed her and in his own morose and grudging way had seemed to be in love with her he had known how to kiss anyhow as she inhaled the sharp fragrance of those days she was again excited there had been glamour she recalled with a thrill the sunday afternoon when mrs james had caught him reading shelley to her under the apple tree and blushed anew as she had blushed then and the continuous alarm of the affair the moments snatched in pauses of the chase yes there had been glamour and it had been sweetperilous and sweet it was a thing to remember but not to fear she didnt think she need fear anything especially as she had told mr germain all about itor as good as told him but its always ticklish work meeting an old hearts acquaintance on new terms neither party to the business can face it quite unmoved for him theres the painful curious inquirythis this is she with whom i had fondly hoped now look there is knowledge stored within those limpid eyesand i might have put it there she and i share experiences which hethat interlopercan never share with this i must dress my wounded side all that his handshake or his bow may convey to her upon her sidethe sedately conscious of two mens regardveiled within her eyes theres this for the ousted lover you may spare me the rod i am anothers who might have been yours you loved me once you told me be charitable now and all that she will express in the flutter of her greeting tristram duplessis looselimbed flushed frowning as of old may have implied it or she who played him hostess of southover may have appealed in that fashion how dyou do was what he said in words when he took her hand which she held out in a nerveless clasp he had arrived late in the afternoon when the hall was fully occupied stockinged young men in from shooting shortkirtled ladies in from getting in their way a dowager or two reading evening papers and a whiskered professor in slippers one must imply skilfully in such a company and then to be sure there was mr constantine jess ponderous benevolent all for domesticity to be reckoned with all women liked mr jess because although he was prodigiously learned he owned to a weakness for small talk and soft voices it was he then who had the triumph of the entry ah mrs germain this is a welcome indeed and doth not a meeting like this make amends his quick fullcushioned eyes swept the corners of the roommy dear lady barbara lady wentrode your servanthow dye do how dye do these things accomplished he turned to his hostess cup in hand and sank into the cushions by her side we have not met i think since that auspicious daytwo years ago is it that dear me how time makes sport with us one should hear the titans laugh i had promised myself an earlier contemplation of your felicity butbusiness business he sighed drained his teacup and asked for more it must have been within a week of your marriage that my young friend and i took a fancy for each other a marriage of minds tristram my dear fellow when was it he had taught his secretary the duty of playing chorus that was very necessary to mr jess tristram leisurely as of old sipped his tea before answering got up and waited for another cup while he collected his reply its a long timei know that thanks no sugar oh im so sorryi forgot she looked up at him hazardously you always took it i thought i know but ive dropped all that better without it he spoke lightly the campaign was broached by mr jess well and how does my friend in the field gallantly i am sure happily i hope mrs germain thought that he would win he works very hard hes speaking now somewhereout of the carriage at a harvest home i ought to have been with him but you stayed to be hospitable to us we are grateful at least i speak for myself tristram there takes kindness for granted not mrs germains said tristram and startled her however she laughed i dont think it was very kind of me i was glad to be let off im sure everything will go right now did you know that you must begin tonight mr jess do you mind theres a meeting at the corn exchange at eight we are dining early mr jess laid his comfortable hand upon his heart i follow my leader where she calls me i am ever to be found and then she raised her eyes to tristram will you speak for us mr duplessis he started as out of a stare who i oh ill do as im bid of course enlist him my dear lady enrol him cried mr jess twinkling but if you love me let him follow me he has a note like a trumpet really she opened her eyes upon tristram i can make a row he admitted but perhaps germain wont like that i am sure he will like whatever you do said she duplessis made no answer but did not shirk the reflection that if he did it would indicate a striking change in the gentlemans views at this moment a fairhaired young lady in a ridinghabitmiss nina swetebrede of copestakecame in craving tea she distributed her nods and smiles on either hand as she advanced to the table dear mary im so tired she pleaded do feed me and make a fuss of me and i shall love you the newly arrived gentlemen were made known to her and mr jess courtly and tenderly jocular ministered to her needs she annexed him without scruple this left duplessis in possession of the teatable but the attack was marys so you have taken to politics in earnest he shrugged i dont know that im in earnest thats putting politics rather high the game is as good as another she might have known that he would never admit earnestnessto her but she felt snubbed the fact is he went on that either every side in politics is partly right in which case its only common honesty to say soor that all sides are entirely wrong which means that only rascals can succeed at it so that in any event one must be more or less of a rogue she ventured a little laugh i know what you meanor think i do i know more about politics than i didonce he parried that one gets to know something of course you talk of nothing else here i suppose there seemed to be a sting in this loyalty must meet it but indeed we do she began and he saved the position for her by saying that he wished he could say the same for himself but therell be no chance of rational conversation he told her until that fellows safely in the home office mr jess was placidly contemplating miss nina swetebredes candid blue eyes and knew nothing of what may have tickled his hostess tristram in a few minutes asked to be shown his room ive got a heap of letters to write and some to read may i ring in the pauses of the party strife when the champions were out in the lists mrs germain played lightly upon her heartstrings plucking chiefly that chord of glamour as she remembered it to have been duplessis who noticed everything about her down to the smallest detailher clothes her neatly cut shoes her manner with servants with germain with the roaring public of the hustingsthought that she carried off the thing very well better no doubt in his absence but still very well she was shy of him and that was charming because it gave her colour and sparkle she was quickly on her dignityand that was touching she seemed to court his good opinion to dress her little window wistfully she made him think of a pullet with its first egg still more touching by jove because there was no egg and little likelihood of one and how careful she was and how she appealed here i am she seemed to be saying with every look trusted and responsible but oh so safe be generous he began to judge her again a girl of her sort she could no more help using her eyes than avoid breathing through her nose with every darted look with every droop of the lids she put herself at his discretion well she neednt be afraid poor little soul he could afford to be generous to one who amused and touched him at once pity is a heady wine in a man of this sortyour conquerorbyinstinctit inspires magnanimity and the worst of that virtue isyou cant be truly magnanimous until you have reduced the object of your charity to destitution and misery before you can lift her out of the mire you must see her in it he may have been tempted but her appealing look tempered his rage even his grudge against germain was less sharp than it had been germain germain and this lovelorn little creature with her peering eyes good heavens let her take her joy where she could they were rarely alone together and when they were she was extraordinarily circumspect but he was master of inuendo and knew her a good scholar there was no need for him to say heigho to hear it echo from her breast and the less he said the more she would have him say he fancied but he was wrong there he said to her once before he left southoveri must ask you this you are happy she stiffened instantly and looked steadily in front of herat the south front of southover it so happened i am very happy thats good i had to ask you know had you she said navelyand then i wonder why you would say i have no business to care she faced him no i shouldnt you are free to do as you like and you he frowned arent you free too she touched the flowers in her breast looking at them yes of course i am it was nice of you to ask me i am very happy a cul de sac that way damn it once at dinner the person of jack senhouse came up for debate several persons present had some hand in the game mr jess and tristram tossed the name about across and across lady barbara rewish flicked it as it passed mr germain gave it a sedate lift into the air when it came to mary she let it drop mr senhouse belonged to her innermost self nobody present knew that she had had anything to do with him but two things nearly lost her her selfpossession one was to hear her friend in public discussionand here she exulted in her secret the other was duplessiss scorn of him that made her hot i was at school with that idiot he had said and at cambridge he was always a wasterbut he used to comb his hair in those days he looked down the table at mary the shuttlecock was with her and she let it drop he saw her do it mr germain was now under way and gave it a lift i remember that mr senhouse proposed on one occasion to sleep near my covertstoo near to suit the views of cradock however i regretted what followed what did follow somebody asked welli regretted it said mr germain closing his eyes for a moment mr senhouse accepted my explanation in the kindest way i must confess that i took no particular notice of his hair save to observe that he wore it uncovered he wears it long said tristram and glanced at mary germain if he wears it uncovered said mr jess hell wear it longer than you my young friend he may wear it to his heels tristram replied but not in my company here mrs germain gave the signal and the gentlemen were left to politics that idiot robbed tristram of some chance of magnanimity in the drawingroom he found it out you know senhouse he asked her she had no fear of him now quite well he is a friend of mine has he been here i think not he doesnt like big houses oh hed come you know hes mighty affable i should be very pleased to see him i like him extremely he laughed hes a great talker always was he talks very well said she and listens very well personally he leaves me speechless here duplessis rose and added with fatigue but i see we are not going to agree about senhouse she looked blankly before her noobviously mr germain asked her to sing and she obeyed with alacrity she sang prettily but not well ordinarily she failed in attack but under duplessiss watching brows it seemed that some new spirit had entered into her she had never sung better the election came and was made and john germain esquire of southover house triumphed over mr leopold levitt the very next day the new secretary of state for all had gone well with the party made his farewells and took his private secretary with him tristram wanting scope for magnanimity had been morose since the senhouse discussion she thanked him lightly for helping us us to duplessis but he gulped it i am glad to have been of any use youll be in town for the session of course i suppose so we shall hope to see you many thanks you are not supposed to see through secretaries of statebut jess should be a good medium so its arrivederci she gave him her hand goodbye but he held it for a minute we are friends againafter this she withdrew yes indeed goodbye friends it was the result of some very careful balancing and an odd result that if senhouse lost nothing in her regard duplessis lost nothing either his arrogance you see was so entirely in character and it is satisfactory to a woman to find a man come out true to type its assurance of strength in him he had been very odious and his judgment of a better man was laughable but he had been superb all the same so that it seemed she could be friendly with the pair of them there was still a third friend to reckon with on the day of the departure of the election guests mr germain was very talkative at dinner and drank more wine than usual two glasses of port for instance he was full of his projects high in hope you could detect the cheer under his voice does my mary see or i hope my dear one can follow that line of thought or i think my child may be satisfied with such a position of trustit might be he thanked her for the loyal help she had given him made her sit with him after dinner instead of sending her to the drawingroom held her hand patted or stroked it and presently fell asleep holding it still finally when it was bedtime he took her in his arms she submitted to his embrace and gave him the kisses he sought but no more presently she looked kindly at him with a certain power unknown to him before it spelled gentle negationpronounced with extreme gentleness but not to be mistaken then she kissed him of her own accord disengaged herself and went away he sat with shaded eyes for a long time motionless but not asleep his eyebrows were arched to their highest once or twice his lips moved he seemed to be crying out upon himself when they met in the morning it was as usual or seemed to be so but his dream was over for good and all and he had muffled himself against the cold iv london nights and days we are to see her now spread her wings for london and butterfly flights about the flowers and sweets there hillstreet affords a standard by which to measure her growth that decorous house in hillstreet which had cowed her when she went to it on trousseaubusiness and had driven her once fairly crying upon the mercies of mrs james she could now find small and dark she thought it a stuffy little house and wondered how many the table would dine how many must be shut out of the drawingrooms theres a famous anecdote of mrs jamess often and impressively told by her which comes to mind here it concerns gerald gunner laura gunners second boy a famous gentlemanjockey and though his years were few remarkably a rip charming manners like all that family but most highspirited wild they say bad influences were at work no doubt his friends were loyalty itself everything was hushed up and more than once but and mrs james used to lower her voicethere was a fracas at sandown lord windleshams horsethey say my dear that he pulled it you will know what that means i dare say i believe there was no room for doubt lord gunner that was of course the old lord father of our recent acquaintanceallowed him fifty pounds a year so long as he remained in canada cutting logs or building railwaysor whatever they do in the wilds and the poor boy went outin the steerage the heskeths during their tour went to see him some years ago and my dear it was deplorable miles and miles into desertswamps no neighbours and of course no church privileges a hovel literally a hovel built by his own hands barely weatherproofnot quite that i am told in one corner they arrived in the evening rather late and found him shelling peas into an old biscuittin his eton birch and a portrait of the queen were absolutely the only ornaments but this to my mind is deeply pathetic would you believe it that poor young man dressed for dinner every night directly he had cooked it it got cold and his jacket was in holesbut he never omitted it mrs hesketh assured me that she wept and fifty pounds a year think of it of course he made nothing what could he make with his training it is a sad story mrs john germains polite education had begun later than gerald gunners but to find a house in hillstreet stuffy is symptomatic of broadening views on the other hand she showed the bourgeoise undismayed when she permitted herself to be excited she was all agog for town delights lady carhawk a berkshire dame was to present her and photographs of her little person stiff feathered and bejewelled making her look as some wit said like a spanish madonna strayed into a fair went down to blackheath with promises of a speedy visit in full dress cards fluttered daily upon the halltable mr germain engaged a second secretary mrs germain began to think of one too she attacked her pleasures as once her taskwork with zest and spirit she made scores of acquaintances lady carhawk must have liked herherself a likable florid lady the duchess of lanark showed that she did lady barbara rewish and others of the sort found their old hearts touched by the grateful graceful girl who never took a favour without showing that she was much obliged never refused one and thats a rare abnegation and if she asked you to do anything for her coaxed for it with bright eyes and wooing lips the duchess called her a nice little thing a pretty soul a good girl and the duchesss third son lord vernon did his best to prove how good she wasand succeeded she got nothing but good out of that for his weaknesses were well known much of this little success she owed to her southover drilling which had taught her how little she had to fear how little was expected of her in a world where chatter is the staple and high spirits a matter of good taste practically she only had to listen and to smile now she looked her best when she smiledher teeth were really perfect as for listening excitement gave her colour and glitter her gowns were as good as they could beand what more do you want but the wish to please that she had she courted your good opinion was anxious to be approved besides she could be patronized and liked it there had never been any question of her success with the men so little indeed that it was curious to see how well she stood with the women her early years it has been hinted did not want of experience she proved her femininity before she was sixteen and betwixt the cubs of the village and the young lions of politics is no difference in kind you vary the allure but brown eyes are still brown and ginger is always hot in the mouth of these splendid youths palmer lovell must perhaps be reckoned with first he who for her sake or so it is said forsook a young and handsome viscountess after a stormy sowing in one field he was now complacently reaping in another mr germains party owned him an acquisition and the same feeling was to be expected of mr germains wife lovell constituted himself her mentor waited about great stairways for her attached himself to her side and sat out all and sundry he explained himself unaffectedly as a hope of the party and she was very willing to believe him but somehow the information did not thrill her as it had when she received it from tristram duplessis with the rising of whose light above the firmament sank the orb of mr lovell horace wingromantic to the waist thence downwards dancing master approved himself in her eyes he was handsome affable an artist in his way she had an instinct for style and he had that he knew where to depart from the tailors ideal which is tightness he knew where to be loose he could unbutton a coat to better purpose than any man livingor a phrase when he saw his way he always coloured his phrases you were thought to hear birds in the brake to see cowslips adrift in a pasturehappy country thingswhen he discoursed some considered his flowers forced things of the hotbed but he was discreet because really he was timid the byron of the boudoir lovell called him scorning mr wing but mrs germain who knew little to byrons discredit and understood boudoirs to be made for two was much taken with this fine gentleman on his part he found her attractive because his world did he was acutely sensitive to opinion with the feelers of a woman for it i dont mean that he knew what was in fashionof course he did but that he could detect what was going to be there he was almost infallible there were others about herit was quite a little triumph in its waywhom to name would be tedious but one was a very great man indeed robert john bernard marquis and earl of kesteven a knight of the garter and an ambassador lord kesteven was no less than sixtyodd years old had a marchioness somewhere and three mature children and a reputation for incisive gallantry second to no mans he managed his affairs of the kind deliberately he had method when he died it was said that not one single note in a womans hand was to be found among his papers that was not for want of hunting for them and yetwell if old kesteven looked at you twice you were worth looking at that was said now he looked at mrs germain more than twice with these tributes at her feet with such heady incense in her nostrils it isnt wonderful if she attended the coming of duplessis with assurance of amusement wondering what offerings he would bring real goddesses we may suppose take their worship as of right but a makebelieve goddess discovers an appetite for it the more she gets she felt perfectly ready for tristram and more than ready by the time she had him it seems that he had thought her outshe might have inferred it had she not been piqued by delayand decided that he must give himself value at any rate he did not present himself at hillstreet until the card for her first evening party made it a matter of duty then he came and was received with airy smilesas if he had been an old crony he found her to be extremely at ease in his company was disconcerted and showed it he had come as one prepared to be fatigued he departed with frowns as one who fears that he has been fatiguing good god he said to himself shell be calling me tristram in a day or two he reflected that if she did that he was done for that would show that he had ceased to strike her imagination had become so much furniture a sort of housedog deeply mortified brooding over it he began to need her his selfesteem sickened she only could restore its tone he became really alarmed about himself couldnt work failed of audacity missed his spring he saw her againhe was in a black mood she rallied him upon it and sent him away to entertain lady barbara whose rights no man dared dispute lady barbara accepted him as a target for some of her archery i saw that young lady married to our friendand she nodded towards their hostess you i fancy did not a most hopeless business i thought i remember a sister with fluffy hair hopeless it would have been if she had been cleverbut thank goodness shes not she has just sense enough to be herself no airs no smirks nothing to hide she told old kesteven all about herself i hear at a dinnerparty father mother sister jinny kesteven was charmed thats a sensible girl you know not a clever one whod spend herself in scheming how to let bygones be bygones on the contrary this girl hoards them for a relish tristram looked very glum was she hoarding him for a relish the old archer went on with her practice look at her now with horace wing horace is weaving his gossamers he thinks shes enmeshed shes not you know shes only pleased i tell you shes exactly what she always was once upon a time tom styles took notice of her as she would say hung about the churchdoor sundays that was a triumph in its way now its lovell or jocelyn gunner or old kesteven i dont suppose she has ever been in love in her lifebut i fancy that you can correct me if i am wrong duplessis faced about i im afraid i cant help you she knew my people in the country we were rather friendly we liked her im glad to think that you do too she amuses me said lady barbara and i certainly admire her honesty horace wing wont i think shell puzzle him with her gratitude horace wants dearer tributes all you young men do mr germain came up to bow over his friends hand im talking of your speech germain she told him kindly i know said he you were rather magisterial i thought but at least you knew what you were talking about tristram here says thats not necessary mr germain blinked he never looked at tristram and did not know fortunate if true he said coldly but i cannot myself afford to believe it ah germain youre too rich you see tristram said as lightly as he could and withdrew to a doorway whence he could see mary lady barbara inquired with eyes and eyebrows to no purpose mr germain was blandly obtuse shes charming said the old gentlewoman and caught him unawares he started coloured yes yes i find her sohourly who dresses her mr germain raised his head really i believe there are consultations she looks well tonight a happy nature my friend charming charming lady barbara murmured and thenwith a look from the door to her friend what is he doing now mr germain grew alert tristram he goes his way i believe he was bickering with poor jess the other day jess is the soul of goodnature but there are limits plenty cried the lady there should be more hell be in the house byandbya thorn in all your flesh mr germain repressed himself if he could get a seat want of means would restrict his chances i fear he is arrogant hes able he believes it that is his only capital sum i fancy but i am not in his confidence he has the run of your house mr germain again lifted his head he is constantias first cousin my wife is interested in him she has known him for some years but she shares my anxieties lady barbara was touched by his gallantry but not put off an old friend she persisted she is willing to believe him so lady barbara nodded her head she was a stoic herself v lord gunner ascertains where we are george lord bramleigh roundest and youngest of men of sixandtwenty overtaking jocelyn lord gunner in st jamessstreet tipped him on the shoulder with his stickhandle gunner turned red in the face damn you bramleigh shut up he said couldnt shut up to save my life old chap his friend replied im so fit i dont know what to do with myself come back into the fencing club and make passes at me gunner growled see you shot first and walked on bramleigh joined him humming an air look here said gunner after a time dyou know a man called duplessis rather says lord bramleigh go on thats what hes doing lord gunner mused his goingson are awful hell make the lady talked aboutand she dont deserve it the lady must be named and lord bramleigh whistled at her name reminiscences of a morning at san sebastian came upon him but were withheld lord gunner poured out his grievances i dont mind a chap hanging roundnot one bit if i wasnt hanging round myself a good lot i shouldnt see it and shouldnt much care if i did theres nothing in that besides there are plenty of us but he messes about thats what i cant stand he messes about and he seems to think she belongs to him thats the way to make her said the sapient youth thats his little plan no its not my boy he was corrected youre off the line thats what he really thinksand by god he shows it hes like a dog with a bone he snarls and turns up his lip the moment you come into the place or if he comes late and finds any one thereas he mostly doeshe sulks pon my soul i hate the brute the young man tilted back his hat and looked up at the skya pale blue sky irradiated by the sun and by the burnished copper wires of our affairs where are we nowend of aprilbeginning of may she came to town in februaryand here we are in may i believe hes only been away from the house for three days on endand thats just now when hes in paris you ought to know said bramleigh the other snorted i do know hes up to no good that chap ill bet you hes not hes not a good sort with women i happen to know now may a man ask lord bramleigh interjected what you are up to lord gunner looked down at him in surprise oh you may bramleigh i can stand it from you im all right you know i wouldnt hurt her shed have a pretty stiff time of it with old fowlsoftheair germaina if it wasnt for some of us who go and amuse her shes a jolly girl you know and she deserves something dash it all cried bramleigh she got something when she married old germain she had nothing at all im told he picked her up in a nursery lord gunner jerked an angry head yes i know i know that wasnt the game ill be shot why any one could have done it he played the god in the machine came bouncing out of the sky and sent the servant in for her beg pardon miss but heres the archangel michael come for you best clothes please shut your eyes and youll be married tomorrow that was the way it was sprung upon her what was a girl to do but bless her stars and say shed be with him directly well and what i say is if old fowlsoftheair finds he aint up to the part he cant drop it and leave her in the lurch if he cant make himself entertaining he must be helped thats what duplessis says lord bramleigh supposed but gunner could not allow it i beg your pardon he says my bread i believe hes a grabber the mischief of it is that i cant say anything i think not said bramleigh tersely but i know a man who could just left him whos your friend bramleigh lord bramleigh would not be drawn ohman you wouldnt know not your sort but the lady knows him couldnt you give him a hint i could said bramleigh with deliberation i could buthe looked up at his tall friendbut if i did i shouldnt leave you out old chap lord gunner halted and faced him you may say what you please about me i dont care what you say he looked over to bondstreet thats my road he said the way to hillstreet asked bramleigh the way to hillstreet he was told lord bramleigh remained upon the piccadilly pavement for some minutes lost in what must be described as thought his lips were framed for whistling but no sound came his eyes stared at nothing in particular then he was heard to say ill do it by gad and seen to turn on his heel he walked down the hill again the way he had come up her life was such a whirl it may well be that she had no time to wonder whither she was flying at any rate she marked neither time nor direction nor was aware that her friends were remarking on both if you had checked her suddenly with the question was she happy she would have stared before she answered you of course from day to day she hardly saw her husband alone he breakfasted as of old in his room his secretary came at ten and stayed to luncheon he had a nap after that and went down to the house at four he might return to dinner he might join her at a party in time to take her home but by then he would be so tired that he would drop asleep in the carriage she may have known or she may not that his eyes were often upon her intensely observant of her gaiety and appreciative of her good manners she can hardly have known that she was seldom out of his thoughts it must be confessed that he was not more than a perfunctory guest in hers she wore his name in her prayers as she wore it abroadin that world of his to which he had enlarged her where she now fluttered her happy wings she paid him in fact the service of lip and eye which we pay to god in church he was no doubt the author of her being my husband saysmy husband thinks she never used such a phrase without the little reverential hush in her voice or without a momentary curtsey of the eyelids when he showed himself in a room she went instantly to his side when he was present at a dinnertable her tones were lower her laughter less infectious he was disposer supreme he was secure of that dignified but remote office it was one which he was well qualified to fill and it was unfortunately for him the only one about her person which was then at his service nobody knew this better than the poor stoic himself nobody knew it less than the engrossed little lady it was not until the end of april or as lord gunner had ascertained it the beginning of may that she became aware of the fact that she had been seeing duplessis every day since the short easter recess it was forced upon her notice by this other that for those days he was absent and that she missed the homage of his knit brows they were more to her she found than horace wings postures or palmer lovells placid contemplation of her charms yet each of these rising statesmen was much more her servant than tristram could care to be lovell used to advise her about her gowns it had got to that his aunt lady paynswick had a shopso that it was reasonable mr wing took each new apparition of her as an occasion for poetrysurface poetry so to speak which a more experienced subject might have found pert but it sounded very well at the time duplessis did none of these things neither saw nor admired he simply frowned but she liked to be frowned at in that sort of wayshe had always liked it it meant you sting me i have no rest you could cure my scowls but you wont i detest you because i love you it was a tribute implied powerand how could she help liking that one of the great joys of power is that you can sit back at your ease twiddle your thumbs and say to yourself an i would i could you must needs feel charitable to him who puts you in the way of that after his three days truantry when he returned to her side she showed him that she was glad to see him generous but mistaken it made him crosser than ever he could be abominably rude when he choseand he chose to be so now she was at the opera alone in her box he came in after the first act nodded and sat down this she forgave even to the extent of offering her hand youve been awayit is nice of you to come im all alone you see he said one must go somewhere she laughed that off what had been the favoured country he named paris as if it hurt him horribly paris she had been there onceon her way home from madrid some day she must be taken there again it had been extraordinaryhad seemed like walking on light duplessis said that it hadnt been like that at all but like walking in smells among a leering populace all this was far from gay but she was very goodtempered it would seem that he had come there to quarrel with her for that is what he did after an act and an interval of monosyllabic answers spells of brooding moustachegnawing and other symptoms of the devil she roundly asked him what ailed him he affected blank astonishment ailed him ailed what on earth should ail him then said she with colour i think you might be civil he stared and met a pair of stormy eyes am i to understand he began you are to understand she told him that you are making me very uncomfortable i have done you no harm her ancestry you see must peep out she was preparing a sceneand what can one do then is that a hint he asked her she turned to the stage you drive me to it she said you have been very rude he rose i can spare you that at any rate he said opened his hat with a clatter bowed and left her her bosom rose and fell fast and faster as the clouds gathered and swept across her eyes hateful manbut what had she done a tyrant he bullied women she felt very lonely the great house seemed to grow dark the great music to howl and bray palmer lovell came in presently after him came gunner but she could get no joy out of them and waited on miserably for her husband she found herself praying for him who at least would be gentle with her he was late however and she could bear no more she left after the third act in her brougham she had a visionit could have been nothing else at the corner of endellstreet under a gaslamp and in the full light of it she saw a tall man standing he was reading a newspaper and had no hat on his head her heart jumpedoh that could be but one person in the world her friend senhouse in london the detestable tristram was forgotten palmer lovell the mellifluous wing went down soused in cornish seas cornish seas sluiced rocks green downs birds adrift in the wind opened out across the yellow flare of a london night she went wideawake to bed and lay sleeplessly there the very next afternoon as she was coming out of a great shop in regentstreet crossing the pavement to get into her carriage she almost ran into his arms a the poor gentleman must have been more than usually on stilts when he made the speech on poultry farming which earned him this sobriquet vi senhouse on the moral law she could have jumped into them you she cried then it wasnt a dream at all i saw you last nightnear the opera he teased her with his wry smile and i saw you last night at the opera you were there oh i was in the gallery i left because much as i love wagner i love air more i suffocated oh but you might have come to see me she said with a pout not at all provocativea pout of sincere regret it was quite cool down there in factshe laughed at a memoryit was very cool indeed too cool i dont follow you said senhouse you neednt perhaps ill tell youshe looked doubtfully at him pondering i should like to tell you lots of things oh heaps everythingfrom the beginning im married you know he nodded gravely i can see that you are all well this made her think rather well but we must talkits obvious will you she looked at the carriage and the footman at the door of it if thats your carriageno i wont thanks have you walked five yards today no then well walk somewhere and have it out you might send that sepulchre away ill see you home her eyes shone i should love it it shall go she told the footman her intentions and sailed happily away in convoy with that tall loosely clad young man who to the footmans concern carried his hat in his hand blooming italian fellerairing his ead of air he told the preoccupied musters who said tlk tlk to his horses she too remarked it why you have got a hat he held it up yes indeedand ill wear it if you insist upon it but i dont she told him i shouldnt know you if you did he led her at a brisk paceto meet his long strides she had to break into a run now and again but she was prouder of his company than of any she had had yet and caught herself humming airs by the way there was indeed heaps to say she plunged into her stored reminiscences as a boy into a poolwent in deep and rose shaking her head breasting the flood i must tell youi believe i saw you on my wedding day from the trainjust a glimpse i saw the ghost plodding alongbingo running in the grassyou were sitting on the tilt smoking of course you were in white were you there it must have been you we had passed swindon i knowit was before we got to bath you were going west and so was iso were we i mean i wondered if we should meet out thereexeter were you there ohand i mustnt forget it is the most important of all hemy husbandtook me to the lands end he looked down quickly at her when were you there in october it was about the middle of october do you mean to say i was there in november said senhouse and stayed till februarythere or thereabouts i am always there for the winter i have business there she had put her hand to her side her eyes spelled ecstatic conviction i knew iti felt it how wonderful whats your wonder my friend why that i should have seen you there but you didnt ah but i did thats just it i was certain you were therei expected to find you in every hollow of the rocks the place told me of youit seemed to bear your mark if i were an animal i should say that i could smell you there he was amused youre not far wrong i was thereabouts you might have smelt some of my deedsflowersi grow em on those cliffs you might have seen em her eyes were roundly open

thrift im tryingfine colour it dont always come true yet but its a pretty thingarmeria senhusiana if you please now she was inclined to be serious with a confession to make hertha de speyne had told her something of all this and given her an interest in it mischief prevailed she sparkled as she probed him i dont quite understand you have a rock gardenyou i have remembered your scorn of propertyof owning anythingand really i am rather shocked a garden of yours he looked blandly interested mine bless you no i havent got a garden for these things i grow em out there on the rocks theyre anybodysyours toms harrys im only the gardener and you prove to me that i know my business because you must have been through my nursery half a dozen timesand saw nothing of it nothing at all i promise you her share in his little triumph was manifest she was intensely pleased thats lovely she saidand then you know if i had caught you outi should have been awfully disappointed i hope i shall never disappoint you maam he told her no if i owned all that i dont think i should care for it i esteem those things down there for taking their chance tourists hardly ever hurt them its the wet that does most harm the winter wetsluicing mists rotting rains she touched his armnearly stopped the walk i cant keep it up she said i have tried but its not to be done i knew afterwards that you did these things hertha de speyne told me are you angry he looked closely at hernot at all angrily you talked me over with her did you she blushed among other people i know that you were with the cantacutes the summer before last then with a sudden memory she stopped again almost took his arm did you seedo you know a white cottageright up on the cliff a green roof his eyes twinkled rats castle rather it has sheltered me more nights than one her lips pressed together as she nodded her head i might have known that i beg your pardon thinking of what she was to speak presently she told him in a grave voice that she intended to live in that cottagebefore i die he took that calmly you might do worse he had come to london he said to supply his needsto sell some pictures in cranbournestreet and to see some books his library was in bloomsbury she gathered the british museum he wanted aristophanes the arabian nights he had nearly everything else narrow inquiry revealed his tastes he owned two books don quixote was one mangnalls questions the other nobible no don quixote was better than the bible because it was our own we were not orientalsat least not now everything that a man could need for his moral and spiritual supplies was in don quixotereligion poetry gorgeous laughter good store of courage wisdom fortitude mangnall was enough for the rest oldfashioned perhaps but then he senhouse was oldfashioned i always read don quixote before i say my prayers they were by now in hyde park beyond the carriage road nearly alone with the trees and grass and certain sooty sheep which cropped there he found her a chair but himself sat on the ground and clasped his knees she must hear his views upon the bible but she had to press for them no no he told her at firstit wasnt his business to preach presently however he broke out youre just a counter in a game at this hourput up between the dressmaker and the policeman you are propertyand thats the bibles doing whywhylook at the ten commandmentshis wife servant maid ox asseverything that is his you come after his house if you remember you come with the flocks and herdsthere you are even nowand there you must be until the system breaks down your jealous god your jealous husbanddont you see that theyre one and the same the policeman and the dressmaker the duea and the eunuch of the door oh good lord thats oriental you know turks delight you wont find that in don quixotea sane latin book but its in half of the new testament saint paul women must cover their heads in church why ill tell you the yashmak the harem is not to be seenshameful the catholics are right they keep the bible for the learned they know it wont do if the italians for instance the most practical clearheaded people in europe were to get familiar with the bible the pope might have his throat cut thered be a revolution thats only one point out of a thousand but its a good one it concerns the welfare of more than half mankind and its relation with the other fraction if men are to buy and hoard women its quite clear that women maynt have souls of their own the whole social system depends upon their having none you are property my friendmarketed by the dressmaker safeguarded by the policeman it is really too degrading it degrades the man more than the woman makes him a kind of stockkeeper the most atrocious form of capitalist there can be the bible of course did not establish thatthe systems as old as hell no but it sanctioned it once and for all ever since that levantine sophist saw big business in christianity and ran it in europe the only hope of religion has been in what lurked of paganismlurked in the uplands of tuscany in the german forests and irish swamps religion is a habit of mindnot a taught thing we are all religious in a thunderstorm but we dont get it out of the decalogue we are all religious when we are in love laws of property are forgottenmen and women are themselves the accursed part of the system is this that they cant be themselves from the beginning you must learn the rules before you can break them now if there were no rules at all there would be no rebels i hope thats clear she listened with head gently inclined and pondering eyes partly amused partly disturbed by his vehemence but not scandalized because it was so like him and because he was he womanlike however she must reduce his theories to practice apply his rules bring them home or near home women he had said were propertywell was she her husbands property bought marketed by the dressmaker what did that mean exactly when with a grunt he stopped his harangue she tried to formulate her speculations i believe that i see what you mean about ruleskeeping and breaking its all very puzzling women are put wrong with men from the very beginningi see that now what did you mean about being themselves have i ever been myself he laughed staring at the ground never well buthow am i to begin go your own way defy the dressmaker she leaned forward her elbows on her knees do tell me what you mean about the dressmaker he stared at the ground again i dont know that i can get much nearer she teaches you toto set snaresto lead the eyesi dont think we can talk about it what am i to do she asked him that in a tone so serious that he knew she must be answered ah he said i cant help you you know you must fudge it out as best you can im dreadfully sorrybut thats the truth you might come to a pass where i could be of usei hope you wonttheres no reason to suppose it meantime hes kindness itself she said looking beyond him he was kind from the very beginningbuti know that i ought not to have married him perhaps said senhouse he ought not to have asked you her eyes fell no she said perhaps not after a pause of some intensity on her part she broke out what you tell me of yourself fills memakes me excited its glorious you stand on your feetyou are free as the airowe nothingwhile iwhat am i not even myself the dressmaker made methe policeman guards me my husbandbut if i had no husband what could i do belong to somebody else if i broke a rule he stopped her with a gesturea quick jerk of the head she met his eyes the pity will be if you break a rule without getting full value for the escapade dont do that i wasnt thinkingi didnt mean you to think he had frightened her she was quite breathless you must understand he said that in my view you are no wiser to put your body in a cage than your mind both must be free dont make the mistake of thinking that a woman who breaks our law of property in one way is worse than the shop thief who breaks it in another to wound the feelings of a good and generous man is a serious thingbut not to take bread when you are starving at least that is how i look at it butyou must be very sure you are starving sincerity is the supreme virtue and insincerity the only deadly sin she nursed her cheek while dreams showed themselves in her grave eyes whether she was pondering what he said or no theres no doubt she was giving it personal application again tristram was in her mindher morose exclusive lover was her friend giving a benediction to tristrams plain desires what was she to do then was she to be possessed by tristramat last sincerity he said was all was she sincere could she askdared she she knew that what he told her she should believeyes and she juggled she did not want to know what he would saybecause she knew it already blame her as you willthats the fact very woman that she was she went about and about the thing she dared notpeering for the assurance of her fears she looked softly at him as he sat there plucking the grass by handfuls or making mounts of torn plantainsshe looked wistfully you are my friend thenwhatever happens to me he met her melting eyes candidly depend upon me ah she said but i do well then i must do what seems to me besti must be brave he smiled have your adventures of course dont be afraid of them be true to yourself thoughat every cost yes yes i promise you that when shall i see you again he gazed blankly at the sky i dont know really im a wanderer you know but the lands end finds me from november to february mostly i begin to work west about october i am due in the north nowin the lakes wastwater will find mesomewhere thereabouts i shall be there till september i leave london tonightno tomorrow their eyes met again without embarrassment he was the only man she could have commerce with in this way i shall see you at lands end some day or other she told him when im wounded caught in a wire by the foot he laughed all rightill set you free but suppose you were in berkshire when i was therehow should i know that you were there would you call at southover he laughed no indeed i shouldnt im a hedgerow chap i move by night mostly well butyou might be within a mile of me and i should never know it yes you would of course he said simply youd know by the trail what trail dont you know that ill show you old borrow calls it the patteran and swears he got it from a gipsy girl called ursula you neednt believe him i dont but the trail is certain a woman who lived in a cave at granada showed it to me look here he plucked up a handful of grass heres a fourwent wayhe marked it with his finger in the dust now watchhe scattered the grass which took roughly the form of a curved pointer you see that on a roadit means the way i am gone but i do mine with leaves when leaves there arewith leaves from the sunny side of a hedgerow you can always tell them her brows inquiredshe was intensely interested dunce they are bigger of course and darker i use them because the gipsies who are everywhere use leaves too but never take the trouble to select them now youll always know my trail by that do you see she clasped her hands togetherher eyes danced how splendid how glorious then we have a language i can find you whenever i want you for if i wanted you very badly i could set a patteran for you couldnt i he nodded she said in a low voice you dont know how strong you have made meyou can never know thank you a thousand times not a bit he said lightly if were friends you are entitled to know my little games and may i speak to you like thatwhen i go anywhere do we share she sighed how can i ever thank you the sun was low when she got up saying that she must go home it was discovered to be seven oclock why she cried they had forgotten to have any tea poor girl will you have some now no no i dont want it but i must go will you come with me or are you engaged you know im never engaged i shall come with you of course will you drive she shook her head no thats too quick lets walk over the grass its no distance she talked to him of her friendsof all her friends but duplessis this he observed did he know mr horace wing by repute only it seemed he could be seen in photograph shopsa very pretty fellow too pretty palmer lovell unlicked he judged then he tried her i know young bramleigh he said with one of his straight looks into the deep of you i met him yesterday she received the shock unfaltering lord bramleigh i hardly know him he had failed lord kestevenfor she went on blandly with her listhe had never heard of he asked what he did and made her open her eyes do she said with a comical air of being shocked hes a marquis this made senhouse perfectly happy but he apologized for laughing ive nothing against him you know i believe its an honest calling does he do nothing else but be a kind marquis to you she affected scorn hes an ambassadorin paris i hope thats honest enough for you i hope so too said senhouse but id rather be a marquis is he your friend he says so i think he means to be all of a sudden she leaned towards him he felt her urgency you are my friend i have no others you have promised me your friendship you have it my dear said senhouse they walked the rest of the way in silence but he stopped once and interested her again it was in mountstreetof all places he stopped short as if he was listening his head high eyes closed he was sensing the air listening to it smelling it narrow mountstreet took the semblance of a forest path brambled dusty hemmed with bracken fronds and silvered roots theres raintheres rain he saidi can hear it coming may be a day off but its on the way she watched him incredulous are you a magician what are you he laughed ive got feelers thats all at the door in hillstreet he left her she was inclined to be tremulous tenderbut he was completely cheerful he would have gone with a wave of the hand had she not held out her own as it was she had prepared a little formal speechi cannot tell you how glad i am that we meti dont try to tell me he said i know it one takes that for grantedamong friends you know thats the privilege of the estate yes yesof course well i wont thank you for doing what pleases you i am sure that it has pleased you she fished for an answer take it for granted he repeated that braced her i will i do goodbye this time he did wave his hand mr duplessis have called madame said greatorex at the door he have left a parcel lord kesteven have calledand mr wing the parceldiscreetly phrasedproved to be most palpably a truss of roses she unfastened it herself and found a slip of paper pinned to the stalk of one forgive was written on it smiling wisely she went upstairs to dress her bouquet in her hand vii she glosses the text had duplessis flowers in hand sued his forgiveness at any time she was not the woman to be stern that was not in her she was at once too sensitive to the flattery of the prayer and too generous to refuse it but at this particular time she felt very strong fresh from communion with her friend secure in him she felt equal to judging a dozen tristramsand to judging them leniently they know not what they do that was why she had smiled so wisely to herself on her way upstairs and it may have been why she wore some of his flowers in the waistband of her gown that night it was one of her most charming gowns too mousecoloured tulle in the belt of this she set crimson roses of tristrams offering she dined out and went on to a party duplessis was waiting for her at the foot of the stairs they went up together he had never yet taken possession of her in that manner and cannot be excused of brutality but he was quick to presume was not at all a good object for generosity her eyes had answered his inquiryforgiven before he touched her hand she had said of course and the rest followed as a matter of course he assumed from it his right to be offensive and her privilege to be unoffended she went upstairs by his side so far as he was concerned possessed to all intents and purposesunder his protection she did not know it then or even feel it her lightness of heart buoyed her up had she not been encouraged in adventure by the time they were well past their hostess at the door tristram had resumed this air of the vaguely irritated lion he looked grandly about him over headshis height gave him pretence what are we to do here all these peoplea wilderness of monkeys when a young man sure of welcome had come up on toetips to shake hands with mrs germainhad bowed prattled bowed and gone duplessis showed more than fatigue he had seen his crimson flowers at her belt and they bretrayed him i want to talk to you lets go and sit down somewhere it cant be here he spoke shortly as if he meant it she took his arm without question and he pushed a way through a couple of full rooms beyond these was a little boudoir beyond that a library empty she sat and he stood fidgeting with reviews on the table taking up and throwing aside like a child sick of toys and she sat softly there with castdown eyes waiting until he chose to remember her she was very conscious of his mood and not unsatisfied with it the whole thing was a game an adventure say and this a recognized move in it have your adventuresdont shirk them sincerity is the great matter be yourself whatever happens he had been plucking up the grass at her feet as he told her that and she had not been able to see his face though she had tried he spoke deliberately as if he was screwing the words out one by oneas if they ought to be said cost him what they might to say had they cost him anything ah if she could have known that butbe yourself whatever happens had she a self what was it was it that of a young woman whoof one of those women who like to be coveted are ready to be owned who indeed always are owned by one or another his servant or his maid his ox or his ass must she be property personal property ah but let her never forget that such as she was jack senhouse was to be her friendalwaysat the call of her need then she remembered the patteran and smiled to herself presently she looked up at tristram scowling over the deux mondes what are you going to do with me now i am here she asked him lightly whereupon he turned short and sat down near her what can i do with you whats possible what am i allowed to say i feel like a caged cat am i to pay you compliments ask you if alls well has it come to that i know what you would say if i did you are not happy its evident it was only in this mans company that she failed of selfpossession with men far greater than he such as kesteven with men defter than he men of the wing vein she could as it were hold the reins and feel the mouth with duplessis she was always liable to strike back upon former days at any moment had he but known it he could have put her so to speak into a white muslin frock turned her into the fluttered village coquette oddly enough with all his wits he had never known it until this moment he had always read her new position into her old ways but now it was too plain to mistake he had but to lift his hand and the discovery ran through his veins like a strong windto make him shiver she was looking down at her hands in her lap picking up her fan plumes one by one and running them between her fingers a latent trembling possessed her which he felt rather than saw the same fever caught him wheres germain he spoke masterfully her reply was studiously simple hell come for me byandby hes at the speakers dinner hes always somewhere else mischief prompted her to ask if he complained of that but he was not to be drawn if you were my wife he told her i should never leave your side if you were my wife i should be your lover always here was a lie obvious even to her but the devout imagination in it was enough to thrill her watching her closely he saw that she was thrilled youre not happy he said and im not happy you made a frightful mistakebut mine was worse it was hardly the moment to assure him that he was quite wrong if a gentleman does you the honour to discern misery even where none exists it proves attention at least to your circumstances its an oblique compliment she said gravely i dont think we ought to talk about such things i have never given you any reason to think me dissatisfied with oh he broke in were not considering the creature comforts i imagine you came here in a carriage from your big houseand youll go back to a big house in your carriage i can understand that these are pleasant arrangements and after two years of them for what they are worth you may well confuse them with the real thing but that a full cup nodding at the brim life together no world nobody in the world but two soulsours and work work together good god its ghastly to think of he looked haggard and there was a hollow ring in his voice the hoarseness of a consumptive her heart went out to him in pity and her hand was laid for a moment on his sleeve you are not wellyou work too hard please dont work he said i have none i wish i had ive quarrelled with jess i know im very sorry i wish that wethat i he suddenly and squarely faced her look here molly he said and made her heart beat and her eyes quail he and he only had called her molly you know whats the matter there has hardly been a day since youve been in town that i havent seen youive found out where you were to beand ive been too you possess my mind i think of nothing else cant sleep for thinking i believed that i should get over it and perhaps i should if i hadnt seen you again last autumn there was the mischief i vow to you i didnt want to come shouldnt have come if jess hadnt insisted a confounded ass it all began again thenand now i tell you fairly i shant get over it im not going to try its stronger than i and i believe that you care too i do believe that i know you do you wouldnt sit there so still if you didntyou wouldnt hide your eyes if you didnt you dare not show me how bright they are ah but i know how bright they can be and what makes them shine no no you and i belong oh dont dontplease dont the cry was wrung from her and the courage to look at him came but then as she turned her head away she said faintly you mustnt and made things ten times worse his next words beat her back i love you do you hear i adore youi care for nobody no rights or claims in the world i cant live without you if you wont listen to me if you drive me too hard i shallno no thats wicked molly ill do you no harm i swear to that but you and i have got to be together or i shall go mad now you know it all she rose and he with her both were shaking but she spoke first let me go now pleasetake me back i mustnt be found here he was ready ill take you away now im glad ive had it out with you now you know the facts at least she put her face in her hands its dreadful i ought not to have listened to you it was very wrong what are we to do love each other dearly said tristram and took her in his arms and kissed her she shuddered and shut her eyes but did not try to move her lips were parted there came a long sigh my darling my darling girl he said and kissed her again they heard steps and sprang apart her terror was manifest come he said we must get out of this she took his armshe looked as sleek as a stroked dove they went into the rooms without another word she was almost at once confronted with people whom she knew and duplessis left her with the first group she encountered she saw him shoulder his way through nodding to right and left in his grand careless way she saw him go out and knew that he would not come back engaged in the chatter usual to such times she talked at random laughed without knowing what amused her when she was told that mr germain had been seenwas here looking for her she gathered her wits at once and went to find him he was talking in his calm superior way to a great lady his court dress suited himhe looked like his ancestor sir william pictured in the diningroom at southover the great lady put up her glasses and smiled at mary here comes that pretty person youve given us how dye do my dear whats the secret of your bright eyes late hours agree with you its plain but this poor man of yours wants care yes indeed said she thankful of the turnoff mr germain made her a bow if you have come to take me away my dear i shall not deny you the pleasure the whole duty of a wife in the season is to take her husband from parties am i not right duchess my dear man said she i dont pretend to such privileges my husband has been in bed these two hours goodnight you happy pair now my dear when will you come to me the th of coursemy ball i trust you for that but do come in to luncheonpositively any day except tomorrow and thursdayoh and saturday saturday is hopeless she tapped marys cheek with her fanwhat a dawn colourand smiled herself onwards fat satiny and benevolent the germains gained their carriage and he was asleep before they were in carlosplace she sat absorbed gazing out of the window still under the spell of tristrams lovemaking she went to bedlay wideeyed in the dark for a while then sighed deeply and smiled and slept her last waking thought was sophistical he told me to have adventuresand to be myself and hes my friend whatever happens entrenched behind her philosopher she had no dreams viii adventure crowds adventure odd thing the rain nosed out by the man of weather came to pass but it delayed for a week or more which was time enough for many other prophecies to be fulfilled when however it did come it struck her imagination she awoke late from a night of deep sleep to hear it thudding on roof and balcony and to see when she looked out the heavy trees of berkeleysquare streaming like waterweed under a sluice here and there a cruising hansom thrashed a way through now and again a milkcart the butcherboys wore their baskets on their heads her first conscious thought was of senhouse barecrested to the wild weather it would be wild in the open and of course he was in the open on some wide common perhaps facing the gale with the rolling collar of his jersey flacking like ships cordage ah to be there with him sharing the joy of battle it was with a sense of suddenly leaving the wholesome great air for that of a hothouse that she turned to her breakfast tray and pile of letters she picked up the first of them the hand was tristrams a letter from him and a visit were now daily events a letter to him also must be written daily and somehow delivered this one was cavalier in tone sweethearti must see you if only to arrange how best we may meet what a storm last night but what a clear blue promise before us i shall be in the burlington arcadegardens endat noon come tr even she never yet free from her early subjection to him felt that this was not how lovers write to their sovereign ladies an assignationand in such a placeproposed to mrs germain she coloured high and clear he had done what she could never have believed possible he had really offended her nothing in the whole world could have persuaded her to go but byandby that sophistry which is ever at hand to clinch a womans argument the way she wants it to travel modified her view suggested a duty insolent arrogant exorbitant lover that he was he must be taught his place he should see her inaccessible he should see her cold profile as she drove by him without so much as a turn of the head perhaps then he would know that she was not a village girl at his disposal perhaps thus at least she reasonedand thus she did the brougham was ordered for a quarter to twelveshe kept it fifteen minutes and then gave the order bank her bank was that of england and stands in burlington gardens she had no real errand there but she feigned one a cheque was to be cashed the footman was to take itand even as she gave it him she saw tristram at the mouth of the arcadein an overcoat to his ankles his wet umbrella in his hand she sat rigid in her place wideeyed for events while looking at musterss careful back it was perfectly possible to see her lover at his post he was watching her intently she knew but he did not move he did not intend to go a step out of his way to meet her true he had walked to the arcadehe who lived in the albany a most cavalier lover this the game went on the minutes passed the footman came back with her money and waited for orders she named a shopa jewellers close by in vigostreet jinny middleham was to be married to a mr podmore a clergyman and must have a present how happily things turned out the cheque would serve the touch of musterss whip caused the hoofs to clatter on the asphalt the brougham lunged forward and swept her by the shameful trystingplace she peered sideways as she passed duplessis looking full upon her did not even lift his hat nor during the hour she spent fingering enamels rivires and rings did he appear at the shopdoor when she went by the arcade on her return he was not there she felt strongly the sensation of escape and was surprised to be so free from disappointment senhouse came back to his own place in her thoughtshe and the wind on the heath both good things but in the afternoon at about six oclock her cavalier was ushered into her drawingroom where she sat alone and stood by the door looking at her until the man had gone out then he crossed the room quickly came straight to her knelt took both her hands and kissed them he humbled himself she hardly knew him for the same man and he did the thing handsomely too named himself grievous things exalted her wouldnt hear of any excuse her generosity easily moved was all on his side in a few minutes she could not hear him accuse himself perhaps he had been thoughtless but she had had no right she said to be so angry finally she wouldnt listen if you go on talking so wildly she told him i shall begin to think you dont mean it and then he did explain it appeared that there had been reason in what he had proposed a certain delicacy taught him that he could not continue calling at the house after what had happened that could hardly fail to appease her his seeming insult then had really been intensely prompted by his fear of insulting her she considered this with hanging head mind you molly he went on being master of her hand i cant withdraw one word of what was forced out of me that night i cant wish undone one single act i adore you and i must tell you so i love you and must show my love here he kissed her the question is how and when am i to see you see you i must and will i wanted to talk to you about thatand how was i to do it would you have had me ask you to my rooms it did occur to her here that a better place could have been found since they met most nights in the week in somebodys house but she put the cavil by as unworthy since he was in her husbands house however not disturbed unduly by the delicacy which had troubled him overnight it would be as well to hear what he suggested im not going to be unreasonable he told her i shall settle down presently and things will jog along no doubt for a bit but at this moment when i have just won youafter two years molly after two yearsi must have you more or less alone for a few days upon my soul i think you owe me that he made her feel that she really did but he frightened her too she looked quickly into his face where he knelt gazing at hers you must tell me what you mean she said i dont understand alone for a few days that is surely impossible he explained with eagerness of course of course dont for gods sake misunderstand i would not ask you to do anything which would cause you discomfort heaven forbid i said more or less alone isnt that plain enough if i cant see you here it can only be at some of these infernal crowds we all flock toand how can we be sure of a moment there look here my dearest think of this plan i should like you to go and stay with your people for a bit that did sound feasible her quick mind jumped after his instantly my people she said wondering yes i should love to see them all again jinny my sister is going to be married i should have gone for that in any event yes of course i could go there if he poured out his plans she should go to blackheath at once and he would take her down leave her at the door he should take rooms in greenwich there was an hotel there not bad at all you looked over the river the shipping was magnificent every day he would meet her somewherethey would both be unknown every day they would spend together greenwich park the river they could sail to the nore round the mouse it would be heaven he said and then he pleadedhis love his misery his longing without you im a lost soul mary if im worth saving come and save me in the sight of heaven you were mine on the day i kissed you first do you remember when that was how long ago do you think i have forgotten it never never that kiss sealed you minemine for ever and what am i asking of you now a few days human companionshipa sop which you are to throw to a starving man havent you charity enough for that ah but i see that you haveyou cant hide it from me she could not he went on from strength to strength i save the proprieties by this plan i secure you absolutely from prying eyes and profane tongues you will have your people your mother to fall back upon if i could beif you could fear me scoundrel enoughmy beloved i wrong you to name such a thought you may disapprove of meyou may be hurtgod forgive me by things that i say do look they are things wrung from me by this throttling passionfor three years i have been gripped by the throat ah and it must end or be the end of me wellmolly look at me what will you tell me she did look at him thenfor one dewy moment pity kindness infinite wistfulness pridemingled in the fire melted and lay gleaming in her eyes wonderingly she searched his face ready to quail before the savagery she expected to read there but he was wiseshe could find nothing there but honesty frank and manly desire for he saw to it that she should not before she turned her head she had given him her hand he stooped and kissed it softly then went away before dinner she went to her husband in the library where he sat with his readinglamp bluebooks and spectacles come in he had called in answer to her knock but did not turn when she entered as she approached his desk approached his studious back she felt like a schoolgirl coming to ask if she might leave earlywith a fibbing reason for the teacher which disguised the secret fearful joy of the real reason the schoolgirl showed in every halting word in every flicker of the covering eyelids i was going to ask youwould you mind if i were to go to my people for a few dayssoon would you be able to spare me do you think he turned quickly hurt by her meekness my love of course can you ask me such things she could not afford tenderness from him just now she took a businesslike tone my sister is to be married shortly as you know there is a good deal to do i could help mother you know jinny is staying with mr podmores family he nodded approvingly quite so quite so it would be only kind you have engagements no doubtbut nothing pressing i suppose have we not people here by the way not until the th this is the th yes yes my dear make whatever arrangements suit you when do you think of going i thought the day after tomorrow but well my love i should not care to go if i thoughtthat you might want me he turned to his desk want you he said under his breath want you so careful was he that she could never have guessed the bitterness of that soft cry but she lingered yet of courseit is quite close to town you could writeor telegraphi could come in a moment yes my dear one yes he said his face averted it would be easy enough but i am not likely to disturb you in your happiness this would never do it would be my duty to come he groaned oh my dearest spare me she must misconstrue that or she must fail she must gulp it down and she didbut it turned her sick thank you she said staidly then i will write to mother her fingers were within an inch of his shoulder they hovered over almost touched it then she went he covered his face with his hands i think he prayed ix the patteran as she lay watchful in her bed the night before her escapade she vowed that she had no love for tristram none whatever at the same moment she protested with a cry that she had none for her husband either indeed it was rather the other way surely surely she was entitled to resentment against that poor gentleman for what reason under heaven had he broken in upon her laborious days if now that he had her she was to be no more to him than a figure at his table was this the whole duty of wives she knew better than that nay then had wives no rights was she bought to be a nun she declared to herself that she would be willing should that enable her to help him in his work but she knew that nothing would enable her she had insight enough into character to read what manner of man he was he can tell me nothingnothing and the more he needs me the less he can say so if i went to him on my knees and begged him to be open with me he would shrivel before my face no no he must be for ever bestowing favourshe loves to be the benefactorand thats all he loves if he could pity me he would love me againin his way but and she clenched her little hands and stiffened her armshe shall never pity menever and then she blushed all over to feel how she had crept to him to ask his leave of absence and how she had cowered there with drooping eyelids too heavy to be raised alas and how she had fibbed a thought of tristram here of his kisses and strong arms about her made her heart beat the wild joy of being possessed by so fine a creature was not to be denied once you blinked the truth that in the very act of taking possession he would despise you for suffering it that had to be blinked though whatever she might have become by right of marriage by intercourse with tristrams own world by familiarity with its waysto tristram she was still a little governess sent into this world to be kissed and fondledbut no possible companion for a gentleman or man of parts formerly if she had felt this she had accepted it but nowwell it had to be blinked mary was no fool she knew quite well that she had learned the ways of the great she knew that she was a success she had been clever enough from the beginning to see that safety lay only in being absolutely herself while she had gone in and out of misperton brand from schoolhouse to church and back she had turned her eyes and earsall her sensesupon these lords of the earth who were lords without effort her cantacutes james germains and their friendsevery gesture of theirs had been a study to her by instinct she had bored into the very marrow of these people they alone in the world could afford to be themselves and directly she could afford it she put that into practicewith success as she knew very well tristram duplessis however would have none of that ignored it he was entirely himself too and never allowed her to forget that she was his inferior every look he gave her was in its way an insult implied you are mine my dear for the picking up she knew that she ought to be offendedbut she was not offended she knew that such a homage as his was not flatteringand yet she was flattered by it then why should she run away from what pleased her as she asked herself this question to which the answer had been so easy a little while before she found herself now echoing more faintly her why indeed was not love a necessity to women was she to have none of it was she to be an unwedded wife for ever and unloved what had her friend told her that wonderful day in the park when it had seemed the scales fell from her eyes and she saw men and women where before she had seen herds dressed by the milliner and marshalled by the police love he had said is a real thingone of the few real things we have and it has been turned by the lawyers into a means of securing real property its bad enough that women should lend themselves to that but worse things are done in loves name i believe well then if tristram loved her in his way was she not justified in giving him what she had left to give at that moment she felt his arms about her his breath upon her cheeks yes yes he loved herhe had always loved her let come what might of that she turned on the light and left her bed she sat at her writingtable and scribbled a few words on a sheeti am going to blackheath tomorrowby train i shall leave charingcross at she put that in an envelope wrote his name and address stamped it now what was the time two oclock it could still be posted so that he would get it at eight dressing gown slippers a hasty twist to her hair a cloak and hoodshe opened her door noiselessly and crept downstairs she was some time unfastening the front doortime enough to cool time enough to decide with a leaden heart that she had no love for tristram the keen pale air tempered her still further be yourself she had been told and sincerity is the whole matter insincerity there lay the sin she had to go to the corner of the square to the pillarbox but not a soul was in sight it could be done gathering her cloak about her she ventured out and walked tiptoe forward with eyes all astare for a policeman or late cab the houses seemed made of eyes there was not a blind window but had a witness in it mocking leering incredulous curious heavily reproving she dragged before them her load of shame oh that it should have come to this that she was a spectacle for all londons reproach but she sped onwards on light feet her letter in her hand where hillstreet broadens into the square stands a great lamp the centre as it were of a pool of light there had been a storm of wind and rain in the early part of that night and the surface of the road was fretted with gleaming reflections where mud and water had been blown up into billows as she stood for a second or two by the pillarbox her letter not yet posted her eyes painfully acute fell upon this wide dimpled and cresseted bay and although her mind was disturbed took some sort of interest in the effect following the light inwards she found her looks arrested by something elsea torn spray of a tree blown no doubt from one of the planes in the square gardenwhich lay by the pillarbox almost at her feet it was about eighteen inches long bent in the midst and pointed to the north strictly it pointed northwest immediately she remembered the patteran which senhouse had explained to her wonderful thingif he had passed this way while she was contending with her sin and had laid this sure sign in the road to show her where he was to be found it pointed to the northno to the northwest that seemed to make a certainty of it her heart beat high and the flood of happiness rose within her until she seemed to be bathed in it to the chin she stood alone in that great glaring emptiness unconscious of everything but her triumphant release from bondage to the northsafety was in the north comradeship health freedom to breathe and move her limbs smiling to herself she dropped her letter into the pillarbox picked up the patteran and returned swiftly to the house to bed and to happy sleep absolved she was absolved in the morning she arose with the feeling of elation one has at the opening of an honest adventure the day is before you the world lies mapped out you are not to failyou cannot she dressed breakfasted and read her letters there was one from tristram which she had not even the curiosity to open she lit the corner of it at the spiritlamp and held it daintily out while it curled and blackened under the flame and dropped in charred flakes into the slop basin ghosts of words in silver characters flickered as they perishedshe saw homage hearts queen kiss and my arms she wrote to her mother at blackheath that she was unexpectedly delayed but hoped to come soon she would write again she said or send a telegram meantime a trunk would arrive and might wait for her at eleven she asked if mr germain was up and being told that he was went in to see him if he had been in the mood to notice anything but his own troubles he must have remarked upon her altered habit she was radiantly well selfpossessed and cool she kissed his forehead lightly asked how he had slept and then told him that she was lunching out and should have her luggage sent down to blackheath she had given orders to her maid and should not want the carriage mr germain listened heavily fingering a bluebook and a pencil he made no inquiries had no suggestions to offer she anticipated what he might have had to say as to an approaching visit of the james germains by telling him that all arrangements had been madeand then she said i wont disturb you again i know that you are very busy yes yes he said my work presses upon me he sighed and then asked with studied politeness you go today she laughed ive just been telling you about it she stooped and kissed his forehead again goodbye she said ill write of courseif youll promise to read what i send you he caught his breath and shut his eyes tightly as if something hurt him but he did not move from his chair nor did he once seek to meet her eyes she could see that he was deeply depressed but felt no pity for him just then her youth was too strong within her her adventure too near and her freedom too certain yet she hovered above him looking down at him drooped in his chair quivering over him as it were like some gossamer insect newdawning to the sun a word a sigh a look would have netted her in but nothing came he sat stonily astare his face hidden by his handthe other keeping his page in the bluebook looking down as from the battlements of heaven an archangel might survey the earth she touched his shoulder with her fingertips and was gone in reasoning it all out or rather in flashing her instinct upon eventsfor that was her wayshe knew that senhouse could not himself have laid the patteran for her guidance none the less she was sure it was intended for her and that it pointed truly to where he was it was june he would be in cumberland wastwater would find him he had said her plan as she worked it out was to take train to kendal and inquire this she did while her trunk and dressingcase were being delivered at heath view and while duplessis was biting his nails under the clock at charing cross station she was being carried smoothly to the north snugly in a corner of a thirdclass carriage her cheek to the windowpane and her bright unwinking eyes watching the landscape as it rushed up to meet her the villa gardens and hedgerows of herts the broad leicestershire cornfields bletchley with its spire rugby crewe then the dark over all but scarcely for a moment did her eyes leave the nearing north she arrived at kendal at midnight and had some tea then she found the ladies waitingroom lay on the sofa and slept x the brothers touch bottom the james germains paid a visit to hillstreet in june it was most unfortunate that it was so wet but the time was otherwise convenient since mary was away on a visit to her people this was how mrs james put itshe was never remarkable for tact nor did she care to be surely she would say openness is best mary once departed then mrs james was installed the very next day the rector followed her from the first he did not like his brothers looks john he thought was ailingailing and ageing he showed an unwholesome white in the cheeks a flabby quality in the flesh poor appetite low spirits vitality was low he was feeble he ate hardly anything and betrayed a tendency to fall asleep in pauses of the conversation yet he talked in flashes during dinner of his projects with something of the old hopefulness he had lately been asking a series of questions agricultural questions somewhat carefully framed he had pressed the minister in charge of such matter he was not without hope that some good might result then a deputation of tenantfarmers had been talked of he should not be unwilling to introduce that it was very characteristic of him to talk negatively the rector used to trace it to a scots ancestressa forbes of lochgour but he owned to being wearyalas that a legislator should admit that in june and said that he looked forward to the recess like any schoolboy mrs james who loved plans asked him his he had none it seemed time has pressed upon us both of late my work and her dissipations but i must talk it over with mary so soon as she returns her wishes must carry weight with me i should delight in showing her switzerlandor norway you would not perhaps delight in the thousands of people doing the same thing here was mrs james with her challenging note the rector marked with concern that john let it go she inquired whether he would resume his visits to misperton brand the cantacutes often speak of you she told him and then remembered that of course he saw the cantacutes here in town he bowed his head then you know of course that tristrams affairif it ever was an affairwith hertha is quite at an end nomr germain had not known that i see very little of tristram he told her and resumed the question of holidaymaking mary had great leanings to cornwall she had been attracted to it upon her first visit had often talked of it and lately had seemed to prefer it to switzerland she would like to be there later in the year spoke of november as a good month i cannot say that it agrees with me he added a languid relaxing airand in november to my mind a visit to the lands end in november would be the act of a suicide but mary is young and strong and her wishes are naturally mineand her pleasures also her pleasures also if he sighed he was not aware of it a silence fell upon the table which became painful to two of the three though not to be broken the rector plunged back into politics they tell me at the clubs that lord craye leaves india but it would not do mrs james had the good taste to rise the carriage was ordered at to take her to a party when she had gone the brothers sat without speaking for some minutes the rector drank his claret john germain was in a brooding stare the younger broke the silence dear old boy i wish that we could have stopped up a few more daysbut the diocesan inspector cant be put off i tried him with my silkiesthes inexorableadamant and then theres constantia with a bazaar on her conscience a bazaarin july john germain did not lift his head from the hand that propped it my dear fellow i understand you perfectly we all have our duties we must all face them whatever it cost whatever it cost us the rector looked keenly at him you are not yourself johnthats as clear as day i do wish that mary had not left you it was not like her she should have known his goaded brother sat up sharplylike one who lifts his gory head from the press of battle descrying fresh foes mary wished to go i could not deny her indeed i wished it also her parents are alone and she is useful to them i believe nay i am sure that she is happy there your belief said the rector is as pious as the fact and as rare the fashion of the day is for children to tolerate their parents the cry is you brought us into the world monsieur et dame yes and thank you for nothing thank god mary hasnt caught that trick but i do think that if she is needed here a hint from you but i will give her no such hints germain said fiercely i am not so selfengrossed i am inured to a solitary life and she is not i remember her youth i remember her activity one would have thought that london in june the rector began and was checked at once germain said shortly that the activity excited by london in june was not wholesome she is better there than here he added and snapped his lips together james germain having raised his eyebrows at this oracle immediately lowered them again and his eyes with them after a pause he spoke more intimately feeling his way along a dark surmised passage i believe you to mean that all this whirl is very new to her and overexciting must you not be patient must you not lead accustom her to it by degrees you know what i think of mary and that i have followed her steps with interest you have told me how bravely she held her own in the country and you arent likely to forget that she had two years in which to do it you speak of our dutiesmeaning i take it your own among others well where do these lie these duties where we find ourselves or where we may choose to put ourselves you may tell me that public life is in a sense your sphereand so it is i grant you but when you entered marys little sphereas you did something of the suddenesthad you not then to inquire whether that could be made elastic enough to include your own surely you had this parliamentary career of yours now nobody is more naturally at westminster than yourself thats of course i wish there were more like you men of sober judgment weighted with their private responsibilities upon my conscience parliament seems a place for buccaneering nowadaysa high sea i rejoiced i say when you stood up but whether you could fairly ask a girl of marys training to take over such work with youby your side here john germain held up his hand one moment you are right james i could not i acted for the best so far as i could see my way i listened to my hopes it was important that i should do something to interest her inin our life together there were reasons serious reasons into which i cannot now enter her life at southover she was not happy she was not contented she could not be james had now nothing to say he frowned to conceal his pain john spoke on slowly as if labouring both words and breath i have failed heri have failed her and since thati have held out my hands tried to speak i am dumb before her youth and eager life i love her dearly i need herbut she cannot know it will never know it experience is what she cries for not of the mouth but of the heart and blood i have no blood to give her and my heart is in a cage he spoke calmly with the icy breath of despair upon his mouth but it was to be seen that his thin frame trembled a barrier grew up between us not made with hands fate made her speak when i was at my lowest it called me to listen when she was made strong by need since then she has respected me through fear loved me by duty i should have charmed her fears away made love her food alas you know that i have failedfrom the very first what could the other say what could he do but bow his head i have endeavoured not to be selfish in this serious matter it would have been easy for me to have kept her in the country a plausible thingit was implied when i took her but i was not able to do that the idea of the sacrifice of one so salient and strong so welldisposed with so much charm was abhorrent to me deliberately knowing full well what risks i ran i chose for this parliamentary work and now i have under my eyes the result which i fearedthe snares are all about her she cannot walk without danger and i must watch and be dumb he sat bitterly silent for a while then his eyes flamed and he struck the table with his closed hand nobody shall take her from me there is a point beyond which i cannot go she is mine in all duty and conscience i am vowed to protect her and i will do itboth now and hereafter where she is now she is safe from the dastardly designs which beset her here her father will protect her her fathers house when she returns i must take some stepsi must consider my plansi have time enough on this i am utterly resolved that i will rescue her soul from destruction my darling from the lions from the power of the dog his voice broke he could say no more but his face was white and stern james germain had no help for him xi of mary in the north she had followed out senhouses precepts as nearly to the letter as might be neither staff nor scrip had sheno luggage at all and very little money in her exalted mood of resolve it had seemed a flouting of providence to palter with the ideal to follow the patteran unerringlya birds flight to the northone could only fail by hesitation time and the pressure of that alone had insisted on the railway the road no doubt had been the letter of the law perhaps too a map was another compromise but she found one in the station where having made full use of its water hairbrushes and lookingglass she dallied in the gay morning lighthovering tremulous on the brink of the unknown it showed her wastwaterwhere he had told her he was always to be found and it showed her kendal too dim leagues of mountain and moor apart a loitering lampman entered into conversation with her he was a langdaler he told her used to walk over once a week to see the old folks and there was another call he had thither it seems there was a ladyhis young lady who took it hard if he missed his day he spoke profoundly of rossett gill and green tongue of angle tarn and great end and of the shelter under esk hause which many a man had been thankful of before today he advised the train to windermere the coach to ambleside thence said he you would get another coach to the langdales and there the road stops and you must take to shankss mare here he looked her up and down not disapprovingly yons a rough road for you he considered and the track none so sure where the ground is soft but youll do it yet said he and im thinking therell be looking for ye out of wastwater she blushed and denied then hes a fule said the lampman his final warning was that she should inquire at the hotel before she started off to walk she promised and went into the town for a breakfast fold within fold height above height wood and rock and water the hillcountry opened to her and took her in when she changed coaches at ambleside she was driven into the arms of the west wind and could feel that every mile brought her nearer to her friend before the end of this sunlit day she would be face to face with the one being in all this world who might know if he would every secret of her heart as she thought this she pondered it every secret of her heart might he then know all yesand she could tell herself so without a blusheven to that which she dared not confess to herself even to that he might know them all she was in great spirits and there were those in her company upon the coach who could have commerced with her by way of exchange or barter but though her eyes sparkled and her parted lips were dewy she had no looks for gallant youth she faced the northwest and never turned her face the horses drew up and stretched their necks for water and the nosebag the passengers tumbled into the inn for luncheon mary faltering no more struck out along the valley up mickleden for the sheepfold and rossett gill the coachman had told her that this road could not be mistook her trouble would begin from the gill follow the beck he said to angle tarnthat on your left handand over the pass make you then for the gap betwixt great end and hanging knott esk hause we call ita lonesome place you shall not turn to right or left if you mind me due norwest lies your road down and up again to the sprinkling tarn maybe youll find a shepherd there tis a place to want company in they tell me you should strike the styhead pass near byif youre in lucks way at starting she felt that she was springs in her heels music in her heart up the broad valley over rocks and tufted fern beside clearrunning water she sped her way until under the frowning steep of the pikes she began to climb here she had needed both patience and breath but being alone with all this mountain glory she must frolic and spend herself she took off boots and stockings and cooled her feet in water and moss she crossed the beck and recrossed it picked a knot of harebells for her belt stooped to drink out of clear fountains rested supine in deep heather fanned herself with fronded fern watched the clouds the birds bared her arms to the shoulder and plunged them after trout she played with her prospect and had never been so happy in her life at five oclock biscuits and chocolate and instead of being by sprinkling tarn she was not yet at esk hause it was here that she misgave herself and for a moment knew the wild horror of the solitude man is not made for the fells pan haunts them and the fear of him gripes the heart suddenly and turns man to stone the sun sloping had hidden himself beyond great end the world looked dun and sinisterestranged from her and her little joys and hopes she stood on a trackless moorland encompassed by mighty hills the black earth oozed black water where she trod right over against her stood a mass of tumbled rock spiked at the top as with knives she was to go neither right nor left she had been told but which was right and which left by now when she had roamed broadcast and at random a few times the knowledge that she was intensely alone braced her against her nerves she beat back panic and considered what had best be done here stood the shelter a rude circle of stones breasthigh within was a seat half hidden in tall fern and foxgloves until she knew her road more certainly she would not leave that refuge from the night wind but at the thought of night coming down and finding her here alone with bat and crying bird made her shiver with the shelter then always in her eye she explored the tableland where now she was on all sides the walking was rough and boggy she was near being mired more than once fatigue settled down upon her as her spirits fell dead despair rose up in their place and drove her to frantic efforts she climbed heights which could give her no helping prospectsince all was alike to her one intricate puzzle of darkening purple valleys and clouded peaks and here the darkness came down like a fog and found her still she huddled closely into her cloak and sat in the shelter while fear reproach and doubts of which she would never have dreamed drove howling over the fieldlike the warring women of the rheinfels scenting havoc from afar off who or whose likes we suppose people the uplands in the nighttime while men and women in the valleys sleep with their children about them at nine oclock it was dusk but not dark she heard quite suddenly and with distinctness a child crying boohoo boohooa merry note there was no doubt that it was silver music to her a child crying and not far away she left the shelter immediately her heart clamative for this blessed solace it led her further than she had expected directly away from the shelter to the edge of the moorland and down hill among rocks and boulders she knew that she could not find her way back knew that she had risked everything stopping with her heart beating fast she listened for the sobbing wail caught it again more clearly than before and went down after it the descent became steep and she very hot but now the scent also was hot and she in full cry presently it struck upon her close at hand boohoo boohoo dont cry she called out clearly im comingdont cry the wailing stopped but not the snivelling by whose sound she was led she peeped round a great buttress of rock and saw a barefoot boy his face in his arm crying pitifully she ran forward and knelt by himwhat is it tell me what the matter is he showed neither surprise nor alarmhe was beyond that stagebut as she continued to coax him put her arm round his neck and tried to draw him to her he turned up presently his bedabbled face and gave her to understand that he was lost and hungry mary laughed for joy here was one in worse case than she but so am i my dear she told him were lost together its not half so bad when there are two of us you know and ive still got some food left now dry your eyes and come and sit by meand well see what we shall see he had a pinched pale face freckled and a shock of sandy hair which tumbled about his eyes so far as could be seen he had no shirt but he was company and morehe was poorerhearted than herself the mother in all women awoke in her here was a child to be nursed he came to her without preface and sat by her side she did not scruple to wipe his eyes and mouth with her handkerchief she embraced him with her arms snuggled him to her and fed him with chocolate and biscuits he seemed hungry but more frightened than hungry and more tired than either for when he had finished what she first gave him he lay still within her arm for some time with his head against her bosom presently she found that he was simply asleep happier than she had been for some hours she let him lie as he was until presently she also felt drowsy then she laid him gently down in the brake took off her hat and lay beside the lad the cloak covered them both in two minutes she was asleep he awoke her in the small grey hours by stretching in his sleep and then by a sudden movement flinging his arm over her and drawing himself close she took him in her arms and held him fast he was still deeply asleep she could hear his regular breath and feel it too poor dear she whispered sleep soundly while you can then she kissed him and herself slept again a sense of the full light of the warmth of the sun upon her added to the drowsy comfort of the hours between sleep and waking the boy was still fast and she hardly conscious when some shadow between her and the comfort in which she lay basking caused her to open her eyes above her looking down upon her quietly amused stood senhouse holding his horse by the bridle the long white sweater the loose flannel trousers bare feet bare headbut he might have been an angel robed in light she sat up blushing and mistyeyed it is you you have come in my sleep i have been two days looking for you the extraordinary comfort she had always felt in the mans presence was upon her immediately nothing to explain nothing to extenuate nothing to hidewhat a priceless possession such a friend two days he said you might easily have been two monthsor two years for that matter but you have made a mighty good shot my camp is not six hundred yards away ill show you but whos your sleeping friend she looked down at the lad whose face was buried deep in bracken she put her hand on his hair i dont knowsome poor boy i heard him crying last night when i had completely lost myself and followed the sound we comforted each other he gave me a good night anyhow we kept each other warm but i know no more of him than that well find out where he belongs to when he wakes he wants food mostly i think and then she laughed in his faceand so do i i believe of course you do said senhouse come along and well breakfast ive just been out capturing the ghost he had wandered far the old beggar mary jumped up what are we to do with the boy oh hell sleep for an hour yet well fetch him when his grubs ready you must help me you know now youre here of course she said and walked by him carrying her hat in her hand are you surprised to see me she must needs ask him senhouse raised his eyebrows noi wont say that i should like to know why you came though no trouble i hope she looked at him radiant no trouble now i saw your trailyour patteranin london he started no indeed you did not i havent been near london since i saw you there i came straight here by train but ill tell you a curious thing three nights ago i dreamed of you her eyes shone tell me your dream but he would not and she could not make him past sprinkling tarn and by the pass which hangs round about the great gable he led her to a green plateau high above the track where she could see the tent bingo stood up and barked a welcome short and sharp then he came scrambling down the scree to meet her knew her again immediately and was profusely happy to see her it was all like coming home for the holidays she turned her glowing face to senhouse and her brimming eyes oh why are you so good to me you two she asked him with bingos head and forequarters in her lap why not said senhouse xii colloquy in the hills by the time the coffee was made and the porridge and mary had emerged from the tent washed and brushed and sparkling she bethought her of the boy ill fetch him she told senhouse he must be fed senhouse nodded so she went back to her gte of the night the boy had disappeared and with him her cloak senhouse chuckled when he heard her faltered tale nature all overbless her free way he said shell lap you like a motherand stare you down for a trespasser within the hour she takes her profit where she finds it and if she cant find it will cry herself to sleep dont you see that you were so much to the good for our friend well what have you to regret you warmed him cuddled him fed himand hes gone warmed cuddled and fed youve been the bona deaand hes not a bit obliged to you very likely he thinks you were a fool perhaps you were my dear but i tell you fools are the salt of the earth yes i know mary said of course i dont mind the cloak he wanted it more than i did but what will become of himpoor little pinched boy senhouse picked up a bleached leaf of rowana gossamer leafand showed it to her what will become of that think you it all goes back again nothing is lost he threw it up and watched it drift away on the light morning wind then come and have your breakfast he bade her as they ate and drank she found herself talking to him of matters which london might have shrieked to hear but it seemed not at all strange that senhouse should listen calmly or she candidly discuss them he had not shown the least curiosity either to find her here or to know why she had come in fact after his question of no trouble i hope and her reply he had become absorbed in what he had to do that daythe meal to be prepared and the plantation of mariposa lilies which he was to show her the work of three yearsjust in flower for the first time youre lucky in the time of your visitanother week and you would have missed them but her need to speak was imperious and so she gave him to understand she told him therefore everything which had been implied in former colloquiesand found him prepared to believe her indeed he told her fairly that when he had first heard from her that she was to marry john germain he recognized that she would not be married at all mind you he went on that need not have mattered a bit if the good man had had any other career to open to you it was a question of that you might have been his secretary or his confidante or his conscience or his housekeeper but hes so damned selfcontainedif youll forgive me for saying thatthat he and the likes of him start in life filled up with everything except nature there was really nothing for you to be to him except an object of charity nor did he want you to be anything else he actually bought you dont you see so that he might do his benevolence comfortably at home you were to be beneficiary and admiring bystander at once and you must have made him extremely happy until you began to make use of his bounties and learn by what you had to do without them where was he then its like a mother with a sucking child she makes it strong makes a man of it and then when it leaves her lap and goes to forage for itself she resents it what else could she expect what else could germain expect he gives you the uses of the world you find out that you are a woman with parts you proceed to exercise yourselfand affront him mortally ill warrant that man quivering all over with mortificationbut i am sure he will die sooner than let you know it her eyes shone bright yes thats true he is like that well but senhouse went on speaking between pulls at his pipe he did not look at her he looked at his sandalled feet i may be wrong but i do not see what you owe him that has not been at his disposal any day these two years and a half i suppose indeed that the blessed law would relieve youbut by process so abominable and disgusting that a person who would seek that way of escape would be hardly fit to be let loose on the world that being so what are you to do the fact is germains not sane one who misreads himself so fatally so much at anothers expense is not sane then i say the worlds before you if you have courage enough to face the policeman he cant touch you you know but he can stare you up and down and make you feel mean then he looked at her kindly but coollyas if to ask well what do you make of that and if he saw what was behind her hot cheeks and lit eyes he did not betray the knowledge she could herself hardly see him for the mist and hardly trust herself to speak for the trembling which possessed her oh i would dare any scorn in the world and face any hardships if but she bit her lip at that point and looked away he saw tears hover at her eyes brink presently he asked her what brought you up here to see me and she almost betrayed herself do you ask me that her heart was like to choke her well said he yes i do she schooled herselflooked down and smoothed out the creases in her skirt theres some onewho wants me i cant doubt it well she spoke fast he haswanted me for a long timesince before i was married perhaps i have given him reasoni didnt mean to do thatbut certainly he used to think that i belonged to him i was very ignorant in those days and very stupidand he took notice of me and i was pleasedso he did have some reason i think well it all began again last yearimperceptibly i couldnt tell you how and now he thinks that i still belong to himand when i am with him i feel that i do but not when i am away from him or alone i am sure that he does not love me i know that i dont love him i feel humiliated by such a courtship really he insults me by his very look and so he always did only i couldnt see it formerly but now i do i desire never to see him againindeed i dare not see him because if i do i know what must happen he is stronger than i he is very strong i know i know very well that he could make me love him if i let him you have no conceptionhow could you have you dont know what a woman feels when she iswhen such a man as thatmakes her love him despair but i must notno no i would sooner die i could never lift up my head again slavery she shuddered and shut her eyes then turned quickly to senhouse oh dear friend i came to you because i was nearly lost one night i had all but promised i saw your sign in the roador thought that i didjust in time just in the nick of time and when i saw it though i had my letter to him in my hand telling him where to find me the next daydo you know i felt so strong and splendidly free that i posted the letter to himand came straight here without any checkand found you ah she said straining her two hands together at the full stretch of her arms ah i did well that time because that very night when i was fighting for my life you were dreaming of me if senhouse had looked at her now he would have seen what was the matter with her but he was sunk in his thoughts this fellow he said broodingly this fellowduplessis i suppose yes i used to know duplessisat cambridge and ive seen him since hes not much good you know she was looking now at her hands in her lap twisting her fingers about suddenly bashful but i think senhouse went on in a level voice i think you had better go back and face him she started she looked at him full of alarm oh dont tell me to do thati implore you let me stay here a little while until im stronger he smiled but shook his head no no too unconventional altogether really i mean what i say if you are to be free you must fight yourself free theres no other way fight germain if it is worth your while but fight duplessis at all events that is essential bless you you have only to tell him the truth and the things done she was very serious i assure you it is not he wont care for the truth he wont care what i tell himno dont ask me to do that its notkind of you senhouse got up lets go and look at my lilies he said well talk about your troubles again presently she jumped to her feet and followed him down the mountain he led her by a scrambling path round the face of great gable and so past kirkfell foot into mosedale bright as emerald as they neared the mountains he showed her by name the pillar steeple and red pike windy gap and black sail high on the southern face of the pillar there was he said a plateau which none knew of but he to reach it was a halfhours walk for her but he encouraged her with voice and hand there he could tell her at last now she was to look before her they stood on a shelf which sloped gently to the south mary caught her breath in wonder and gave a little shriek of delight oh how exquisite oh how gloriously beautiful a cloud of pale flowersviolet rose white golden yellowswayed and danced in the breeze each openhearted to the sun on stalks so slender that each bell seemed afloat in aira bubble of colour she thought she had never seen so lovely a thing senhouse peacefully absorbing her wonder and their beauty presently began to explain to her what he had done i had seen these perfect things in california growing in just such a place so when i lit on this plateau i never rested till i got what it was plainly made for full south you see sheltered on the east and north good drainage and a peaty bottom i had a hundred bulbs sent out and put them in three years ago no flowers until this year but theyve grown wellthere are nearly two hundred of them out now ive had to work at it though i covered them with bracken every autumn and kept the ground cleanand here they are with luck the tourists wont light on them until there are enough and to spare they are the worst i dont mind the natural history societies a bit they take two or three and publish the findbut i can stand that because nobody reads their publications the trippers take everythingor do worse theyll cut the lot to the groundflowers and leaves alike and you know you kill a bulb if you take its leaves it cant eat poor thingcant breathe now just look into one of those thingslook at that white one she was kneeling before the bevy and cupped the chosen in her two hands just look at those rings of colourflame purple black pale green can such a scheme as that be matched anywhere its beyond talk beyond dreams now tell me have i done a good thing or not she turned him a glowing face you ought to be very happy he laughed i am happy and so may you be when you please ah she looked ruefully askance i dont knowim not sure but if i am ever to be happy it will be by what you teach me my child said senhouse and put his hand on her shoulder look at these things welland then ask yourself is it worth while troubling about a chap like duplessis while god and the earth are making miracles of this sort every day somewhere thoughtful serious sobered she knelt on under his hand love between a man and a woman is just such a miraclejust as lovely and fragile a thing but theres no doubt about it when it comesand it ought not to be denied even if it can be when theres a doubt on either sidethe things not to be thought of loves not appetitelove is nature and appetite is not nature but a cursed sophistication produced by all sorts of things which we may classify for convenience as overeating fed horses in the morning well one of these days the real thing will open to youand then youll have no doubt and no fears either youll go about glorifying god he felt her tremble and instantly removed his touch from her shoulder he sat on the edge of the plateau with his feet dangling lets talk of real things he continued after a time not of feelings and symptoms this is one of my gardensbut i can show you some more above this plateau is anotherjust such another i filled it with xiphion iriswhat we call the english iris although the fact is that it grows in spain its done wellbut is nearly over now i just came in for the last week of it and of course ive got hepaticas and auriculas and those sort of things all over the placethis mountains an old haunt of mine but my biggest job in cumberland was a glade of larkspurs in a moraine of scawfell pike i surpassed myself there last year they were a sight to thank god fornine feet high some of them lifting up great fourfoot blue torches off a patch of emerald and gold i lay a whole morning in the sun looking at themand then i got up and worked like the devil till it was dark some brutal beanfeasters from manchester fell foul of them soon afterfell upon them tooth and claw trampled them out of sightand gave me three weeks hard work this spring but they have recovered wonderfully and if i have luck this year i shant fear even a glasgow holiday let loose on them she was caressing the flowers half kneeling half lying by them go on please she said when senhouse stopped tell me of some more gardens of yours he needed no pressing being full of his subject and crowded upon her his exploits with all england for a gardenplot to her inexperience it seemed like a fairy tale but to her kindling inclination all such wonders were fuel and he could tell her of nothing which did not go to enhancing the magic in himself peonies he told her of in a cornish cove opening to the seaa five years task and a niche on a dartmoor tor where he had coaxed caucasian irises to grow like wholesome weeds tamarisks like bushes afire in a sandy bight near bristoli made the cuttings myself from slips i got in the landeswistaria in a curtain on the outskirts of an oak wood in the new forest that had been his first essayten years ago you never saw such a sightthe trees look as if they were alightwrapped in mauve flames and never touched yetand been there ten years ive got the little tuscan tulipclusiana is its name a pointed curving bud it has striped red and whitegrowing well on a wooded shore in cornwall ive got hepaticas on a welsh mountain a pink cloud of themand pyrennean auriculas dropping like rosy wells from a crag on the pillar rock aint these things worth doing they are worth all chatsworth to me she caught his enthusiasm her burning face her throbbing heart were but flowers of his planting once more she was splendidly conscious of discovery of unsuspected distances seen from a height and once more exulted in the strength which such knowledge gave her no education could have bettered thisan interest in life itself in work itself all that day she laboured by his sidedigging weeding fetching and carrying in that sunny hollow of the hills she cooked his meals and waited upon him she grimed her hands scratched and blistered them tore her gown blowsed herself was tired but too happy to rest this this was life indeed towards dusk after dinner she was so tired that she could hardly keep her eyes open and senhouse who had been watching her with shrewd amusement bade her to bed the tent was at her disposal while she remained slowly she obeyed him unwillingly but without question the day was fading to a lovely close night as it were was drawing violet curtains over the dome of the sky the great hills were intensely dark and the valley between them and below lay shrouded in a light veil of mist it was so quiet that they could hear the lingmell beck crisping over the pebbles or swishing between the great boulders and once a fish leapt in a pool and the splash he made was like a smack on the cheek mary obeyed slowly she stood behind him where he sat watching all the still wonder of the dusk hoping he would speak afraid herself to break the spell of her own thoughts she was excited she felt the exquisite luxury of ease after toil if she had dared she would have indulged her quivering senses she could deceive herself no more she had no need in the world which senhouse could not satisfy and no chance of happiness unless he did but she respected him more than she loved him it never entered her head for a moment that it would be possible for her to draw such a man on still she stayed as if unable to leave him his mere neighbourhood was balm to her fever so they remained for some unmeasured time while the silence became crushing and the dark blotted out hill and hollow she could not hear her heart beating and the pulses in her temples in a manner she was rapt in an ecstasy she thought no more she was possessed her happiness was at the point of bliss senhouse sat on motionless he too absorbed in contemplationlike a priest before his altarmiracles he may not have known that she was so close to him or he may have known it very well if he did he showed no sign of it his thoughts whatever they were held him as he sat his chin between his clasped knees rigid as a dead viking crouched so in his tomb of stones his black glazed eyes were fixed sombrely towards the shrouded valleyacross it to the mountains beyond so at last when her pleasure became a pain so piercing that had it endured much longer she must have cried aloud she shivered as she clasped her hands together over her breastand then lightly let one fall to touch his shoulder she must needs speak to him now do you wish me to go he answered shortly it will be better yes you had better go very welli will but tomorrow am i to go home tomorrow i shall do exactly what you tell me you know that he did not move nor answer her immediately she hung upon his silence then he said im a man you knowand youre a woman theres no getting away from that and you wish me im a compromiseby my own act this is halfway house you may rest here you seeand go onor go back she could school her voice but not her hand which touched his shoulder she had to move it away before she spoke and if i decideto go on you must notuntil you know what it means some daypossiblywhen you seenot feelyour way it may be look here he said abruptly we wont talk about all this i told youin cold bloodwhat i thought you ought to do go back and see duplessis dont ask me to reconsider thatin hot blood im not myself at this time of night i saw straight enough when you put it to me i value your friendshipim proud of it more i must not say it is something to have made a woman like you trust me thats too good a thing to lose do you see and ill tell you this toothat you may trust me if you do as i tell you it will work out all right yes yesi believe that but you told me this morning to followmy heart i did my dear and i meant it but not what your heart calls out at midnight she stood where she was a little longer presently she sighed i will do as you bid mebecause you bid me and he laughed reason most womanish dont laugh at me just now she said he folded his arms tightly and stooped his head towards them i darent do anything else he told her and i will not in the dark she stretched out her hands to him but soon she gave over and gloried in the strength he had goodnight she said and he answered her without moving goodnight she stole away to his tent but he sat on where he was far into the night in the morning light they met as if nothing had happened and after breakfast he took her by wastwater to seascaleto the train for the south he was the old informal chatty companion full of queer knowledge and outspoken reflections he told her his plans so far as he could foresee them he should be going to cornwall in november then he put her in the train and touched her hand lightly as his way was he looked into her face and smiled half ruefully dont forget halfway house he told her she could only sob oh no oh never never he turned awaywaited for the train to movethen waved his hand as the train carried her under the arch and bent on its course she had her last glimpse he stood white and slim against the grey buildings she waved her hand and was carried onwards to the south xiii the summons she knew now that she loved senhouse and that knowledge filled her with indescribable triumph and gave her unimagined strength at the same time the quietude of her new joy really amazed her she could lie back in her corner seat of the train and watch her flight to the south be conscious that every thresh of the great driving wheels was taking her from her beloved reflect that she could neither write to him nor hear from himwanderer that he was and sojourner in tentsand regret nothing and long for nothing more tangible than she possessed already he had her heart she had made her surrender on that night of intense colloquy that had been her true bridal nightby that mysterious intercourse she had become his irrevocably a great security possessed her a conviction which it would have been blasphemous to question that all was well if one had told her you and he may never meet again she would have laughed in his face at the absurdity such a thing was not worth argument spelt its own refutation an immense content possessed her a security which excused her from looking back and made the future indifferent she thought neither of her husband with remorse nor of duplessis with apprehension she was not appalled by the flatness of her immediate prospect of a return to town and its round of flurry chatter and dress of southover and its autumn rites these things were shadows of life the real life was hidden in her heart she would send her trickedout body to dinnerparties and other assemblies of dolls while she herself would be elsewhere in some blue immensity of air breasting some great hill breathing the breathwhich was foodof her mother the earthher mother their mother she and her beloved were brother and sister entertainment here for the flying miles to which the threshing wheels lent processional music if she hardly knew herself it is no wonder she crossed london by rote reached blackheath walked sedately to her fathers little house entered the little dull door and kissed her parents whom she found at teaall in a dream they made much of her the great lady she was become found it not amiss that she appeared in tumbled gown with soiled blouse and hat remarkable for its unremarkableness great ladies could do as they pleased being a law unto themselves nor were they confused by her replies to the proper inquiries mr germain she said i think hes very well i havent seen him since i left london we dont see much of each other you know mother a stack of forwarded letters was indicated telegrams among them she nodded her head and passed her cup for some more tea she heard of the girls progressall out in good boarding schools of her providing next of jinnys triumphs in the lincolnshire home of the podmores jinny has a bold way with her as you know mary they were not inclined towards her at first there was a question whether she should not pack up her box again the day after she got therebut mr podmoreher mr podmorewent on his knees on his knees maryand she consented to stay very bold of jinny considering that old mr podmore is a rural dean mary smiled the simple talk went on byandby it came out that a visitor had called to see mary several timesa mr duplessis a very tall young man he came here the evening we had expected you and i thought the chimney was afire when i heard his knock exactly like the fire brigade i opened the door in a twitterand there he wassix feettwo of him and a tall hat atop of that is mrs germain at home he asks me and i say she may be for shes not here then he says you are mrs middleham i take it i tell him he takes me rightly dont you expect yourmrs germain i told him the truth ill call tomorrow he saysand he did mary and today too a handsome upstanding young manvery much at home with the likes of me i supposebut you know your own business best of course mary stroked her mothers cheek dear little old mother she said i know youre afraid for me mr duplessis is quite harmless ill see him if he comes tomorrow in the intervals of houseworkfor she insisted upon being usefulshe wrote to her husband from day to day telling him in her first letter that she had been unable to write before as she had been travelling on this particular information he made no comment whatsoever indeed he confined himself to such generalities as the state of the weather his cold which under medical advice i am nursing at home and the proceedings of mrs james constantia is a great comfort to me you will be pleased to hear that i am not without hope of inducing her to prolong her visit she speaks very kindly of you my brother i regret to say has been called home by parochial cares the cantacutes dined here last evening i regretted that i could not be down to receive them however constantia she replied pleasantly to all this feeling not one grain of discomfort out of anything which mrs james could or could not do she begged to be kept informed of his cold you know that i will come to you the moment you care to have me in answer to that by return of post he wrote that on no account must she alter her plans believe me i am fully contented that you should be with your parents it is i understand reckoned a failing of the past generation that children should admit any claim in them who bore and nurtured them personally i do not pretend to be abreast of the times in this particular nor should i wish you to be so i am assured that there is no cause for uneasiness on my account and will most certainly see that you are kept supplied with bulletins i beg my sincere respects to your father and mother after that she heard nothing more from him duplessis had called two days after her arrival but she had been out and he had not waited he came again after three days intervalhaving written to announce his intentionat oclock in the morning she was on her knees in pinnedup skirt and apron her arms bare to the elbows scrubbing the kitchen floor when his knock resounded through the house the quick blood leapt into her cheeks but she held to her task her mother came fluttering in thats your visitor mary what am i to doand you in such a state show him in here mother says mary never child hell think you demented mary was inflexible her eyes glittered i shall see him nowhere else she said upon his second attack a scared and serious mrs middleham opened the door mary pausing in her scrubbing heard the dialogue oh goodmorning mrs germain my daughter is here sir oh shes come has she do you think she would see me she says so sir i have asked her but she hopes you will excuse her untidiness oh of course she has been kind enough to help us hereshe is at work now you will please to overlook my dear mrs middleham if you will follow me i will show you where she is mary rose from her knees to receive him having wiped her hands and arms on her apron her cheeks were burning and her eyes alightbut she looked none the worse assuredly for that when duplessis stooping his fair head entered the kitchen she came forward lightly to receive him goodmorning she said you will take me as i am ill take you how i can said tristram shaking hands your mother prepared me for this attack of industry you might let me help you mary laughed dont destroy my mothers illusions she is convinced of the complete idleness of the upper classes if she lost that she would have to alter all her ideas of society i dont know anything about the upper classes but mrs middleham can have no notion how hard i can work duplessis said i was at it all last night dancing till heaven knows when ill warrant heaven does said mrs middleham to herself she was not able to find anything to say to this magnificent visitor duplessis and mary made a fairer show for she had learned to dread with the high world a single second of awkwardness she was even able to continue her work on her knees and chat with tristram who for his part sat calmly on the kitchen table and talked nineteen to the dozen it is difficult to say which side of this simple performance scandalized mrs middleham the morethat mary should be on her knees with a scrubbing brush or that duplessis should not be the good blunt woman sat it out as long as her endurance would last growing more and more stiff in the back primming her lips in and in until she showed none at all finally she rose with a you will excuse me and stalked out of her own kitchen she sat in the empty parlour and looked at a photograph album as a protest meanwhile marys hour had come it had been on the edge of her tongue to ask her mother to staybut she had dismissed the thought as unworthy she fixed her mind upon the plateau of mariposa lilies and her eyes on her work and scrubbed for life molly said duplessis why did you run away from me she elbowed her brush stoutly because i was afraid of you she saidthen stopped and looked up at him but im not nownot in the least afraid you need not be you wrote to me that you were coming on the th i know and this is the th and you are only just here no i have been here four or five days where were youwhen you were not here i was travelling travelling yes but i decline to be questioned you mean i suppose that you will decline to answer her colour rose you always correct my language i know my exact meaning is that i deny your right to question me about my own affairs but if they are my affairs too may i not know what you are doing with them she thought yesi suppose you may do that very well then i will ask you why you sent me word that you were to come here on the th by train and then did nothing of the sort on her knees still she faced him with her answer yes i will answer that when i wrote i intended to comeand expected that you would meet me but when i posted the letter i had changed my mind i did not intend to come he stared with very cold bright eyes you did not intend to come when you posted the letter pray did you intend me to expect you at the station she answered him yes i did expect it he raised his eyebrows really my dear friend you interest me extremely did you think that six hours or more at charing cross station would be good for my nerves morals or constitution i will tell you what i thought she said i thought that waiting at charing cross would be no worseto say the leastfor a man than an appointment in burlington arcade could be for a woman duplessis bit his cheek that was your gentle reproof then for my blunder yours was only a blunder because i saw what it really was it had never entered your head that i could be other than honoured to meet you anywhere you presumed that i should run there you ran very near to it my friend he said that is you had yourself driven she bowed her head i admit it i was a foolbut i am not a fool now no said duplessis you are not you are as a matter of truth extraordinarily beautiful just now and i am more ridiculously in love with you than ever but she rose from her knees and stood before him let me finish what i have to say to you please she said that was not my only reason for deceiving you i wished you to wait for me in vain because i wished you to understand that i could not see you any more i wished you to believe that our intercourse must be over i chose the harshest means i could think of i might have written it no doubt but you would have answered the letter and i am no match for you in writing i might have seen you and told youbut i couldnt do that molly said duplessis folding his arms why couldnt you see me she looked down because i couldnt it was because you dared not said duplessis she did not answer she was trembling a little now and he saw it but presently she looked him straight in the face yes she said that is true i did not dare he laughed gaily and started forward to take her but she put her hand up no she said you are mistaken i dared not then but now i dare i can meet you now whenever you please and have no fear at all duplessis red in the face scowled and watched her from under savage brows am i to understand by that that you have ceased to care you must understand that i do not love you he left the table where he had been sitting and took a turn about the room presently he stopped in front of her his height gave him great advantage i decline to take that answer i cannot believe that you mean it seriously i think that you loved me two nearly three years ago and that you have loved me of late since last octobersome nine months i know that i have never for a moment ceased to love you through your engagementhorrible entanglement as it wasthrough your years of married lifemiserable eclipsemy love has gone on my need has increased you know that you cannot doubt me it was not my doing that you were false to our love i couldnt interfere it was begun without my suspicion and all the mischief done before i could get home after that i did my honest best to get on without youand then your fool of a husband must drag me in what next the inevitable the undoubted we two were drawn together it had to be and now you ask me to believe thatfor no reason at allit must stop my dear girl you cant swap horses crossing the stream you know i decline to be switched off like so much electric current whos the other man this surprising turn to his speech nearly threw her off her pedestal but she could answer him truthfully there is no question of caprice or of other people at all the real truth is that i have grown wiser i know now that i was losing my selfrespect by permitting you to love me as you didin the manner you saw fit to use it was not love at allyou had got into the habit of considering me as your property and you could not bear that anybody else should claim a right to me directly i saw that i knew that i couldnt allow myself to think of you to be with youif i was to beif i could hope to hold up my head he was very angry may i know what or who enabled you to see this unfortunate aspect of my affairs i cant tell you that she said it came to me suddenly i think your asking me to meet you in such an extraordinary place had something to do with it i beg your pardon for that he said at once honestly and sincerely i am ashamed of that only it is fair to say that i meant no possible disrespect to you i couldnt well meet you in your own house the weather was beastlyi thought we could discuss our plansand might as well do it under a glass cover as under umbrellas we might have been there five minutes really i cant admit that the base is broad enough to hold all the superstructure it was nothing she admitted i was only offended for a momentand of course if i had still been nursery governess i should have gone without a question i should have been flattered i am sure butah surely you can be honest with yourself surely you know what it is you want of me why if i could bring myselfwould it be worthy of you to she broke off impatient at the hopelessness of convincing him mr duplessis she said and he frowned at the style i have been wicked i thinkat least i have been so foolish that i can hardly believe it was i i am sure you wont be so ungenerous as to pin me down to a mistake i beg you to take what i say nowas i mean it looking up at him she saw that she had made no way the more she said she could see the greater the fire in the man he stooped right over her and she could hear the fever in his voice my love my adorable lovei shall never give you upnevernever she cowered ah be merciful he said my mercy shall be my love and serviceand took her hands she strained awayshe turned her headno no she murmured i implore you but he drew her inmy belovedmy darling the street knocker clamoureda double calland as he started she sprang back to the wall and gained the door she went down the passage and met her mother with a telegram in her hand for you mary no bad news i hope mary read think it would be well if you could come todayconstantia germain she had not heard from hillstreet for three days yes certainly she must go mother i must go home immediately mr duplessis will take me ill tell him to wait she returned to the kitchen duplessis was biting his cheek leaning against the table with folded arms his breath was still quick mr duplessis said she i have had a telegram from homefrom mrs james my husband is ill and i must go to him will you take me please he jumped forward of course im very sorry ill do everything go and get readyill find a cab xiv vigil a shadow not hers which moved kept mary silently employed she was watching it she was not conscious of having spoken a single word from the moment of farewell to her mother until her arrival at hillstreet duplessis had accompanied her from door to door she cannot have been aware of it or she would have dismissed him at victoria not that he had been obtrusivefar otherwise he saw to everything and what conversation there had been he had made it she might have been grateful to him for all this had she observed it once only had a cry escaped her he is dying he will die thinking me wicked what shall i do he had answered her no he is a just man you have nothing you need fear to tell him he is dying she repeated her eyes fixed upon the dun waste of houses and chimneystacks duplessis could not doubt this it seemed as certain to him as to her he too discerned the moving shadow as he helped her out of the cab in hillstreet the carriage came quickly up and the rector of misperton in it he and she met on the pavement duplessis lifted his hat reentered the cab and departedseen therefore by the rector by musters and the carriagegroom and by the stately butler and his familiar at the open door she and james germain went up the steps without greeting as she went straightforward to the stairs she heard the rectors inquiry well greatorex and greatorexs reply the doctors are there sir there is no change she went lightly up the stair to the door of her husbands room she knocked lightly a nurse opened who is it please i dont think i am mrs germain i must come in mrs james the doctrine of the souls immortality lambent upon her features stood by the window talking in whispers to a great physician another equally imposing was by the bed his hand on the sick mans pulse at marys entry the lady broke away and came towards her the light of conflict was in her eyes tight upon her lips she was prepared for reproof in any formbut none came mary did not see her she walked past her on tiptoe to the edge of the bed and sat herself in a chair which stood there and looked at the shadow which was not her own it hovered now moved no more sir lambton tweedale his investigation ended joined his colleague by the window mary thought that he was dead he lay on his back with nearly closed eyes and she could discern no movement for breath his face was colourless and so frail so diaphanous did he look she thought that she could see the colour of his eyes through the lids a haunting thought he seemed to be watching her through them as if they were a thin veilto be reading her whether guilty or not of pity for him lying there so noble so patient and so fordone of awe before his remoteness from her lot his immortal indifference of remorse for what had been or a shudder for what might have beenshe had none but her eyes watched him intently with a new power in them a fierce and feverish lightas if she had the will and the means to draw the dead back to life for one halfhour only to fulfil one need he must hear her tell him her story and then he might die in peace one of the great pair came to where she sat on the watch and bowed mrs germain i think she nodded sharply without turning her eyes i couldwe couldhave wished that you had received earlier notice of this serious turn it seems to have been mr germains express desire that you should not be needlessly alarmed he was perfectly conscious and master of himself twentyfour hours ago but a great change took place yesterday afternoon it appears neither sir lambton nor myself can be held answerable for she stopped him by an impatient movement of her head do you think he isin danger undoubtedly it is right that you should know that it is serious he will die ah we must not say that she looked him through and through then he is not dead no no thank you that is all i want to know the learned pair went out together and mrs james with them the nurse remainedto drink her tea and hover she was very ready with whispers but mary sat with fixed intense eyes willing her husband to live and asked for no details byandby the rector came in on noiseless feet and stood by her between these two there had always been sympathy generosity on his part repaid with gratitude on hers but now she would not turn her head nor even when she felt his hand touch gently on her shoulder and stay there could she bring herself to acknowledge the kindly act he remained by her so for a long time then my child he said have you had any tea she shook her head no thank you i dont want any it could be brought you here no thank you you must be brave mary ah she knew that i must indeed she said remember please that i knew of this no sooner than you did she started she flushed what did this mean then was it possible that mrs jamesfor reasonsah and if it was did it matter did anything matter only one thingand that was of her provision she resumed her hungry patient watch the rector still stood by her his hand on her shoulder be patient my dear trust the future to the good god she said i do but he will not die yet i am sure ah my dear he began in his despair but she spoke on vehemently he cannothe will not he will know me again presentlyand speak to me that is necessary for us both we have things to talk about then he will die the rector shrank you talk strangely what do we know my dear old brother will you not come and restafter your he stopped there and she understood his reason im not at all tired she told him i shall sit here until he wakes and knows me i can rest here quite well i dont want any food or anything the rector urged her no more and presently left her she sat on through the dinnerhour the change of nurses motionless and absorbed once the patient stirred sighed muttered with his lips listening to him breathless herself she could now hear his breathso short and light it was that she must have overlooked it all these hours from this time onwards through the ministrations of the nightnurse through visits of the rector through ominous absence of visits from the rectors wife through the bustling entry of dr goodlake and his voluble explanationsdouble pneumoniaabsence of willeffortand the likeshe was in a fever of hope and anticipation waiting like one tense at the startingpost for the signal at midnight mr germain stirred and began to moan regularly hopelessly in a way to break your heart this too her certainty gave her the heart to endure such nourishment as he could be given set him wandering he spoke ramblinglyoften of hercited scripturemy darling from the lions she caught and the lion and the dragon shalt thou tread under thy feet once he cried aloud ha tell wilbraham i will not see him and again moaning no no it is untrueit cannot be true there followed a time of broken sleepat three oclock with a grey line of light between the curtains she saw his open eyes fixed earnestly upon her she was on her knees by the bed in a moment i am here she said do you know me his lips moved yes i was at home when i heard of your illnessbut i did not go home when i left you i went to the north to consult a friendabout myself do you hear me can you hear me again he sighed yes his eyes were fixed upon herswith interest she thoughtbut without any judgment the nightnurse discreetly left the room she asked his patience and plunged into her storyher story and his own with tristrams part interwoven there was one who used to see me was her way of bringing in duplessis and after that tristram was he throughout she would not use his name felt she could not and knew that she need not full understanding lay behind those unwinking charged eyes terribly watchful and indifferent to anything but curiosity she saw them as the patient eyes of an investigator expectant of a final experiment i have studied this case for three yearsnow at last i am to have it he knew everythinghad known everything from the beginning she had no news for him how she would put it was what he was waiting forfor that only she had drawn him back to life this knowledge this realization drove her to candour past belief she felt as if she was stripping herself for public exhibitionfound herself talking in a dry voice of lovers intimacies and of still more secret thingsof things which women feel but do not even think she had to examine herself unflinchingly during this confession which reduced itself for lack of matter to one of motives in the course of it she had to face a fact never faced before only felt she could not love tristram she did not love germainwhom then did she love the fine colour flushed her cheeks the true light flamed in her eyes as she told herselfand then told her husband i know myself now there is one man who could do with me as he pleased but he will do nothing with me i trust him utterly he has changed me he has given me a soul i think he has taught me the worth of things which i never valued before and what life is and happiness and truth it is through him that i went home and faced what i was afraid ofleft him and all the wonderful things he could make me see i might never see him againbut i left him i am doing what he would wish now in telling you all this untruth is impossible to him and must never be possible to me again that is why i have waited here to tell you i had to tell youi had to tell myself now i have told you everything she stopped there because she felt that if she were to go on she would have to be insincere contrition for what she had done and allowed to be done in the days of her blank ignorance prayers for forgiveness promises of amendmentsuch things proper for bedside confessionwhat would they imply what involve that she loved this poor watcher alas pity might have urged her to deceive him so but she dared not deceive himand moreover she was certain that he could not now be deceived the light of another world shone upon him shone through him and enabled him to read hearts she did not shrink from this supernatural power of hisif it had been profitable she would have given him her lifeblood it seemed to her as clear as daylight that the utmost she could do for him had now been donewhen she had discharged her conscience before him and cleared her honour she believed that he would feel himself honoured by that act and as she stooped over him to kiss him she told him as much it is kind of you to have listened to me you have done me so much honour so much kindnessbut this is the greatest you have ever done me do you understand that i feel it so for a moment his terrible intelligence pored upon her as she hung over his bed it searched her explored her wondered judged a flicker of a smilea momentary relaxation of his rigid lipsa faint wavering of his attention then he signed and closed his eyelids down the strain was over she had been heard assessed acquitted when the nightnurse came in she found the patient at peace and mary germain crouched on the floor asleep her head upon the edge of the bed xv the dead hand her calmness which was not the stupor of grief from this point onwards shocked her friend and disturbed her enemy in the house the rector could not but feel it a slight upon his dead brother and an attitude most unbecoming to so young a widow but mrs james was made uncomfortable by an attitude for which she had not been prepared whatever the girls faults may have been she had never been brazen why then was she brazen now why almostyes indecent in her indifference mary proposed nothing objected to nothing took no part in the funeral arrangements answered no letters read none allowed her sisterinlaw entire control sank back with evident contentment to be the cipher in her own house which of course she ought to have been from the first there was something behind all this mrs james was far too intelligent to misread it this did not mean that mary was overwhelmedby grief or shame either it did not mean that she felt herself in disgrace no this was impudencecolossal the rector to whom this reading of the girl was propounded could not deny it colour shes very young to have such troubles upon her and of course shes still very ignorant she cant express herself i dont at all agree with you constantia but i own i should have preferred to see her in tears why should she cry pray she has all that she wantsa sure income and her liberty at least that is what she supposes but we shall see you paint your devils so impossibly black my dear said the rector that really they refute themselves i am sorry to have to say it but you are incapable of being just to this poor girl however as i own tears had been a sign of grace certainly she shed no tears that any one could see she was frequently in her room alone and may have cried there the rector made advances by look by gesture even by words he was not an effusive man would sooner have died than have invited anybody to pray with himbut for all that he did put himself in her way heart in hand so to speakand when she gently disregarded him he felt chilly she did not attend the funeral nor did she choose though she was urged to be present at the reading of the will she told the rector who pressed this duty upon her that she couldnt oblige him please dont ask me to do that i have nothing to expectand if he had left me anything i should have to think about it very seriously he took me from nothing i brought him nothing he has done more for me and allowed me to do more for my parents than i could ever have askedeven of him i make no claims at all and have no expectations i have never thought about such things naturally my child naturally not butafter such a shock as thisafter the first pang of lossit is wise to think of the future you had no settlement you know how could i she asked simply he smiled at the question well my dear well your parents might reasonably have lookedmy dear brother was very impulsive in some waysi cant doubt but that he intended to make proper provision but he kept his affairs very much to himselftoo much however at such a timeto judge the beloved dead no no for the same reason i cant press you noplease do not she said and turned to the window he left her the will then was read before the rector and mrs james miss germain and miss hester germain and produced its effect it bore the date of a month before the testators second marriage and was expressed to be made in view of that coming ceremony and to take the place of any settlement it left her porchfield house in farlingbridge otherwise known as the dowry house with all its furniture and household gear and three thousand pounds a year charged upon his southover estate so long as she remain chaste and unmarried mr dockwra solicitor slurred his phrase excusing it mrs james liked it extremely in the case of remarriage mary was to have five hundred pounds that was all said mr dockwra so far as mrs germain was concerned and he only said this much because he was asked by mrs james germain if there was no further reference to her for the rest the deceased gave handsome legacies to his sisters though they were otherwise provided for and liberal remembrances to his servantsannuities calculated upon their years of service and referred to the fact that the southover property and the london property alike were in strict settlement upon his own children should he have any and failing them upon his brother james mr dockwra then produced a small bundle of papers there was a codicil he said which bore date the th of augusta week before mr germains wedding by this document he left five hundred a year to my cousin tristram duplessis so long as he remained unmarried thus tersely expressed the rector started as if he had been shot and his wife compressed her lips i think that i should explain said mr dockwra that this codicil was not drawn by me and that i had no knowledge of its existence until the day after mr germains death mr james germain however as executor handed me then the sealed envelope containing it that envelope contained one other papera telegram which as it has no obvious reference to the disposition may have been put there by oversight i shall hand it now to mr germain the rector took it opened it looked at it and raised his eyebrows presently he put it quietly on the table before him mrs james without turning her head read it it was very shortmiddleham hillstreet berkeleysquarelook out mrs james smiled at her thoughtsand presently left the room mary must now be told what she had not cared to hear the rector broke her the contents of the will but said nothing of the codicil he had not asked his wife the meaning of that second document and did not mean to it pointed to a domestic mystery without being a prude all such matters were distasteful to him he was very kind as he had always been you will be very comfortably left you see mary he said at any rate let us say while you are looking about you mary had shown no more than a polite interest in his report three thousand a year porchfield she may have been dazed but she certainly was not dazzled james germain reflected to himself on the ease with which one gets acclimatized little more than two years ago this child was working hard for sixty pounds a year now she hears that she is secured three thousandwithout moving a muscle i need not tell you he went on that your home is here or at southover for any length of time convenient to you indeed i am sure i might include the rectory in my general invitation we have been so nearly related i could not bear to think the tie severed by my dear brothers death apart from that we have learned to love each other i hope i shall always look upon you as one of usif you will let me and your settlement at porchfield will be a reason the more to keep me at southover that is very kind of you mr germain mary saidbut without enthusiasm after a few more efforts the worthy man left her alone it was then mrs jamess turn she came in after knocking with the telegram in her hand this i think belongs to you she said mary took it read it and remembered a quick flush of colour showed that she did yes she said but it is of no importance now and she tore it across but mrs james was not to be balked you must allow me to explain its importance it was found in the envelope containing the codicil to my dear brothers willa codicil which he made within two days of your receiving it mary still looking out of the window commented idly a codicil was there a codicil that meant that you changed your mind didnt it in this case said mrs james it means i think that my dear brother explained his mind i thought that the rector might have informed you no said mary mrs james cleared her throat and began to enjoy herself by that he left five hundred a year to my cousin tristram duplessisso long as he remained unmarried mary was puzzled at first she knew by the speakers tone that she was in disgraceand connected it with duplessis at the mention of his name she stared at the bitterly incisive lady mr duplessisfive hundredif he doesnt marry what has that to do with she stoppedher eyes widened and deepenedshowed fathomless ah she said and picked up the torn paper she read the date august th what did you say was the date of the will it was a codicil said mrs james the date please the date mary asked her fretfully it was dated the th of august jinnys birthday mary remembered it perfectly he had had tea with the two of them and she had clung to him afterwards with a confession on the tip of her tongue he had never been more loving to her than on that afternoonand he had jinnys telegram in his pocketin his breast pocketwhile she had clung sobbing to his breast and he had left her that evening full of love as he had seemed to be and gone home and tied tristram by the leg ahso he had known everythingalways before that night at exeterhe had known it from the beginning she sat very stillthe telegram in her lapand her eyes cast down as she played idly with the pieces lifting them up and letting them fall the triumphant foe could see nothing but her heavy eyelids and the fringe of her lashes curving upwards as they brushed her cheeks if she expected victory she was to be disappointed i am glad you sent him my telegram she said i am glad he knew about mr duplessis and me mrs james lifted her head it was certainly advisable that he should be told personally i could not interfere i told him nothing that may have presented itself to me no said mary of course not it was no business of yours mrs james jumped it seems to me that it was very much a business of yours if you will forgive me it was mary said and i told him all about it mrs james started i told him mary said on the night he died he quite understood it is horrible to me cried mrs james that he was kept in the dark so long he wasnt at all in the dark mary said that is plain now i wish that i had known it before you may well say so apart from candour apart from sincerity surely it is the sacred duty of a married woman to have no secrets from her husband mary looked up she had the eyes of a woman acquainted with grief i am not a married woman she said i fancy that you must know it xvi wings the tale of germains posthumous disposition of his chattels ran as such tales will all about town and lost nothing in the running women took it complacently after their kind of course it was odd and yet in its way was it not a tribute one or two pretty young wives told each other that it was touching a miss lavender shed tears in the clubs they said plainly that duplessis had been bought off palmer lovell with his back to the fireplace cried out in his strident boys voice if thats not compounding a felony its compounding a felon but what the devil of a right has old germain alive or dead to whip his wife in public no clubman had an answer to this the best thing of all was said by lord kesteven in paris god be good to us what turks we all are heres old germain taking the haremkey into the grave with him that keenfaced old lord came to london and called on mary in hillstreet he observed her pale in her black weeds but with a haunted kind of beauty upon her which she had never had before her eyes were enormous he said she was very quiet in her manner seemed dazed but not cowedapprehensive you might think she looked up at him in a mutely expectant way as if she expected him momentarily to hit her and was too tired even to flinch at the impending blow he felt deeply for herall sorts of things and after his manner therefore was more bluff and direct than usual well my young friend and what are you going to do with yourself i should advise you to get out of this no woman can be expected to stand it she flushed at the bold attack but did not avoid it i hear nothing of what is being said i am sure he did not mean to be unkind that is not like him i was to blame i wont talk about it or i shall get angry cantin a mans willto disguise something worse and nastierpouf look here my dear try francetry paris my sister margaret de guiche would like you to pay her a visit she said so shes alone and you need see nobody de guiche is in petersburg you couldnt have a better duea than margaret it will be a kindness to herand a kindness to me i wish youd think of it she listened with hanging head and veiled eyes her eyelids always heavy seemed now as if they were of intolerable weight she watched her twisting fingers as she thanked him for the proposal she would think of it she told himshe had everything to think of i know that very well kesteven said but there are some things which i hope you need not consider one of them is the great regard i have for you oh yes she was sure of that he had shown her so much kindness im glad to hear it he continued and ill go as far as this if you decide to renounce your legacyon reflectioni should claim the privilege of helping you to do it i can hardly go furtherbut so far i am ready to go remember that remember that i am allowed to call myself your friend remember if you choose that i am fiveandsixty and take heartif you need heart it was clear what was implied in this speech but she did not feel equal to quieting the anxiety which underlay it she made no remark at any rate said his lordship i tell you that you may command the htel de guiche margaret may be trustedand perhaps i need not add that you may trust me too but he couldnt get her to say more than she would think of it so took his leave he kissed her hand so far she had not seen duplessis nor heard from him but the sense that an interview with him was impending was as it were swinging like a sword over her head fretted her nerves so badly that she was incapable of thinking what she could say to him when he came to heras of course he wouldwith an offer of instant marriage that would be in his view the only possible answer to the public affront he had received but as the days went on and he made no sign she began to wonder dimly whether after all she might not escapeand from such faint sighings thrown out into the vague she came by degrees to hopesand from hopes to plans and shifts everything in town conspired together to make her position impossible the chill reserve of mrs jameswhose frozen civility was worse than any rebuke the letters of her parents from blackheath kind repining halfinformed letters which said in effect we dont know what is being cried against you but be sure that we are on your side and the terrible letters of jinny almost mrs podmore by now and vigorously on the side of decorumthe disgrace which has been cast upon our family your unfortunate liaison one can only hope that you will let them be a warning child let us be thankful that things are no worse all this made the poor girl so selfconscious that she could hardly lift her head she thought that the very servants were judging heras no doubt they were she felt beaten to the earth and the fund of commonsense the fund of charity which she had at her callthrough mere panicsuspended payment if she had been left to herself she would have borne her husband no grudge for seeking to tie her publicly to his name she would have pitied not blamed him for supposing that three thousand or thirty thousand a year could have held her and certainly that midnight confession absolved her in her own conscience if she had looked back upon her dealings with duplessis it would have been to see what a little fool she had beento blush at her ignorance not at her shame but now her world insisted on her disgrace she was made to stand in a sheet like a jane shore the straight clinging disgraceful robe imprisoned her body and soul she felt that she must die if she stayed where she was a public mock but until duplessis delayed so obviously his coming she had felt bound in honour to see him to be just to duplessis he kept himself away by violence obeying an instinctwhich was a true one he had no doubt but that she would marry him nowhe could not for the life of him see how any two people could otherwise reply to posthumous impudence of the sort indeed he felt in his heart of hearts that she owed him that but his instinct told him that that could not be put to her for the present and that to be seen in her society to visit her even to write to her would make her burden heavier to bear he contented himself by renouncing his legacy in the most precise termsin a letter to dockwra the lawyer and in another to james germain if this act came to marys ears as he hoped it would no harm would be done to his affair rather she would see in it a plain declaration of his feelings but unfortunately for him it did not james germain was at misperton by this time and dockwra communicated directly with him not through his wife james germain true to his fastidious sense thought it no business of marysand was thankful it was none of his the delay of a week ten days a fortnight gave her courage her feverish dreams hopes of a release left her she knew now that she was to be free and once resolved schemes began to gather in her brain to develop her mind went to work and she became happy there was no doubt at all where she would go all her ideas of freedom were centred in one placelands end the sea the rocks the birdsand the low white cottage facing them allopendoored to them all her dream of nearly three years now to come true if senhouse was at the back of her mind he was kept rigorously there she felt virginal now when she thought of senhouse found herself blushing and put the image away as not lawful freedom from the intolerable eyes about herthe butlersher maidsmrs jamessthis ghastly mummery of clothes and ceremonyshe agonized to be quit of it all but now she intended to be and could not afford time to agonize she turned all her quick wits to the work applied method and deliberation to it and could almost fix a day so plain did everything seem method cautioned her to go slowly to work the first thing to do was to accustom mrs james to her walks abroad she devoted a week to thiswent alone deeply veiled into the park every day and spent gradually increasing hours there doing nothing more then one morning she went circuitously to the bank in burlingtongardens and asked for her passbook there was some to her creditthe remains of her pinmoney allowance two days later she presented a cheque for which left her a balance of sand asked for the money in gold the porter took the sack to her cab and she gave the direction hillstreetbut once out of hearing she put her hand through the window at the top and gave another orderthe army and navy stores leaving her sack of money in the cab she bought herself a gladstone bag perhaps it is evidence at once of the folly and fortune of women that she was not robbed she may well have deserved to be for being full of her ingenious schemes she had given no thought to the matterhad neither taken the mans number nor told him what she was entrusting to him she had not so much as troubled to shut the cab door after her the man himself with a well im damned had done that and it may be that the very magnitude of his opportunities had bereft him of the means of using them for she found him smiling on the rank when she came out the bag was handed in to heruncoveredshe gave the new direction paddington and en route deposited her sack of sovereigns and locked it in the bag at paddington she dismissed the cab not extravagantly and disappeared with a porter and the bag she put it in the cloakroom took a ticket for it then went back to hillstreet two things must be done two letters be writtenone to her mother one to james germain he had always been her friend she was really fond of him and liked to think that he would regret her loss while she was bound to guard against his trying to recover her to her mother she wrote very simply that she was suddenly called away on affairs connected with her husbands death and might have to go abroad it would be difficult to writebut she would send an address as soon as she had one of any permanence she added darling mother be as sure of my love for you and father and all of you as i am of yours i promise to tell you how i succeed in my business or if i fail in it you will never be out of my thoughts as you are never out of my prayers love me always in spite of anything that you may hear against me i have been foolish very ignorant and very blindbut no worse mother upon my honour i am wiser now and intend to be a good woman trust your mary who loves you and kisses this paper she wrote in the same strain to the rector of misperton i am not able to bear the strain of london for the present and intend to travel for some time before making my plans i feel the need of quiet and shall trust in you to do all you can to ensure it to me after the comforting words you gave me i am sure that you may rely upon my doing nothing which should make me unworthy of them i am resolved not to see mr duplessis again i could never be happy with him nor make him happy after what has passed if he should inquire for me pray tell him that this is my sincere conviction and ask him not to attempt to dissuade me from it i can never thank you enough for your invariable kindness to me that must always be one of my happy recollections of the life that i have ended if i have to begin again without it it is because i cannot ask you to continue it until i have proved myself more worthy to have it i am going away now by myself to work and to learn and to forget much but never to forget your kindness i beg you to remember sometimes with charity your affectionate friend mary s germain it was on the tip of her pen to write to tristram as she sat hesitating the phrases printed themselves one after another in her head and she wrote them down you never loved mebut i was proud to be even in your notice i am greatly to blame for the renewal of what was idle on your part and foolish vanity on mine in the beginning i can only be glad that my husband though he knew everything heard it all again from my own lipsi told him the night he died i hope that you will be happy and famous i know that both are in your power do not try to find me i beg of you forget me and love a woman who is more suited to you by birth and education i know that if you try you can succeed in this if you have any feeling of regard for me you will do as i ask you nowmary s germain two of these letters she posted with her own hand that night tristrams she reserved then she made her last preparations she packed her jewelcase carefully tied and sealed it and addressed it to the bank she dined in her boudoir and spent the rest of the evening with bradshaw planning out her route love of secrecy love of intricacy which were both characteristic of her decided her against so simple a course as a journey from paddington to penzance she worked out a way more to her taste waterloo to basingstoke thence to swindon and thence by the great western to exeter where she would stay for a while this necessitated an early start in the morning for she must go to paddington and recover her three hundred pounds she would take no luggage whatever would buy what she wanted in exeter loyalty to senhusian ethics decided her to this meantime it was necessary to be rid of her maid for an hour that she effected by the simple means of sending her with the note to duplessis and with her jewelbox to be taken to the bank and a receipt obtained the moment she was alone she dressed herself as she intended to appearin black jacket and skirt and a grey silk blousein hat and veil studiously plain then she left the house in hillstreet on foot got a cab in daviesstreet and was free all went well with her as far as basingstoke but there she was imprudent she asked at the office whether she could book through to penzance and break her journey for a week and being told after some delay that she could notthen exeter please she said second single to exeter and receiving it holding it in her mouth she half turned to get a better light into her purse and caught sight of horace wingthe courtly horacewho must have heard her in the shock as he hastened forward cap in one hand golfclubs dragging by the other she left her change on the counter bowed and fairly ran this was very indiscreet but she escaped and the porter came after her with her bag horace wing after gaping had a shuddering fit he did not follow her and was not able to smile at the encounter for some weeks her carriage was empty she was alone now with all her life like an open sea in front of her she sat looking out towards the west her hands quiet in her lap she had no sense of high adventure no bosom full of hopepeace possessed her altogether she felt that she could lie her length upon some green bank sheltered from the wind and sleep herself to death such a feeling as this was so foreign to her nature that she was surprised at herself asked herself whether some chord in her had not been broken she was sanguine by temperament and always lived in the future if on any morning of any week she could not wake up with the sense of an excitement to come to be waited for to be felt nearerthat day was so much dead weight so much space of drab to be got through in order that she might live tomorrow she told herself that she was mortally tiredthat her present reward was to be able to live unwatched and unjudged that was enough for any girl surelylet the morrows outlook provide for the morrow even while she was thinking these thoughts she caught herself unawares she found herself watching the flying landscape anxiously and smiling as she watched the open common the duckpond and the white roadyes and the tiltcart drawn by a white horseplodding to the west three years ago almost to a dayshe and the tiltcart had taken that road and then she had been a bride of an hourand now she was a widow of an hour she caught herself blushing was confused felt eyes upon her the carriage seemed full of eyes for a while she continued to watch to watch through the mist in her own eyesand then she turned suddenly in her place opened her novel and read diligently in it until the train stopping at taunton showed her that the place of dangerous memories was past she would not allow her thoughts to recur to that curious little drama of the mind in fact she worked hard to avoid the temptation she abandoned her novel opened her purse and did her accounts she made lists of necessary purchases and began to post up the diary with which she had provided herself when she reached exeter she stepped outmiss mary middleham her bag bore a label to that effect xvii first flight mrs merritt who had been housekeeper to the late canon blackrod and now let lodgings in a house of her own was amiable and by the possession of that quality was able to keep her curiosity within bounds but it was her daughter polly a devon maid of apple cheeks and sloeblack eyes who taught her enthusiasm for her lodger polly merritt adored the quiet and pretty young lady who though she wore such beautiful clothes gave herself none of the airs which were clearly within her rights who would wash her own blouses trim her own hats or sit belowstairs chatting affably while she trimmed one for polly herself in such familiar intercourse all the necessary safeguards of landladies were proved to be secure miss middleham it seemed was an orphan by profession a teacher of languages who had found it necessary to leave her london employment to escape a gentlemans attentions most reasonable most proper the gentleman was one indeed highly connected in fact cousin of an honourable but impecunious and not very steady girls who are orphans must look after themselves there had been nothing for it but flight admirable forethought nothing certainly but praise could be given to miss middleham for conduct so discreet itll bring him round miss depend upon it mrs merritt had considered itll make him look nine ways as good as a slap in the face any day better i hope mary said some of em wants one thing some another miss let him know that youre in earnest whatever you do i am quite in earnest mrs merritt mary told her and i think i have made that plain did you tell him so or write it miss polly must ask writings betterbut its dull work i have done both polly he doesnt know where i am i made it quite clear to him that he could not mrs merritt having observed her guest passed the back of her hand rapidly across her nose to be sure you could miss its easy to be seen that god almighty never gave you that pair of eyes for nothing to call a man or send him about his businessah ill warrant you poor fellow mused the tender polly i pity him in private conversation afterwards mrs merritt assured her daughter that she need not we should have the young gentleman here before the swallows were away let polly mark her words our young lady was a snug young ladythat was a certainty she was not a girl who would go without letters of a morning for long together letters that sort live on em as a man on his eleven oclock beer no no she was used to company any one could see she was meant to be somebodys darling how else did she get her pretty waysand why to goodness wear her pretty frocks but for that meantime she had been used to the best you could see and she should have it here what mrs merritt however did not know and polly did know was that another gentleman stood in the background here lay the root of pollys passionate interest in her friend a constant appeal to her imagination and judgment and wonder a gentleman was to be expected there was always a gentleman but two gentlemen one more gentleman and polly might have felt the responsibilities of paris in fact she did feel them as things were mary had come to exeter meaning no more than a passagebirds rest therea night or two and away her cottage at the lands end solitary vigil face to face with the sea and the rocks tending of the hidden garden there a waiting and watchingand a great reward that had been her fixed intent nothing seemed to be in the way she was free as air why should she wait it is very odd though how you cannot carry through these hotblood thoughts in the cold blood that momentary shyness which had come upon her in the train when she had caught herself looking out for a remembered villagegreen and had been abashed came upon her the moment she began to think of cornwall with a view to going there she found herself trembling found herself delaying drawing back had she been her old self never sought and never mated in this tremulous plight she had remained but she had learned to face such difficulties and did not shirk it the more she thought of it the plainer it became that she could not have the cottage could not sit down there and wait for senhouse virgin as she was and virginal as she was now become again the picture of herself in such an attitude and in such an act filled her with shame and if to picture it was dreadful what would the daylong reality be but unendurable but where then was her sense of comradeship of perfect amity between him and her she did not know it was gone and what would hewondrous clearseeing friendsay to her for this prudery that she did know she could see him appeal for laughter to the skies alas it could not be helped she was a maiden therefore might be wooed she was a maiden therefore could not go awooing so he and she might never meet again better sooh infinitely betterthan that they should meet by her act thus it was that polly merritt came to learn about the other gentleman marys perplexities had been stated and polly was thrilled oh miss and hes never spoken no said mary at leastnot about that what was the nearest he ever got to mary looked wise he told me to go away once he did why were you to go then becauseoh because he could see i suppose that i didnt want to and well becausei sometimes fancyhe didnt want me to at least i think he didnt he said you had better go home im a man you know polly opened her eyes wide thats as plain as my nose i should think so so of course yes of course i had to go she looked down at her toes just as if senhouse had been standing above her bidding her go i dream sometimes she said that he comes to me in the night and looks at menever speaks but just looks not at me you know but through meright through to the pillow thats enough then he turns and goes away and i follow him out of door into the warm darkand he turns sharply upon me and is dreadfully angry ive never known him angry but dreams are like that i see his face quite changedwild and cold at once and terribly stern and i run away into the empty house and wish that i were dead no no i could never bear thatto seek him and be spurned i would sooner never see him again polly was deeply moved but practical a girl must look aheadfar beyond dreams you had best not miss she said if thats likely to be the way of it is he that sortyour hotandcold oh i dont knowhow can i tell that has never been between us save that once when he told me to go away hes a wonderful talker about all sorts of things he can make them all extraordinary i feel after listening to him that i understand all life all experience everything seems reasonable but when it comes toushe wont speak i believe he cant and i understand him better when he doesnt so would any one i should think said polly merritt but hows he going to look at you if he never sees you and dont know where you are ah said mary with farsighted eyes i dont know you might write to him i supposeand slip in your address by accident like mary shook her head i couldnt besides he has no address he just comes and goeslike the wind has he no house of his own no he lives in a tentin a cart what like a gipsy oh miss this would never never do but mary admitted it thoughtfully yes i think he might be a sort of gipsy this to polly was final i do think youre better here miss middleham if youll excuse me perhaps i am said mary polly had veered ill warrant the other gentleman would have a house to offer you oh yes i suppose so but ah thats just itthats just it mary admitted it i suppose it is but he says that he will never marry he doesnt believe in marriage ho indeed cried polly then pray what does he believe in i dont know im not sure polly tossed her young head it wouldnt take long for me to be sure then mary showed her face and her eyes shone clear i am sure of this that if he called me i should follow him over the world however he chose me to be but i know he never will he is unlike anybody elsehe comes and goes like the wind let him for me said polly specially when hes going the summer waned and fainted autumn mists crept about and found her still in exeter pupils came slowly but she got one or two and there was promise of more the vicar of the parish helped her she taught in his sunday school did him some visiting danced with his boys and sang with his girls through him she got an engagement in september in a young ladies academyto teach italian two days a week she got to know a few people there was a gentlemanly young man called bloxam who escorted her home from choral evenings then there was a curatequod semper quod ubiquewho lent her books and professed himself ready to discuss them afterwards by correspondence or otherwise these things faintly amused her the simplicity of such devices for instance the little buildingsup of the little architects she felt herself ruefully slipping back into the parochial losing touch with her wide horizons the tonic properties of freedom which at first had been as delightful as the mere ease of it were now staling by use she began to find herself grow dull the one fact upon which she could build was that she was again earning her living xviii enter a birdcatcher october was in mild and languorous the trees dripped all day the mist seemed unable to lift itself from the lowlying city mary grew restless and discontented the usual things happened but had ceased to entertain mr bloxam after taking her for excursions by water had one day proposed that she should take tea with his people prosperous hucksters in the town she agreedto find out very soon that she was on exhibition on approval you might say mrs bloxam the mother addressed her particular inquiries mr bloxam the father gave her a carnation out of the conservatory shortly afterwards mr bloxam the son made her another proposition and was exceedingly surprised that she did not jump at it can such things be he inquired looking about she had shaken her head at him very gently when she told him that really she couldnt it was charmingly done with kindness but complete finality that he saw he told her that his heart was broken that she saw before her a man beaten down it is dreadful he said my mother liked you so much she is hard to please i suppose you wouldnt care to think it over again she shook her head a mr bloxam of exeter if he only knew or could be made to know no no she said i shant alter but i hope we are not to be bad friends mr bloxam had bowed and said i should be most happyand one sees what he meant my mother you know wont like it naturally she is partial she will say that you led me on then she will say what is very untrue cried mary with flashing eyes and i hope you will tell her so it is very hard if i may not have friends without being accused of ridiculous things girls do them you know said mr bloxam dubiously ive met with several cases if you are likely to include this among them i must ask you to let me go she said with spirit but perhaps you would like to give me some tea first mr bloxam murmuring about the sacred rites of hospitality assured her that he would and they parted on good terms he told her that he intended to travel and indeed he did afterwards go to westonsupermare for a month the unfortunate but absurd episode taught her to be circumspect with the literary curate he however was of a more cautious temperament and went away for his holiday with no more pronounced symptom than a promise to send her picture postcards from the cathedral cities which he purposed visiting you may like to have these afterwards he darkly said and then took himself away on a bicycle the year was come to a critical point for her about this time halfway house would be plodding its way to the west its owner looselimbed and leisurely smoking on the tilt almost any day now it might pass by exeter or through it almost any day she might come plump upon itand what was to happen to her then could she endure the years round or know him by her cornish sea in her white cottage on the cliff and stay here nursing her wound feeling the throb and the ache it seemed impossibleand yet women do such things it was almost the worst of her plight that she knew she could do it it was in her blood to do it the poor were like that dumb beasts and now the delicacy which she had felt at first and which had kept her away from lands end became a tyrant as the temptations grew upon her it prevented her riding afield by any road leading into exeter from the east she had a bicycle more she had a certain way of bringing him directly to her side he had taught her the patteran but no she couldnt so she worked on doggedly with the fret and fever in her bones and day by day october slipped into november the days slipped off as the wet leaves fell early in november on a day of sunny weather polly merritt announced a visitor who followed her immediately into the room his straw hat under his left arm his right hand held out a gentleman to see miss middleham if you please says polly merritt and mary had sprung up with her hand to her side its the tall one mother not the windy one was explained in the kitchen but mrs merritt sniffing had declared they were all the same i dont know anything about that said polly but this gentleman talks like asking and having if you want my opinion the riot in her breast was betrayed by her shining eyes and the quick flood of colour from neck to brows but he played the man of the world so well that she was able to recover herself he made his excuses for breaking in upon her he had been going through exeter in any case it was hardly to be resisted she would allow he owned that horace wing had given him the clue poor horace you hurt him it took two months hard talking in town and at least a month of surmise in scotland before horace could find strength enough to own up to the fact that he had met you that you had bowedand bolted he mentioned it with tears in his eyes as an extreme case he had heard you book to exetersecond single then he looked at her and smiled but why miss middleham why not she echoed him bravely i had to be somebody werent you person enough ah yes i was too much of a person i was almost a personage i was never happy in that disguise my clothes never fitted me you should let other people judge of that if you would like my opinion of your clothes for instance she shook her head without speaking he tried a more direct attack you forgive me for coming she suspected a tenderness oh it is very kind of you i dont have many visitors i am glad to see you thats good may i see you again then while i can she inquired are you likely to be here long a light hand was necessary now oh dear nounfortunately a day or two at the outside time to buy cartridges you remember the ogmores i am due at wraybrook on the seventh pheasants but until then this was the fourth you see he would be horribly in the way i am occupied a good part of the day she told him i have pupils he raised his eyebrows really have you he flushed and leaned forward have you renounced your not in so many words she said i have simply dropped it nobody knows where i am you knew that i had formally renounced mine she had not known that there was an implication in itwhich she had run here to avoid and here it was did you she said shortly im not surprised of course not he agreed you could not expect me to do anything else and you have done precisely the same that also i took leave to expect he saw concern gather in her eyes broke off abruptly and plunged into gossip does your late world interest you still do you want to hear the news palmer lovells engagement for instance a princess of italy i give you my worda donna teresa scalchi rather a beauty and a great shrew palmer can bite a bit too that will end in tears and hertha de speyne marries abroad morosov an anarchist of sort they can collect plants in siberia he broke off again remembering that others had collected plants in siberia watching her he saw that she remembered it too oh and old constantine and i have kissed we are fast friends once more i write speeches which he mangles hes to be at wraybrook waiting for me he cant bear me out of his sighthes like an elderly wife frightful nuisance of coursebut i hope you are pleased she looked at him for a moment of course i am pleased i always wanted you to succeed he rattled on she had never seen him in such good spirits or manners when he left her after an hour she was quite at her ease he said that if he might he would come in the evening and take her for a walk it would do her good and as for him she might have pity upon a fellow at a loose end with nothing on earth to do but buy cartridges when he had gone she sat still looking at her hands in her lap could she maintain herself for three days already she felt the fences closing inshe had felt them as they moved though never once had she been able to hold up her hand or say stop that you may not assume tristram was master of implication and her master there throughout his airy monologue he had taken her for grantedher and her origin her humility her subservience to his nod her false position with germain her false position now why his very amiability his deference to her opinion his tentative approachwhat were these but implications of his passion for her a passion so strong that it could bend his arrogant back and show a tristram duplessis at the feet of a mary middleham she writhed she burned to feel these things and to be powerless against such attack and he was to come again this evening and every day for three days he was to comeand no help for her she must fall without a cry yes without a cry for she was cut off from her friend by the very need she had of him what was she to do what could she dobut fall she struggled at three oclock in the afternoon she told polly merritt that if the gentleman called again he was to be told that miss middleham was not well and had gone to bed polly wondered but obeyed lovers tricks quoth mrs merritt thatll bring him to the scratch it did he received the news at the door with an impassive faceall but for his eyes which keen and coldly blue pierced pollys sloeblacks to the brain and extracted what might be useful to him many thanks miss polly he had said presently youre a good friend i see look here ill tell you what to do ill bring some flowers round presently and you shall put em in her room and say nothing about it do you see polly saw the next day was a busy one for her and she saw nothing of tristram until the evening then to her dismay she found him waiting for her outside the gates of rosemount academy where her italian lesson had been given if she bit her lip she blushed also and if he remarked but one of these signals it was not her fault cavaliers had attended at those gates beforenot for her only but for her among others such a cavalier however so evidently of the great world had never yet been looked upon by the young ladies of rosemount oh cried mary startled who told you your amiable friend miss polly betrayed you i hope youll forgive her i suppose i must probably you frightened her out of her wits but he swore that they were very good friends indeed he thought that miss polly liked him upon his word and mary could not deny that polly undoubtedly did his admirable behaviour inspired confidence inquiries after her health no reference to ambiguous exotics no assumptions no plans for evening walks he went with her to her door and left her there with a salute but before she could get in while she stood with her hand on the knocker as if by an afterthought he came back to her from the gate jess had summoned him to wraybrook he said he knew that there was something to tell her positively he must go the day after tomorrow now was she free tomorrow she was but she hesitated to say so well then would she give him a great pleasure would she come with him to powderhamexplore the park and the shore have a picnic luncheon and all that sort of thing would she as he stood down there below her with flushed face and smiling obsequious eyes she thought that she really might trust herself if not him polly opening the door was nodded to and told that she need not wait polly needed no telling come mrs mary he urged her what do you say will you let me look after you for this once will you please to remember that never once since we have known each otherhow many yearshave we had a whole day together extraordinary fact its quite true she reflected we never have once we very nearly did though twice he corrected her but she could not admit that well which was her instance it was long ago when she had been at mispertonhad been some six months there one midsummer daysurely he remembered he had promised to take her to glastonbury the dogcart was to meet them at clewgate station ah yes he criedand i called for youand you were readyin a brown holland frock had i a brown holland i remember that i was quite ready and then a note came down from mrs james beloved mrs james and you pretended to be angry pretended oh my dearest friendi swore i know you did and i you pretended to cry no no there was no pretence i did cry mary he said why did you cry she recovered herself because i was very young and very stupid now for my instance he said not so very long ago you were to go to blackheathby train and i went to charing cross station but with a flaming face and real trouble in her eyes she stopped him please dontyou hurt me i think that you forget he begged her pardon so sincerely that she could not refuse the morrows appointment they met at the stationshe in a straw hat and linen frockfor the weather was wonderful he in flannels the perils of adventure glittered in her eyes he played the courtier sure now of his game she begged for thirdclass tickets but he compromised for secondand flagrantly bribed the guard to keep the carriage it was impossible that she should avoid the knowledge that she was practically in possessionimpossible that she should not see the approving smiles of the bystanders a pretty girl and her sweetheart simple comedy of neverending charm abhorrent to the senhouses of this world but not to be extirpated until birnam come to dunsinane softly the knowledge brooded upon her softly virginal she sat very much aware the epicure returned to master tristram who by a whisper could have had her but refrained he sat by her but respectfullyhe discoursed at large powderham castlehe spoke of that it was a pity that the fine place could not be seen but the courteneys had let it and he didnt know the people it was full he happened to have heard he believed that bramleigh was staying there he forgot if she knew bramleigh a quaint little man but probably she wouldnt want to be bothered with a lot of people so they must be contented with the park thus tristram discoursed and at his discretion sat she saying little looking at him never heeding every shade of inflection and every hairs breadth of movement of his they reached the station he helped her to descend all seemed well with tristrams wooing his lady was in a pensive mood softly receptive of his implications the temptation to paint in bolder masses was not resisted nor that more subtle form of artthe silent art speechless they loitered together and sometimes their hands touched and sometimes he hovered over her as if protecting her with wings her eyes were veiled she appeared sleek as a dove under his hand once he breathed her namemary oh mary but he saw her shiver and stiffen and knew that she was still to be won so be it but he could not give over the delicious chase to have her thus wideeyed quivering straining beside himlike a greyhound taut at his leash he was beside himself with longing and like a fool gave way my dearest he began but she checked him with a fierce cryno nonot that and though he could see nothing but the sharp outline of her cheek and chin he knew that she was watching something he looked about him vaguely what on earth the seaa narrow strip of blue tumbling water spuming where it touched the yellow sandsthe flecked pale skythe gorselarks above itin a far corner a gipsys tent and a white horse foraging what on earth he drew back she seemed to start forwards as if to escape from himbut then she turned suddenly and he saw that she was pale that she trembled and that there was real trouble in her eyes i am tired she said very tired may we go home now of coursewhat a brute i am but i thought that you wont you tell me what has tired you all at once i dont knowit came over mesuddenly but i do want to go home pleaseimmediately her eyes were fullbrimming he was touched come then well go to the station its no great distance unless you would rather sit oh no i couldnt possibly no no indeed i must go home my head aches dreadfully i think a sunstrokeperhaps i can hardly stand up he saw that that was true come he said take my arm well go at once when they had turned back she seemed to recover she walked at any rate as fast as he didset the pace but she would not talk any more in the train she sat apart looking out of the windowand after a time he let her alone at exeter when he put her in the fly and would have followed her she put her hand on his arm please dont come with me i shall be myself directly i beg you not to come and dont think me ungratefulindeed you have been kindness itself im very much ashamed of myself ill see you tomorrowto say goodbye you will let me do that i must know how you are you see yescome tomorrow if you will goodbye i am much better i shall be quite well but come of course if you had rather of course i shall come he lifted his hat bowed and turned away she watched him walk towards his hotel then with a face of flame she turned to her own affair this was to be her last bid for freedom her last chance if she was to be the crying shame of her sex it must be so come what might she must call for help she stayed the fly at the door paid the man and watched him turn and go galloping down the hill then she turned to her affairacross exeter it took her to the honiton road she walked the whole way some two miles out of the city beyond the suburbs to where the open country began and here she laid her patteran with branches of crimson maple torn from the sunny side of the hedge at the corners of two byroads she laid themone to the south one to the north not satisfied with that she went north herself to the cullompton road and laid two patterans more her cheeks burned like fire and in her heart was a bitter pain she felt that she had unsexed herself was bedraggled and bemired but her need had racked heryou cant blame the wretch writhing there if he call upon his god xix heartache and the philosopher love which had given her heart wings to soar clogged senhouse about the feet hobbled him and caused him to limp if she had never loved before she had played with love but to him the woe was new one need not inquire into his relations with women or believe him immune to understand that it was so entirely new to him that he refused to believe in it she was present with him though with her face veiled night and day the thought of her was joy his ledge of calochortus took a value in his eyes because she had looked at them knelt among them stroked and fondled one at least he mocked at himself for searching out and cherishing the marks of her feet for stooping to touch what seemed to be the printings of her knees and yet when he went down the pillar and stood among other precious growths of his he saw them a huddle of wet weeds the outlook was a bad one he tried to paint and smeared out everything he tried to write and had nothing to say he slept badly and yet he could not leave the north for he had an appointment in october which would take him to penrith a learned man from baden was coming out to meet him with proposals in his pocket of grand ducal dimensions two years planthunting in the caucasus and three years gardeningwith the schwarzwald for his garden so far the grand ducal government was prepared to go upon report the thing had been a year coming to a head for senhouse was a difficult man to inoculate with other peoples ideas but to such a head it was now brought and he felt that whatever else he did he must by all means meet herr doktor lffner what was he to do then between june and october characteristically with the south calling him he went north he shipped at leith and went to iceland with bingo and a saddlebag for all his luggage he traversed that island from end to end and though he could not tire himself he got his sleeping powers back began to paint and to believe in his painting to botanize and to be sure it was worth while he knew next to nothing of danish and was driven in upon himself for company upon that fare he throve he moped no more forgot mary for whole hours together and believed himself cured in september he returned to leith and went afoot down to penrith to meet the herr doktor their greeting was cordial oh man of silences oh thou unlettered one do i find thee in truth my dear doctor lffner you do indeed come into the yard and ill show you some things worth having where have you been my friend iceland iceland ach then you haf no you haf not never in the worlt im not sure but i rather think that i have what he had was some earth and broken limestone in a spongebagso far as could be seen but there was enough beside to occupy the pair of them until dinner before that meal was ready the doctor had fallen weeping on senhouses neck had clasped him to his breast thou hast itthou hast itoh wonderchildand then as he wiped the dew from his glasses with a startling lapse into idiomi say dot was cholly the dinner was very gay bingo had an indigestion next morning the great man was taken out and about to view the various fields of tillage the ledge where calochortus had been fair in marys eyes the larkspur slope and what could be done with alpines upon a cumberland moraine he was more than amazed he was convinced you are chust the man for us we pick you up cheap i consider for ten thousand mark senhouse was not concerned to affirm or deny but he insisted upon it that he was selling his liberty very cheaply indeed and i wouldnt do it you know for a hundred thousand he said if it werent for the two years in the caucasus you have me there i own ive hungered after that for years and now ill take it as it comes to me there must be irises there which neither leichtlin nor korolkov have spottedim certain of it and you are the man to spod them said herr lffner with deep feeling bod mind you we haf them wid you in schwarzwald honour among thieves said senhouse depend upon me herr lffner passed by the proposal that he should be taken to the dukeries to see the cyclamen or to wales for the peonies or to cornwall for the ramondias but he could not resist the promise of syrian irises growing wild on dartmoor that he must see before he died and he would take kew and necessary business there on the way agreed they would start in the morning by the express from carlisle this they did lffner senhouse and bingo journeyed to london and put up at the grand hotel which was chosen by the savant solely on account of its name i feel grand to haf got you my senhouse said he let us therefore go to the grandest hotel we can find it was not in his friends power to correct this simplicity and the grand hotel was too grand for him in the lounge of this palaceall lookingglasses and whisky as he described itit was necessary for him to spend certain moments while herr lffner briskly inspected rooms menus and lists of wines briskly but with method he went to work senhouse having discovered that most of the plants were imitation and the others dying flung himself upon a plush settee and picked up journal after journal in the hope of finding one which did not contain either photographs of ladies or advertisements he was grumbling over an evening sheet when his friend joined him and sighing his content at a good dinner ahead of him produced and lighted a cigar senhouse found himself reading for a second time a paragraph of a leading article which began thus ever since the byelection in farlingbridge caused by the death of mr germain the government has been losing seats with a steadiness as reasonable as reason can require midway through his second reading he stiffened and sat up excuse me lffner he said but i must leave you for an hour or so herr lffner beamed and bowed i am sorry but submit onlyyou must promise me to come back or i lose you du wilder mann senhouse was not vague on the contrary he was remarkably collected yes ill come back but this is a matter of losing myselfor the reverse as the case may be he nodded and walked straight out of the hotel into the street bingo stepping delicately with ears set back and muzzle to earth followed close to his right heel he shared his masters contempt of london but added fear the hour was late for callers since it was now halfpast seven but he knew nothing of hours he went directly to hillstreet and rang the bell after a long interval a caretaker released many a bolt and peered round the edge of the door a respectable greyhaired lady very anxious mrs germain said senhouse he almost heard her sigh out of town sir so i see but where is she bingo lifted his head high snuffed the air misliked it and yawned the elderly lady had no more doubts she would be at southover house sir the family is expected on the th for a few days on their way abroad senhouse jerked away all this surplusage the family what family it is mrs john germain i mean whatever caution may have lingered in the caretaker now disappeared in the occasion of a treasured wonder to be revealed oh sir we dont know anything about her its all a mystery sir and has been since mr johnpassed away what do you mean by that she was asked her cue shes not been seen or heard of sirnot by her own family nor by ours she went away by herself in julyafter the event sirand heres october come round and never heard of yet senhouse betrayed nothing but his mind moved like lightning tell me exactly what you mean he bade her and she did omitting nothing he listened made no comments and gave no chances then he asked her do you know mr duplessiss address she did not his club she said she would call her husband the husband in his shirtsleeves was all for speculation upon the affairspeculation at large illustrated by reminiscences duplessis was a good gambit but the moment he had opened by saying that many a time had he stood behind mr duplessiss chair at the reform he found himself rehearsing to his wife things that she had heard but an hour ago senhouse had snapped out his reform thanks and gone his way at the reformbingo coiled on the steps with one eye wary for perilhe learned that duplessis was in devonshire wraybrook park near honiton was his address he returned to the hotel and found herr lffner immovable in his place and still with a cigar but he was deplorably hungry and leapt to his feet the moment he saw senhouse thank god for you he warmly said come and dine i cant dine lffner you must hoard your thanksgiving im going down to devonshire the savant gazed at him to devonshirewithout dinner that is not possible my friend to begin it is bad for yousecondly it is late oh said senhouse im a nightbird you know i dont want you to come with mein fact id rather you didnt youve got lots to do at kew and can meet me there but i must be off in half an hour i shall catch the herr lffner looked at his watch then at his friends dog then at his friend smiles played about his face and eyes what mischief do you meditate what dark work he said and you could hear the enthusiasm gurgling beneath like flood water in a drain but senhouse was unfathomable and for once not smiling its serious work im after lifeanddeath work i believe my trip to the caucasus hangs on itand all my trips to come herr je du lieber i know its a queer thing nothing seemed to hang upon anything this morning and now everything upon one thing its no good my dear man i cant explain trust me ill telegraph to you from exeter and wait for you there bod said herr lffner out of his chest if you haf here a lifeanddeathworksi cannot understand if you make of it lifeworks you telegraph and i come but if it is a deathworkswhat then it wont be said senhouse it cant be goodbye herr lffner went to his dinner at wraybrook park his lean face was announced to duplessis at halfpast ten in the morning at the breakfasttable by a respectful butler it was not told him that it had awaited him since eight oclock some one to see mein the drive he had asked suspecting nothing why in the drive the gentleman preferred to be outside sir he had a dog with him duplessis stared at his plate all right ill come in a minute he said and resumed his meal at eleven he came out of the front door cigar in mouth and saw immediately what was in store for him the carriage drive at wraybrook sweeps round the lake which is the great feature of the place on the edge of that he had seen in a moment the tall man in grey bareheaded talking with one of the gardeners and had flushed his eyes narrowed and glittered he paused perceptibly then drew a breath and went down over the lawn bingo sitting up on his haunches gave a short yap of warning then apologized to his master senhouse finished what he had to say to the gardener nodded and went up to meet his man they encountered without recognition bingo with lifted forefoot reserved his judgment his custom was to run in and apply the test of nose to calf but in this case he stayed behind you wish to see me im told duplessis spoke first yes said senhouse i do i have to trouble you i have just heard of john germains death in some sort duplessis had been prepared for thisbut in no way which could have been explained he was able to take it quietly news travels slowly your way he said germain died in july so i have learned but it must have been sudden i happen to know that he was quite well at the beginning of that month and had not the least reason to expect any such thing why should you duplessis was rather famous for impertinence senhouse said ill tell you i saw mrs germain early in julyduplessis grew redin fact she must have gone directly from the north where i met her to her husbands bedside i think ill interrupt you for one moment duplessis said you are probably as interested in saving time as i am therefore the sooner i know how i can serve you the better for both of us bingo who had been looking with gloomy interest at the root of his tail here attacked it with ferocity senhouse laughed ill tell you mrs germain has disappeared duplessis asked do you want me to find her for you i want you said senhouse to tell me where she is duplessis looked him full in the face really i dont know what business you have to ask me that then ill tell you if you please said senhouse when she left the north she did not i believe go directly to london she went to blackheath to her people there she saw you who told you that sir duplessis was angry she told me that she should see you there it had not been her intention but she changed her mind then i have to thank you mr senhouse for an insufferable interference in my affairs said duplessis i advised her to see youyes come now he said with a change of tone which duplessis found hard to bear you have had your innings i was careful not to touch on that you have had more than one if i dont mistake you i think now that i go in duplessis was not the man to give candour for candour his eyes were steady on his enemy i dont give ladies addresses without their leave you know you may assume it here when i saw mrs germain in cumberland she gave me to understand that she might wish to see me again if she had wished it said duplessis i suppose she would have told you where she was apparently she does not wish it obviously you do not senhouse replied and i have reasons for putting your wish and her action together and as a matter of fact she could not let me know anything because i have no certain address your addresses are nothing whatever to me said duplessis i decline to tell you anything very well said senhouse slowly then you must get what good you can out of that duplessis turned on his heel and walked away bingo sleek and swift ran after him and sniffed daintily at his calves curiosity so to speak was behind him drove his tail in between his legs it wanted but a spark to kindle the smouldering young man and here it was he turned again blazing call in your cur will you they dont allow dogs here bingo heel said senhouse and watched him smiling quietly xx in which bingo is unanswerable swinging along his miles from honiton back into exeter he saw the patteran just within the twomilestone she wants me shes here bless her wild heart then he walked into the city sat in the treeshaded alley of the inn by exebridge and breakfasted as well he might he had eaten nothing since yesterdays noon at two oclock as he leaned smoking his pipe and looking at the river he saw duplessis in a dogcart drive over the bridge this was precisely what he had expected the moment he saw the patteran in the road hell lunch before he moves hell treat himself handsomely ill give him till halfpast three then we go togetherthe three of us bingo lowered his ears senhouse and he were too old friends for eyeservice or tailsignals together they crossed the bridge and strolled up the curving street the second innyard they visited showed them the wraybrook dogcart high and yellowwheeled hes put up he goes back tonight hes lunching now what shall we do i think a walk he addressed himself to the wooded heights which look down on exeter his spirits were high to meet the evenings battle he urged bingo to extend himself infected him with the fray to come my friend do you know who lives in this town do you know whom we are to see byandby a gentlehanded acquaintance my frienda lover of yours whose troubles have been told you and me by signs not by words bingo my boy for words have not been made fine enough to voice her thoughts halfthoughts and quarterthoughts no but by a sigh scarcely heard or a hand on your head by caresses and lingering touches and suchlike pretty talk thats how we know her and what we love her for bingo because shes timid and full of alarmsall on the edge of the real thing hovering on the threshold of the cage bingo pricked up his ears then whined he moved his head to acknowledge a friendly speech but he was trembling and looking up the road bingo come in said senhouse and trembled too he saw mary coming up the road books under her arm she was rosy with breasting the hill and he could see that her eyes were very bright he could see from the gate at which he leaned that she was charged with excitement that her lips were never still that she looked sideways for events he had to put his hand on bingos head to keep him backand to keep himself back ill give him one more chance he told himself and stayed where he was mary passed him all unconscious went quickly up the road stopped at a white gate and slowly pushed it open as she went in he saw her pause and look down the road by which she had come then she went in and the gate swung to and fro and clicked as the latch caught senhouse inspected the gate then his watch rosemount academy for young ladiesthree oclock shes teaching till four she expects him he retired to his trees but had to call bingo twice he was halfway up the drive nosing out his friend duplessis came up the hill at five minutes to four and smoked three cigarettes one after another he looked at his watch incessantly as he walked up and down the road senhouse watched him calmly not making any effort at concealmentbut concealed because it was obvious duplessis had no notion of his whereabouts ladiesyoung ladies in straw hatscame out of rosemount academy in twos and threes and vanished up or down the road as the case might be some rode bicycles and waved the prouder farewells to their friends afoot one was fetched in a brougham by a furred matron two had a maid and one joined a brother in a cricket cap ladies of severer mien tightly jacketed and in black came presently a longhaired musicmasterand mary as she stood beyond the gate she saw duplessis senhouse knew that by her look she had a trick when she was at a pass of driving all expression from her eyes they showed then as masks of black it was her way of defence you could not tell whether she was glad or afraid of you but she addressed herself to her task completed or allowed the young musician to complete the conversation bade him a smiling farewell which sent him happily on his way and then waited blankly but with colour for duplessis the road was now empty but for these two he came up lifting his hat he took her hand and held it while he bent to speak to her senhouse saw her so held but with averted face saw that she was listening that she was serioustoo serious to be frightened once he saw her look up at the man and frame no with her grave lips once again look up and frame yes at that second answer duplessis took her hand againher left hand which had been idle by her sideand held it while he continued to talk vehemently in low tones he watched her now intently as she fought these long odds and had bingo by the scruffbingo on his hind legs shivering and whining in whisperssteady boy hold yourself mary was now pale and in her eyes was the light of distress they beaconed across the way but no help came as she listened she began to breathe quickly he could see her bosoms unrest her hand was caught up to tristrams lipsbut she sprang away then and her oh no no never neveri could not do it gave senhouse the cue for which he shook he loosed bingo who like a streak of grey light shot across the road duplessis started violently but a low glad cry came from marys heart bingo oh my dearest friend oh bingo she stooped in the road and the two were one then she rose vividly bright and waited for senhouse he crossed the road leisurelywith no looks for duplessis he held out the maplebranch my excuse he said she took it from him and kept it in her hand but she could not speak in the presence of the two men she showed nothing common or meanno consciousness she was perhaps at her best her colour high but not painful her eyes serious but not veiled modesty had been jarring affectation here modesty was not possible her left hand still held bingos head to her side bingo on his hind legs revelling in her hand the two men each in his way put their fate to the touch neither took his eyes off her neither gave an inch duplessis would not have compromised if he could his sullen rage was patent he let it smoulder senhouse smiledall the faun showed in him the stored secret knowledge the power of the adept of the seer into the dark of him who would mock if he were not full of pity he spoke first it seems that you are to choose he said i can ask you to do that her soft eyes beamed and her smile met his in the way halfway house she said asking he nodded halfway house well put it still duplessis said nothing at all but fixed her with his knit brows a good ear might have heard three hearts beating i think that bingos did for he nozzled in marys hand she let him gently down stooped over him kissed his head whispered in his ear then rising to her assize with a look divinely mild and a gesture of confidence which brought tears into one pair of eyes she put her hand in senhouses and stood by his side duplessis stiffened and looked at the pair of them i take your answer he said bowed to her and walked down the hill bingo sitting sagely on his haunches suddenly yawned shyly they turned to each other shyly kissed senhouse kissed her twice then threw his head back and laughed his joy to the skies oh wonder of the world he cried and took her to his heart heres for the last of her in the train on their way to london and lffner senhouse was commenting upon what lay before them the caucasus the schwarzwald what would she do in the caucasus for example that was easy i shall sit in the door of the tent waiting for you she told him in the black forest what else he believed her we are to leave halfway house then and then he looked out of the window at the rolling hills of wilts at any rate here i am a bondslaveyoked by baden for five years make what you will of it she said nothing she was always slow of speech with her betters when they talked above her head but she pondered the saying it was clear for presently she picked up his hand stooped to it and kissed it then lowering her head put his arm over her neck and looked at him from below it it was a pretty act one of her prettiest he saw the beauty of her gentle rebuke it sent him to his knees bingo sitting on her skirt looked pityingly at his master for a few seconds and then up into her face the end transcribers notes obvious printing
