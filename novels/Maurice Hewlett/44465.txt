images generously made available by the hathi trust cynthia by leonard merrick with an introduction by maurice hewlett new york ep dutton and company introduction my first acquaintance with mr merrick's engaging and stimulating muse was made in the pages of violet moses an early work which appeared i remember in three volumes reading it again in the light of my appreciation of what its author has done since i think of it now as i felt of it then it has great promise and though its texture is slight its fibres are of steel it shows the light hand which has grown no heavier though it has grown surer the little effervescence of cynicism with never a hiccough in it the underlying deeply funded sympathy with real things great things and fine things and the seriousness of aim which tantalisingly stops short just where you want it to go on and provokes the reader to get every book of mr merrick's as it appears just to see him let himself go which he never does he is one of the most discreet dissectors of the human heart we have in violet moses mr merrick avoided the great issue after coming up against it more than once so did he in the quaint companions a maturer but less ambitious study i don't know why he avoided it in violet's case unless it was because he found it too big a matter for his light battery in the companions' case i do know it was because he came upon another problem which interested him more a problem with a sentimental attraction far more potent than any he could have got out of miscegenation the result was the growth out of a rather ugly root of a charming and tender idyll of two poets an idyll nevertheless with a psychological crux involved in its delicate tracery all this seems a long way from cynthia which is my immediate business but is not so in truth in cynthia which i believe followed violet you have a problem of psychology laid out before you and again mr merrick does not i think fairly tackle it but he fails to tackle it not because it is too big for his guns as violet's was and not because he finds another which he likes better as he did when he was upon the companions but because i am going to suggest he found it too small he took up his positions opened his attack and the enemy in his trenches dissolved in mist the problem with which cynthia opens is the familiar one of the novelist considered as such and as lover husband father and citizen now it's an odd thing but not so odd as it seems at first blush that while you may conceive a poet in these relations and succeed in interesting your readers you will fail with a novelist i cannot now remember a single interesting novel about a novelist there is pendennis of course but who believes that pen was a great novelist or cares what kind of a novelist he was who cares about walter lorraine would anybody give twopence to read it the reason is that in the poet the manifestations of literary genius are direct and explicit some are susceptible of quotation some may be cut out with the scissors while in the novelist they are oblique and implied humphrey kent in cynthia is in no sense an explicit genius we are not in fact told that he was a genius at all his technique seems to have been that of mr george moore then rather fashionable the book puts it no higher than this that the hero with an obvious bent for writing marries in a hurry and then finds out that he cannot be an honest man and support his wife and child by the same stroke it is not whether he can be a good novelist and a good lover too but whether he can be a good novelist and pay his bills that's not very exciting though george gissing in new grub street drew out of it a squalid and miserable tale which once begun had to be finished luckily in cynthia mr merrick finds a secondary theme and handles it so delicately and so tenderly that the book has an abiding charm because of it that theme is the growth of cynthia's soul i myself am one of cynthia's victims and i am sure that mr merrick is another he sketches her with admirable reticence in the beginning where she is shown to us as very little more than a pretty girl his strokes are few and sure but she grows from chapter to chapter and at the end after the tragic crisis she sweeps onward to the sentimental crisis which crowns the tale of her married life with a dignity and grave beauty which justify a belief in hestia even now when modern testimony and practice alike are against such a belief she justifies mr merrick's conclusion too it is seldom enough that we are able to believe in the happy solution of such troubles as he has traced out in cynthia cynics against inclination we feel that the dog will return to his vomit after the easy reconciliation and facile tears upon hestia's generous bosom not so here cynthia has got her humphrey for what he is worth and will hold him she is one of mr merrick's loveliest women and he has made many lovely women maurice hewlett chapter i two friends were sitting together outside the cafe des tribunaux at dieppe one of them was falling in love the other an untidy and morose little man was wasting advice it was the hour of coffee and liqueurs on an august evening you are said the adviser irritably at the very beginning of a career you have been surprisingly fortunate there's scarcely a novelist in england who wouldn't be satisfied with such reviews as yours and it's your first book think twelve months ago you were a clerk in the city and managed to place about three short stories a year at a guinea each then your aunt what was her name left you the thousand pounds and you chucked your berth and sat down to a novel 'nothing happens but the unforeseen' the result justified you you sold your novel you got a hundred quid for it and the saturday and the spectator and every paper whose opinion is worth a rush hails you as a coming light for you to consider marrying now would be flying in the face of a special providence why said humphrey kent 'why' are you serious because your income is an unknown quantity because you've had a literary success not a popular one because if you keep single you've a comfortable life in front of you because you'd be a damned fool the climax is comprehensive if it isn't convincing but the discussion is a trifle 'previous' eh i can't marry you my pretty maid et cetera you are with her all day said turquand i conclude she likes you and the mother countenances it there's really nothing to countenance and remember they haven't any idea of my position they meet me at a fashionable hotel they had read the book and they saw the times review what do they know of literary earnings the father is on the stock exchange i believe i am an impostor you should have gone to the little show i recommended on the quay then i find it good enough kent laughed and stretched himself i am rewarding industry he said for once i wallow i came into the money and i put it in a bank and by my pen which is mightier than the sword i've replaced all i drew to live during the year ain't i entitled to a brief month's splash besides i've never said i want to marry i don't know what you're hacking at you haven't 'said' it but the danger is about as plain as pica to the average intelligence all the same my son how old are you twenty seven isn't it pack your bag ask for your bill and go back with me by the morning boat and if you're resolved to make an ass of yourself over a woman go and live in gilded infamy and buy sealskin jackets and jewellery while your legacy lasts i'll forgive you that the prescription wouldn't be called orthodox you'd find it cheaper than matrimony in the long run i promise you now and again when some man plays ducks and drakes with a fortune for a cocotte there are shrieks enough to wake his ancestors but marriage ruins a precious sight more men every year than the demi monde and the turf and the tables put together and nobody shrieks at all except the irrepressible children did it never occur to you that the price paid for the virtuous woman is the most exorbitant price known in an expensive world no said kent shortly it never did and they call you 'an acute observer' marriage is man's greatest extravagance the apothegm excepted it sounds like a dissipated copybook it's a fact upon my soul i tell you a sensible girl would shudder at the thought of entrusting her future to a man improvident enough to propose to her a fellow capable of marrying a woman is the sport of a reckless and undisciplined nature that she should beware of the end is curacoa and brandy said kent and in your best vein what else you'll contradict yourself with brilliance in a moment if you go on the journalist dissembled a grin and kent gazing down the sunny little street inhaled his cigarette pleasurably to suppose that miss walford would ever be his wife looked to him so chimerical that his companion's warnings did not disturb him yet he was sufficiently attracted by her to find it exciting that a third person could think it likely he was the son of a man who had once been very wealthy and who having attempted to repair injudicious investments by rasher speculation had died owning little more than enough to defray the cost of his funeral at the age of nineteen humphrey had realised that with no stock in trade beyond an education and a bundle of rejected manuscripts it was incumbent on him to fight the world unassisted and suppressing his literary ambitions as likely to tell against him he had betaken himself to some connections who throve in commerce and had been socially agreeable to be annihilated by a sense of your own deficiencies seek an appointment at the hands of relations the boy registered the aphorism and withdrew when life means merely a struggle to sustain existence it is not calculated to foster optimism and the optimistic point of view is desirable for the production of popular english fiction his prospect of achieving many editions would have been greater if his father had been satisfied with five per cent he shifted as best he could and garnered various experiences which he would have been sorry to think would be cited by his biographer if he ever had one poverty is no disgrace but there are few disgraces that cause such keen humiliations eventually he found regular employment in the office of a stranger and making turquand's acquaintance in the lodging house at which he obtained a bedroom contemplated him with respect and envy turquand was sub editing the outpost a hybrid weekly for which he wrote a little of what he thought and much that he disapproved in consideration of a modest salary the difference in their years was not too great to preclude confidences an intimacy grew between the pair over their evening pipes in the arid enclosure to which the landlady's key gave them access and it was transplanted to joint quarters embellished with their several possessions chiefly portmanteaus and photographs equally battered the elder man perceiving that there was distinction in the unsuccessful stories displayed to him imparted a good deal of desultory advice of which the most effectual part was not the assurance that the literary temperament was an affliction and authorship a synonym for despair the younger listened sighed and burned aching to be famous and fettered to a clerk's stool he tugged at his chains he had begun to doubt his force to burst them when he was apprised to his unspeakable amazement that a maternal aunt whom he had not seen since he was a school boy had bequeathed him a thousand pounds dieppe had dined and the grande rue was astir he watched the passers by with interest in the elation of his success he was equal to tackling another novel on the morrow and he saw material in everything in the chattering party of american girls running across the road to eat more ices at the pastrycook's in the coquettish dealer in rosaries and lives of the saints who had put up her shutters for the night and was bound for the opera in the little boy soldiers from the barracks swaggering everywhere in uniforms several sizes too big for them sentences from the reviews that he was still receiving bubbled through his consciousness deliciously and he wished swelling with gratitude that the men who wrote them were beside him that he might be introduced and grip their hands and try to express the inexpressible in words i should like to live here turk he remarked the atmosphere is right it's suggestive stimulating when i see a peasant leaning out of a window in france i want to write verses about her when i see the same thing at home i only notice she's dirty ah said turquand that's another reason why you had better go back with me to morrow the tendency to write verses leads to the casual ward let us go and watch the insolent opulence losing its francs the casino was beginning to refill and the path and lawn were gay with the flutter of toilettes when they reached the gates two of the figures approaching the rooms were familiar to the novelist and he discovered their presence with a distinct shock though his gaze had been scanning the crowd in search of them there are the walfords he said the other grunted he also had recognised a girl in mauve and kent watched her silently as long as she remained in view he knew that he had nerves when he saw miss walford the sight of her aroused a feeling of restlessness in him latterly which demanded her society for its relief and he had not denied to himself that when a stranger sitting behind him yesterday in the salon de lecture had withdrawn a handkerchief redolent of the corylopsis which miss walford affected it had provided him with a sensation profoundly absurd if he had nerves however there was no occasion to parade the fact and he repressed impatience laudably it was half an hour before the ladies were met objecting to be foolish he felt nevertheless that cynthia walford was an excuse for folly as she turned to him on the terrace with her faint smile of greeting felt with unreasoning gratification that turquand must acknowledge it she was a fair slight girl with dreamy blue eyes bewitchingly lashed and lips so delicately modelled that the faint smile always appeared a great tribute upon them she was no less beautiful for her manifest knowledge that she was a beauty and though she could not have been more than twenty two she had the air of carrying her loveliness as indifferently as her frocks which tempted a literary man to destruction she accepted admiration like an entremets at a table d'hote something included in the menu and arriving as a matter of course but her acceptance was so graceful that it was delightful to bend to her and offer it kent asked if they were going in to the concert and mrs walford said they were not it was far too warm to sit indoors to listen to that kind of music she found dieppe insufferably hot and ridiculously over rated now trouville was really lively didn't he think so he said he did not know trouville don't you oh it is ever so much better very jolly really most jolly we were there last year and enjoyed it immensely we we had such a time she giggled loudly how long are you gentlemen remaining mr turquand is 'deserting' to morrow he said i oh i shall have to leave in about a week i'm afraid you said that a week ago murmured miss walford i like the place he confessed i find it very pleasant myself mrs walford threw up her hands with a scream of expostulation her face was elderly despite her attentions to it but in her manner she was often a great deal more youthful than her daughter indeed while the girl had already acquired something of the serenity of a woman the woman was superficially reverting to the artlessness of a girl what is there to like dieppe is the casino and the casino is dieppe but the casino is very agreeable he said his glance wandering from her and the charges are perfectly monstrous though of course you extravagant young men don't mind that a friend might call me young said turquand gloomily my worst enemy couldn't call me extravagant oh i mind some of the charges returned kent i hate being 'done' she was pleased to hear him say so her chief requirement of a young man was that he should be well provided for but if he had the good feeling to exercise a nice economy till he became engaged it was an additional recommendation her giggle was as violent as before though oh i daresay she exclaimed facetiously i'm always being taken in i don't believe those stories any longer do you remember willy holmes cynthia and the tales he used to tell me i used to think that young man was so steady i was always quoting him and it turned out he was a regular scapegrace and everybody knew it all the time and had been laughing at me i've given up believing in any one mr kent in anyone do you hear she shook the splendours of her hat at him and gasped and gurgled archly i've no doubt you're every bit as bad as the rest he answered with some inanity miss walford asked him a question and he took a seat beside her in replying turquand sat down too twilight was falling and a refreshing breeze began to make itself felt a fashionable sea purled on the sand below with elegant decorum in the building the concert commenced and snatches of orchestration reached them through the chatter of american and english and french from the occupants of the chairs behind presently mrs walford wanted to go and play petits chevaux the sub editor involuntarily attached to the party accompanied her and kent and the girl followed the crowd round the tables was fairly large but turquand prevailed on the dame to see that there was space for four persons in a group she complimented him on his dexterity but immediately afterwards became fatigued and begged him to take her to the settee in the corner the party was now divided into couples chapter ii he had appreciated the manoeuvres sufficiently to feel no surprise when she found the room stifling ten minutes later and said that she must return to the terrace she had shown such small desire for his companionship hitherto however that he was momentarily uncertain which tete a tete was the one that she was anxious to prolong pouf she exclaimed as they emerged into the air it was unbearable where are the others didn't they come out too they have no idea we've gone said turquand dryly she was greatly astonished she had to turn before she could credit it i thought they were behind us she repeated several times i'm sure they saw us move oh well they'll find it out in a minute i expect never mind they strolled up and down sorry you're going mr turquand your friend will miss you very much i don't think so he answered he knew i was only running over for a few days he tells me it is the first holiday he has taken for years she said his profession seems to engross him i suppose it is an engrossing one but he oughtn't to exhaust his strength i needn't ask you if you've read his novel what do you think of it i think it extremely clever work said turquand and it's been a great success too eh 'one of the books of the year' the times called it it has certainly given him a literary position how splendid she said yes that's what i thought it 'extremely clever' brilliant most brilliant his parents must be very proud of him they're dead said turquand mrs walford was surprised again she had somehow taken it for granted that they were living and as she understood that he had no brothers or sisters it must be very lonely for him he sees a good deal of me said her escort and i'm quite a festive sort of person when you know me her giggle announced that she found this entertaining but the approval did not loosen his tongue she fanned herself strenuously and decided that besides being untidy he was dense of course in one way she pursued his condition is an advantage to him literary people have to work so hard if they depend on their writing don't they i do he assented i'm sorry to say his constant obtrusion of himself into the matter annoyed her very much she had neither inquired nor cared if he worked hard and she felt disposed to say so turquand who realised now why honours had been thrust upon him this evening regretted that loyalty to kent prevented his doing him what he felt would be the greatest service that could be rendered and removing the temptation of the mauve girl permanently from his path with talent and private means our author is fortunate i often tell him so he said if it doesn't tempt him to rest on his oars she added delightedly wealth has its dangers young men will be young men 'wealth' is a big word said he kent certainly can't be called 'wealthy' but he doesn't depend on his pen she cried with painful carelessness he has some private means i believe in fact i know it i am so glad so glad for him now i have no misgivings about his future at all have you i'm not sure that i follow you she played with her fan airily he is certain to succeed i mean he needn't fear anything as he has a competence oh i know what these professions are she went on laughing my son is in the artistic world we are quite behind the scenes i know how hard up some of the biggest professionals are when they have nothing but their profession to depend on a profession is so precarious shocking even when one has aptitude for it kent has more than 'aptitude' he said he has power perhaps he'll always work too much for himself and the reviewers to attract the widest public perhaps he's a trifle inclined to over do the analytical element in his stuff but that's the worst that can be said and then it's a question of taste for myself i'm a believer in the introspective school and i think his method's it schools and methods were meaningless to the lady in such a connection novels were novels and they were either good or they were rubbish if she understood anything about them and she had read them all her life she looked perplexed and reiterated the phrase that she had already used oh extremely clever brilliant most brilliant really i quite agree with you your son writes did you say mrs walford oh no not writes no no my son sings he sings he is studying for the operatic stage her tone couldn't have been more impressive if she had said he was de reszke his voice is quite magnificent really he replied with interest that's a great gift a voice he is 'coming out' soon she said he er could get an engagement at any moment but he is so conscientious he feels he must do himself justice when he makes his debut justice in professional circles he is thought an immense amount of immense has he sung at any concerts in private she explained socially he visits among musicians a great deal and of course it makes it very lively for us he is quite er in the swim you're to be congratulated on your family said turquand with such a son and a daughter like miss walford yes she is very much admired she admitted very much but a strange girl mr turquand you wouldn't believe how strange he did not press her to put him to the test but she supplied the particulars as if glad of the opportunity he remarked that in narrating matters of which she was proud she adopted a breathless staccato delivery which provoked the suspicion that she was inventing the facts as she went on she is most peculiar she insisted the matches she has refused appalling no he said a viscount she gasped she refused a viscount in monte carlo last year a splendid fellow enormously wealthy perfectly wild about her she wouldn't look at him you astonish me he murmured mrs walford shook her head speechlessly with closed eyes and there were others she said in a reviving spasm dazzling positions treated them like dirt she said if she didn't care for a man nothing would induce her what can one do with such a romantic goose be grateful that you aren't a mother mr turquand some day he opined without returning thanks the young lady will be induced oh and before long if it comes to that she nodded confidentially to tell you the truth i expect somebody here next week a young man rolling in riches and with expectations that oh tremendous he raves about her she has refused him er seven times seven times he wanted to commit suicide after her last rejection but she respects him immensely a noble fellow he is oh a most noble fellow and when he asks her again i rather fancy that pity'll make her accept him after all she must have felt it a grave responsibility observed the journalist politely that a young man said he wanted to commit suicide on her account that's just it she feels it a terrible responsibility oh she's not fond of him sorry for him you understand sorry and between ourselves i'm sure i really don't know what to think would be for the best i don't indeed but i wouldn't mind wagering a pair of gloves that if she doesn't meet mr right soon she'll end by giving in and mr somebody else will have stolen the prize before he comes hee hee hee turquand groaned in his soul in his mental vision his friend already flopped helplessly in the web and he derived small encouragement from the reflection that she was mistaken in the succulence of her fly you're not smoking she said do i don't mind it a bit he scowled at her darkly and was prepared to see betrothal in the eyes of the absent pair when they rejoined them as yet however they were still wedged in the crowd around the tables on their right a fat frenchwoman cried assez assez imploringly as her horse leading by a foot threatened at last to glide past the winning post and leave victory in the rear to their left an english girl evidently on her honeymoon was making radiant demands on the bridegroom's gold kent had lost sixteen francs and miss walford had lost five before they perceived that the others had retired we had better go and look for them she declared the well bred sea shimmered in the moonlight now and the terrace was so thronged that investigation could be made only in a saunter i wonder where they have got to she murmured her companion was too contented to be curious we're sure to come upon them in a minute he said do you abuse dieppe too miss walford not at all no it is mamma who is bored i should like to show you arques he said i'm sure your mother would be interested by that do you think we might drive over one afternoon i don't know she replied is it nice well 'nice' isn't what you will call it when you are there it's a ruined castle you know and you can almost 'hear' the hush of the place it's so solemn and still and old if you're very imaginative you can hear men clanking about in armour you would hear the men in armour i think am i imaginative she smiled aren't you he asked perhaps i am i don't know what makes you think so he was puzzled to adduce any reason excepting that she was so pretty he did not pursue the subject there are several things worth seeing here he said of course dieppe 'is only the casino' if one never goes anywhere else i suppose you haven't even heard of the cave dwellers the 'cave dwellers' she repeated their homes are the caves in the cliffs have you never noticed there are holes they are caves when you get inside vast ones one room leading out of another the people are beggars very dirty and occasionally picturesque they exist by what they can cadge and of course they pay no rent it's only when they come out that they see daylight how horrid she shivered and you went to look at them rather they are very pleased to 'receive' one of the inhabitants has lived there for twenty years i don't think he has been outside it for ten he sends his family many of the colony were born there don't you think they were worth a visit i don't know she said one might be robbed and murdered in such a place oh rather he agreed some of the inner rooms are so black that you literally can't see your hand before you it would be a beautiful place for a murder the next of kin lures the juvenile heiress there and bribes the beggars to make away with her unknown to him they spare her life because because why do they spare her life but they keep her prisoner and bring her up as one of themselves twenty years later i believe i could write a sensational novel after all what nonsense laughed miss walford daintily do you like that kind of story i like plots about real life best she said don't you he found this an exposition of the keenest literary sympathies and regarded her adoringly she preferred analysis to adventure and realism to romance what work he might accomplish inspired by the companionship of such a girl wherever have you been cynthia we thought you were lost he heard mrs walford say discordantly and the next moment they were all together it's where have you been mamma isn't it well i like that we didn't stop a minute i made certain you saw us get up we've been hunting for you everywhere mr turquand and i have been out here ever so long haven't we mr turquand looking at the moon too if you want to know and hee hee hee talking sentiment turquand who was staring at kent allowed an eyelid to droop for an instant at the conclusion and the latter stroked his moustache and smiled such a time we've been having all by ourselves she persisted uproariously mr kent are you shocked oh i've shocked mr kent he'll always remember it i can see it in his face i shall always remember you mrs walford he said trying to make the fatuity sound graceful we were left by ourselves and we had to get on as we could she cried hadn't we mr turquand i say we had to amuse ourselves as we could now cynthia's glowering at me oh hee hee hee you two young people are too respectable for us we don't ask any questions but but i daresay mr turquand and i aren't the only ones hee hee hee who have been 'looking at the moon' shall we find chairs again said kent quickly noting the frown that darkened the girl's brow it's rather an awkward spot to stand still isn't it she agreed that it was and a waiter brought them ices and mrs walford was giddy over a liqueur they remained at the table until she said that it was time to return to their hotel parting from them at its gates the two men turned away together both felt in their pockets filled their pipes and smoking silently drifted through the rugged little streets to the cafe where they had had their conversation after dinner 'thank you for a very pleasant evening' said turquand breaking a long pause it was the only criticism that he permitted himself and kent did not care to inquire if it was to be regarded as ironical chapter iii after his friend's departure the mother and daughter became the pivot round which the author's movements revolved primarily his own companionship and the novelty of dieppe had been enough but now he found it dreary to roam about the harbour or to sit sipping mazagrans alone reviewing the weeks before turquand joined him he wondered what he had done with himself in various hours of the day solitude hung so unfamiliarly on his hands that miss walford's society was indispensable soon after the chocolate and rolls he went with the ladies to the casino and spent the morning beside them under the awning mrs walford did not bathe while people could have comfortable baths in the vicinity of their toilet tables she considered that recourse to tents and the sea was making an unnecessary confidence and she disliked to see cynthia swim with a lot of frenchmen in the water whether it was their sex or only their nationality that was the objection was not clear she usually destroyed a copy of a novel while mr kent and her daughter talked considering the speed with which she read it indeed it was constantly astonishing to him that she could contrive to do a book so much damage in the evening they strolled out again and but for the afternoon he would have had small cause for complaint even this gained a spice of excitement however from the fact that it was uncertain how long miss walford's siesta would last and there was always the chance as he lounged about the hotel smoking to support the tedium that a door would open and cause heart leaps mrs walford thought that the visit to arques would be very jolly and the excursion was made about a week later kent found the girl's concurrence in his enthusiasm as pretty as he had promised himself it would be and when they had escaped from the information of the gardien and wandered where they chose to go the chaperon was the only blot upon perfection perhaps she realised the influence of the scene though her choice of adjectives was not happy the explorations made her tired before long since the others were so indefatigable they might explore while she rested it was as kent had said intensely still the practical obtruding itself for a moment he thought how blessed it would be to work here where doors could never slam and the yells of children were unknown they mounted a hillock and looked across the endless landscape silently in the dungeons under their feet lay dead men's bones but such facts concerned him little now far away some cattle or were they deer browsed sleepily under the ponderous trees of what consequence if they were cattle or deer still further where the blue sky dipped and the woodland rose a line of light glinted like water perhaps it was water and if not what matter it was the kingdom of imagination deer water fame or love the earth was what he pleased among the crumbling walls the girl's frock fluttered charmingly his eyes left the landscape and sought her face it's divine she said he could not disguise from himself that life without her would be unendurable i knew you'd like it he said unsteadily she regarded the questionable cattle again his tone had said much more kent stood beside her in a pause in which he believed that he struggled he felt that she was unattainable but there was an intoxication in the moment that he was not strong enough to resist he touched her hand and his hear pounding met her gaze as she turned cynthia he said in his throat the colour left her cheeks and her head drooped are you angry with me she was eminently graceful in the attitude i love you he said i love you what shall i say besides i love you she looked slowly up and blinded him with a smile its newness jumped and quivered through his nerves cynthia can you care for me perhaps she whispered he was alone with her in elysium adam and eve were not more secure from human observation when they kissed under the apple tree he drew nearer to her her eyes permitted in a miracle he had clasped a goddess and he would not have been aware of it if all the pins of birmingham had been concealed about her toilette to protest presently she said we must go back to mamma he had forgotten that she had one and the recollection was a descent what will she say he asked i'm not a millionaire dearest i am afraid she won't be pleased i'll tell her when we get home oh mamma likes you and you have a father he added feeling vaguely that the ideal marriage would be one between orphans whose surviving relatives were abroad and afraid of a voyage do you think they will give you to me after i've spoken to them she said deliciously yes oh they will be nice i am sure mr kent there then but one can't shorten it and it sounds a disagreeable sort of person not as you said it it was very wrong of you to make me say it so soon are you a tyrant we must really go back to mamma did you know i was fond of you asked kent i wandered why why did i wonder yes i don't know no tell me was it because you liked me you're vain enough already haven't i an excuse for vanity am i an excuse language failed him tell me why you wondered he begged because you're wickedly persistent i am everything that is awful cynthia yes because you liked me perhaps the weeniest scrap in the world oh you are horrid what things you make me say and we are only just engaged it's a glorious word don't be afraid of it i shall be afraid of you in a minute how do you think of your your proposals in your books i've only written one book did you make it up he didn't talk as you talk to me he wasn't so madly in love with her but he said the very sweetest things that's why you are horrid she declared again i don't know what you mean a bit mr kent who is he humphrey yes sweetheart now you've put it out of my head she laughed softly i was going to say something let me look at you till you think what it was perhaps that wouldn't help me oh you're an angel he exclaimed cynthia we shall always remember arques she breathed assent was this joan of arc's arques no noah's whose she said he was penitent he made haste to add not hers it is spelt differently besides i believe you're being silly she said in a puzzled tone i don't understand oh we must go back to mamma she'll think we're lost mrs walford didn't evince any signs of perturbation however when they rejoined her nor did she ask for particulars of what they had seen she seemed to think it likely that they might not feel talkative she said that she had enjoyed it all immensely sitting there in the shade and that the gardien who had come back to her had imparted the most romantic facts about the chateau around some of them she was convinced that mr kent could easily write an historical novel which she was sure would be deeply interesting though she never read historical novels herself had mr kent and cynthia any idea of the quantity of pippins grown in the immediate neighbourhood every summer the gardien had told her that as well no it had nothing to do with the chateau but it was simply extraordinary and the bulk of the fruit was converted into cider and the peasantry got it for nothing cider for nothing must be so very nice for them when they couldn't afford the wine and she had no doubt that it was much more wholesome too though personally she had tasted cider only once and then it had made her ill they drove down the dusty hill listening to her the girl spoke scarcely at all and the onus of appearing entertained devolved upon kent when the fiacre deposited them at the hotel at last he drew a sigh in which relief and apprehension mingled cynthia followed her mother upstairs and he caught a glance from her and smiled his gratitude but he questioned inwardly what would be the upshot of the announcement that she was about to make he perceived with some amusement that he was on the verge of an experience of whose terrors he had often read he was a candidate for a young lady's hand yes it made one nervous he asked himself for the twentieth time in the past few days if he had been mistaken in supposing that mrs walford over estimated his eligibility perhaps he was no worse off than she thought but even then he quaked for he had seen too little society since he was a boy to be versed in such matters and he was by no means ready to make an affidavit that she had encouraged him what was encouragement a signal at the entrance to the dining room was exciting but obscure and there was no opportunity for inquiries before the ladies took their seats he anathematised an epergne which to night seemed more than usually obstructive cynthia was in white he did not remember having seen her in the gown before and the glimpse of her queenliness shook him no mother would accord to him so peerless a treasure he had been mad it was interminable this procession of courses relieved by glances at a profile down the table his mouth was dry and he ordered champagne to raise his pluck it heated him without steadying his nerves the room was like a turkish bath yet the curve of cheek that he descried was as pale as the corsage how could she manage it he himself was bedewed with perspiration he could wait no longer he went on to the veranda and lit a cigar he saw mrs walford come out and throwing the cigar away rose to meet her she was alone where was cynthia seeking him or was her absence designed i hope our excursion hasn't tired you mrs walford oh dear no she assured him she hesitated but her manner was blithesome his courage mounted shall we take a turn she suggested mrs walford your daughter has told you what i of our conversation this afternoon perhaps i haven't many pretensions but i'm devoted to her and she is good enough to care a little for me will you give her to me and let me spend my life in making her happy she made a gesture of sudden artlessness i was perfectly astonished she exclaimed to tell you the truth mr kent i was perfectly astonished when cynthia spoke to me i hadn't an idea of it i er i don't know whether i'm particularly obtuse in these affairs hee hee hee but i hadn't a suspicion but you don't refuse he begged you don't disapprove she waved her hands afresh and went on jerkily with a wide fixed smile i never was more astounded in my life of course i er from what we've seen of you most desirable most desirable in many ways at the same time er cynthia's a delicate girl she has always been used to every luxury so few young men are really in a position to justify their marrying my position is this he said i've my profession and a little money not much a thousand pounds left me by a relative last year with a thousand pounds behind us i reckon that my profession would certainly enable us to live comfortably till i could support a wife by my pen alone her jaw dropped he felt it before he turned and shivered i'm afraid you don't think it very excellent he murmured she was breathing agitatedly it i must say er i fear her father would never sanction oh no i am sure it's out of the question a man may keep a wife on less without her suffering mrs walford my god if i thought that cynthia would ever know privation or distress do you suppose i would a wife she said a wife my dear mr kent a man must be prepared to provide for a family as well have you er any expectations i expect to succeed said kent i've the right to expect it no others may i ask how much your profession brings you in i sold my novel for a hundred pounds he answered it was my first he added as he heard her gasp it was my first mrs walford i love her at least think it over let me speak to her again let me ask her if she is afraid don't refuse to consider the pain in his voice was not without an effect on her disgust she was mercenary though she did not know it she was not good natured though she had good impulses she was ludicrously artificial but she was a woman and he was a young man she did not think of her own courtship for she had been sentimental only when her parents approved she hadn't married for money but her heart had been providentially warmed towards the one young gentleman of her acquaintance who was comfortably off she thought however of cynthia who had displayed considerable feeling in the bedroom an hour ago i must write to her father she said in a worried voice i really can't promise you anything i am very vexed at this sort of thing going on without my knowledge very vexed i shall write to her father to night i must ask you to consider the whole matter entirely indefinite until he comes immense responsibility immense i can't say any more mr kent she left him on the veranda his sensation was that she had shattered the world about him and that a weighty portion of the ruin was lying on his chest chapter iv when sam walford ran over to dieppe in obedience to his wife's summons he said well what's this damn nonsense louisa eh there's nothing in this you know this won't do cynthia is very cut up you had better tell her so i'm sure i wish we had waited and gone to brighton instead a lot of bother an author he said with amusement what do you do with authors you do 'find 'em' my dear i don't know what you mean she returned tartly i can't help a young man taking a fancy to her can i if you're so clever it's a pity you didn't stop here with her yourself if you don't think it's good enough you must say so and finish the matter that's all you're her father i'll talk to her he declared where is she now let's go and see and where's mr what d'ye call him what's he like mr kent he is a very nice fellow if he had been in a different position it would have been most satisfactory there's no doubt he's very clever highly talented the newspapers are most complimentary to him and er of course a novelist is socially er he has a certain damn it he can't keep a family on compliments can he i suppose he's a bull of himself eh thinks he ought to be snapped at nothing of the sort you always jump to such extraordinary conclusions she said he is a perfect gentleman and proposed for her beautifully after all there aren't many young men who've got so much as a thousand pounds in ready money but he isn't making anything you tell me objected mr walford they'll eat up a thousand pounds before they know where they are he wouldn't expect anything with her i suppose she shook her head violently no earthly occasion oh dear no let me go and see cynthia he said again it's a funny thing a girl like that hasn't ever had a good offer upon my soul it is you ask home such twopenny halfpenny men retorted his wife she is in her room i'll let her know you're here cynthia was cut up she liked humphrey kent very much and everything is relative she felt herself to be a juliet she considered it very unkind of mamma to oppose their marriage and said as much to her father with tears on her lashes and pathetic little sobs sam walford was sorry for her his affection for his children was his best attribute he said damn it several times more and then he patted her on the cheek and told her not to cry and went out on the plage to commune with tobacco after his cigar he sought a coiffeur there is a very excellent one in dieppe and he was shaved an operation that freshened him extremely and he had his thin hair anointed with various liquids of agreeable fragrance and most attractive hues and submitted his moustache to the curling irons the french barber will play with one for hours and when mr walford had acquired a carnation for his buttonhole and sipped a vermouth over the pages of gil blas it was time to think of returning to the hotel a pretty woman who had looked so demure in approaching that the impropriety was a sensation lifted her eyes to him and smiled as she passed he momentarily hesitated but remembered that it was near the dinner hour and that he was a father with a daughter's love affair upon his hands but he re entered the hotel in a good humour cynthia went to bed radiantly happy that night and kissed a bundle of lilies that had cost fifty francs for the capulets had relented the two men had had a long conversation on the terrace over their coffee and the senior who was favourably impressed had ended by being jovial and calling kent my boy and smacking him on the shoulder mrs walford was not displeased by the decision since it could never be said that she had advocated it my daughter's fiance mr kent the novelist you know sounded very well and she foresaw herself expatiating on his importance and determined what his income should be in her confidences to intimate friends really if the house were nice he might be making anything she liked who could dispute her assertions the capulets had relented and the sun shone especially in paris where kent went in haste to get the engagement ring the thirsty trees were shuddering in the glare and the asphalt steamed but to wait had been impossible though the stay at dieppe was drawing to a close and they would all be back in london soon it seemed to him that it would be as the signing of the agreement when cynthia put her finger through his ring and he was resolved that it should be a better one than any of those that her mother wore with such complacence poor devil of an author though he was her acquaintances shouldn't see that cynthia was marrying badly by the very emblem of his devotion in the rue de la paix he spent an hour scrutinising windows before he permitted himself to enter a shop he chose finally a pearl and diamonds one big white pearl and a diamond flashing on either side of it it was in a pale blue velvet case lined with white satin he was satisfied with his purchase and so was the salesman cynthia's flush of delight as he disclosed it repaid him superabundantly and when the girl proudly displayed it to them he was gratified to observe her parents' surprise the cries of admiration into which mrs walford broke were fervent and instantaneously she decided to say that he was making three thousand a year his days were now delicious to kent a magic haze enwrapped their stereotyped incidents so that the terrace of the casino the veranda of the hotel nature and the polyglot lounging crowd itself were all beatified they were as familiar things viewed in a charming dream the pleasant fields traversed so oft which were still more pleasant as they appeared to the sleeping soldier a tenderness overflowing from his own emotions was imparted to the scenes and he found it almost impossible to realise sometimes that the goddess beside him who had been so unapproachable a month ago was actually to belong to him it dazzled him it seemed incredible he had once sat down in the salon de lecture with the intention of informing turquand of his joy but the knowledge that the news entailed a defence if he didn't wish to write formally had resulted in his writing nothing delicacy demanded that he should excuse his action by word of mouth if excuses were required at all to do such a thing in permanent pen strokes looked to him profanation of an angel and an insult to the bounty of god mr walford was not able to remain at dieppe till the day fixed for the others' return nor he said genially was there any occasion for him to put himself out now that he had a prospective son in law to take his place humphrey was well content he understood that the elder lady was a bad sailor and clung obstinately to the saloon and he anticipated several golden hours to which the paternal presence would have proved alloy he was not disappointed sustained by heidsieck and the stewardess mrs walford stayed below as usual and he tasted the responsibility of having the girl in his charge he let the flavour dissolve on his palate slowly it was as if they were already on the honeymoon he thought as they paced the deck together or he made her comfortable in a chair and brought her strawberries he watched her eat them with amused interest vaguely conscious that he found it wonderful to see her mouth unclose and a delicate forefinger and thumb grow pinky you are sure you have the address right she asked humphrey fancy if you lost it and could never find us again after we said good bye to day wouldn't it be awful awful such a thing might happen she declared you try and try your hardest to remember where we told you we lived but you can't it is terrible you go mad or to a post office he said she laughed gaily how could you write to me when you'd forgotten the address you foolish fellow there i was brighter than you that time he felt it would be prolix to explain that he was thinking of a directory and not of stamps come after that i must really hear if you've learnt your lesson what is it quick you live in a house called the hawthorns he said one of the houses you would have called it the cedars only that was the name of the house next door i take the train to streatham hill i must be very particular to say 'hill' or catastrophes will happen to begin with i shall lose an hour of your society and dinner dinner will certainly be over dinner will certainly be over when i come out i turn to the right pass the estate agent's take the first to the left and recollect that i'm looking for a bow window and a white balcony and a fence that makes it impossible to see them do i know it not 'impossible' but yes i'll trust you he parted from the women at victoria and getting into a hansom gave himself up to reflection the rooms that he shared with turquand were in the convenient if unfashionable neighbourhood of soho and an all pervading odour of jam reminded him presently that he was nearing his destination he wasn't sure of finding turquand in at this hour he opened the door with his latchkey and dragging his portmanteaus into the passage ran upstairs the journalist in his shirt sleeves was reading an evening paper with his slippered feet crossed on the window sill hallo he said you've got back yes said humphrey how the jam smells it's raspberry to day i've come to the conclusion that the raspberry's the most penetrating how are you dry and hungry too is there anything to drink in the place there's a very fine brand of water on the landing and there's the remainder of a roll extra sec in the cupboard i believe i finished the whisky last night we can go and have some dinner at the suisse madame is desolee she's asked after you most tenderly good old madame and her moustache more luxuriant there was a pause in which humphrey considered how best to impart his tidings the other shifted his feet and contemplated the smoke dried wall the only view attainable from the window kent stared at him it was displayed to him clearly for the first time that his marriage would mean severance from turquand and the restaurant suisse and all that had been his life hitherto and that turquand might feel it more sorely than he expressed he was sorry for turquand he lounged over to the mantelpiece and dipped his hand in the familiar tobacco jar and filled a pipe before he spoke well he said with an elaborate effort to sound careless i suppose you'll hardly be astonished old chap i'm engaged chapter v turquand did not answer immediately no he said at last i'm not astonished nothing could astonish me excepting good news when is the event to take place that's not settled soon we shall always be pals turk i'll come and see you sometimes oh yes father consented things are quite smooth all round h'mph he looked hard at the wall and pulled his beard you said it would happen didn't you i didn't see a glimmer of a possibility myself love's blind you know you said too it er it wouldn't be altogether a wise step you'll change your mind about that one day turk hope so said turquand can't to night you still believe i'm making a mistake what need is there to discuss it now why shouldn't we why should we why argue with a man whether the ice will bear after he has made a hole in it we shan't be extravagant and i shall work like blazes i've a plot simmering already happy ending this time i don't quite see it to be consistent no you must manage it they like happy endings consistent or not damn it i mean to be true i won't sell my birthright for a third edition i shall work like blazes and we shall live quite quietly somewhere in a little house that's impossible said turquand you may live in a little house or you may live quietly but you can't do both things at the same time in the suburbs in streatham probably her people live in streatham and of course she would like to be near them and you will have a general servant eh with large and fiery hands like cornelia downstairs only she'll look worse than cornelia because your wife will dress her up in muslins and streamers and try to disguise the generality if you work in the front of your pretty little house your nervous system 'll be shattered by the shrieks of your neighbours' children swinging on the gates forty pound a year houses in the suburbs are infested with children nothing seems to exterminate them and the inevitable gates groan like souls in hell and if you choose the back you'll be assisted by the arrival of the joint and the vegetables and the slap of the milk cans and cornelia the second's altercations with the errand boys a general servant with a tin pail alone is warranted to make herself heard for eleven hundred and sixty yards life hasn't made an optimist of you observed kent less cheerfully that you clack about 'happy endings' the optimist is like the poet he's born he isn't made speaking of life i suppose you'll assure yours when you marry yes said kent meditatively yes that's a good idea i shall but your suggestions are none of them too exhilarating he added let's go to dinner the sub editor put on his jacket and sought his boots i'm ready he announced by the way i never thought to inquire mrs walford hasn't a large family has she a son as well that's all why i congratulate you said turquand it was the first time the word had passed his lips it's a truism to say that a man should never marry anybody but if he must blunder with someone let him choose an only child marrying into a large family's more expensive still his wife has for ever got a sister having a wedding or a christening or a birthday and wanting a present or a brother asking for a loan or dying and plunging her into costly crape yes i congratulate you humphrey expressed no thanks and he determined to avoid the subject of his engagement as much as possible in their conversations hence forward he was due at the hawthorns the following afternoon at five o'clock and his impatience to see the girl again was intensified by the knowledge that he was about to see her in her home the day was tedious in the morning it was showery and he was chagrined to think that he was doomed to enter the drawing room in muddy shoes but after lunch the sky cleared and when he reached victoria the pavements were dry the train started late and travelled slowly but he heard a porter bawling stretta mill on the welcome platform at last and making the station's acquaintance with affectionate eyes he hastened up the steps and in the direction of the house he was prepossessed by its exterior and his anticipations were confirmed on entering the hall mrs walford was in the garden he was told and the parlourmaid led him there it was an extremely charming garden it was well designed and it had a cedar and a tennis court which was pleasant to look at though tennis was not an accomplishment that his life had furnished opportunities for acquiring and it contained a tea table under the cedar's boughs and cynthia in a basket chair and a ravishing frock he was welcomed with effusion and he presented his chocolates mr walford already returned from town was quite parental in his greeting tea was very nice and english in the cedar's shade and cynthia's presence it was very nice too to be made so much of in the circumstances really they were very delightful people the son was in germany he learnt or we could have given you a treat my boy if you are fond of music exclaimed the stock jobber you will hear a voice when he comes back that's luck for a fellow to be born with an organ like caesar's he'll be making five hundred a week in twelve months i tell you it's wonderful 'five hundred a week' echoed mrs walford he'll be making more than five hundred a week i hope before long they get two or three hundred a night not voices as fine as caesar's and won't go on the stage till they have had their money either you talk such nonsense sam absurd i said 'in twelve months' murmured her husband deprecatingly i said in 'twelve months' my dear he turned to kent and added confidentially there isn't a bass in existence to compare with him you'll say so when you hear ah let me introduce you to another member of the family my wife's sister kent saw that they had been joined by a spare little woman with a thin pursed mouth and a nose slightly pink she was evidently a maiden lady and his hostess's senior her tones were tart and when she said that she was pleased to meet him he permitted himself no illusion that she spoke the truth miss wix as a matter of fact was not particularly pleased to meet anybody she lived with the walfords because she had no means of her own and it was essential for her to live somewhere but she accepted her dependence with mental indignation and fate had soured her under a chilly demeanour she often burned secretly with the consciousness that she was not wanted and the knowledge found expression at long intervals in an emotional outbreak in which she quarrelled with louisa violently and proclaimed an immediate intention of taking a situation what kind of situation she thought she was competent to fill nobody inquired neither did the threat ever impose on anyone nor did she take more than a preliminary step towards fulfilling it she nursed the wanted columns of the telegraph ostentatiously for a day or two and waited for the olive branch the household were aware that she must be persuaded to forgive them and she was duly persuaded relapsing into the acidulated person in whom hysteria looked impossible a year or so later the outbreak would be repeated and she would then threaten to take a situation quite as vehemently as before tea aunt emily yes please if it hasn't got cold humphrey took it to her she stirred the cup briskly and eyed him with critical disfavour i've read your book mr kent oh he responded as she did not say any more have you miss wix very good i'm sure she brought out after a further silence he would not have imagined the simple words capable of conveying so clearly that she thought it very small beer indeed i suppose you're in the middle of another no he replied not yet really she obviously considered that he ought to be you should call her 'aunt' exclaimed sam walford you'll have to call her 'aunt emily' we don't go in for formality my boy rough diamonds perhaps mr kent thinks it would be rather premature suggested miss wix he talked to cynthia fruit and fowls might be admired if he liked and she and papa took him on a tour of inspection there were moments when he was alone with cynthia while her father discovered that there weren't any eggs he is very good looking said mrs walford don't you think so i can't say he struck me as being remarkable for beauty said the spinster i didn't say he was 'remarkable for beauty' but he has er distinction decided distinction i'm surprised you don't see it and he has very fine eyes his eyes won't give 'em any carriage and pair replied miss wix i used to have fine eyes my dear but i've stared at hard times so long i don't know where the 'hard times' come in i'm sure exclaimed mrs walford sharply and he wanted to give her a carriage directly they marry but sam's forbidden it the maiden sniffed he is most modest for his position i tell you he was chased in dieppe the women ran after him a baroness in the hotel positively threw her daughter at his head he wouldn't look at anybody but cynthia the baroness was miserable the day the engagement was known cynthia ought to be very proud returned her sister dryly oh of course the girl is making a wonderful match no doubt about it he sold his novel for an extraordinary sum quite extraordinary and the publishers have implored him to let them have another at his own terms i saw the telegrams astonishing position for such a young man she's in luck she's a very taking girl her smile is so sweet and her teeth are quite perfect she was in luck to meet such a catch some i people didn't have the opportunity i once had a beautiful set of teeth added miss wix morosely but you can't pick rich husbands off gooseberry bushes on the white balcony after dinner kent begged cynthia to fix the wedding day after she had named one in may it was agreed that subject to her parents' approval they should be married two months hence he made his way to the station about eleven o'clock with a flower in his coat and rapture in his soul the first weeks of the period were interminable he went to the hawthorns daily and mrs walford was so good as to look about for a house for them in the neighbourhood he was in love but not a fool he was determined not to cripple himself at the outset by a heavy rental in conference with the fiancee he intimated that it would be preposterous for them to think of paying a higher rent than fifty pounds cynthia was a little disappointed for mamma had just seen a villa at sixty five that was a picturesque duck he strangled an impulse to say we'll take it and repeated that as soon as their circumstances brightened they could remove she did not argue the point though the rara avis evidently allured her and kent felt her acquiescence to be very gracious and wondered if he sounded mean the outlay on furniture did not worry him much as mrs walford pointed out the things would always be there and once they were bought they were bought in her company they proceeded to tottenham court road every morning for a week and this one sped more quickly to him than any yet it was a foretaste of life with cynthia to choose armchairs and etchings and ornaments and the rest for their home together they had found a house at fifty pounds per annum it was about ten minutes' walk from the hawthorns a semi detached villa in red brick with nice wide windows and electric bells and rose trees on either side of the tessellated path they wanted to be able to drive up to it when they returned from the honeymoon and find it ready for them mrs walford was to buy the kitchen utensils and engage a servant while they were away all they had to do now was to buy the articles of interest and settle the wall papers and have little intermediate luncheons and go back to the shop and sip tea while rolls of carpet were displayed it was great fun in the shops though the things seldom seemed to look so nice as they had done in the catalogues and it was generally necessary to pay more than had been foreseen but again once they were bought they were bought the thought was sustaining if kent felt blank when he contemplated the total of what they had spent and remembered that the kitchen clamoured still he reflected that to kiss cynthia in such a jolly little menage would certainly be charming and the girl averred ecstatically that the dessert service looked better than mamma's he estimated that they could live in comfort on two hundred and fifty a year for the first year at all events and by then he would have finished a novel which in view of the press notices that he had had he believed would bring them in as much as that even if it did not there would be a substantial portion of his capital remaining and with the third book no he had no cause for dismay he told himself they had decided upon mentone for the wedding trip a fortnight it was long enough and they both felt that they would rather go to mentone for a fortnight than to bournemouth or ventnor for a month it would amount to much the same thing financially and be much more pleasant the morning after we come back darling said kent i shall go straight to my desk after breakfast and you know you'll see scarcely more of me till evening than if i were a business man and had to go to the city y e s concurred cynthia meekly of course i understand chapter vi mr and mrs waxford's present was to be a grand piano or possibly a semi grand since the drawing room was not extensive and with a son being educated for the musical profession it was natural that they shouldn't select it till he returned they wished for the advantage of his judgment he was travelling he was on the continent with pincocca the master under whom he studied on hearing of his sister's engagement he had at once despatched affectionate letters and now he was expected home in two or three days to make mr kent's acquaintance and tender his felicitations in person the better kent learnt to know the walfords the more clearly he perceived how inordinately proud they were of their son caesar's arrival and caesar's approaching debut were topics discussed with a frequency he found tedious even cynthia was so much excited by the prospect of reunion that a tete a tete with her lost a little of its fascination he occasionally feared that if his prospective brother in law did not arrive without delay he would have been bored into a cordial dislike for him by the time they met he foresaw himself telling him so at a distant date and their joking over the matter together miss wix alone appeared untainted by the prevailing enthusiasm and the first ray of friendliness for the spinster of which he had been conscious was due to a glance of comprehension from her eyes one afternoon when caesar had been discussed energetically for upwards of half an hour it struck him that there was even a gleam of ironical humour in her gaze enthralling isn't it she seemed to say what do you think of 'em he said to cynthia later they do talk about your brother and his voice an awful lot dearest don't they she looked somewhat startled well i suppose we do she answered slowly now you point it out but i didn't know you see ever since his voice was discovered caesar's been brought up for the profession when you've heard it you'll understand is it really so wonderful he asked respectfully oh i'm sure you'll say so signor pincocca told mamma it would be a crime if she didn't let him study seriously for the career and caesar has been under him years since then pincocca says when he 'comes out' people 'll rave about him if he had had just a 'fine voice' he would have gone on the stock exchange you know with papa but but there could be no question about it with a gift like that kent acknowledged that it was natural they should be profoundly interested by the young fellow's promise privately he wished that a literary man could also leap into fame and fortune with his debut the next afternoon when he reached the hawthorns he heard that caesar had already come indeed he had divined as much by mrs walford's jubilant air at the moment the gentleman was not in the room cynthia ran to fetch him humphrey awaited his entrance with considerable curiosity and the mother kept looking impatiently towards the door i don't know what's keeping him she said in her most staccato tones he went to fetch my book oh he'll be here in a minute or shall we go and look for him perhaps he's in the garden and cynthia can't find him what do you say just as you please said kent but as he spoke the girl returned to announce that her brother was following her and the next moment there was an atmosphere of brillantine and tuberoses and humphrey found his finger tips being gently pressed in a large moist palm i am charmed said caesar walford with a lingering smile charmed kent saw a fat young man of six or seven and twenty with an enormous chest development and a waist that suggested that he wore stays and was already wrestling with his figure his hair which had been grown long was arranged on his forehead in a negligent curl and his shirt collar low in the neck surmounted a flowing bow i'm very pleased to meet you said the author with disgust i am charmed repeated caesar tenderly it's quite a delight and it's you who are going to take cynthia away from us eh he glanced from one to the other and shook a playful forefinger you bad man o wicked puss mrs walford viewed these ponderous antics beamingly there's grace her expression cried there's dramatic gesture for you again humphrey's gaze sought the sour spinster's and yes her own was eloquent he sipped his tea abstractedly so this was the gifted being of whom he had heard so much this dreadful creature who bulged out of his frock coat and minced and posed and was alternately frisky and pompous what a connection to have was it possible that his voice was so magnificent as they all declared or would that be a disappointment too in any case his self complacence made a stranger ill it was about two hours after dinner that the young man was begged to oblige the company and humphrey who was now truly eager to hear him feared for a long while that the persuasions would not succeed for the coming bass objected in turn to wagner and verdi and all the songs in his repertoire he shrugged his shoulders pityingly at this one had forgotten another and was not equal this evening to a third at last however cynthia rose and insisted that he should give them infelice ernani was intolerable but since they would not let him alone he crossed languidly to her side a hush of suspense settled upon the long drawing room sam walford fixed kent with a stare as if he meant to watch the admiration begin to bubble in him louisa the hilarious and untruthful appeared to be experiencing some divine emotion even before the first note miss wix closed her eyes with her mouth to one side then the young man languished at the gasalier and roared it was a prodigious roar no one could dispute that he possessed a voice of phenomenal power if it were once conceded to be a voice in the musical sense at all it seemed as if he must burst his corsets and shift the furniture that the ceiling itself must split with the noise that he hurled up perspiration broke out on him and rolled down his face as he writhed at the gas globes his large body was contorted with exertion but he never faltered bellow upon bellow he produced to the welcome end till cynthia struck the final chord and he bowed a performance asked walford swollen with pride kent said indeed it was the compliments were effusive it was discussed whether he was or was not in voice to night he explained that to lose himself when he sang he needed pincocca at the piano he sank into his chair again and mopped his wet curl the amateur accompaniment is very painful he said winningly kent took leave of the family earlier than was his custom asserting that he had work to do the momentous date was now close at hand and turquand who had not refused to be best man had made a present that was lavish all things considered in the days that intervened humphrey and he found it impracticable to taboo the subject of the wedding it was arranged that on the eve of the ceremony they should have a bachelor dinner by themselves and subsequently smoke a few cigars together in a music hall neither wanted anybody else nor in point of fact did humphrey know many men to invite for time to attend the wedding the journalist had applied to his editor on the grounds of a bereavement and as he watched kent collect possessions and pore over a continental bradshaw and fondle the sacred ring he was more than ever convinced that he had used the right term it was a wet evening the eve of the wedding day a yellow mist hung over soho and a light rain had fallen doggedly since noon turning the grease of the pavements to slush on the moist air the smell of the jam clung persistently and along the narrow streets fewer children played tip cat than was usual in the district kent's impedimenta were packed and labelled and a brown paper parcel among the litter contained the best man's new suit the coat would be creased by the morrow and he knew it but he had a repugnance to undoing the parcel sooner than was compulsory and once when kent was not looking he had kicked it the two men put up their collars and made their way across the square are you sure we'll go to the suisse asked kent it isn't festive turk yes let's go to the suisse said turquand grumpily it's close both knew that its proximity was not the reason that it had been chosen but the pretence was desirable we'll have champagne of course said humphrey as they passed in and took their seats at their customary little table with its half yard of crusty bread and damp napkins we'll have champagne and and be lively for heaven's sake don't look as if you were at a funeral turk this is to be an enjoyable evening where's the wine list champagne what for said turquand auguste will think you're getting at him auguste was prevailed upon to believe that the demand was made in sober earnest that being the case he could run out for champagne no less easily than for bittare madame at the semi circular counter waved her fat hand in their direction gaily monsieur had inherited a fortune it was evident well said turquand when the cork had popped here's luck wish you lots of happiness old chap i'm sure same to you murmured kent god knows i do it's awful muck this stuff isn't it what's he brought it's what you ordered your mouth's out of taste eat some more kidneys humphrey shook his head i suppose you'll come here to morrow evening the same as usual eh may as well i suppose one's got to feed somewhere you'll be all rice and rapture then i'll think of you do i don't know how it is but but just now somehow between ourselves but perhaps i oughtn't to say that i say don't think i was going to to i wouldn't have you think i meant i wasn't fond of her old boy for the world you don't think that do you she oh heaven she's a perfect angel turk fill up your glass for goodness' sake man and do look jolly turk next time we dine together it'll be at streatham and there'll be a little hostess to make you welcome and and there'll always be a bottle of irish old man and we'll keep a pipe in the rack with the biggest bowl we can find and call it yours by god we will yes said turquand huskily going to have any more of this stew i've had enough help yourself no i'm not ravenous either smoked too much perhaps i say madame doesn't know yet better tell her she was induced to join them presently and to drink a glass of champagne enchanted by the invitation monsieur kent was always si gentil but champagne was it that he celebrated already another romance comment he was going to be married nevare but yes to morrow ah mon dieu she rocked herself to and fro and screamed the intelligence down the dinner lift to her husband in the kitchen alors they must drink a chartreuse with her she insisted yes and she would have one of monsieur kent's cigarettes to the health of the happy pair outside the rain was still falling as they left the restaurant suisse and tramped to a music hall here their entrance was unfortunately timed some good turns appeared earlier in the programme some good turns figured lower down but during the half hour that they remained the monotony of the material that the average music hall comedian regards as humorous struck kent more forcibly than ever wives eloped with the lodgers or husbands beat their wives and got drunk with the boys there seemed nothing else nothing but conjugal infelicity it was rang tang tang on the one vulgar discordant note i've had enough of this he said let's go what time is it time for a quiet pipe at home and then to turn in early let's cab it they were glad to take off their wet boots and to find themselves back in their own shabby chairs but cornelia had let the fire out and the dismantled room was chilly turquand produced the whisky and the glasses and blowing a cloud they drew up to the cold hearth remarking that the weather had turned muggy and that a fire would have been out of place on such a night it looks bare without my things doesn't it observed kent one wouldn't have believed they made so much difference yes assented turquand you'll have to get some books for that shelf over there you know it's awful empty turquand shivered and said that he should you aren't cold cold not a bit no you were saying i don't know i wasn't saying anything particular i'll write you from mentone old fellow not at once but you shall have a line thanks answered turquand be glad to hear from you not that there'll be anything to say no of course not still you may just as well twaddle if you will there was a pause while the pair smoked slowly each busy with his thoughts and considering if anything of what he felt could be said without its sounding sentimental both were remembering that they would never be sitting at home together in the room again and though it had many faults it assumed to the one who was leaving it a tender grace now he had written his novel at that table his first review had come to him here associations crept out and trailed across the floor he felt that this room must always contain an integral portion of his life and turquand would miss him be dull for you to morrow evening rather i'm afraid won't it he said in a burst oh i was alone while you were at dieppe you know i shall jog along all right you've bought a desk for yourself haven't you yes swagger eh you won't 'know where yer are' what's that do you feel a draught no i well perhaps there is a draught now you mention it yes i shall work in style when we come back strange feeling going to be married turk is it said turquand haven't had the experience hope mrs kent will like me they never do in fiction you you might tell her i'm not a bad sort of a damned fool will you and er i want to say don't have the funks about asking me to your house once in a way old chap when i shan't be a nuisance take my oath i'll never shock your wife humphrey too fond of you be as careful as as you can i give you my word his teeth closed round his pipe tightly neither man looked at the other humphrey put out his hand without speaking and turquand gripped it there was a silence again both stared at the dead ashes the clock of st giles in the fields tolled twelve and neither commented on it though each reflected that it was now the marriage morning strikes me we were nearly making bally asses of ourselves said turquand at last in a shaky voice finish your whisky and let's to bed chapter vii as the wheels began to revolve he looked at the girl with thanksgiving perhaps the top feeling in the tangle of his consciousness was relief that the worry and publicity of the day were over they were married for good or for ill for always whether things went well or went badly with him she was his wife now he realised the fact much more clearly here in the train than he had done at the altar indeed at the altar he had realised little but the awkwardness of his attitude and that cynthia was very nervous and he was glad but knowing that he was glad he wondered vaguely why he did not feel more exhilarated they were alone in the compartment and he took her hand and spoke to her she answered by an obvious effort and both sat gazing from the window over the flying fields she thought of her home and that everything was very strange and that she would have liked to cry properly without having humphrey's eyes upon her kent wondered whether she would like to cry while he affected to be unaware of it behind a paper or whether she would imagine he wanted to read and consider him unfeeling he thought that a wedding day was a very exhausting experience for a girl and that her evident desire to avoid conversation was fortunate since to save his soul he could not think of anything to say that wasn't stupid he thought also though his palate did not crave tobacco that a cigar would have helped him tremendously and that it was really extraordinary to reflect that he and cynthia walford were man and wife next he questioned inwardly what she was thinking and attempted in a mental metamorphosis to put himself in her place it made him feel horribly sorry for her he pitied her hotly though he could not say so and by a sudden impulse he squeezed her gloved fingers again with remorseful sympathy at the moment that he was moved to the demonstration however she was really wishing that the dressmaker had cut the corsage of her blue theatre frock square instead of in a v she was sure it would have looked much better he was agreeably conscious that his mind had something feminine in it and congratulated himself on his insight into hers some men would have failed to comprehend cynthia was distressfully conscious that the tears with which she was fighting had made her nose red and she longed for an opportunity to use her powder puff the engine screamed both spoke perfunctorily the train sped on as he sat by her side before the sea he looked not at the girl but within him he thought of the book that had formed in his head and perhaps his paramount feeling was impatience and the desire to find the first chapter already materialising into words they were married the unconscious pretences of the betrothal period were over in both to him as well as to her the magic the subtile enchantment was past she was still cynthia more than ever cynthia he understood but there had been a fascination when cynthia was a goddess to him which an acquaintance with strings and buttons had destroyed the corylopsis stood in a squat little bottle with a silver lid among brushes and hair pins on a toilet table and his senses swam no more when he detected its faintness on her frock companionship and not worship was required now and neither found the other quite so companionable as had been expected this the girl in her heart excused less readily than the man primarily indeed the latter refused to acknowledge it it was preposterous to suppose that if they did not possess much in common he would riot have perceived the disparity during the engagement then he reminded himself that his life might have tendered him a shade intolerant he must remember that the subject of literary work all engrossing to his own mind made on hers unaccustomed demands to try to phrase a sensation the attempt to seize a fleeting impression so delicately that it would survive the process and not expire on the pen's point were instinctive habits with himself to her they appeared motiveless and wearisome games he had endeavoured in the novels that they read together during the honeymoon to cultivate her appreciation of what was fine for she had told him some of her favourite authors and he had shuddered she had obtained a book for herself one day and offered it to him he had thanked her but said that he was sure by the title that he wouldn't care for it she answered that it was very silly and unliterary she had acquired that word to judge a book by what it was called she was surprised at him if she had done such a thing he would have ridiculed her and apart from that she did not see that winsome winnie was a bad title what was the matter with it kent said he could not explain she declared with a little triumphant laugh that that just showed how wrong he was he made his endeavour very tenderly to be looked upon as the schoolmaster abroad was a constant dread with him when he discovered that to effect a similarity of taste between them either she must advance or he must regress sometimes very occasionally he handed her a passage with an air of taking it for granted that the pleasure would be mutual but her assent was always so constrained that he was forced to realise that the cleverness of expression was lost upon her that to her the word painting had painted nothing at all he wondered if his wife's dulness of vision fairly represented the eyes with which the novel reading public read and if it was folly to spend an hour revising a paragraph in which the majority would after all see no more artistry than if it had been allowed to remain as it was written first he knew that it was folly in a man like himself with whom literature was a profession and not a luxury though he was aware at the same time that he would never be able to help it that to the end there would be nights when he went up to bed having written no more than a hundred words all day and yet went up with elation because rightly or wrongly he felt the hundred words to have been admirably said he knew that there would be evenings in the future as there had been in the past when after reading a page of a master's prose with delight he would go and tear up five sheets of his own manuscript with disgust and he knew already though he shrank from admitting this that when it happened he would never be able to confess it to cynthia as he had done to turquand because cynthia would find it absurd the fortnight was near its conclusion and both looked forward with eagerness to the return to england he would plunge into his work she would be near the hawthorns and have friends to come to see her neither of the pair regretted the step that they had taken each loved the other but a honeymoon was a trying institution viewed as a whole presently where they sat she turned and put some questions to him about his projected book her intentions were praiseworthy she was a good girl and having married an author she understood that it was incumbent on her to take an interest in his work though she had fancied once or twice that perhaps it would have been nicer if like a stock jobber he had preferred not to discuss his business at home papa had never cared to do so she knew discussing an author's business was not so simple as she had assumed there seemed to be such a mass of tedious detail that really didn't matter when do you think it will be finished humphrey she said in nine months i hope if i stick to it so long as nine months she exclaimed with surprise why i've read let me see two three new ones of mrs st julian's this year will it really take so long as nine months quite sweetheart perhaps longer i don't write quickly i'm sorry to say still it won't be bad business if cousins pay the two hundred and fifty that i expect i think they ought to after the way the last has been received some people get much more don't they just a trifle he said yes but i'm not a popular writer you see wait a bit though we'll astonish your mother with our grandeurs yet you shall have a victoria and two men on the box with powdered hair and drive out on a wet day and splash mud at your enemies i don't think i have any enemies she laughed you will have when you have the victoria and pair some poor beggar of an author who's hoping to get two hundred and fifty pounds for nine months' toil will look at you from a bus and cuss you suppose you can't get two hundred and fifty she inquired you can't be sure oh well if it were only a couple of hundred we shouldn't have to go to the workhouse you know if it comes to that a hundred the same as i got for the other would see us through though of course i wouldn't accept such a price don't begin to worry your little head about ways and means on your honeymoon darling there's time enough for arithmetic and it's going to be good work i've been practical too i can end it happily and retain a conscience it's almost a different plot from what it was when i began to think and it's better it ends well and it's better the thing's a koh i noor tell me all about it she suggested he complied enthusiastically she was being very sympathetic and he felt with perfect momentary content how jolly it was to have a lovely wife and talk over these things with her just what he had pictured but wouldn't it be more exciting if you kept that a mystery till the third volume she said at the end of five minutes it was as if she had thrown a bucket of ice water on his animation i don't want it to be a mystery he said that isn't the aim at all what i mean to do is to analyse the woman's sensations when she learns it i want to show how she feels and suffers yes and the temptation that she wrestles with and loathes herself for being too weak to put aside don't you see don't you see she was chiefly sensible that his pleasure had vanished and that the note of interest in his voice had died she however repeated her suggestion to be a literary critic she must be prepared to maintain her views i think all that would be much duller than if you had the surprise she declared he did not argue he did not attempt to demonstrate that her suggestion amounted to proposing that he should write quite another story than the one he was talking about he felt hopelessly that argument would be waste of time perhaps you are right he said but one does what one can but you should say 'what one will' dear it can be done whichever way you like there's only one way possible to me i assure you for once 'the wrong way' is the more difficult that which you think is the wrong way said cynthia with gentle firmness he looked at her a moment incredulously good lord he said let me know something about my own business i don't want to pose on the strength of a solitary novel i'm not arrogant but let me know something at all events more than you heavens above a novelist devotes his life to trying to learn the technique of an art which it wants three lifetimes to acquire and mr jones who is a solicitor and mr smith the shoe manufacturer and little miss pink of putney who don't know the first laws of fiction who aren't even aware there are any laws to know are all prepared to tell him how his books should be written i am not miss pink of putney she said and if i were we all know whether we like a book or whether we don't 'like' he echoed to 'like' and to 'criticise' men are paid to criticise books when they can do it it's thought to be worth payment editors who don't exactly bubble over with generosity sign cheques for reviews i don't pretend to teach mr smith how to make his shoes i've sense enough to understand that he knows the way better than i nor do these people think that they can teach a painter how to compose his pictures or that they can give a musician lessons in counterpoint why on earth should they imagine they're competent to instruct a novelist it is absurd your comparisons are far fetched she said a painter and a musician we all know have to study they they're entitled to the consideration due to a certain amount of money sunk eh that's really it there are thousands upon thousands of families in the upper middle classes of england to whom fiction will never be an art because the novelist hasn't been to an academy and paid fees as a matter of fact it is only in artistic and professional circles that a novelist in england is regarded with any other feeling than good humoured contempt unless he's publicly known to be making a large income the commercial majority smile at him they've a shibboleth i'm sure it's familiar to you 'you can't improve your mind by reading novels' they're persuaded it's true they have heard it ever since they were children in these families where no artist no professional man of any kind has ever let in a little light 'you can't improve your mind by reading novels' is one of the stock phrases of middle class english philistia ask them if they improve their minds by looking at pictures in the national gallery or even at the academy and they know it is essential that they should answer 'certainly' ask them how they do it and they are 'done' of course they don't really improve their minds either way because before the contemplation of art in any form can be anything more than a vague amusement a very much higher standard of education than they have reached is necessary only they have learnt to pretend about pictures it's an odd thing or perhaps a natural one that an author of the sort of book that they are impressed by a scientist a brain worker of any description literary or not talks and thinks of a novelist with respect while these people themselves find him beneath them there was a silence in which both stared again at the sea his irritation subsiding it occurred to him that he might have expressed his opinions less freely considering that philistia was his wife's birthplace he was beginning to excuse himself when she interrupted him don't let us discuss it any more humphrey she said in a grieved voice please i am sorry i said so much i was wrong said kent i have vexed you no i am not vexed she replied in a tone that intimated she was only hurt cynthia don't be angry make it up she turned instantly with a touch of her hand and a quick pleased smile and he set himself to efface the effect of his ill humour with entirely successful results as they strolled back to the hotel side by side he felt her to be a long way from him there was even a sense of physical remoteness mentally she did not seem so near as in the days of their earliest acquaintance he caught himself wishing that he could debate a certain point in construction with turquand and from that it was the merest step to perceiving that mentone would be jollier if turquand were with him instead he was appalled to think that such a fancy should have crossed his brain and strove guiltily to believe that it had not but once again he felt spiritless and blank and it was a labour to maintain the necessary disguise he observed forlornly that cynthia always appeared happiest in their association when the ineptitude of it was weighing most heavily upon himself chapter viii mrs kent placed few obstacles in the way of her husband's industry and installed in leamington road streatham he began his novel and deleted and destroyed and re wrote until at the expiration of three weeks he had accomplished chapter i primarily he did not experience so many domestic discomforts to impede him as turquand had predicted mrs walford had obtained a very respectable and nice looking servant whose only drawback was a father in a lunatic asylum and the frequently expressed fear that if she were given too much to do she might go out of her mind on the premises ann was so superior and a general had really proved so difficult to get that the thought of an hereditary taint had not been allowed to disqualify her cynthia confessed to finding it a little awkward when a duty was neglected but apart from this ann was an acquisition the author's working hours were supposed to be from ten o'clock till seven with an interval for luncheon but the irregular habits of bachelorhood made it hard for him to accustom himself to them and it was often agreed that he should take his leisure in the afternoon and reseat himself at his desk in the alluring hours of lamplight when the neighbours' children were at rest and scales ceased from troubling to these neighbours he found that he was an object of considerable curiosity he had not lived in a suburb hitherto and he discovered that for a man to remain at home all day offered much food for conjecture there subsequently in some inexplicable manner his vocation was ascertained and then when cynthia and he went out people whispered behind their window curtains and stared of his wife's family he saw a good deal both at the hawthorns and at no leamington road and his liking for his brother in law did not increase there was an air of condescension in mr caesar walford's self sufficiency that he found highly exasperating the bass's debut had been fixed during their absence for the coming season and he repeated the newest compliments paid to him by his master with the languid assurance of an artist whose supremacy was already acknowledged by the world the latest burst of admiration into which pincocca had been betrayed had always to be dragged by his parents from reluctant lips but he never forgot any of it humphrey was sure that the artist thought even less of him than the neighbours did fiction he rarely read he said he said it with an elevation of his eyebrows as if novels were fathoms beneath his attention his eyebrows were in fact singularly expressive and he could dismiss an author's claim to consideration or ridicule a masterpiece without uttering a word there had been more truth than is usual in such statements when humphrey said that he was not conceited on the score of his unprofitable spurs but when he contemplated the complacent sneer by which this affected young man pronounced a novelist of reputation to be entirely fatuous he was galled cynthia had told her mother how hard he was working and once when they were spending an evening at the hawthorns some weeks after their return his industry was mentioned well exclaimed the stock jobber tolerantly and how's the story getting along heh yes said kent i'm plodding on with it fairly well sir he was aware that his father in law did not view fiction seriously either and he always felt a certain restraint in speaking of his profession here and what's it about asked mrs walford in the indulgent tone in which she might have put such a question to a child have you made cynthia your lovely heroine and are you flirting with her at dieppe again i know what it'll be hee hee hee i'm sure you meant yourself by the hero in your last book you know i told you that long ago he knew also that she would tell him that just as mistakenly about the hero of every book he wrote n no he said i shouldn't quite care to try to make 'copy' out of my wife it wouldn't be easy and it wouldn't be congenial you ought to know her faults better than anybody else i should think by this time said miss wix and her virtues said humphrey oh said miss wix with acidulated humour he says two months are quite long enough to find out all cynthia's virtues louisa i didn't hear him say anything of the sort said mrs walford crossly well what is it about tell us he felt awkward and embarrassed i can't explain a plot i'm very stupid at it he said you shall have a copy the moment it is published mater and read the thing i do wish he'd call me 'mamma' she cried he makes me feel a hundred years old to change the subject he inquired if she had read henry james's new book i don't know she said oh yes they sent it me from the library this week it isn't bad i didn't like it much did you read it caesar caesar became conscious that people talked read he echoed wearily read what henry james's last i forget what it was called something i saw you with it the other day a red book i looked through it i had nothing to do quite amusing she said wasn't it i forget he murmured i never do remember these things it took a clever man some time to write said kent it might have been worth your attention for a whole afternoon caesar was not disturbed neither his confidence nor his amiability was shaken do you think so he said with gentleness i can't read these things any more there's nothing to be gained what does one acquire whether angelina marries edwin or whether she marries charles he shook his head and smiled compassionately sam walford guffawed when i feel that my mind's been at too great a tension i sometimes glance at a novel but i'm afraid i'm really afraid i can't concede that i should be justified in giving up an afternoon to one caesar has his work to think of you know put in cynthia he's not like us women you'll find it a tough job to get the best of caesar in an argument proclaimed walford boisterously oh i don't deny that i have read novels in my time there was a time when i could read a yellow back he made this admission in the evident belief that a book was more frivolous in cardboard covers than in the cloth of its first edition but i can't do it to day well cried mrs walford i must say i agree with humphrey i must say i think it's very clever to write a good novel i do really i couldn't write one i'm sure i couldn't i haven't the patience oh exclaimed caesar with charming confusion it's humphrey's own line of course it is i always forget he turned to kent deprecatingly you know i never associate you with it it's a surprise every time i remember kent said it was really of no consequence at all well well well said walford everybody to his trade we can't all be born with a fortune in our throats wish we could eh humphrey my boy did you hear what lassalle said about his voice the other day caesar just tell humphrey what lassalle said about your voice the other day oh humphrey doesn't want to listen to that long story said mrs walford i'm sure he could do no less after this than express curiosity well then caesar tell us what it was do caesar begged his sister i haven't heard either a trifle he demurred not interesting i didn't know i'd mentioned it oh yes said miss wix don't you remember you told us the story at tea and then you told it again to your father at dinner but do tell cynthia and humphrey i er dined with pincocca last night at his rooms he drawled one or two men came in afterwards he introduced me i didn't pay much attention to the names you know what it is and by and by pincocca pressed me to sing he said i was 'a pupil' and i could see that one of the men was prepared to be bored this really is so very personal that no no no go on what nonsense said his mother i could see he was prepared to be bored so i made up my mind to sing i was nettled very childish i admit it but i was nettled i didn't watch him while i sang i couldn't i did better than i expected you forgot everything cried sam walford i know i did yes i didn't think of pincocca or of him or of anybody in the room when i had finished he came up to me and said 'mr walford i am green with jealousy ah heaven if i could command such a career' the man was lassalle flattering shouted his father to kent flattering 'if i could command such a career' eh kent asked himself speechlessly if this thing could be if i could command such a career' declaimed mr walford what do you think of that he's coming out in the spring you know yes so i've heard said humphrey where that's not settled here in town i expect at covent garden he sang to the manager last week the man was was staggered ha said kent perfunctorily there's never been anything heard like it i tell you he'll take london by storm what i can't understand said miss wix her mouth pursed to a buttonhole is how it was you didn't know lassalle directly he came in is he the only musical celebrity you aren't intimate with her nephew looked momentarily disconcerted one doesn't know everybody he said feebly lassalle happened to be a man i hadn't met what do you mean emily flared mrs walford you don't imagine that caesar made the story up i suppose 'mean' said miss wix with wonder 'make it up' why should he make it up i said i 'didn't understand' that is all quite a simple observation she rose and seated herself stiffly on a distant couch mrs walford panted and turned to humphrey who she was afraid had overheard how very absurd she said jerkily how very absurd of her to make such a remark so liable to misconstruction by the way do you see anything of that mr turkey turquand what was he called now has he er er any influence with the press he knows a good many people of a kind why we shall be very pleased to see him she said i liked him very much he might dine with us one night when there's nobody particular here i was thinking he might be useful to caesar the press can be so spiteful can't it so very spiteful of course caesar will really be independent of criticism but still still you'll give turquand a dinner oh you satirical villain she said playfully hee hee hee you're all alike you writing men you'll even lash your mamma in law aren't you going to have anything to drink sam humphrey has nothing to drink cynthia a glass of wine the servant had entered with a salver and the tantalus and sam walford proposed the toast of his son's debut they prepared to drink it and it was noticed then that miss wix sat alone in her distant corner emily aren't you going to join us i beg your pardon emily exclaimed walford i didn't know you were with us upon my word i didn't 'the poor are always with us' said miss wix in a low and bitter voice if it can be spared a drop of whisky then you'll tell mr turquand we shall be happy to see him said mrs walford to kent don't forget it you might bring him in with you one evening i dare say he'll be very glad of the invitation and he can hear caesar sing what's your hurry i want to talk to cynthia you aren't going to write any more when you get back i suppose he acknowledged that he was that he had taken his wife to a matinee on that understanding but it was past twelve when they left her mother's house and turned homeward through the silent suburb the railway had just yielded back a few theatre goers weary and incongruous looking in the cold clearness of the winter night the women's long cloaked figures and flimsy head gear drooped dejectedly and the men with their dress trousers flapping thinly as they walked appeared already oppressed by the thought of the early breakfast to which they would be summoned in time to hurry to the station again the prosperous residences lying back behind spruce trim shrubberies and curves of carriage drive finished abruptly and then began borders in which fifty pounds was already a distinguished rental the monotonous rows of villas with their little hackneyed gables and their little hackneyed gates their painful grandiloquence of nomenclature seemed to kent a pathetic expression of lives which had for the most part reached the limit of their potentialities and were now passed without ambition and without hope some doubtless looked forward or looked back from the red brick maze but to the majority the race was run and this was conquest he was about to comment on it but the girl was unusually quiet and the remark on his lips was not one that would have been productive of more than a monosyllabic assent in any circumstances their front garden slept he unlocked the door and saying that she was very tired cynthia held up her face immediately and went upstairs after he had extinguished the gas kent mounted to the little room where he worked and lit the lamp beyond the window over the bare trees the moon was shining whitely he stood for a few moments staring out and thinking he scarcely knew of what then he began to re read the last page of the manuscript that lay on the desk he had just begun to write when cynthia stole in and joined him are you busy she asked no dearest he said'surprised what is it she came forward and hung beside him fingering the pen that he had laid down she had put on her dressing gown and her hair was loose she was very lovely very youthful so she looked like a child playing at being a woman the sleeves fell away giving a glimpse of the delicate forearms and he thought the softness of the neck she displayed seemed made for a parent's kisses how cold it is she murmured don't you feel cold you shouldn't have come in he said you'll take a chill you'd be better off in bed baby she shook her head i want to stop then let me get you a rug and wrap you up he rose but she stayed him petulantly i don't want you to go away i want to speak to you humphrey is anything the matter i've something to tell you she pricked the paper nervously with the nib something can't you guess what it is humphrey think it's about me a tear splashed on to the paper between them kent's heart gave one loud throb of comprehension and then yearned over her with the truest emotion that she had wakened in him yet he caught her close and caressed her while she clung to him sobbing spasmodically oh you do love me you do love me don't you she gasped i'm not a disappointment am i she slipped on to the hassock at his feet resting her head on his leg with the tumbled fairness of her hair across his trouser as she crouched there she looked more like a child than ever a penitent child begging forgiveness for some fault he swore that she had fulfilled and exceeded his most ardent dreams that she was sweeter in reality than his imagination had promised him and he pitied her vehemently and remorsefully as he spoke because in such a moment she was answered by a lie the lamp which the servant had neglected flickered and expired and on a sudden the room and the two bent figures before the desk were lit only by the pallor of the moon cynthia turned and looked up in his face deprecatingly oh i'm so sorry i meant to remind her i'm punished i'm left in the dark myself he stooped and kissed her the fondness that he felt for her normally intensified by compassion assumed in this ephemeral circumscription of idea the quality of love and he rejoiced to think that after all he was deceived and that their union was indeed indeed the mental companionship to which he had looked forward he did not withdraw his lips her mouth lay beneath them like a flower and his arms enclosing her she nestled to him voicelessly pervaded by a deep sense of restfulness and content in a transient ecstasy of illusive union their spirits met and life seemed to kent divine chapter ix as chapter by chapter the novel grew under his hand kent saw from the little back window the snow disappear and the bare trees grow green until at last a fire was no longer necessary in the room and the waving fields that he overlooked were yellow with buttercups he rose at six now and did about three hours' work before cynthia went down then they breakfasted and with an effort to throw some interest into her voice she would inquire how he had been getting on he probably felt that he had not been getting on at all and his response was not encouraging after breakfast he would make an attempt to read the newspaper with his thoughts wandering back to his manuscript and cynthia would have an interview with ann this interview ostensibly concluded before he went back to his desk was generally reopened as soon as he took his seat and for some unexplained reason the sequel usually occurred on the stairs oh what from the grocer's ma'am so and so and so forth yes ma'am oh and ann what do you say ma'am more instructions interrupted by a prolonged banging at the tradesman's door and the girl's rush to open it what is it ann the fishmonger ma'am nothing this morning nothing this morning echoed by ann the boy's departing whistle ann yes ma'am ask him how much a pound the salmon is to day hi how much a pound's the salmon meanwhile kent beat his fists on the desk and swore once he had pitched his pen at the wall in a frenzy and dashed on to the landing to remonstrate but he had felt such a brute when cynthia cried and declared that he had insulted her before the servant and it had wasted so much of his morning kissing her into serenity again that he decided it would hinder him less on the whole to bear the nuisance without complaint the ink splashes on the wall paper testified to his having raged in private on more than the one occasion however and the superior ann's feet appeared to him to grow heavier every week the domestic machinery was in his ears from morning till nightfall from the time that she began to bang about the house for cleaning purposes to the hour that he heard her rattle the last of the dinner things in the scullery and go to bed it seemed to him often that it could not take much longer to wash the plates and dishes of a lord mayor's banquet than ann took to wash those of his and cynthia's simple meals and when like the report of a cannon the oven door slammed he yearned for his late lodging in soho as for a lost paradise and this wasn't all his wife was less companionable to him daily fifty times he had registered a mental oath that he would abandon his hope of cultivating her and resign himself to her remaining what she was but he had too much affection for her to succeed in doing it yet and with every fresh endeavour and failure that he made his dissatisfaction was intensified he burned to talk about his work about other men's work to speak of his ambitions to laugh with someone over a witty article instead their conversation was of caesar whose debut had been postponed till the autumn of the engagement of dolly brown whom he did not know to young styles of norwood whom he had not met of the laundress who had formerly charged four pence for a blouse and who now asked fivepence when he pretended to be entertained she spoke of such things with animation when he dropped the mask her manner was as dull as her topics for she was as sensitive as she was uninteresting her wistful question whether she had proved a disappointment recurred to him frequently and to avoid wounding her he affected good spirits more often than he yawned but the strain was awful and when he escaped from it at last and sank into a chair alone it was with the sense of exhaustion that one feels after having been saddled for an afternoon with a too talkative child the oases in his desert were turquand's visits but turquand never came without a definite invitation streatham was a long distance from soho and there was always the risk of finding that they had gone to the walfords' besides it was necessary to book to streatham hill from the west end and the service was appalling with the delays at the stations and the stoppages between them especially on the return journey when the train staggered to a standstill at almost every hundred yards one evening when he dined with them humphrey gave him some sheets of his manuscript to read he did not expect eulogies from turquand but he would rather have had to listen to intelligent disapproval than refrain from discussing the book any longer and when the other praised the work he was delighted you really think it good he asked better than the last you don't think they'll say i haven't fulfilled its promise honest injun you know seems very strong said turquand sucking his pipe no i don't think you need tremble if these pages aren't the top strawberries rather meredithian that line about her eyes in the pause isn't it you remember the one i mean of course kent laughed gaily it came like that he said fact does it look like a deliberate imitation would you alter it oh i say talking of lines i'm ill with envy 'occasionally a girl kissed from behind as she stretched to reach a honeysuckle rent with a scream the sickly coloured airless evening' the 'sickly coloured airless evening' isn't it great what do you think of that for atmosphere and he's got it with the two adjectives but the 'honeysuckle' the 'honeysuckle' with that 'sickly coloured airless' you can smell it whose moore's i opened the book the other day and it was the first thing i saw i had been hammering at a lane and summer evening paragraph myself and when i read that i knew there wasn't an impression in all my two hundred words you shouldn't let him read mrs kent while he has work on the stocks said the journalist i know this phase in him of old yes and you used to be very rude put in kent perfunctorily my wife isn't i can be depressed now without being abused cynthia laughed she was very pretty where she lay back in the rocker by the window her face was a trifle drawn now but she looked girlish and graceful still she looked a wife of whom any man might be proud you didn't mention it she said i didn't know but i don't see anything wonderful in what you quoted i must say do you mr turquand i'm sure 'sickly coloured airless doesn't mean anything at all it means a good deal to me said kent i'd give a fiver to have found that line cousins wouldn't give you any more for your book if you had said turquand put money in thy purse i suppose you'll stick to cousins why not life's too short to find a publisher who'll pay you what you think you're worth and cousins are affable affability covers a multitude of sins and there's a lot of compensation in a compliment cousins senior told me i had a 'great gift' perhaps he was referring to his hundred pounds he was referring to my talent though i says it as shouldn't that was your turn cynthia yes said turquand a wife's very valuable at those moments isn't she mrs kent how do you mean said cynthia who found the conversational pace inconveniently rapid i shall send it to cousins went on humphrey hastily and i want two hundred and fifty this time they won't give it you why not partly because you'll accept less and you haven't gone into a second edition remember look at the reviews cousins's will look at the sale the thing will have to be precious good for you to get as much as that it will be precious good said kent seriously i'm doing all i know you shall wade right through it when it's finished if you will and tell me your honest opinion i won't say it's going to 'live' or any rot like that but it's the best work it is in me to do and it will be an advance on the other that i'll swear mrs st julian's last goes into a fourth edition next week observed turquand grimly if that's any encouragement to you good lord said kent it only came out in january is that a fact one of 'life's little ironies' hers is the kind of stuff to sell my boy the largest public don't want nature and style they want an improbable story and virtue rewarded the poor 'companion' rambles in the moonlight and a becoming dress and has love passages in the grounds at midnight which wouldn't be respectable only she's so innocent the heiress sighs for a title and an establishment in park lane i and the poor 'companion' says 'give me a cottage with the man i love' making eyes at the biggest catch in the room no doubt though the writer doesn't tell you that and hooks him blessed is the 'companion' whose situation is in a story by mrs st julian for she shall be called the wife of the lord sonny the first mission of a novel is to be a pecuniary success you are an ass excuse me mrs kent you may give him all the good advice you can i've said before that i like mrs st julian's stories but humphrey has made up his mind not to that's firmness i suppose as he is a man she laughed turk didn't imply that he liked them either isn't it painful though to think of the following a woman like that can command what a world to write for it breaks one's heart it's an over rated place said turquand it's a fat headed misguided beast of a world it isn't the world said cynthia brightly it's the people in it a ghastly silence followed her comment a pause in which the journalist stared at the stove ornament affecting not to have heard her and kent felt the sickness of death in his soul shame that his wife should say such a stupid thing in turquand's presence paralysed his tongue and turquand pitying his embarrassment turned to the girl with an inquiry about her relatives humphrey had taken him to the hawthorns as requested and turquand with characteristic perversity had professed to discover a congenial spirit in miss wix it was about miss wix that he asked now cynthia laughed again yes your favourite is quite well she answered as cheerful as ever fate hasn't been kind to miss wix said turquand she's been chastened and chidden too much in other circumstances skittles said humphrey in other circumstances she might have been sweeter and less amusing personally i am grateful that there were not other circumstances i like miss wix as she is she refreshes me i wish she had that effect on me said kent as the guest rose to go and he reflected gloomily that he would hear nothing refreshing until the next time they met he begged him to remain a little longer and when turquand withstood his persuasions he insisted on accompanying him to the station and parted from him on the platform with almost sentimental regret only his interest in his book sustained him he was deep enough in it for it to have a fascination for him now and though there were still days when he did not produce more than a single page there were others on which composition was spontaneous and delightful and happy sentences seemed to fall off his pen of their own accord he wrote under difficulties when the summer came for cynthia required more and more attention but while he often devoted a whole morning or afternoon to her he made up for it by working on the novel half the night more than once he worked on it all night and after a bath and a shave he joined her at breakfast on very good terms with himself to support the sprightliness however he needed to breakfast with someone to whom he could report his progress and cry i've come to such a point or that difficulty that we foresaw you know is overcome a grand idea his exhilaration speedily evaporated at breakfast and if he returned to his room an hour later he did so feeling far less fresh than when he had left it yes cynthia demanded many attentions through the summer months she was petulant capricious and dissolved into tears at the smallest provocation there was much for kent to consider besides the novel also there were anticipations in which they momentarily united and he felt her to be as close to him as she was dear but these moments could not make a life and despite the fact that the time when they expected their baby to be born was rapidly approaching he was living more and more within himself cynthia had no complaint to make against him if marriage was not altogether the elysium that she had imagined it would prove she did not hold that to be humphrey's fault she found him if eccentric tender and considerate but he was bored and weary his feeling for her was the affection of a man for a child tinged more or less consciously by compassion since he knew that she would sob her heart out if she suspected how tedious she appeared to him though she would have been a happier woman with a different man the cost of the mistake that they had made was far more heavy to him than to her he realised what a mistake it had been while she was ignorant of it and of this at least he was glad chapter x she was very ill after her confinement and for several weeks it was doubtful if she would recover the boy throve but the mother seemed to be sinking the local doctor came three times a day and a physician was called in and then other consultations were held between the physician and a specialist and it appeared to kent that he was never remembered by mrs walford or the nurse during this period excepting when he was required to write a cheque you shall see her for a moment by and by one or the other of them would say she is to be kept very quiet this afternoon yes yes now you're not to worry go and work and you shall be sent for later on then he would wander round the neglected little sitting room and note drearily and without its striking him that he might attend to them that the ferns in the dusty majolica pots were dying for want of water or he would sit down and write by a dogged effort at the rate of a word a minute asking himself anxiously what sum it was safe to expect from messrs cousins his banking account was diminishing rapidly under the demands made upon it now and he found it almost as hard to write a chapter of a novel as if he had never attempted to do such a thing before he returned thanks to heaven that he was not a journalist to whom the necessity for covering a certain number of pages by a stated hour daily was unavoidable but he wished himself a mechanic or a petty tradesman whose vocations he presumed were independent of their moods it was not till the crisis was past and cynthia was downstairs again in a wrapper on the sofa that he began to feel that he was within measurable distance of the conclusion the nine months that he had allotted to the task had long gone by but that it would have taken him a year did not trouble him for he knew the work to be good he told her so one afternoon when they were alone together again she with her couch drawn to the fire and he sitting at the edge holding her hand i'm satisfied he declared when i say 'satisfied' you know what i mean of course it's as well done as i expected to do it another week 'll see it finished darling she patted his arm poor old boy it hasn't been a happy time for him either has it i've known jollier but you're all right again now thank god and i'm going to pack you off to bournemouth or somewhere soon to bring your colour back i was speaking to dr roberts about it this morning he says it's just what you need i've been very expensive humphrey she said wistfully how much we didn't think it would cost so much as it has did we you should have married a big strong woman humphrey or or what or nobody she murmured the eyes that she bent upon the fire glittered he squeezed her hand and laughed constrainedly i'm quite content thank you he said in as light a tone as he could manage what are you crying for nurse will look daggers at me and think i've been bullying you tell me was she kind to you i've been haunted by the idea that she was treating you badly and you were too frightened of her to let anyone know you're such a kid little woman in some things such an awful kid not such a kid as you imagine she said i've been thinking i've thought of many things since baby was born often when they believed i was asleep i used to lie and think and think till i was wretched what did you think of asked kent indulgently you mustn't be vexed with me if i tell you i've thought that perhaps although you don't feel it yet though you don't suppose you ever will feel it it might have been best for you really and seriously best if you had married nobody humphrey if you had had nothing to interfere with your work and had lived on with mr turquand just as you were there now you are vexed bend down and let me smooth it away what can have put such a stupid idea into your head said kent wishing pityingly that he had not felt it quite so often don't be a goose sweetheart what nonsense i should be lost without you i think i suit you better than any other woman would she said with pathetic confidence but if you had kept single that's what i've wondered if you wouldn't be better off without a wife at all oh you should hear some of the stories nurse has told me of places she has been in i didn't think there could be such awfulness in the world and in the first confinement too it makes one afraid that no woman can ever expect to understand any man hang your nurse said humphrey cackling old fool i suppose in every situation she is in she talks scandal about the last and where there wasn't any she makes it up when does she go she can't leave baby until we get another you know at least i hope she won't have to another another nurse mamma is going to advertise in the morning post for us at once we want a thoroughly experienced woman don't we dear we don't know anything about babies ourselves and oh rather poor little soul we owe him as much as that life is the cost of the parents' pleasure defrayed by the child we'll make the world as desirable to him as we can he paused for her to comment on his impromptu definition of life by which he was agreeably conscious he had said something brilliant but it passed by her unheeded he reflected that turquand would either have approved it or picked it to pieces and that for it to go unnoticed was hard she looked at him tenderly i knew you'd say so it doesn't really make much difference to our expenses whether we pay twenty pounds a year or twenty five and to the kind of nurse we shall get it makes all the difference on earth what shall we call him him you're not going to get a man baby you silly have you thought of a name i have he was still wishing that she had a sense of humour and occasionally made a witty remark what he asked yours i want to call him 'humphrey' what do you say to it what for it's ugly you said so the first time you heard it i think we might choose something better than that but it's yours she persisted i want him called by your name i do i do she held his hand tightly and her lips trembled if if i were ever to lose you humphrey i should like our child to have your name don't laugh at me i can't help feeling that that night when he was born oh that night shall i ever forget it and dr roberts looked across at me and said 'well you have a little son come to see you mrs kent' the first thing i thought was 'we can call him humphrey' i wanted to say it to you when they let you in but i couldn't i was so tired i thought it instead when nurse brought him over to me or when he cried or when i saw him moving under the blanket in the bassinet i thought 'there's my other humphrey' he kissed her and sat staring at the fire his conscience clamorous he had not realised that he had grown so dear to her and the discovery made his own dissatisfaction crueller he felt a thankless brute a beast it seemed to him momentarily that the situation would be much less painful if the disappointment were mutual if she too were discontented with the bargain she had made to listen to her speaking in such a way to accept her devotion knowing how little devotion she inspired in return stabbed him he asked himself what he had done that she should love him so fondly he had not openly neglected her but secretly he had done it often and with relief had she missed him when he had shut himself in his room not to write but to wish that he had never met her his mind smote him the question obtruded itself during the following days but now at least his plea of being busy was always genuine enough he was writing fiercely the pile of manuscript to which he added sheet after sheet was heavy and thick then there came a morning when he went to bed at three and rose again at eight to begin his final chapter having told the servant to bring him a sandwich and a glass of claret for luncheon when one o'clock struck and she entered tobacco had left him with no appetite and a furred tongue he threw a thank you at her and remained in the same bent attitude his pen traversing the paper steadily he was working with an exaltation which rarely seized him the exaltation with which the novelist is depicted in fiction as working all the time his aspect was untidy enough for him to have served as an admirable model for that personage he had not shaved for three days and a growth of stubbly beard intensified the haggardness that came of insufficient sleep the wind was causing the fire to be more a nuisance than a comfort and every now and then a gust of smoke shot out of the narrow stove obscuring the page before him and making him cough and swear the atmosphere was villainous but excepting in these moments he was unconscious of it he was near the closing lines his empty pipe was gripped between his teeth and he wanted to refill it but he couldn't bring himself to take his eyes from the paper while he stretched for his pouch and the matches he meant to refill it the instant he had written the last words but now an access of uncertainty assailed him and he could not decide upon them he stared at the paper without daring to set a sentence down and drew at the empty bowl mechanically his palate craving for the taste of tobacco while his sight was magnetised by the pen's point hovering under his hand he sat so for a quarter of an hour then he wrote with supreme satisfaction what he had thought of first and rejected his pen was dropped he drew a breath of relief and thanksgiving and lit his pipe his novel was done unlike the novelist in fiction again he did not mourn beautifully that the characters who had peopled his solitude for twelve months and whom he loved were about to leave him for the harsher criticism of the world he was profoundly glad of it he felt exhilaration leap in his jaded veins as he picked up his pen and added the end he felt that he was free of an enormous load a tremendous responsibility of which he had acquitted himself well almost every morning with rare exceptions for a year he had so to speak awakened with this unfinished novel staring him in the face almost every night for a year he had gone up the stairs to the bedroom remembering what a lump of writing had still to be accomplished and now it was done and he couldn't do it better blessed thought if he recast it chapter by chapter and phrase by phrase he could not handle the idea more carefully or strongly than he had handled it in the bulky package that lay in front of him the story told he was eager to forward it to the publishers without delay but turquand had so recently referred to his expectation of reading it in the manuscript that he sent it to soho first let me have it back quickly he begged and the journalist's answer in returning the parcel reached him on the next evening but one he showed it to cynthia with delight turquand wrote very warmly the manuscript was submitted to messrs cousins with a note requesting them to give it their early consideration and now kent was asked constantly by the walfords if they had written yet and what terms he had obtained cynthia had not regained strength enough to care to travel at present and her parents and brother generally spent the evening at no where truth to tell kent found their interest rather a nuisance his father in law evidently held that it was derogatory for him to be kept waiting a fortnight for his publishers' offer and mrs walford made so many foolish inquiries and ridiculous suggestions that he was sometimes in danger of being rude caesar alone displayed no curiosity in a matter so frivolous but listened with his superior air which tried kent's patience even more the fat young man's debut had been postponed again now he was to appear for certain in the spring and he explained in a tone implying that he could if he might impart esoteric facts that the delay had been discreet no outsider can have any idea he said languidly what wheels within wheels there are in our world he meant the operatic world into which he had still to squeeze a foot this last season it would have been madness for a new bass to sing in london he was doomed before he opened his mouth doomed he looked at the ceiling with a meditative smile as if dwelling upon curiously amusing circumstances very funny he added excepting his master he did not know a professional singer in england and whenever a benefit concert was to be given he would chase the organiser all over the town in hansoms and telegraph to him for an appointment on urgent business in the hope of being allowed to sing but his assurance was so consummate that although one was aware he had not yet done anything at all he almost persuaded one while he talked that he was the pivot round which the musical world revolved caesar excepted kent had really no grounds for complaint against the walfords the others' queries might worry him but their cordiality was extreme and they made cynthia relate turquand's opinion of the book for which no title had been found again and again even the stock jobber's view that a fort night's silence was surprising was due to an exaggerated estimate of the author's importance and mrs walford when she refrained from giving him advice appeared to think him a good deal cleverer now that the manuscript was in messrs cousins' hands than she had done while it was lying on his desk indeed there were moments at this stage when his mother in law gushed at him with an ardour that reminded him of the early days of his acquaintance with her in dieppe chapter xi well have those publishers of yours made you an offer yet no sir i haven't heard from them you should drop them a line said walford irritably damn nonsense how long have they had the thing now about three weeks drop 'em a line they may keep you waiting a month if you don't wake them up don't you think so cynthia he ought to write oh i expect we shall have a letter in a day or two papa we were afraid you weren't coming round this evening you're late how d'ye do mamma how d'ye do aunt emily and how are you asked mrs walford have you made up your mind about bournemouth yet she is quite fit to go now humphrey you ought to pack her off at once there's nothing to wait for now you've got your nurse how does she suit you she seems all right said cynthia rather doubtfully a little consequential perhaps that's all oh you mustn't stand any airs and graces put her in her place at the start what has she done she hasn't done anything only she's our first explained kent and we're rather in awe of her she was surprised to find that there weren't two nurseries she is frequently 'surprised' and then we apologise to her don't be so absurd murmured his wife he does exaggerate so mamma no but of course she has always been in better situations with people richer than us 'us' she repeated questioningly looking at kent with a smile he laughed and shook his head than we then and she's the least bit in the world too self important than 'we' echoed mrs walford than 'we' nonsense 'than us' kent pulled his moustache silently and there was a moment's pause than us said the lady again defiantly unquestionably it is 'than us very well he replied i'm not arguing about it mater i always say 'than us' said sam walford good humouredly ain't it right no said miss wix of course it isn't sam ridiculous declared mrs walford with asperity 'than we' is quite wrong quite ungrammatical i don't care who says it isn't i say it is a literary man might have been supposed to know said miss wix ironically but humphrey is mistaken too then what's the difference what does it matter put in cynthia there's nothing to get excited about mamma i'm not in the least excited said her mother with a white face but i don't accept anybody's contradiction on such a point i'm not to be convinced to the contrary when i'm sure i'm correct well let's return to our muttons said kent once upon a time there was a nurse and oh you are very funny mrs walford exclaimed let me tell you you don't know anything about it and as to emily i don't take any notice of her at all she may say what she likes what i like is decent english said miss wix since you don't mind this lively conversation must be very good for cynthia humphrey you're quite a member of the family you see we're rude to one another in front of you isn't it nice i shouldn't come to you to learn politeness either retorted mrs walford hotly i shouldn't come to you to learn grammar or politeness either you're most rude yourself most ill bred that'll do that'll do said the stock jobber we don't want a row damn it let everybody say what they choose it ain't a hanging matter i suppose if they're wrong i'm not wrong sam humphrey just tell me this do you say 'than who' or 'than whom' now then you say 'than whom' but that's the one instance where the comparative does govern the objective in english and angus or morell or somebody august denies that it ought to govern it there momentarily she looked disconcerted then she said all i maintain is that 'than we' is very pedantic in ordinary conversation very pedantic indeed and i shall stick to my opinion if you argue for ever 'than us' is much more usual and much more euphonious i consider it's much more euphonious than the other i prefer it altogether miss wix gave a sharp little laugh you may consider it more euphonious to say 'heggs' and 'happles' too but that doesn't make it right her sister turned to her wrathfully and the ensuing passage at arms was terminated by the spinster putting her handkerchief to her eyes and beginning to cry i won't be spoken to so she faltered i won't oh i quite understand i know what it means but this is the last time i'll be trampled on and insulted the last time sam don't be a fool emily nobody wants to 'trample' on you you can give as good as you get too what an infernal rumpus about nothing 'pon my soul i think you have both gone crazy i'm in the way yes and i'm shown every hour that i'm in the way she sobbed in crescendo humphrey is a witness how i am treated i won't stop where i'm not wanted this is the end of it i'll go i'll take a situation everybody excepting the offender endeavoured to pacify her cynthia put an arm round her waist and spoke consolingly while walford patted her on the back humphrey brought her whisky and water but she waved it violently aside i'll take a situation i've made up my mind thank heaven i'm not quite dependent on a sister and a brother in law yet thank heaven i've the health to work for my living i'd rather live in one room on a pound a week than remain with you i shall leave your house the moment i can get something to do i'll be a paid companion i'll go into a shop and she went into hysterics when she recovered she drank the whisky and water tearfully and begged kent to take her back to the hawthorns he complied amiably and tried on the way to dissuade her from her determination it was his first experience of this phase of miss wix and he was a good deal surprised by the valour that she displayed her weakness had passed and the light of resolution shone in the little woman's eyes her nostrils were dilated her carriage was firm and erect he felt that it was no empty boast when she asserted stoutly that she would go to a registry office on the morrow nor was it as much as that she would probably do but the prospect of employment was as the martyr's stake or an arena of lions to her mind and after the office had been visited the decision of her manner would decrease and the heroism in her eyes subside until at last she trembled in a cold perspiration lest her relatives should take her at her word it'll be a small household if you go he said i suppose caesar won't live at home after he comes out and they will be left by themselves miss wix sniffed when he comes out yes he seems to have been rather a long while doing it but there can't be any doubt about it this time the agreement for the spring is signed i hear they were passing a lamp post miss wix's mouth was the size of a sixpence and her eyebrows had entirely disappeared under her bonnet it always is she said the agreements are always signed and written in invisible ink i don't seem to remember the time when that young man wasn't coming out 'next spring' and i knew him in his cradle he was an affected horror then kent laughed to himself in walking home he had suspected the accuracy of the proud parents' statements already just as he had suspected when he had been invited to meet an operatic celebrity at the hawthorns who it was that sent the telegram of regrets and apologies that bore the star's name he wondered how much the walfords' foolishness and his pupil's vanity had been worth to the italian singing master who gesticulated about the drawing room and foretold such triumphs when he re entered no he was relieved to find the company cheerful again they seemed even to be in high spirits and the cause was promptly evident cynthia pointed radiantly to a letter lying on the table for you she cried from cousins be quick we're all dying of impatience how did you leave aunt emily she's going to bed he said tearing the envelope open his heart had leapt and he trusted only that he wasn't destined to be damped by the suggested price the others sat regarding him eagerly waiting for him to speak cynthia tried to guess the amount by his expression well said mrs walford at last well what do they say kent put the note down all the colour had gone from his face his lips twitched and his voice was not under control as he answered they haven't accepted it he said they're returning it to me they don't think it good what she ejaculated oh humphrey he heard cynthia gasp and then there were seconds in which he was conscious that everyone was staring at him seconds in which he would have paid heavily to be in the room alone that the book might be refused after such reviews as had been written of his last was a calamity that he had never contemplated and he was overwhelmed when he had been despondent he had imagined the publishers proposing to pay a couple of hundred pounds for it when he had been gloomier still he had fancied that the sum would be a hundred and fifty in moments of profound depression he had even groaned i shan't get a shilling more for it than i did for the other one but to be rejected declined with thanks was a shock for which he was wholly unprepared it almost dazed him what do you mean demanded sam walford breaking the silence angrily not accepting it but but this is a fine sort of thing it takes you a year to write and then they don't accept it a damn good business you're in upon my word hush sam said mrs walford what do they say what reason do they give let me look kent handed the letter to her mutely his wife watching him with startled pitying eyes and she read it aloud 'dear sir 'we are obliged by the kind offer of your ms to which our most careful consideration has been given' been better if they'd considered it a little less grunted walford 'we regret to say however that in view of our reader's report we are reluctantly forced to decide that the construction of the story precludes any hope of its succeeding the faults seem inherent to the story and irremediable and we are therefore returning the ms to you to day with our compliments and thanks' ha ha said kent wildly they return it with their compliments i don't see anything to laugh at said his mother in law with temper i call it dreadful anything but funny i'm sure do you think so he said i call it very funny there's a touch of humour about their 'compliments' that'd be hard to beat ah said walford your mother in law's sense of humour isn't so keen and 'literary' as yours she only sees that your year's work's not worth a tinker's curse papa murmured cynthia wincing kent's mouth closed viciously against your judgment on such a matter sir he said of course there can be no appeal it ain't my judgment answered walford it's your own publishers' it's no good putting on the sarcastic my boy here he caught up the letter and slapped it here you've got the opinion of a practical man and he tells you the thing's valueless there's no getting away from facts and i say the thing's strong sound work exclaimed kent and the reader's an ass oh what's the use of arguing with you you see it rejected and so to you it's rubbish and when you see it paid for to you it will be very good i want some whisky has 'aunt emily' drunk it all he helped himself liberally and invited his father in law to follow his example walford shook his head with a grunt you won't have a drink i will i want to return thanks for messrs cousins' compliments it's very flattering to receive compliments from one's publishers i'm afraid you none of you appreciate it so much as you ought we're having a ripping evening aren't we with hysterics and rejections and whisky's good for both well sir what have you got to say next i think we'll say 'good night' said mrs walford coldly i'll be round in the morning cynthia come sam it's past ten she rose and put on her things kent assisting her the stock jobber took leave of him with a scowl and when the last good night had been exchanged cynthia and the unfortunate author stood on the hearth vis a vis the girl was relieved that her parents were gone the atmosphere had been electric and made her nervous of what might happen next she had been looking forward besides to consoling him when the door closed to his lying in her arms under her kisses while she smoothed away his mortification she could enter into his mood to night better than she had entered into any of his moods yet and she ached with sorrow for him to turn to his wife on any matters connected with his work however never entered his head any more so when she murmured deprecatingly papa didn't mean anything by what he said darling you mustn't be vexed with him all he replied was oh he hasn't made an enemy for life my dear if you're going up to your room now i think i'll take a stroll she said do and and cheer up but her heart sank miserably he dropped a kiss on her cheek with a response as feeble as her own and went out a woman may have little comprehension of her husband's work and yet feel the tenderest sympathies for the disappointments that it brings him but of this platitude the novelist had shown himself ignorant cynthia did not go up to her room at once she sat down by the dying fire and wondered she wondered in the hour in which she had come mentally nearest to him if after all humphrey and she were united so closely as she had supposed chapter xii she loved him when they married perhaps neither had literally loved the other but the girl had roused much stronger feelings in the man than the man had wakened in the girl to day the position was reversed and her perception that he did not find her so companionable as she had dreamed was the beginning of a struggle to render herself a companion to him if she had been a woman of keener intuitions she must have perceived it long ago but her intuitions were not keen she was not so dull as he thought her nor was she so dull as when she married but a woman of the most rapid intelligence she would never be her heart was greater than her mind much greater her heart entitled her to a devotion that she was far from receiving to her mind marriage had made a trifling difference her sensibilities it had developed enormously her husband overlooked her sensibilities and chafed at her mind fortunately for her peace her tardy perception of their relations did not embrace quite so much as that she stayed at bournemouth for a fortnight and when she came home her efforts to acquire the quickness that she lacked to talk in the same strain as kent to utter the kind of extravagance which seemed to be his idea of wit were laboured and pathetic especially as he did not notice them she read the books that he admired and was bored by them more frequently than she was moved she attempted in fact to mould herself upon him and she attempted it with such scanty encouragement and with so little apparent result that if her imitation had not become instinctive by degrees she would have been destined to renounce it in despair he was not at this time the most agreeable of models he was too much humiliated and too anxious though mr and mrs walford were superficially affable again he felt a difference that he could not define in their manner and was always uncomfortable in their presence he had called the book the eye of the beholder and he submitted it to messrs percival and king but february waned without any communication coming from the firm and once more the walfords asked him almost every day if he had any news his only prop now was turquand whom he often went to town to see turquand had been genuinely dismayed by messrs cousins' refusal and it was by his advice that the author had chosen percival and king kent awaited their verdict feverishly not only was his humiliation bad to bear but his financial position was beginning to be serious and the walfords' knowledge of the fact aggravated the unpleasantness of it messrs percival sent the manuscript back at the end of april they did not offer any criticism upon the work they regretted merely that in the present state of the book market they could not undertake the publication of the eye of the beholder then the novelist packed it up again and posted it to fendall and green messrs fendall and green were longer in replying and the fact of the second rejection could not be withheld from the walfords after they had heard of it the change in their manner towards him was more marked they obviously regarded him as a poor pretender in literature and her mother admitted as much to cynthia once well mamma said cynthia valiantly i don't see how you can speak like that it's terribly unfortunate and he's very worried but you know what humphrey's reviews have been nothing can take away the success he has had oh 'reviews' said mrs walford with impatience he mustn't talk to us about 'reviews' of course all those were 'worked' for him by cousins we are behind the scenes we know what such things are worth this conviction of hers that his publishers had paid a few pounds to the leading london papers to praise him in their columns was not to be shaken cynthia did not repeat it to him and kent did not divine it but miss wix who had consented to remain at the hawthorns appeared quite a lovable person to him now in comparison with his wife's mother of intention louisa did not snub him the stock jobber was not rude to him deliberately but both felt that their girl had done badly indeed for herself and their very tones in addressing him were new and resentful in secret they were passionately mortified on another score their prodigy the coming bass had once more failed to secure a debut and at last there was nothing for it but to admit that the thought of a musical career must be abandoned the circumstances surrounding this final failure were veiled in mystery even from cynthia but the fact was sufficiently damning in itself the wily pincocca was paid fees no longer and caesar took a trip to berlin with a company promoter whom his father knew and who did not speak german while his mother invented an explanation it was trying for the walfords both their swans turning out to be ganders at the same time and that one of them had been acquired not hatched was more than they could forgive themselves or him there were occasions soon when kent was more than slighted when no disguise was made at all one day in july walford said to him i tell you what it is humphrey this can't go on you'll have to give your profession up and look for a berth my boy how's your account now pretty low confessed his son in law feeling like a lad rebuked for a misdemeanour walford looked at him indignantly ha he said it's a nice position 'pon my word and no news i suppose nothing fresh nothing sir you'll have to chuck it all you'll have to chuck this folly of yours and put your shoulder to the wheel and work i thought i did work said kent doggedly do you think literature is a game i think it's an infernal rotten game yes ah well there said kent many literary men have agreed with you you'll have to put your mind to something serious if you only earn thirty bob a week it's more than your novels bring you in what your wife and child will do god knows have to come to us i suppose a fine thing for a girl married eighteen months she hasn't arrived at it yet answered kent very pale and i don't fancy she will many thanks for the invitation walford stopped short they had met in the high road and cocked his head his legs apart will you take a berth in the city for a couple of quid if i can get you one he demanded sharply no said kent i'll be damned if i will i'll stick to my pen whatever happens and i'll stick to my wife and child too the other did not pursue the conversation but the next time that humphrey saw mrs walford she told him that his father in law was very much incensed against him for his ingratitude it is sometimes advisable for a man to change his business she said a man goes into one business and if it doesn't pay he tries another your father in law is much older than you and er naturally more experienced i think you ought to listen to his opinion with more respect especially under the circumstances oh he murmured have you said that to cynthia no it is not necessary to say it to anybody but you and it might make her unhappy she is troubled enough without she had as a matter of fact said it to her with much eloquence the previous afternoon and another thing she continued i am bound to say i don't see any grounds for your believing er er that your profession has any prizes in store for you even if you could afford to remain in it you mustn't mind my speaking plainly humphrey you are a young man and er you have no one to advise you and you may thank me for it one day let me thank you now he said fighting to conceal his rage if you can she said if you feel it i am very glad you see what you have done you wrote a book which you got very little for some nice reviews she smiled meaningly which we needn't talk about and then you spend a year on another which nobody wants to succeed as a novelist one must have a very strong gift there is no doubt about it a novelist must be very brilliant to do any good to day very brilliant he wants er to know the world to know the world and er oh he must be very polished very smart i see he said shakily as she paused you don't think i've the necessary qualifications you have aptitude she said you have a certain aptitude of course but to make it your profession so many young men who have been educated could write a novel you happen to have done it others haven't had the time they open a business or go on the stock exchange or perhaps they haven't the patience i'm afraid your publishers did you a mistaken kindness by those unfortunate reviews how do you mean he asked yes the reviewers didn't agree with you did they she smiled again and waved her hands expressively oh they were very pretty very nice to have but er newspaper notices do not take us in naturally they were paid for cousins arranged with the papers for all that with he looked at her open mouthed as the names of some of the papers recurred to him with them all she said oh yes you must remember we are quite behind the scenes pincocca he said musingly yes you knew pincocca but he was a singing master and he doesn't come here now oh pincocca was one of many one of very many she giggled nervously how very absurd that you should suppose i meant pincocca you mustn't forget that caesar knows everybody i'm almost glad he isn't going on the stage for that reason he brought such crowds to the house at one time that really we lived in a whirl i believe between ourselves that this man he has gone to berlin with is at the bottom of his throwing up his career a financier a mr mccullough one of the greatest powers in the city and er caesar was always wonderfully shrewd in these things don't say anything but i believe mccullough wants to keep him i won't say anything he said mccullough controls millions she gasped and your father in law thinks from rumours that are going about that he's persuaded caesar to join him in some negotiations that he has with the german government of course we mustn't breathe a word about it sh what were we saying oh yes i'm afraid those unfortunate reviews did you more harm than good nothing great in the city can be got for you because you haven't the commercial experience but a clerkship would be better than doing nothing you must really think about it humphrey if you can't do anything for yourself as your father in law says you are sitting down with your hands in your pockets eating up your last few pounds it occurred to her that a clerkship might look small beside the ease with which her son was securing a partnership in millions of course she added caesar always did have a head for finance and er he's a way with him he has aplomb aplomb that makes him immensely valuable for negotiations with a government it's different for caesar kent left her and cursed aloud he went the same evening to turquand's partly as a relief to his feelings and partly to ask his friend's opinion of the feasibility of his obtaining journalistic work for heaven's sake talk he exclaimed as he flung himself into the rickety chair that used to be his own say anything you like but talk i've just had an hour and a half of my mother in law neat take the taste out of my mouth turk i wish i were dead what the devil is to be the end of it the walfords say 'a clerk ship' oh my god you should hear the walfords i've 'a little aptitude' but i mustn't be conceited i mustn't seriously call myself a novelist i've frivolled away a year on the eye of the beholder and cousins squared the reviewers for me on the spectator and the saturday and the rest look here i must get something to do don't you know of anything can't you i introduce me to an editor isn't there anything stirring at all i'm buried i live in a red brick tomb in streatham i hear nothing and see nobody except my blasted parents in law but you're in the thick of it you sniff the mud of fleet street every day you're the salaried sub of a paper that's going to put a cover on itself and 'throw it in' at the penny you yes said turquand i 'ave flung my thousands gily ter the benefit of tride and gin'rally they tells me done the grand' it looks like it doesn't it i know all about that but surely you can tell me of a chance i don't say an opening but a chance of an opening man the outlook's awful i shall be stony directly you must fendall and green haven't written eh no their regrets haven't come yet how about short stories you didn't find 'em particularly lucrative did you a guinea each one in six months no but i want to be invited to contribute 'can you let us have anything this month mr kent' my dear chap should i have stuck to the outpost all these years if i had such advice to give away i did he coughed and spat out an invisible shred of tobacco i did stick to it you weren't going to say that you were going to say 'i did advise you once but you would marry' well i don't complain that i married the only fault i have to find with my wife is that she's the walford's daughter she's not literary but she's a very good girl don't blink facts turk my money would have lasted longer if i hadn't married but i shouldn't have got my novel taken on that account the point of this situation is that after being lauded to the skies by every paper of importance in england i can't place the book i write next at any price at all nor find a way to earn bread and cheese by my pen if a musician had got such criticisms on a composition he'd be a made man if an artist had had them on a picture the ball would be at his feet if an actor had got them on a performance he'd be offered engagements at a hundred a week it's only in literature that such an anomalous and damnable condition of affairs as mine is possible you can't deny it i don't said turquand chapter xiii nor did the conference which was protracted until a late hour provide an outlet to the dilemma it was agreeable but it did not lead anywhere if he should hear of anything he would certainly let the other know that was the most the sub editor could say authors are not offered salaries to write their novels and kent was not a journalist by temperament nor possessed of any journalistic experience as to tales or articles for the outpost that paper did not publish fiction and their rate for other matter was seven and sixpence a column however some attempt had to be made and kent went to town every day and cynthia saw less of him than when he had been writing the eye of the beholder he hunted up his few acquaintances and haunted the literary club that he had joined in the flush of his success he applied for various posts that were advertised vacant and he inserted a skilfully framed advertisement no answer arrived and the tradesmen's bills and the poor rates and the gas notices and the very competent nurse's wages continued to fall due in the meanwhile when the competent nurse's were not due the incompetent general's were dr roberts' account came in and the sight of his pass book now terrified the young man they had not been married quite two years yet and he asked himself if they had been extravagant in view of this evidence of the rapidity with which money had melted but excepting the style in which they had furnished he could not perceive any cause for such self reproach they had lived comfortably of course but if the novel had been placed when it was finished they could have continued to live just as comfortably while he wrote the next he feared they would have to take a bill of sale on the too expensive furniture and that way lay destitution cynthia's composure in the circumstances surprised him he told her so it'll all come right she said you are sure to get something soon and perhaps fendall and green will accept the eye of the beholder fulsomely this was an improvement for a few months since she would have been unable to recollect their name and have referred to them vaguely as the publishers he felt the sense of intimacy deepen as fendall and green dropped glibly from her lips and the fulsomely made him feel quite warm towards her' have you told your people what a tight corner we're in he asked she shook her head why should i that's our affair so it is he assented poor little girl it's 'orrible rough on you though i wonder you aren't playing with straws you didn't know what economy meant when we married praise from him was nectar and ambrosia to her she wanted to embrace him but felt that if she embraced the opportunity to give a happy definition of economy it would be appreciated better she perched herself on the arm of his chair and struggled to evolve an epigram as she could not think of one she said what nonsense i wish you had read the book and liked it said kent speaking spontaneously say you wish i'd read it replied his wife oh you'd like it because it was mine but i mean i wish what i don't know she twisted a piece of his hair round her finger my taste is much maturer than it was she averred with satisfaction somehow i can't stand the sort of things that used to please me i don't know how i was able to read them they bore me now he smiled as she had often done to him before she seemed a child masquerading in a woman's robes you're getting quite a critic well she said happily you'll laugh but i got a peacock's tail from the library and when the review in the chronicle came out the reviewer said just what i'd felt about it he did i'm not such a silly as you think you see my love he cried i never thought you were a 'silly' not very wise though oh i know what i lack humphrey but i am better than i was i am really remember i never heard literature talked about until i met you it was all new to me when we married and if you've noticed it you aren't very very interested in anything else the longer we live together the more the nicer i shall be he answered lightly you're nice enough now but he was touched after a long pause as if uttering the conclusion of a train of thought aloud she murmured baby's got your shaped head i hope to god it'll be worth more to him than mine to me he exclaimed she was silent again what are you so serious for all of a sudden he said looking round cynthia bent over him quickly with a caress and sprang up it was you who wanted the t's crossed for once she said tremulously there now i must go and knock at the nursery door and ask if i'm allowed to go in the man of acute perceptions wondered what she meant and in what way he had shown himself dull at comprehending so transparent a girl it was in october when less than twenty pounds remained to them that something at last turned up turquand had learnt that an assistant editor was required on the world and his wife a weekly journal recently started for the benefit of the english and americans in paris the editor was familiarly known as billy beaufort and the proprietor was a sporting baronet who had reduced his income from fourteen thousand per annum to eight by financing and providing with the diamonds which were the brightest feature of her performance a lady who fancied that she was an actress beaufort had been the one dramatic critic who did not imply that she was painful and it was beaufort who had latterly assured the baronet that the world and his wife would realise a fortune he had gone about london for thirteen years assuring people that various enterprises would realise a fortune that was his business but the baronet was one of the few persons who had believed him then billy beaufort took his watch and his scarf pin and his sleeve links away from attenborough's when in funds he could always pawn himself for a considerable amount and turned up again resplendent at the club whose secretary had been writing him sharp letters on the subject of his subscription the only alloy to his complacence though it did not dimmish it to any appreciable degree was that he was scarcely more qualified to edit a paper than was a landsman to navigate a ship he described himself as a journalist and the description was probably as accurate as any other he could have furnished of a definite order but he was a journalist whose attainments were limited to puffing a prospectus and serving up a rechauffe from truth never attached to a paper for longer than two or three months he was during that period usually attached to a woman too he drove in hansoms every day of the year always appeared to have bought his hat half an hour ago affected a big picotee as a buttonhole and lived nobody knew how while he was ridiculed in fleet street as a pressman he was treated with deference there on account of his reputed smartness in the city and while the city laughed at his business pretensions there he was respected for his supposed abilities in fleet street so he beamed out of the hansoms perkily and drove from one atmosphere of esteem to another waving a gloved hand on the way to clever men who envied him in days gone by he had tasted a spell of actual prosperity by what coup he had made the money and how he had lost it are details but he had now developed the fatal symptom of dwelling lovingly on that epoch when he had been so lucky and so courted and so rich there is hope for the man who boasts of what he means to do there is hope for the boaster who lies about what he is doing but the man whose weakness is to boast of what he once did is doomed he is a man who will succeed no more if the sporting baronet had grasped this fact the world and his wife would never have been started and billy beaufort would not have been looking for an assistant editor to do all the work kent obtained the post the man with whom beaufort had parted was a thoroughly experienced journalist who had put his chief in the way of things but had subsequently called him an ass and what billy sought now was a zealous young fellow who would have no excuse for giving himself airs beaufort believed in turquand's opinion and had always thought him a fool for being so shabby knowing him to have ten times the brain power that he himself possessed and turquand had blown humphrey's trumpet sturdily he did more than merely recommend him he declared with a recollection of the nurse and baby that kent was the man to get but that he was afraid it would not be worth his while to accept less than seven pounds a week when the matter was settled humphrey sought his friend again and wringing his hand exclaimed you're a pal but but i say what are an assistant editor's duties exhilaration and misgiving were mixed in equal parts in his breast turquand laughed as nearly as he could be said ever to approach a laugh the assistant editor of the world and his wife will have to cut pars nimbly out of the english society journals and the paris dailies and 'put 'em all in different language the more indifferent the better' he must handle the scissors without fatigue and arrange with someone on this side to supply a column of london theatrical news every week out of the daily telegraph say with me it's worth a guinea and i may as well have it as anybody else you're appointed our london dramatic critic said kent won't you have thirty bob a guinea's the market price and i can have some cards printed and go to the theatres for nothing you see when i feel like it they don't take any stock in the outpost he must attend the repetitions generales himself if he can get in and make all the acquaintances he can against the time when the rag dies 'dies' echoed kent is it going to die oh it won't live my boy if it had been a permanent job i shouldn't have handed it over to you i'm not a philanthropist but it will give you a chance to turn round and an enlightened publisher may discern the merits of the eye of the beholder in the meanwhile you'd better go on looking for something while you are on the thing perhaps you'll be able to get the paris correspondence for a paper if you try what more what besides the scissors nothing there's the paste i don't imagine you'll need much else you're a trump repeated kent gratefully i feel an awful fraud taking such a berth turk but in this world one has to do what one can't exactly by george it seems to be a paying line there is always room at the top you know said turquand when you rise in what you can't do the emolument is dazzling beaufort was returning to paris the same day and he was anxious for kent to join him there with all possible speed kent's first intention was to go alone and let cynthia follow him at her leisure but when he reached home and cried 'mary you shall drive in your carriage and charles shall go to eton' she refused to be left behind i can be ready by wednesday or thursday at the latest she exclaimed delightedly when explanations were forthcoming what did you mean by 'charles' and 'mary' oh humphrey didn't i tell you it would all come all right how lovely and how astonished mamma and papa will be yes i fancy it will surprise 'em a trifle he said we'll go round there this evening shall we and we'll put the salary in francs it sounds more he hesitated i say do you think nurse will mind living in paris cynthia paled i must ask her i hadn't thought of that oh oh i dare say i shall be able to persuade her it's rather a hurry for her though isn't it she does so dislike being hurried tell her at once he suggested she'll have all the more time to prepare in run up to her now let let us think murmured cynthia we'll consider ann must be sent away and we shall have to give her a month's wages instead of notice she's no loss he observed i don't know i what your mother ever saw in her she can't even cook a steak the wench she fries them dear i know she does said kent a woman who'd fry a steak would do a murder well we shall have to give her a month's wages instead of notice it's an iniquitous law but what about nurse perhaps said cynthia nervously if you were to mention it to her darling if you don't i mind of course i don't mind he answered but without alacrity what an idea tell ann to send her down she entered presently an important young person in a stiff white frock and he played with the newspaper trying to feel that he had grown quite accustomed to seeing an important young person in his service you wished to speak to me madam but baby will be waking directly i shan't keep you a moment said kent er your mistress and i are going to paris we shall be there some time i suppose it's all the same to you where you live we want you to be ready by thursday nurse to paris said nurse with cold amazement and a pause that said even more cynthia became engrossed by a bowl of flowers and kent felt that after all paris was a long way off i suppose it's all the same to you where you live he said again though he no longer supposed anything of the sort and there are three days for you to pack in you know three nice full days three days sir she echoed reproachfully to go abroad may i ask you if you would be staying in a place like that all the winter sir yes certainly through the winter or probably so it mightn't be so long it depends i could not undertake to leave 'ome for good sir said the nurse i am engaged my friend lives in 'olloway and oh it wouldn't be for good declared cynthia ingratiatingly we couldn't stay there for good ourselves oh no and of course if you found we stopped too long to suit you nurse why you could leave us when you liked couldn't you though mr kent and i would both be very sorry to lose you i'm sure they looked at her pleadingly while she meditated what baby will do hi don't know madam she said changing his cow poor little dear will it hurt him demanded the mother and father in a breath if you have the doctor's consent madam you may chance it it isn't a thing that hi would ever advise well well look here said kent we'll see dr roberts about it to day and if he says there's no risk that'll settle it you will get ready to start thursday morning nurse i will endeavour to do so sir she said with dignity they felt that on the whole she had been gracious and kent having obtained dr roberts' sanction to change the cow commissioned a house agent to try to let no furnished at four guineas a week chapter xiv lest he should feel unduly elated the eye of the beholder came back on wednesday afternoon but this time he did not post it to another firm instanter he could not very well ask for it to be returned to paris and he left it with turquand when he bade him good bye send it where you like he begged perhaps you might try farqueharsen next yes i've rather a fancy for farqueharsen but let it make the round old chap and drop me a line when there aren't any more publishers for it to go to the nurse's endeavour was crowned by success the walfords had congratulated him so warmly that he almost began to think they were nice people again and the departure was made on thursday morning as arranged they travelled of course by the newhaven route and reached the gare st lazare after dark on a rainy evening the amount of luggage that they possessed among them made kent stare as he watched half a dozen porters hoisting trunks and a perambulator and a bassinet on to the bus and it seemed as if they would never get out of the station at last they rattled away through the wet streets the baby whimpering and the nurse flustered and he and cynthia very tired they drove to a little hotel near the madeleine where they intended to stay until they found a suitable pension de famille and where dinner and the warmth of beaune was very grateful nurse also picked up after the waiter's appearance with her tray and a half bottle of vin ordinaire and as their fatigue passed exhilaration was in the ascendant once more cynthia's recovery was so marked that finding the rain had ceased and the moon was shining she wanted to go out and look at the grand boulevard so humphrey and she took a stroll for an hour and said how strange it was to think that they had come to live in paris and how funnily things happened and they had a curacoa each at a cafe and went back to their fusty red room on the third floor with the inevitable gilt clock and a festooned bedstead quite gaily the chambermaid brought in their chocolate at eight o'clock next morning and her brisk bonjour m'sieur et madame sounded much more cheerful to them both than ann's knock at the door with the 'ot water mum to which they were accustomed the sun streamed in brilliantly as she parted the window curtains after the chocolate and rolls were finished kent proceeded to dress and leaving cynthia in bed betook himself to the office of the paper in the rue du quatre septembre beaufort had not come yet and pending his chief's arrival he occupied himself by examining a copy the tone of the notes struck him as decidedly poor and a lengthy interview with one of the prominent french actresses abounded in all the well worn cliches of the amateur the dainty and artistic room into which the interviewer was ushered the lady's mock despair which gave place to graceful resignation and fragrant cigarettes made him sick beaufort was very cordial when he entered though and it was vastly reassuring to discover how lightly he took things the work mr kent would find was as easy as a b c turf topics was contributed by a fellow called jordan and really mr kent would find a few hours daily more than enough to prepare an issue they went into the private room where a bottle of vermouth and a pile of french and english journals marked and mutilated were the most conspicuous features of the writing table and kent came to the conclusion that his editor was an extremely pleasant man as the vermouth was sipped and they chatted over two excellent cigars at first the duties did not prove quite so simple as had been promised to one who had never had anything to do with producing a paper before and the printer worried him a good deal but beaufort was highly satisfied the novice was swift to grasp details and took such an infinity of pains in seasoning and amplifying the rechauffes that really his stuff read almost like original matter as he began to feel his feet too he put forth ideas and finding that the other was quite ready to listen to them gained confidence and was not without a mistaken belief that in so quickly mastering the mysteries of a weekly and painfully exiguous little print of which four fifths were eclectic he had displayed ability of a brilliant order primarily the labour that he devoted to the task was ludicrously disproportionate to the result but by degrees he got through it with more rapidity when a month had passed since the morning that he first sat down in the assistant editorial chair of the world and his wife he discovered that he was doing in an afternoon what it had formerly taken two days to accomplish and he marvelled how he could have been so stupid the work had devolved upon him almost entirely now for beaufort having shown him the way in which he should go dropped in late and withdrew early and did little but drink vermouth and say yes certainly capital while he was there it was kent who proposed the subject for the week's interview wrote or re wrote the causerie and who even secured the majority of the few advertisements that they obtained also when the semi celebrity to be interviewed was not a good looking woman it was he who was the interviewer when the lady was attractive billy beaufort attended to that department himself cynthia had found a pension de famille in the madeleine quarter highly recommended for a permanency and here they had removed they had two fairly large bedrooms communicating on the fourth floor and paid a hundred and fifty francs a week it did not leave much over from the salary for their incidental expenses after reckoning the nurse's wages but it was supposed to be very cheap and madame garin and her vivacious daughter who skipped a good deal for thirty years of age and was voluble in bad english begged them on no account to let any of the other boarders hear that they were received at such terms for that would certainly be the commencement of madame garin and her daughter's ruin some of the boarders were french people but the meals with which twenty five persons down the long table appeared to be fairly content were very bad they would have been thought bad even in a boarding house in bloomsbury the twenty five persons were waited on by a leisurely and abstracted italian and the intervals between the meagre courses were of such duration that kent swore that he had generally forgotten what the soup had been called by the time that the cold entree reached him yet they were not uncomfortable their room was cosy in the lamplight when the winter had set in and etienne had made a fire and the curtains of the windows were drawn to hide the view of snowy roofs and though the dinner often left them hungry they could go out and have chocolate and cakes and even as a foreign pressman kent got some tickets for theatres and concerts it was livelier than leamington road to say the least of it more lively for him than for cynthia perhaps but an improvement for her as well since one or two of the women were companionable she took walks with them while he was at the office and practised her french on them in the chilly salon one afternoon when he was sitting at the office table and beaufort had gone the clerk came in to him with a card that bore the name of mrs deane pitt she was staying in paris and the editor had accepted his suggestion that it might be a good idea to interview a novelist for a change kent had sent the proofs to her the day before but he had never seen her he told the clerk with some satisfaction to show her in and he wished he had put on his other jacket for the author of two and a passion was a woman to meet he felt shabbier still when she entered she looked to him like an animated fashion plate reduced to human height from the hues of her hat to the swirl of her skirt it was evident that mrs deane pitt made money and knew where to spend it an osprey in the hat was the only touch of vulgarity everybody would not have termed her pretty but her eyes and teeth were good and both flashed when she talked her age might have been anything from thirty to thirty five i wanted to see mr beaufort she said in a clear crisp voice but i hear he's out yes he is out said kent is it anything i can do well i don't like that interview i dare say it was my own fault but i object to suffering for my own faults one has to suffer for so many other people's in this world it's all about two and a passion i wrote two and a passion seven years ago and i didn't get a royalty on it either why not talk about the books i've done since and say more about the one that's just out you say 'mrs deane pitt confessed to having recently published another novel' and then you drop it as if it were a failure and 'confessed' why 'confessed' that's the tone i don't like in the thing you write about me as if i were an amateur he felt that beaufort would not be sorry to have missed her may i see the proofs again he asked she gave them to him and settled herself in her chair he looked at them pen in hand and she looked at him it can easily be put right can't it mr 'kent' easily oh yes will you tell me something about your new book i'm ashamed to say i haven't read it yet don't apologise it's called thy neighbour's husband does she bolt with him or do you end it virtuously virtuously monsieur she said smiling you travel fast and please go on are there cakes and ale or does she tend the sick and visit the poor you appal me said mrs deane pitt whatever my faults i am modern i end with a question point not questioning the lady's oh her happiness of course 'this brilliant and absorbing study which is already giving rise to considerable discussion' would be the kind of thing quite she said i'm awfully sorry to give you so much trouble the 'trouble' 's a pleasure you don't want your 'favourite dog' mentioned do you favourite dogs are rather at a discount er three she said yes a boy and two girls does the boy 'in a picturesque suit' come into the room and lead up to 'evident maternal pride' he's a dear little fellow she answered but do you think 'evident maternal pride' would be quite in the key no i'd stick to me and the work besides domesticity is tedious to read about the dullest topic in the world is other people's children kent laughed i'll explain to mr beaufort he declared you shall have a revise sent on to morrow i'm sure you'll find it all right when he understands the style of thing you want thank you she said dryly i assure you i have no misgivings mr kent 'kent' i've never had any correspondence with you have i the name's familiar to me somehow an alias is 'the garden of england' he said no you haven't written anything have you two novels one is published and the post is wearing out the other i remember she cried uttering the title triumphantly i read it what grand reviews you had of course i know now i liked your book extremely mr kent 'humphrey kent' isn't it thank you he said yes 'humphrey kent' and you go in for journalism too eh oh this is a departure i was never on a paper till lately really she exclaimed you aren't giving fiction up i'm pot boiling mrs deane pitt do you think it very inartistic of me don't she said inartistic i hate that cant there are papers that are always calling me inartistic one's got to live oh i admire the people who can put up with west kensington and take three years to write a novel but their altitude is beyond me i write to sell moi though you needn't put that in the interview but i shouldn't have thought you'd have any trouble in placing your books you oughtn't to to day i expect you've been too 'literary' you'll grow out of it you don't believe in i'm a practical woman the public read to be amused and the publishers want what the public will read good bad or rotten that's my view you mustn't make me say these things though she broke off laughing and getting up it's most indiscreet to a pressman i shall send you a copy of thy neighbour's husband to a colleague good afternoon mr kent i'll leave you to go on with your work now pray don't look so relieved i should value the copy ever so much he said it was anything but relief i was struggling to conceal despair she put out her hand and a faint perfume clung to his own after the door had closed though her standpoint was not his own her personality had impressed him and as he watched her from the window re entering her cab kent was sorry that she hadn't remained longer he hoped she would not forget her promise to send her novel to him and when it reached him a few days later he opened it with considerable eagerness the style disappointed him somewhat and the story seemed to him unworthy of the pen that had written two and a passion but he replied as he was bound to do with a letter of grateful appreciation and endeavoured moreover to persuade himself that he liked it better than he did the lady on her side wrote a cordial little note thanking him for the amended proof sheets i had no idea that i was so clever or so charming she said she should be pleased to see him if he could ever spare the time to look in she could give him a cup of real english tea and she was very truly his eva deane pitt chapter xv she was living in the avenue wagram she had taken a small furnished flat there for a few months and when he saw her on the boulevard about a week afterwards kent was puzzled to discover the reason that he had not availed himself of her invitation he called a day or two later and found her cynical but stimulating in recalling the visit it appeared to him that she was more entertaining in conversation than in print which suggested that her good things were not so good as they sounded but while she talked he was amused he left the flat with the consciousness of having spent a very agreeable half hour and was sorry that her day which she had mentioned to him was a fortnight ahead she seemed to know many persons in paris whom he would be glad to meet and apart from the hostess with whom he had drunk english tea and smoked egyptian cigarettes the entree to the little yellow drawing room promised to be enjoyable that she was a widow he had taken for granted from the first and his assumption had proved to be correct she was a woman who struck one as born to be a widow it was difficult to conceive her either with a husband or living in her parents' home as to her children she spoke of them frequently and saw them seldom kent decided that she was too fashionable and a trifle hard but this did not detract from the pleasure that the visits afforded him perhaps his perception of her character was indeed responsible for much of the pleasure for it rendered it more complimentary still that she was nice to him she was surprised to learn that he was married and declared that she looked forward to knowing his wife she did not however take any steps to gratify the desire and kent was not regretful he felt that few things more productive of boredom for two could be devised than a tete a tete between mrs deane pitt and cynthia and though he was reluctant to acknowledge it to himself he had a feeling also that if it occurred the lady would be a little contemptuous of him afterwards he knew her opinion of young men's marriages in the majority of cases and was uncomfortably conscious that she would not pronounce his own to be one of the exceptions mrs walford's letters to her daughter had hitherto been in her most enthusiastic vein mr mccullough had given the disappointed bass a berth in berlin and in her letters this was alluded to as a position upon which she showered her favourite adjectives of jolly and extraordinary and immense caesar was mccullough's right hand the best houses in berlin were open to him and his prospects social and financial were dazzling of late however he had been dwelt on less and one morning there came a letter that contained a confession of personal anxiety the recent heavy drop in american stocks and the failure of two or three brokers had seriously affected the jobber they thought of trying to let the hawthorns which was much too large for them now and moving out of the neighbourhood caesar remained mccullough's right hand but briefly and it was evident that the writer was in great distress cynthia was terribly grieved and startled she dashed off eight pages of love and inquiries by the evening mail and when the news was confirmed with more particulars she felt that she could do no less than run over to utter her sympathy in person kent agreed that it was perhaps advisable and raised the money that was necessary cheerfully enough by pawning his watch and chain only when she sent him a rather lengthy telegram from streatham detailing her mother's frame of mind did he feel that she was exaggerating his share in her solicitude the chilly salon where the ladies played forfeits after dinner or where the vivacious daughter thumped the piano was not attractive during cynthia's absence neither was it lively to smoke alone in his room or to go to a theatre or a music hall by himself and when in calling on mrs deane pitt he mentioned his loneliness and she proposed that he should take her to the varietes he accepted the suggestion with alacrity as he obtained the tickets for nothing his only expense was cabs and the liqueurs between the facts and it was so enjoyable laughing with her on the lounge of the cafe that the recollection of their being paid for out of the balance of his loan from the mont de piete was banished mrs deane pitt made some more of her happy remarks while they sipped the chartreuse and her teeth and eyes flashed superbly the piece was a great success but kent thought the entr'actes were even gayer and when the curtain had fallen and they reached the avenue wagram she would not hear of his leaving her before going in and having some supper his liqueurs looked very paltry to him contrasted with the table that exhibited mayonnaise and champagne and his exhilaration was momentarily damped by envy fiction meant a good deal when one was lucky how jolly to be able to live as this woman did her maid took away her cloak and hat and he opened the bottle she drew off her long gloves and patted her hair before the mirror with fingers on which some rings shone let's sit down am i all right he thought he had never seen her look so charming or so young you have a colour he said a proof it's natural when we went out i was as pale as a ghost i work too hard i do what are you smiling at i work horribly hard life's so dear yes 'expensive' don't say it it would be unworthy of you and i can't do a fifth part of what's offered me with all my fag am i supposed to sympathise with you for that certainly you should sympathise what de you suppose i tell you for to be felicitated do you think it's agreeable to have to refuse work when one needs the money it would bring in the trials of tantalus were a joke to it i had to let a twenty thousand word story for the metropolis slide only the other day and i could place half a dozen shorter stories every week if i'd the time to write them you do write a great many said kent and you seem fairly comfortable 'wise judges are we of each other' you ought to see my bills that music stand over there is full of them that's the place i always keep them in i'm naturally tidy it's one of my virtues i had to turn out chopin's mazurkas yesterday to make room for some more i only came to paris because people don't write you so many abusive letters when they have to pay two pence halfpenny postage oh i'm comfortable enough in a fashion but i've my worries like my neighbours i suppose i'm extravagant but i can't help it besides i'm not do you think i'm extravagant he looked at her and nodded smiling no she said not really why heavens you haven't the illusion that you're economical i believe you spend a small fortune on cabs alone i don't spend a solitary franc on one when i'm not alone you never walk so far as i can ascertain no not so far as that but i toddle a bit your champagne is above criticism and you dress like like an angel the simile is bad and improper go on what other faults have i i like to know my friends' opinion of me 'if to her share some human errors fall ' he murmured don't look then shall i hide it behind my table napkin that's sheer cowardice fill your glass and mine please go on tell me how i strike you frankly i know you think i don't approach literature reverently enough and ought to devote twelve months to a book and let my poor little children go barefoot in the meanwhile well i did give twelve months to a book once but i had a husband when i wrote two and a passion and he provided the shoes now if i didn't work as i do i should have to live at battersea and buy my clothes at brixton and take my holidays at southend you wouldn't calmly condemn me to southend my income apart from what i make barely pays my rent your rent is somewhat heavy suggested kent with two flats going at once wretch do you lecture me because i couldn't find a tenant for the victoria street place he blames me for my misfortunes she caught the long gloves up and swirled them round on his cheek like the others they were perfumed but now their scent was in his face they looked in each other's eyes an instant smiling across the corner of the table then as the smile died away they remained looking in each other's eyes attentively he drew the gloves from her hold and played with them her hand lay upturned to take them back and in restoring them his own rested on it she averted her gaze but her palm did not slip away so quickly as it might have done you know you may smoke she said rising and going over to the fire i'll have one too isn't it too late he asked joining her his voice was not quite steady and now he didn't look at her as he spoke you can have one cigarette she said sinking into an armchair and crossing her feet on the fender how's the paper going eclipsing le petit journal of course he said did you ever know anybody's paper that wasn't you count paris your home i suppose you mean to stop here permanently i go back in march the people are returning here then i loathe london after paris but i shall have escaped most of the winter there that's one thing where did you live in town my neighbourhood was battersea that is to say it was suburban wilds we had a villa at streatham have it now in fact he added remembering with dismay that there was a quarter's rent due no i'm afraid i can't condole with you mrs deane pitt 'pride sleeps in a gilded crown contentment in a cotton night cap' she said an address is only skin deep after all besides streatham is pretty pretty well and it looks prettier out of a big house get money my friend she said languidly you are young enough and i think you're clever enough when all things were made nothing was made better and it's really very easy as soon as you are popular the editors will take anything 'first catch your hare' he observed i'm not popular the clock on the mantelshelf struck one and he threw away his cigarette end and got up good night mrs deane pitt good night she said her touch lingered again and her personality dominated him as he walked back to the pension de famille through the silent streets he was angry with himself to perceive that it was so what the devil had he been about in that business with the gloves over the table she had let him do it too did she like him he wouldn't go to see her any more well that was absurd but he would not go so frequently as he had and he must keep a rein on himself nothing could come of it he was convinced even if he wished and he did not wish it would be too beastly to deceive a girl like cynthia and their baby only a year old he decided as he mounted the stairs to tell cynthia when she came back that he had been to the varietes with mrs deane pitt it would not disturb her to hear that and though it was juggling with his conscience he would feel cleaner afterwards there was a letter from her waiting for him on the bedroom table and he washed his hands before he opened it cynthia wrote to say that she should be home the next evening but one and that her parents had been rejoiced to see her on the whole things did not seem to be so desperate as she had feared but it was quite determined that the hawthorns should be let for fortunately there was a peruvian family who were prepared to take it just as it stood and mamma had already been to view a house at strawberry hill which was quite nice and far cheaper whether miss wix would remove with them was doubtful mamma's temper is naturally not of the best just now and i gather that the dissensions have been rather bad papa talks of allowing aunt emily a pound a week to live by herself and really she seems to prefer it she added underlined that caesar was still the right hand of mccullough she had learnt to smile a little at caesar and kent winced as he came to that allusion to a mutual joke and then there followed a dozen affectionate injunctions he was not to be dull poor boy who had no watch and chain but to go somewhere every night he was to hug baby for her and to give and keep a score of kisses she was always his loving wife he read it under the paraffin lamp with his overcoat on and wished that it hadn't arrived till the morning mrs deane pitt's inquiry how the world and his wife was going had had more significance than kent's careless reply the band of paris correspondents in the vicinity of the boulevard magenta and elsewhere were already beginning to talk about billy beaufort for not only was he neglecting the first chance of a competence that had fallen his way for years he was squandering the whole of a very handsome salary and getting into difficulties besides the amount of energy which this man when in his deepest waters expended upon a search for opportunities was equalled only by the abysmal folly by which he ruined all that he obtained he was one of the fools who devote their lives to disproving the adage that experience teaches them the circulation of the paper was purely nominal and the baronet had constantly to be applied to for further funds indeed the only work in connection with the journal which billy did now was to write euphemistic reports to the proprietor the money did not supply the journal's deficiencies alone card debts had to be settled somehow and an ephemeral attachment to a girl who tied herself in knots at the nouveau cirque was responsible for some embarrassment hitherto however beaufort had always spared the hundred and seventy five francs at the end of the week to his assistant editor but on the saturday after cynthia's return he asked him casually if he would mind waiting for it a few days sorry if it puts you out at all he said i can't help myself you shall have it for certain wednesday or thursday i suppose you can finance matters in the meanwhile eh kent could do no less than answer that he would try on monday morning though madame garin's bill would come up with the first breakfast and he saw that he would be compelled either to make an excuse to her or to pretend to forget it till he could pay chapter xvi their bills had been paid with such exceeding regularity up to the present that he decided to take the bolder course distasteful as it was he had been obliged to ask landladies to wait longer in his time but it was one thing to be disappointed as a bachelor and quite another when one had a wife and baby and nurse in the house madame garin's countenance moreover was of a rather forbidding type and did not suggest a yielding disposition in money matters he was agreeably surprised to hear her say after a scarcely perceptible pause that it was of no consequence when he spoke to her in passing her little office in the hall on monday morning cynthia's relief was immense it had been a serious crisis to her her earliest experience of having to ask for credit and to be on the safe side he had not promised to pay before thursday both trusted that the salary would be forthcoming on wednesday though for if the nurse wanted anything bought in the meanwhile they would be obliged to temporise with her and that would have its awkwardness beaufort did not refer to the subject on wednesday and kent went home with sixty five centimes in his pocket he got in late and cynthia was already at dinner she glanced at him inquiringly as he took his seat and he shook his head not yet he murmured she disguised her feelings and continued to talk chiffons with the woman opposite but when they mounted to their room and the proprietress looked out of the bureau at them with a greeting she felt a shade uncomfortable and hastened her steps i hate that bureau she said as soon as they had reached the haven of the first landing the garins seem to live in it and you can't get by without their seeing you well he didn't give it to you eh no it'll be all right to morrow though it's lucky i said 'thursday' instead of to day has nurse been to you for anything thank goodness she hasn't but baby is bound to be out of something directly you do think we are sure of it to morrow humphrey don't you he said there was no doubt about it and they drew their chairs to the hearth the night was cold and presently he went out to a grocer's and spent sixty centimes on a bottle of the kind of red wine that the restaurants threw in with the cheapest meal smuggling it upstairs under his overcoat in madame garin's wine list it figured as medoc at two francs and she would not have been pleased with him for getting it at a shop they made it hot over their fire in one of the infant's saucepans and sweetened with sugar from the nursery cupboard they found it comforting though their capital was now a son they were not unhappy in the prospect of a hundred and seventy five francs in the course of twenty four hours and once cynthia laughed so i gaily that the nurse came in and intimated that the rooms opening into one another made the noise very disturbing to baby kent went to the office next day without a cigarette for he had smoked his last and he i awaited his chief's arrival with considerable impatience the editor had not been in when he returned to luncheon but in reply to cynthia's eager question he assured her that he was certain to have the money in his pocket when he saw her again in the evening he wanted a cigarette by this time very badly indeed and when the office clock struck three he left his desk and stood pulling his moustache at the window moodily he began to fear that it was going to be one of the days when billy beaufort did not appear in the rue du quatre septembre at all his misgiving proved to be well founded and dinner that night was agreeable neither to him nor the girl she had been reluctant to go down to it on hearing that madame garin could not be paid and though he persuaded her to go down she sped past the bureau with averted eyes it was useless to go in search of beaufort the only thing of which one could be positive with regard to his movements at this hour was that he would not be at his hotel but kent promised her to see him before commencing work in the morning and said that the amount necessary should be sent round to her at once beaufort was staying at the grand and he was still in his room when kent called there he was found in bed reading his letters a suit of dress clothes trailed disconsolately across a chair and by the window a fur coat and a hat box had rolled on to the floor he had not drunk his chocolate but a tumbler of soda water and something and a syphon stood on the table beside him surrounded by his watch and chain some scattered cigarettes and the bulk of his correspondence he looked but half awake and cross what's the matter he murmured sit down there's a seat there if you move those things will you have anything to drink i won't have a drink but i'll take one of those cigarettes if i may said kent sticking it in his mouth and inhaling gratefully i'm sorry to dun you but you told me i could have the money 'wednesday or thursday' and i'm pressed for it i wish you would let me have it now i want to send it up to my pension before going on to the shop beaufort put out his tongue and drank some more of the contents of the tumbler thirstily that'll be all right he said yawning don't you bother about that but the point is that i want it now said kent i dare say it would be 'all right' but i'm in need of it this morning my bill came up on monday and i put the woman off till yesterday i can't put her off any more what is this the first week you owe her my boy a week i haven't paid my bill here for eleven weeks let her wait you haven't a wife said kent i have it's damned unpleasant for a girl i can tell you how much does the old harpy want inquired the editor with resentment a hundred and sixty more or less with extras i have the interesting document with me if you'd like to see it billy gaped again oh well he said we'll engineer it you you tell your wife not to worry herself and don't trouble any more i'll see you through he settled his head on the pillow and appeared to be under the impression that the difficulty was disposed of it's very good of you answered kent as his tone seemed to call for gratitude i'm glad to hear you say so but how soon can i have it eh oh i shall be able to draw to morrow you shall have a hundred and sixty to morrow i give you my word of honour on it i'll work it for you somehow i won't see you in a hole kent stared at him on the morrow a second week's salary would be due and on the next day but one a second account from madame garin he pointed the fact out to beaufort quietly but with emphasis he said that if matters were financially complicated it would be well for him to understand the position in order that he might realise his outlook and if essential make a temporary removal to a quarter where he could live more cheaply he did not want to badger him he explained but beaufort's programme was not capable of imitation in his own case and as a family man he must cut his coat according to his cloth if you want me to let part of my salary stand over for the next few weeks and it's unavoidable i suppose it is unavoidable he said finally only i can't be left in the dark about it am i to understand that you propose to pay me a hundred and sixty francs to morrow instead of three hundred and fifty or shall i have the lot what he received was a peaceful snore and he perceived that billy beaufort had fallen asleep he contemplated him for a minute desperately and lit another cigarette the thought of cynthia sitting at home in the bedroom waiting in suspense for a messenger's knock at the door nerved him to upset a chair and beaufort opened his eyes with a grunt what can you do demanded kent briefly this time lest slumber should overtake him again can you give me any money before i go i've told you i'll do my utmost you shall have a hundred and sixty francs to morrow i can't give it you now i haven't got it if i had you may be sure you wouldn't have to ask twice for it i'm not a chap of that sort kent by george i never desert a pal i've my faults but i never desert a pal if a louis on account is any good i can let you have that well said humphrey seeing that there was no more to be done i rely on you and thanks i'll take the louis to go on with he went down and out on to the boulevard and sent cynthia a petit bleu saying got something balance to morrow and wondered gloomily whether madame garin would continue complacent when she discovered that after all he suggested paying one week's bill instead of two perhaps it would be easier to arrange with the vivacious daughter he resolved to try and the young lady was all smiles and mais parfaitement monsieur when he spoke to her he congratulated himself on having had the idea but though beaufort provided him with the sum agreed upon next day and repeated that he never deserted a pal with an air of having achieved a triumph he did not make up the deficit and instead of being able to square accounts with the garins the assistant editor gradually found himself getting deeper into their debt from its being a doubtful point whether he would receive his salary in full it became a question whether he would get any of it at all and when he obtained half he learnt by degrees to esteem it a fortunate week beaufort overflowed with promises and protestations everything was always on the eve of being righted but the day of righteousness never dawned mademoiselle garin began to stop monsieur kent in the hall and convey to him with firmness that her mother had very heavy obligations to meet and cynthia sat at the dinner table in constant terror of the old woman coming in and publicly insulting them one morning when the laundress brought back their linen humphrey had to feign to be asleep while cynthia explained that monsieur had all the money and was so unwell that she did not like to wake him the poor creature was sympathetic and went away telling madame not to disquiet herself it was doubtless only a passing indisposition but after she had gone the girl begged humphrey to take a loan on her engagement ring and after some discussion he complied everything is more valuable in paris than in london until one has occasion to pawn it and then it is worth much less especially jewellery from the mont de piete kent procured about forty per cent of what a london pawn broker would have lent him however the loan was useful though it did not clear them it afforded temporary relief and it paid the nurse's wages which were due the same day cynthia said that she had become so demoralised she used a happy term now with a frequency he would have found astonishing if he had recalled how she talked when they first met that a substantial payment on account made her feel quite meritorious and there was a week in which they went to the theatres again and walked past the bureau with heads erect march had opened mildly and people were once more beginning to sit outside the cafes and mrs deane pitt was returning to england kent had kept his resolution not to enter the yellow drawing room in the avenue wagram when it could be avoided partly no doubt because of the anxieties he had had to occupy his mind but partly also by force of will when he heard that she was leaving though he could do no less nor did he feel it necessary to do less than call to bid her au revoir and he was conscious as the servant replied that she was at home that he would have been disappointed otherwise he gown betokened that visitors were expected teacups demonstrated that visitors had been she welcomed him languidly and motioned him to a seat i thought you must have gone to london or to paradise she said what have you beer doing with yourself i've been so fearfully busy he answered lamely on the paper of course i don't hear good reports of the paper she said i hope they aren't true the paper is as good as it always was responded kent neither better nor worse may i ask what you hear i heard that sir charles eames is getting tired of it says he is running a journal that nobody reads but himself and he 'don't read it much' he informed a man in his club who told it privately to another man who told it in confidence to a woman who told me i wouldn't breathe a word of it to anyone myself that 'if the price didn't improve soon he should scratch it' what will the robin do then mr kent humphrey looked grave this was the first plain intimation he had had that the world and his wife was likely to collapse and badly as the post was paying him now it was more lucrative than any that awaited him he thought that mrs deane pitt might have communicated her news more considerately the robin will manage to find crumbs i suppose he said i wasn't born on the world and his wife may i offer you some tea and cake in the meantime no thanks her tone annoyed him this afternoon it was hard and careless he fancied at the moment that his only feeling for her was dislike and sneered at the mental absurdities into which he had strayed there was a lengthy pause a thing that had seldom occurred between them followed by platitudes well he murmured getting up i'm afraid i must go she did not press him to remain must you she said i dare say we shall meet again it's a small world in every sense i hope we shall au revoir and bon voyage mrs deane pitt if you should go back yourself you'll come to see me you know where i live thank you i shall be very glad but as he went down the stairs kent was surprised to perceive that he felt suddenly mournful the noise of the door closing behind him was charged with ridiculous melancholy and there appeared to him something sad in this conventional ending that had the semblance of estrangement the sentiment and impression of the hour that he had spent in the room after the varietes recurred to him and contrasted with it their adieu became full of pathos he questioned reproachfully if in his determination not to be more than a friend he might not have repaid her own friendship by ingratitude and so have wounded her he first decided that he would send her a letter and then that he would not send her a letter he made his way through the champ elysees reflectively and once half obeyed a violent temptation to turn back he would have obeyed it wholly but that he felt its indulgence would be laughable or that mrs deane pitt would be likely to look upon it in that light so he restrained the impulse but he could not laugh himself chapter xvii the respite afforded by the mont de piete was brief and all that kent received from beaufort in the next three weeks was twenty francs the garins' faces in the hall were very glum now and the sum against notes remises at the top of the bills that came up to the bedroom on monday mornings had swelled to such disheartening dimensions that the debtor no longer gave himself the trouble to decipher the various items in addition to this the affairs of the world and his wife had reached a crisis and he learnt from the editor that it was doomed an interval of restored hope ensued the life of the paper hung in the balance then they went to press no more beaufort declared that kent's claim would be discharged without delay and knowing the ex proprietor's position humphrey could not believe that he would be allowed to suffer that the baronet was ignorant of his claim's existence and that it was billy beaufort who had to find the money for him he had no idea no more had he suspected when he took cynthia to the nouveau cirque and applauded the contortions of mlle veronique that the artiste who stood on her head and kissed her toes to them was in part responsible for their plight billy realising that the matter must be squared somehow if things weren't to become more unpleasant spoke reassuringly of sir charles being momentarily in tight quarters and humphrey in daily expectation of a cheque made daily promises of a settlement to the garins while he discussed with cynthia what should be their next move to remain in paris would be useless and they decided that they would go back to england as soon as the cheque was cashed perhaps it was fortunate after all that no had not been let in london he must advertise again and a post might be easier to find now that he could call himself an assistant editor in the advertisement the days went by however and beaufort whom he awoke like an avenging angel at early morning and tracked in desperation from bar to bar until he ran him to earth at night still remained in hourly expectation of the money both cynthia and kent feared that their inability to pay was known to everybody in the house and they imagined disdain on the face of the italian who waited on them at meals and indifference in the bearing of etienne when he laid the fire the chambermaid's bonjour m'sieur et madame had a ring of irony to their ears and on mondays in particular they were convinced that she sneered when she put down their tray the thought made the girl so miserable that kent took an opportunity of asking mademoiselle garin if it was so and she informed him that he was mistaken nobody 'as been told monsieur she said oh not at all but monsieur it is impossible that you remain you know if your affairs do not permit of a settlement your intentions are quite honourable well understood but my mother cannot wait her expense is terrible 'eavy 'ere vraiment c'est epouvantable je vous assure et and and my mother 'as an offer for your rooms and she asks that you and madame locate yourselves elsewhere monsieur on saturday after an instant of dismay humphrey was on the whole relieved at the idea of being allowed to depart in peace and to await his cheque where the situation wouldn't be strained it was rather a nuisance having to make a removal for so short a time but when it was effected he felt that they would be a great deal more comfortable he replied that they would go of course and that madame garin could depend upon his sending her the amount that he owed the moment that his arrears of salary were forthcoming he said he thoroughly appreciated the consideration that she had shown them and could not express how deeply he regretted to have inconvenienced her yes monsieur murmured mademoiselle garin she hesitated she added in a slightly embarrassed tone you know monsieur my mother must keep your luggage 'ere her lawyer 'as advised that what said kent oh my dear mademoiselle garin i will give your mother an acknowledgment a promissory note whatever she likes she will only have to trust me for a few more days i'm perfectly certain to have the money in the course of a week she won't keep the luggage surely my my dear young lady think what it means with a wife and child mademoiselle garin spread her arms with a shrug it is always 'a few more days' monsieur she said my mother will permit you to take your necessaries for the few days and the things belonging to the little one no more can i see her inquired kent rather pale oh yes she is in the bureau the servants can hear everything that goes on in the bureau he demurred can't i talk to her in her room mademoiselle garin preceded him there and he tried his best to wring consent from the old woman but she was as hard as nails and would not listen for long an acknowledgment of the debt certainly the lawyer had advised that too and he would prepare it but their luggage jamais de la vie the baby's box and the bassinet and for madame kent and himself such articles as were indispensable for one week she would agree to nothing else cynthia was upstairs playing with the baby and kent went in and shut the door that communicated with the nursery what is it she asked after a glance at his face he wondered if he could soften the news but it did not lend itself to euphemisms he told it to her in as light a tone as he could acquire it won't be for any length of time and we can easily make shift for a bit he said it isn't as if the child's things had to be left behind you see a handbag will hold all we really need for ourselves what do we want after all for a week it isn't a serious matter if one comes to look at it it sounds worse than it is i think she sat startled and still then she cuddled the baby close and forced a smile my brown frock will do she assented i shall go in that oh it isn't so dreadful no of course just for a moment it does give one a shock doesn't it but but as you say it sounds worse than it is were they nasty to you the old lady wasn't very affectionate the girl wasn't so bad it's cussed awkward darling i know poor little woman i was funking telling you like anything it took me ten minutes coming up those stairs and i nearly went out for a walk first she laughed she was already quite brave again we shall get through it all right she said where shall we go we might go back to the hotel where we stayed first mightn't we we paid there i thought of that he replied but it was rather dear wasn't it we had better spend as little a possible there are our passages and we mustn't arrive in london with nothing i'm afraid we shan't be able to get your ring out in any case that can't be helped i'm sorrier about your watch and chain a man is so lost without a watch saturday saturday will be mi careme won't it we shall celebrate it nicely oh she sat upright and stared at him with frightened eyes humphrey nurse his jaw dropped and he looked back at her blankly i'd forgotten her he said to see our luggage detained it could only mean the one thing humphrey what would she think what can we do she mustn't mustn't know i should die of shame no he said she mustn't know that's certain good lord what an infernal complication at the last minute i don't know what's to be done i'm sure take the child in to her and let's think he filled a pipe and puffed furiously until cynthia came back couldn't we he suggested couldn't we say that as we're at the point of going home we don't think it's worth while carting the heavy trunks to another place madame garin has 'kindly allowed us to leave them here in the meantime' eh cynthia mused then what are we going to another place ourselves for she said yes said kent that won't do hang the woman she's a perfect bugbear to us we're all the time struggling to live up to the teapot i wish to heaven we could get rid of her altogether that answered the girl after a pause that is the only thing we can do we must send her away and i'll take baby you a nice job for you you could never go down to a meal and travelling too imagine it i can do it i'd like it anything anything rather than she should see us turned out and our luggage seized that would be too awful yes we must get her away humphrey we must get her away before we leave here whatever happens afterwards is our own affair she'll be gone and know nothing about it that's very good he said thoughtfully but there'll be her wages and her passage back great scott and another month's wages because we don't give her proper notice how much would it come to i've got two francs fifty and i've pawned my match box i'm afraid we must think of something else we could send her second class on the boat as well yes certainly second class what does that cost have you got the paper you had look for it do it used to be in your bag kent searched and found it he also felt that their lot would be comparatively a bed of roses if they were spared the astonished inquiries of the nurse second class tickets are twenty five and sevenpence he announced and two months' wages are four pounds say five pounds ten well dear i might as well try to raise a million he blew clouds and waited for an inspiration while she walked about the room with her hands behind her even if we could get it she remarked breaking a heavy silence i don't know what reason we could give for packing her off so suddenly it would look rather a curious proceeding wouldn't it we could say said kent that we have decided to live in paris permanently she'd want to go then the charms of 'olloway yes answered cynthia we could say that but why in such a gasping hurry yes it would be rather a rush it's a fact well i'll tell you we are going on a visit to some friends in the country and they haven't room for another nurse mrs harris's nurse will do all that's needed while we're there but five pounds ten i can see beaufort and make the attempt but the man hasn't got it till the draft comes you can't get blood out of a stone let him go and pawn his match box then and his watch and chain and his engagement ring he must find it for you humphrey tell him you must have it say it's it's a matter of life or death think of what we've gone through already trembling in case she suspected what a state we were in the blessed relief it will be to be alone and have no pretences to make i shall feel new born i'll see him to day said kent catching her enthusiasm he's often in a place in the rue saint honore about four o'clock what time is it now go in and ask her she's the only one among us with a watch tell her mine has stopped unless it has stopped too often yours is 'being cleaned' she disappeared for a second and returned to say that it was half past three hurry and you may catch him now she continued and and humphrey be very firm about it won't you if he hasn't got it make him give you a definite promise when you shall have it to day's tuesday say you must have it by thursday at the latest and come back and tell me the result as quickly as you can wait here's a kiss for luck kent kissed her warmly she had never before seemed to him so companionable such a good fellow as she did in this dilemma and picking up his hat and cane he ran down the stairs and made his way to the buffet in the rue saint honore at his best pace beaufort was not to be seen in the bar nor was he in the inner room but on inquiring at the counter kent learnt that a gentleman there was now waiting for billy having an appointment with him for a quarter to four this was very lucky kent took a seat on the divan and ordered a bock rolling a cigarette he debated how he could put the matter strongly enough he had expended so much eloquence of late without deriving any benefit from the interviews that he did not feel very hopeful of the upshot however he was resolved that he wouldn't fail for any lack of endeavour after beaufort came in a little before five he sat watching him warily until the other man took his leave beaufort expressed pleasure at seeing him and asked him to have a drink kent did not refuse the invitation for it would be easier to talk there in the corner than dodging among the crowd in the streets and he opened fire at once he felt that his best card was absolute frankness and explained the situation without reserve billy was entirely sympathetic he romanced about sir charles but was subsequently truthful a draft from the baronet might be delivered any morning or evening but in the event of its not coming in time he would straighten matters out himself he was damnably short but he had arranged with a pal to jump for him if he touched a bit to morrow of which there was humanly speaking no doubt kent should have a hundred and forty francs at night and the balance of what was owing to him early in the week damon would repay himself when the draft arrived such devotion demanded another drink and though this left him with less than a franc in i his pocket kent went back to the pension de i famille in much better spirits and feeling that he had good news to impart cynthia looked upon the tidings in the same light as the nurse might learn from the servants that their rooms were to be vacated on saturday they decided to speak to her without delay kent informed her that they were going to friends in the country preparatory to settling in paris for two years and that she must make her preparations to return to england on saturday morning this gave a margin for delay on beaufort's part the young woman was greatly taken aback and though she did not wish to stay there was real feeling in her voice as she said how sorry she would be to leave the baby she hung over the bassinet and tears came into her eyes then cynthia choked and began to cry too and humphrey found her five minutes later with her face buried in her pillow sobbing that she felt ashamed to have told lies to such a conscientious nice minded girl chapter xviii kent's appointment with beaufort next evening was for half past eight outside the cafe de la paix the sous remaining after the conversation in the rue saint honore had gone for a nursery requirement so he was unable to sit down while he waited his man was very late and he walked to and fro before the stretch of chairs and tables on the boulevard for nearly an hour tacitly confessing himself penniless to every idler there when billy arrived at last he began by saying that his news was not altogether unsatisfactory whereat humphrey's heart sank and when details were forthcoming it appeared to him about as unsatisfactory as it could possibly have been stripped of the circumlocution by which the speaker sought to palliate its asperities the news was that the completion of his business had been deferred till saturday and that while he was confident of touching then he feared that he could do nothing in the meantime kent took no pains to conceal his despondence seeing that he and cynthia must leave the boarding house by noon and get the nurse out of the way and into the train by ten o'clock in the morning saturday sounded as hopeless as doomsday he explained the urgency of the situation afresh over a fine and after reflection billy thought that assisted by the signature of somebody else he could raise a hundred and fifty francs in another quarter when he had had a second fine he was sure of it and bade humphrey meet him there again on the morrow at a quarter to two the following day was thursday and when kent descended about eleven madame garin requested him to sign the document her lawyer had drawn up after that had been done and j duly witnessed one may do anything one likes in france excepting not pay kent told her that his wife wished her to view the contents of the baby's trunk before it was closed as a matter of fact it was a rather large one and they were anxious to avoid the possibility of its giving rise to remark in front of servants at the moment of departure she replied that such an examination was not necessary it would be sufficient if they instructed their nurse to pack nothing that didn't belong to the little one this led to his informing her that the girl was quitting their service and to his horror madame garin said frigidly you know what i have consented to monsieur the things of the child and for madame kent and yourself what is enough for one week nothing else my god exclaimed kent with a gasp you don't mean to say you won't let the girl take her box but certainly i mean it she returned it was perfectly understood i have already been too liberal but but heavens above he stammered the girl doesn't owe you anything my wife is dismissing her so as to keep our humiliation from her knowledge madame if you refuse to let her box go the exposure is complete the proprietress shrugged her shoulders that does not concern me this time kent literally lacked the courage to tell cynthia what had occurred he went out and dropped on to the first bench that he came to sick in his soul what was the use now if beaufort did bring him the money when they met the girl could not be sent home without her luggage and they would have to make a clean breast of the whole affair to her and beg her to be tolerant with them cynthia had been very plucky she had taken the disappointment of last night like a brick and was at the moment full of hope for the result of the appointment at a quarter to two but he felt that this unexpected blow would surely crush her it was the death stroke to their scheme and entailed even more mortification than they had feared originally he was at the foot of the champs elysees and he sat staring with wide eyes at the passers by at the bonnes big of bosom with the broad bright ribbons depending from their caps at the children with their hoops and the women in knicker bockers flashing through the sunshine on their bicycles paris looked so light hearted that woe seemed incongruous in it now it happened about half an hour subsequent to his leaving the house that cynthia decided to go with her baby and the nurse for a walk halfway down the stairs it was perceived that something had been forgotten and she continued the descent alone to her dismay she saw the gaunt figure of madame garin standing at the office door and as she came timorously down the last flight the proprietress stood with folded arms watching her perhaps her nervousness was very evident perhaps the other had been sorrier for her than she had shown but as the girl reached the hall the grim old woman moved towards her and with a gesture that said as plainly as words oh you poor little soul took her face between her hands and kissed her on the forehead listen she said that's all right about the box of your servant be easy cynthia murmured a response to her kindness without realising what was meant presently kent became aware that among the stream of nurses and infants flowing up from the place de la concorde were his own nurse and infant and that cynthia accompanied them she recognised him before they reached the bench and coming over to him with surprise sat down and then each spoke of what the other did not know what a half hour you have had she cried when she understood and he exclaimed but the relief heaven be praised you came this way their fate now hung once more on what billy beaufort would have to say and kent sped to the rendez vous with restored energy by the clock in the middle of the road it was twenty minutes to two when he reached the cafe de la paix and as before it was impossible for him to take a chair he rolled a thin cigarette with a morsel of tobacco that remained in his pouch and paced his beat smoking at two o'clock billy had not come he had not come at half past two kent doubted if this augured well for the tidings that were to be communicated but he fortified himself by remembering that he awaited a man who was rarely punctual in any circumstances nevertheless the later it became the worse the chance looked and when the clock pointed to three he began to lose both hope and patience at a quarter to four there was still no sign of beaufort the watcher's feet ached and the pavement seemed to grow harder and his boots to get tighter with every turn a little tobacco dust lurked in the corners of his pouch he thanked god to see it and carefully as if it had been dust of gold he shook it on to a paper and assuaged his weariness and rage with another cigarette beaufort meant the success or the failure of their plan and while he had but scant expectation of his turning up now he dared not go away he promised himself to go at four but at four dreaded lest he might miss him just by five minutes and determined to stop until a quarter past despair had mastered him wholly when a cab rattled to a standstill and forgetting the pain of his feet he saw billy spring out a glance however assured him that the waiting had been to no purpose and after billy had made many apologies and recounted a series of misadventures his statement was that he was unable to obtain any money until saturday afternoon kent dragged himself home and cynthia and he sat with bowed heads we're done said humphrey and that's all about it i must tell the girl we can't pay our bills and are turned out but she's always been paid up to the present what's it to do with her after all we won't be done declared cynthia we won't humphrey if if i wrote no by jove he said i do bar that we've kept our affairs from your people all along and we won't give ourselves away now do you mind very much she did but lied nobly you're perfectly right she answered i was a coward to think of it kent squeezed her hand you're a trump he said little woman i've another idea turquand she was breathless beautiful if turquand has got it turquand will lend it but but has he well it's worth trying let's see i can catch the post he'll get the letter in the morning if he answered on the instant we could have the money to morrow night good lord how tired i am where's the stationery he dashed off a note begging his friend to send five pounds ten or six pounds if he could manage to spare so much immediately and then he remembered that he could not buy a stamp there was a sick pause defeat confronted them again there's nothing for it he said i must go and ask the garins i'd post it without one if we were in england but here he left her walking about the room in excitement and went down the bureau was shut he learnt that the women were out do you think nurse herself has got one he suggested coming back or or twenty five centimes she is out too she took baby ten minutes ago humphrey another inspiration the bottles she cried triumphantly pointing to the wardrobe there are three on an empty bottle of the wine that they sometimes boiled in the evening two sous were refunded if a customer chose to give himself the trouble to take it back they had had occasion to acquire the knowledge kent pulled the bottles out and after an abortive effort to make a parcel of them caught up his letter and ran to the shop he got thirty centimes bolted to the post office and saved the mail nothing could be done now but pray that turquand might be in a position to oblige him in the meantime the young woman all unconscious of the jeopardy in which it had been packed her box calmly in the room behind their door and prepared for her departure on saturday morning with the composure of one whose ticket and wages were as good as in her purse by friday evening the box was corded and labelled when kent and cynthia entered and beheld it so suspense tightened its grip about their hearts the mail would not be delivered until about nine o'clock and when they judged that the hour was near they sat with tense nerves straining to hear etienne's heavy footsteps on the landing as yet they had not arranged where to remove to on the morrow and they spoke disjointedly of the necessity for deciding something kent said that it would be desirable to have two rooms in the new place also then they would be able to talk when the baby was asleep in one room it would be awful this assumption that the nurse would not be with them was followed by intensified misgivings and in her imagination both saw her sitting on her tin box with her hat on while they faltered to her that after all she couldn't go if it comes in the morning you know he said at the end of a long silence it will be in time her train doesn't start till ten y e s said cynthia she expects it to night is that some one coming upstairs nobody answered kent listening intently no her train doesn't start till ten i don't think in point of fact that we can look for it to night you see we needn't give up if it hasn't come when we go to bed no that's what i mean one must allow for hark no it's nothing one must allow for him having to cynthia uttered a cry it is come in entrez yes etienne appeared a letter for monsieur kent snatched it from his hand it was from turquand he tore it open postal orders for six pounds dazzled their eyes in pencil was scribbled here you are sonny yours ever turk cynthia gave a hysterical laugh they were say ten minutes later after she had blessed turquand and her eyes were dried she opened the door or the adjoining room with great dignity and said by the way nurse i had better give you your money now you can change enough postal orders for your ticket you know opposite the station then she came back radiant and kent said salvation must be celebrated and as their cab next day wouldn't cost ten shillings they would go out on the boulevard and drink turquand's health and buy some tobacco on the way compared with what their state of mind had been they were supremely contented now that the danger of their servant witnessing their disgrace was over and in the morning when they had bidden her good bye and watched her drive away and their misfortunes were nobody's business but their own they drew a breath of veritable thanksgiving cynthia's trunks and humphrey's and his hat box and the dressing case that somebody had given to the girl as a wedding present were drawn together in a corner of the room to be left behind and with intermittent attentions to the baby they stored their toilet articles and all the linen that it would hold in the hand bag that was to be taken with them the bassinet was already shut up and sewn in its canvas wrapper and the blankets and such of the child's clothing as would not go in its box had been packed downstairs in the perambulator there was nothing further to do but to put the oatmeal and the saucepan and a few other infantile necessaries in a basket leaving cynthia to collect these kent hurried out to obtain accommodation at an hotel he went first to the one where they had stayed on their arrival it was close at hand but all the communicating rooms were occupied and he was forced to try somewhere else jordan who had done turf topics for the world and his wife had once mentioned to him a place in the rue de constantinople as being cheap and comfortable and he bent his steps there impatiently regretting that they had not made their arrangements earlier the mother had intended to see to the matter in order to be sure that everything was suitable and that there wasn't a draught from the window and the rest of it but being so much worried she had put it off when he reached the address in the rue de constantinople he was not favourably impressed the terms were low but the proprietress seemed so too and though her manner was jovial enough and the place looked clean he hesitated to settle with her after he had tried at an hotel in the rue des soeurs filandieres at which he was obliged to own that the rate was higher than he was prepared to pay he decided that he had been hypercritical and went back but as ill luck would have it the woman had let the apartments that she had shown him five minutes after he left it was mi careme and the streets were beginning to be blocked by sight seers he remembered that cynthia would be sitting anxiously in the chaotic bedroom wandering why he was gone so long and hurrying through the crowd he returned to the rue des soeurs filandieres and said he had changed his mind he was glad when he had done so it was for only a week perhaps for less and there was a chambermaid who would be willing to assist madame with the little one when she could since madame found herself temporarily without a bonne she had a cock eye but she seemed to have a good heart and kent assured her that any extra services that she might render should be rewarded he made for the boarding house at his best pace and told the waiter to send for a cab constructed to carry luggage on the roof cynthia was in a chair with the baby on her lap and she looked up eagerly on the table was a tray with luncheon for which she would have been unable to go down even if she had had the audacity and she explained that madame garin finding that she did not appear had sent it up to her unasked cynthia had not been hungry but that was very nice of madame garin they were not entitled to dejeuner to day the little basket was ready now and kent cast a gloomy glance at the impedimenta that were to be detained questioning if he could manage to distribute more than three francs among the servants almost at the same moment there was a knock and etienne entered i have called a cab he announced surlily the patronne says there is no need for a voiture en galerie because monsieur must not take his trunks the colour fell from their faces and for a second they stood dumb and stock still oh yes stammered kent at last we are leaving our heaviest trunks we are going to send for them but we need a voiture en galerie all the same i will speak to madame garin he found her erect in the hall in her favourite attitude her arms folded across her flat breast her face was as pale as his own and her eyes were angry he looked at her amazed i don't understand your message madame he murmured i cannot have a voiture en galerie but it is for the things you have allowed not at all she exclaimed what do you suppose you will remove from my house you will take 'what i have allowed' but you need no voiture en galerie for that pray speak quietly he implored look there's the perambulator over there and there are the box and bassinet of course they must go on the roof of a cab we can't put them inside zut she answered i do not permit you to take such things i will watch what you take fetch your things down do you mean to say muttered kent with dry lips that at the last moment you refuse to let us take the child's bassinet i never consented to it you lie good god he said isn't mademoiselle garin at home i want to see mademoiselle where is she my daughter is out no you will not take the bassinet and you will not take the perambulator you will take what you can carry in the hand and that is all the perambulator we must have he insisted if you keep the bassinet you must let us have the perambulator the child's bedding and half its clothes are in it never she repeated and hugged herself determinedly you have had my acknowledgment of the debt and then you repudiate the agreement said kent trembling with passion it is very honest such behaviour 'honest' she echoed ha ha it was perhaps 'honest' that you came here with your wife and your little one and your nurse to live in my house and eat at my table and did not pay me for it you are a thief you are a rogue and a thief his fingers twitched to smash some man in the face and the box he gasped fighting for the ground inch by inch do you allow that never never never go and fetch your things down he went up slowly with weak knees cynthia was standing in the middle of the room pale and frightened she had her hat on the baby dressed for the streets was clasped in her arms she won't let the luggage go said kent hoarsely god knows what's come to her i don't perhaps she thinks we were trying to get out more than was arranged she swears now that she promised nothing come on it's no good waiting there's a cab at the door let's go but but what shall we do faltered the girl humphrey baby must have his things it's impossible to do without them oh this is awful awful or not we must put up with it for heaven's sake let's get out of the damned place as fast as we can where were the most important things put i don't know they are everywhere she declared tremulously i want the basket when we get in but afterwards i want the box and the bedding i want everything of baby's she must be a perfect wretch he seized the basket and the hand bag and they descended the stairs the baby crying loudly and the tears dripping down the girl's cheeks fortunately the boarders had all gone to see the procession but madame garin was still where kent had left her and etienne and the chambermaid and the italian waiter suppressing a smile stood watching about the hall in an agony of shame that seemed as if it would suffocate her cynthia slunk past them to the cab her head bent low over the child and as the driver opened the door she fell rather than sank on to the seat kent made to follow her immediately but this was not to be madame garin stopped him she commanded him to display the contents of the bag and then ensued a scene in which she became a mouthing shrieking harridan remonstrance was futile collars stockings handkerchiefs slippers were wrested from him piece by piece and flung on the office floor while she loaded him with abuse and the servants nudged one another grinning kent clung to the basket like grim death but the hand bag when she threw it back at his feet at last had been emptied of so much that he dreaded to guess what was left in it he picked it up without a word and scurried through the hail and plunged into the fiacre even then the ordeal was not over as the man mounted to the box a woman approached with whom they had grown rather friendly in the house and seeing humphrey with the bag she came to the cab window and put amiable and maddening questions as to where they were going and when they were coming back kent was voiceless but cynthia leant forward and replied in the midst of his misery and abasement he admired his wife for the composure she contrived to simulate in such a moment on reaching the hotel it was necessary to invent some story to account for the absence of luggage and he remarked as carelessly as possible that it would be delivered on the morrow he had ordered luncheon to be ready for them and in the room intended for cynthia and the boy a fire had been lighted she flew to the basket and boiled some oatmeal while kent endeavoured to soothe the mite whose meal had been delayed by the disturbance and who cried as if he would never be pacified any more when the food was cooked and something like order was restored the luncheon was allowed to be brought up the fillet overdone and the potatoes hard and stiff however after what they had been through it tasted to them delicious and emboldened by the thought that there would be no bill for a week kent told the waiter to take away the wine that was included and to bring them a bottle of burgundy instead the wine put heart into them both and as their fatigue passed they drew their chairs to one of the windows and found courage to discuss the situation while they gazed at the little ornamental garden at the corner of the street the baby slept tucked in the quilt of the high big bed and cynthia said that by and by he must be put inside the bed for the night in the frock that he had on every minute revealed some further deficiency they opened the bag and they had neither brushes nor sponges and but a single comb yet she laughed again for instinctively she realised that she was at the apex of her opportunity that at such a crisis a wife must be either a solace or an affliction she realised that whatever happened to them during the rest of their lives there would be moments when he looked back on their experiences in paris and remembered how she had behaved as they sat there beside the open window with the remainder of the bottle of burgundy between them and a smile forced to her lips the philistine might have been a bohemian born and bred again kent marvelled silently at her pluck by the time the dinner was laid their nerves were almost as equable as their speech but this renewed calmness received a sudden shock it was the rule of the proprietress they were told politely to ask for a deposit from strangers and she would be obliged if monsieur kent would let her have twenty or thirty francs purely as a matter of form cynthia started painfully and kent refastened the paper of his cigarette before he answered certainly he said is thirty francs enough i've only a cheque in my pocket but tell madame i'll give her the money to night when the waiter had withdrawn he and cynthia looked at each other aghast their breathing space had been brief they knew that their having no luggage had made the woman suspicious of them and that unless they were to be promptly turned out here as well the thirty francs must be found dinner had to be eaten lest they should appear discomfited by the message but the coffee was no sooner swallowed than kent prepared to go out swearing to obtain two or three louis before they slept and reminding the girl that if beaufort's expectations had been fulfilled he would now be in a position to let them have much more he went to search for billy among his various haunts the streets were massed and the slow pace permitted by the mob infuriated him all paris seemed to have surged on to the boulevard thronging the pavements and the roads and playing the fool he pushed forward as best he could and tried the grand in the faint hope that the other might be dining there or that something could be learnt of his movements but he was able to learn nothing after all he thought it would have been wiser to inquire at the bar in the rue saint honore and retracing his steps he now pressed through the crowd in the direction of the madeleine impeded and pelted with confetti at every yard at the corner of the rue caumartin a clown in scarlet satin thrust a pasteboard nose into his face kent cursed him and shoved him aside and the buffoon spun into the arms of a couple of shop girls who received him with shrill screams the concourse appeared to grow noisier and more impenetrable every moment it was the first mi careme celebration that the young man had witnessed and with fever in his veins and wretchedness in every fibre of him this carnival confusion with its horseplay and hindrance was maddening the lamplight sparkled with the rain of coloured discs they were pitched into his eyes and his ears as he struggled on the asphalt was soft and heavy with them when he reached the madeleine things were better but at the buffet beaufort had not been seen since five o'clock somebody there believed that he had an appointment at nine at the cafe de la paix kent edged into the throng again and forged his way until the cafe was gained the figure that he sought was in none of the rooms he squeezed along to all the likeliest cafes on the boulevard in turn and in one of them he descried jordan whom he buttonholed eagerly yes jordan had met beaufort this evening beaufort had said that later on he might go to the moulin rouge this was a clue at least and kent tramped wearily until the glittering sails of the windmill revolved in view the price of admission had been raised to night but he could not hesitate the dancing had already begun and two thirds of the assembly ran about in fancy dress a quadrille was going on and in different parts of the ballroom three sets were enclosed by vociferous english spectators while the band brayed a tuneless measure his gaze roved among the company vainly and he thought that he would be able to make his examination better when the sets broke up the listless dancers with stuff skirts and elaborate be ribboned petticoats lifted to their shoulders looked like factory hands as they lumped perfunctorily over the floor momentarily a mechanical smile alleviated the gloom of their excessive plainness at long intervals spurred to energy by the cries of the audience one of them gave a kick higher than usual or threw a bit of slang to her vis a vis but for the most part the performers were as spiritless as marionettes the air of gaiety and interest was confined entirely to those who looked on it was midnight when beaufort was found and he was partially drunk kent caught him by the arm and heard that his business had not been completed to day but was once more certain for next week completed or not however kent had to have money and he made the circumstances clear a task which in his companion's condition was somewhat difficult he said that they were in new quarters penniless and that the woman demanded a deposit their luggage was detained at the garins' and could not be recovered unless he paid the bill or at all events a substantial portion of it in the meanwhile they possessed literally nothing a good round sum on account of his claim was absolutely essential billy was tremendously grieved he answered that he could manage twenty francs and he repeated with emotion that he never deserted a pal in the end kent extracted fifty and secretly relieved even by this but dog tired dragged himself down the rue blanche towards the hotel cynthia was waiting up for him reading a sheet of an old newspaper that had lined one of the drawers to keep herself awake she heard the result of his expedition with gratitude they could now give the proprietress what she wanted and would be able to buy a hairbrush and one or two other immediate necessaries she kissed him and retired to the next bedroom where she prayed that the child would allow her a good night kent whose fatigue was so great that it was a labour to undress bade her call him if he could help her in any way it seemed but a few minutes afterwards that he was startled back to consciousness by the baby's crying and listening in the darkness he heard cynthia moving about blundering to the door with half opened eyes he found her trying to quiet the boy and to heat some food at the same time and the weariness of her aspect made his heart bleed the fire which had been built up to last until the chambermaid's entrance had gone out and rocking the child on her lap with one hand the girl semi nude held a saucepan with the other over the flame of a candle she rebuked him for coming in for poor fellow he must be so tired he took the saucepan from her and fetching the candle from his own room held the food to warm over both flames while maternity paced the floor a clock in the distance told them that the hour was three at last a tremor stirred the placid surface of the milk the baby was fed and coaxed to repose again and oblivious now of everything but the need for sleep they dropped upon their beds and slept chapter xix good morning monsieur here is the chocolate good morning and madame has hers been taken in ah three hours ago look it is a beautiful day monsieur then when the waiter had let in the sunshine and gone kent would rise and find cynthia either busily stirring more food over the fire or preparing the boy's bath afterwards she would carry him into the little enclosure opposite and what with her unfamiliarity with a nurse's duties and the makeshifts that she was put to it often seemed to her that this was the only time during the day that she was free to sit down their meals were all served in kent's bedroom but just as the luncheon appeared the baby who was feverish and fretful would surely cry and she would be obliged to call out that kent was not to wait for her begin for dinner she made desperate efforts by this time the child bathed once more was supposed to be already asleep and more oatmeal had to be stirred and carefully watched for five and twenty minutes an operation that entailed burning cheeks and occasionally despair since the saucepan had a habit of boiling over without warning and requiring to be filled and stirred for twenty five minutes again when the task was achieved there followed a hurried attempt to make herself look cool and nice before the soup arrived kent was apt to be irritable if she was not ready and providing the baby did not wake at the last moment and prevent her going in after all the dinner hour was very agreeable thanks to the chambermaid they had been able to dispense with the tallow candles at sixpence each and had obtained a lamp which was much more cheerful the vin compris had turned out to be rather good too and after the appalling meals at the garins' the cuisine struck them as quite first rate not infrequently when the coffee was brought in they sent down for liqueurs and their evenings despite the worry of the day and their ignorance where the money was coming from to pay the bill were very jolly beaufort's expectations were still unrealised on tuesday he was certain things would be right on thursday and on thursday with undiminished confidence he repeated early in the week the proprietress of the hotel was a huge red woman who had been a low class domestic servant the gracious service unexpressed by which she had attained her present prosperity the squinting chambermaid did not know and she added with a grin and a grimace that it was really very difficult to conjecture it the flaming countenance and belligerent eye of the proprietress would in the circumstances have scared kent from the door had she been visible when he came there to arrange and on friday night he slept uneasily she presented the bill next morning at nine o'clock and at twelve sent him a message that she wished it to be settled at once his interview with her was eminently unpleasant and on monday when the fire for the child was not laid and cynthia inquired the reason she learnt that the woman had forbidden the servant to take up any fuel but for nanette their position would now have been untenable she smuggled wood to the room pacified her mistress by the recital of imaginary telegrams picked up on monsieur kent's floor and finally squeezing cynthia's hand one afternoon offered to bring down some money that she had saved out of her wages this was the last straw cynthia put her arms round her neck and kissed her and when humphrey came home and she told him what had happened they both felt that to have to decline such a loan and wish that it could be accepted was about the deepest humiliation to which it was possible for people to sink they were mistaken but it was the lowest point that they themselves were called upon to touch the day following beaufort telegraphed asking humphrey to meet him at the cabaret lyonnais where at a moderate price he ordered a little dinner of supreme excellence billy had not had his loan made yet that he said buoyantly was certain for next week but he had had a lucky night at baccarat and after the benedictine he pulled out a bundle of notes on to the table of the shabby restaurant and beaming with rectitude paid his debt in full with a cigar in his mouth and delight bubbling in his veins kent jumped into a cab and having rattled to the rue des soeurs filandieres threw their receipt and the remainder of the money into cynthia's lap she nearly dropped the baby with astonishment and though they were unable to go out anywhere it was perhaps the liveliest night that they had spent in paris after adding the garins' account and the cost of their return and a present to nanette it was momentarily disconcerting to perceive how few of the notes would be left but the relief was so enormous that their spirits speedily arose again and extravagant as it was they ordered champagne and invited nanette to share it kent recovered their luggage the next morning and the morning after that they departed for london they had heard in the meanwhile that the walfords could easily put them up until no was ready for them the journey without a nurse was awkward and though it had been essential to go to the walfords' kent was chagrined to reflect that her absence would have to be explained compared with the crossing from newhaven this passage was to cynthia who had to remain below all the time a long voyage when they reached victoria at last she felt that she would have given a good deal to be going to the grosvenor hotel strawberry hill was gained about nine o'clock and kent found the house a pathetic descent from the hawthorns mr and mrs walford however were not unamiable and as they did not refer to the absence of the nurse otherwise than by inquiring how soon he expected to replace her he concluded that his wife had anticipated their surprise and discounted it more or less dexterously in her letters so the paper was a failure said walford when the excitement of the entrance had subsided oh well you will be able to get something to do here i dare say before long what do you think of the house not so bad eh not bad at all said kent very pretty that was awful news sir i was infernally sorry to hear about it might have been worse though a good deal ups and downs said the jobber we'll get square at the finish grin and bear it louisa old girl you'll always have enough to eat mrs walford laughed constrainedly she did not relish allusion to their reverses it appeared to her insult added to injury i don't think we've either of us much cause to grieve she answered we're very comfortable here don't you think so humphrey there are such nice people in the neighbourhood cynthia people who move in the best society and hee hee hee we are making quite a fashionable circle we are out almost every night well i don't hear much about paris did you have a jolly time we went everywhere and saw everything said cynthia humphrey got no end of tickets and well yes paris is lovely why 'well yes' well of course the paper's stopping was an anxiety to us mamma naturally how's aunt emily emily writes us once a week acknowledging the receipt of her allowance how she is i really can't tell you she says very little more than that she has 'received the money' she's living in apartments in brunswick square and i believe she is very glad she is alone i am i can tell you she has become very sour emily has apartments in brunswick square aren't so remarkably cheap said kent aunt emily must be expensive mater well she has er one room it's a nice large room i understand and quite enough for one person i'm sure there was no occasion for her to take a suite she isn't going to give any parties no occasion whatever a bedroom can be very cosy when the lamp's lighted and there's a bottle of wine on the table can't it cynthia she won't have any bottles of wine what are you thinking of said mrs walford not but what she could afford wine she added hastily but it doesn't agree with her it never did i suppose you know that caesar is still in germany he has settled there if there are moments when i feel out of it in spite of the company we see at strawberry hill it's when i read of the life that boy leads in berlin he is in a brilliant circle most brilliant cynthia told me he had a first rate thing capital thing affirmed sam briskly i tell you he's going to the top of the tree when he's my age caesar will be a big figure in europe kent thought he was a fair size already but replied briefly that he had been very fortunate ability my lad he's got the brains do you know louisa it was damn foolishness of us ever to persuade that boy to go on the stage he was meant for what he is we'd no right to divert his natural bent he's in the proper groove because his tendency was too strong for us but we were wrong i say we did very wrong by george he might never have made more than a couple of hundred a week among greasy opera singers all his life what a thing by dint of many midnight conferences with louisa he had almost succeeded in believing that he meant part of what he said are his prospects so very wonderful then asked cynthia surprised what is it he is doing it is only a sort of clerkship isn't it a clerkship shrieked her mother how can you talk such ridic'lous nonsense a clerkship absurd he's mccullough's right hand quite his right hand mccullough says he would be worth twice as much as he is to day if he had met caesar five years ago he told your papa so last week didn't he sam he did said the jobber but there was less conviction in his tone this was new and he hadn't taught himself to try to credit it yet he told your papa that caesar's power of er of gripping a subject was immense he had never met anything like it he consults him in everything he doesn't take a step without asking caesar's opinion first i don't suppose a young man ever had such an extraordinary position before clerkship ho you don't know what you're talking about kent gave the conversation a twist by inquiring miss wix's number as he and cynthia would have to pay her a visit and on searching for her address mrs walford discovered with much surprise that she was not in brunswick square after all but that her one room was in a street leading out of it the mistake was unimportant moreover his mind was too much occupied for him really to think of making social calls on any one but turquand to the office of the outpost he betook himself next morning and learnt that his friend was at brighton until monday this did not look as if he had been pressed for his six pounds but in other respects it was disappointing kent proceeded from the outpost to the offices of two other papers where he left advertisements and after that he had only to stroll back through the streets which looked very ugly and depressing after paris to ludgate hill luncheon was over when he re entered the villa but it had not been cleared away and he found cynthia in the dining room alone reading a novel he noted with as agreeable surprise as she could have afforded him that it was the copy of his own book that he had given to mrs walford on their return from dieppe he looked at his wife kindly turk's not in town he said helping himself to cold sirloin and salad gone to brighton for a day or two i've paid for my advertisements have you sent off yours yet to try to induce a general servant to accept a situation cynthia shook her head meaningly and came across and took a chair beside him kemp is awfully nice with baby she said she is upstairs with him now and on the whole i've been thinking that we had better not hurry to get home again we had better be a long time arranging matters humphrey while we are here we haven't any expenses kent stared and then smiled this is abominable morality he said paris has certainly corrupted you young woman and besides your people would worry my life out with questions nothing puts me in a worse temper than being asked what my news is when i haven't any that's all very well my dear boy but we have no money there's a quarter's rent overdue now isn't there and we should only have a month's peace before the tradespeople began to bother i really think we ought to take two or three weeks at all events finding a girl i do indeed mamma and papa would beg us to stop if they knew what a state we were in it seems to me we ought to do it without giving them the ahem needless pain of listening to our confession you're very specious laughed kent the semi serious conclusion might have been uttered by himself and he approved the tone without recognising the model has your mother noticed that you haven't got your ring on no i couldn't tell her a story about it and i'm praying that she won't i've been envying you your trouser pockets ever since we arrived don't take ale humphrey have some claret it will do you more good if we sold our furniture what would it fetch at a sale and apartments would cost us more than the house no we'll make ourselves welcome here for a week or so and well let's hope the advertisements will turn up trumps then we shall be independent one of the advertisements was to appear on monday chapter xx it was slightly disheartening to perceive how many other assistant editors were open to offers and he had the uncomfortable consciousness that his competitors' experience was probably a great deal wider than his own he knew that a daily was out of the question for him and his chance of securing a post on a periodical seemed scarcely better on monday morning when he saw the wanted columns cynthia declared that his own advertisement read nicer than any in the list and that if she were an editor it would certainly be the one to attract her attention but cynthia was his wife and not an editor and her view encouraged him no more than sam walford's supposition at the breakfast table that he might obtain the management of a sound magazine he went in the evening to soho and cornelia's successor in opening the door told him that turquand had returned the journalist was at the table writing furiously and kent declined to interrupt him more than he had already done by entering turquand indicated the cupboard where the whisky was kept and picking up a special edition kent sat silent until the other laid down his pen that's off my chest said turquand looking up after twenty minutes well my parisian how do you carry yourself do you still speak english i can still say 'thanks' in english answered kent i was devilish obliged to you old chap here's your oof rot said turquand have you been popping anything to get it the popping took place before i wrote you don't be an ass i couldn't take the things out even if i kept it go on don't play the fool well i've had some bad quarters of an hour in the pleasant land of france i can tell you that's what i want you to do said turquand let's hear all about it what do you think of that whisky half a crown my boy my latest discovery i think it's damned good myself he listened to the recital with an occasional smile and somehow now the trouble was past many of the circumstances displayed a comic side to the narrator what was quite destitute of humour was the present and when they fell to discussing this both men were glum i suppose you haven't been able to do anything with the novel kent asked has it made the round yet or does a publisher remain who hasn't seen it it came back last week from shedlock and archer oh yes publishers remain it's at thurgate and tatham's now i packed it off to them on friday farqueharsen was no use i tried him as you asked he rejected it in a few days i wrote you that didn't i you did communicate the gratifying intelligence where has it been turquand produced a pocket book farqueharsen rowland ellis shedlock and archer he announced i must enter 'thurgate and tatham' i dare say you'll place it somewhere in the long run we haven't exhausted the good firms yet by the bye the front page has got a bit dilapidated you'd better copy that out and restore the air of virgin freshness when thurgate sends it home you expect he will then i don't know what to expect you seem so infernally unlucky with it for the life of me i don't know why it wasn't taken by cousins in the first instance i looked it through again the other night and i consider it's i don't want to butter you but i consider it's great work by jove i do kent glowed he felt as he had done all along that it was the best of which he was capable and praise of it was very dear to him even though the praise was a friend's i say you know about your wife's aunt i suppose said turquand what do you think of her she has left the walfords you mean who told you miss wix told me but i didn't mean that departure i meant her other one not heard of any other departure of the lady's what where's she gone she has gone to journalism said turquand with a grin the fair miss wix is a full blown journalist don't your wife's people know she's keeping it dark then she came to see me and said her income was slightly inadequate and she 'thought she could do some writing' wanted to know if i could put her in the way of anything get out scoffed kent did she really come to see you though very improper of her oh miss wix and i always took to each other i think she dislikes me less than anybody she knows i'm not kidding you it's true honour bright what that she's writing turquand nodded his face was preternaturally solemn but his eyes twinkled i got her the work he said it just happened i knew of a vacancy well upon my soul exclaimed humphrey i wish you'd get some for me doesn't it just happen that you know of another ah you aren't so easy to accommodate miss wix is a maiden and her exes aren't large she gets a guinea a week and is affluent with it it's a beautiful publication sonny a journal for young gals and it sells like hot cakes i tell you the outpost would give its ears for such a circulation kent stared at him incredulously a journal for young girls he echoed the acrimonious wix is this a fact or delirium tremens fact i swear she does the correspondence page she's been on it a fortnight now she's 'aunt' something i forget what at the moment they're always 'aunt' something on that kind of paper the young gals write and ask her questions on their personal affairs one of 'em says she is desperately in love with a gentleman of her own age seventeen and isn't it time he told her his intentions as his 'manner is rather like that of a lover' and another inquires if 'marriage between first cousins once removed is punishable by law' she calls them her nieces and says 'no my dear plaintive girlie i do not think you need despair because the gentleman of your own age has not avowed his feelings yet a true lover is shy in the presence of his queen but with gentle encouragement on your part all will be well i was so glad to have your sweet letter' miss wix miss wix yes her comforting reply to changed pansy the first week was a master piece must have bucked changed pansy up a lot and occasionally she has to invent a letter from a mercenary mother and admonish her the admonishments of mercenary mothers are estimated to sell fifteen thousand alone you should buy a copy it's on all the bookstalls buy it said humphrey i'd buy it if it cost a shilling what's it called well i'm not easily astonished but miss wix comforting changed pansy would stagger the colossus of rhodes does she like the work 'like' it my boy she execrates it sniffs violently and gets stiff in the back whenever the stuff is mentioned that's the cream of the whole affair the disgust of that envenomed spinster as she sits ladling out gush to romantic schoolgirls makes me shake in the night i've got her name now she's 'auntie bluebell' 'auntie bluebell's advice to our readers' winsome words one penny weekly kent himself began to shake and but that the bookstalls were shut when he took his leave he would have borne a copy home he told the news to cynthia and she laughed so much that sam walford underneath turned on his pillow and remarked gruffly to louisa that he didn't know what cynthia and humphrey had got to be so lively about he was sure considering their circumstances and that he was afraid humphrey was a damn improvident bohemian their mirth was short lived unfortunately the first advertisement was productive of no result and the solitary communication received after the appearance of the second was a circular from a typewriting office the outlook now was as desperate as before the post on the world and his wife turned up and their pecuniary position was even worse than then when they had been at strawberry hill a week too the warmth of the walfords' manner towards their son in law had perceptibly decreased and though kent did not comment on the difference in his conferences with cynthia he knew that she was conscious of it by her acquiescing when he asserted that they had been here long enough at this stage he would have taken a clerkship gladly if it carried a salary sufficing for their needs and after they had returned to leamington road and had temporised with the landlord and sold a wedding present for some taxes and were living on credit from the tradespeople he began to debate whether the wisest thing he could do wouldn't be to drown himself and relieve cynthia's necessities with the money from his life policy the idea which primarily presented itself as an extravagance came by reason of the frequency with which it recurred to him to be revolved quite soberly he wondered if cynthia would grieve much and if when his boy could understand she would talk to him of his papa or provide him with a stepfather he did not in these conjectures as to the post mortem proceedings lose sight of the eye of the beholder and devoutly he trusted that it would see the light after he was dead and make so prodigious a stir that the names of the publishers who had refused it were held up to obloquy and scorn he was walking through victoria street towards the station one afternoon and mentally lying in his grave while the world wept for him when he was brought to an abrupt standstill by a greeting he roused himself to realities with a start and found that the white gloved hand that waited to be taken by him belonged to mrs deane pitt how d'ye do mr kent are you trying to cut me i beg your pardon i didn't see it's awfully stupid of me i'm always passing people like that you've returned then for good oh yes we live in town you know in the suburbs at least you told me she smiled 'battersea' so i did 'battersea' is streatham but that's a detail the mechanicalness of his utterance passed and animation leapt back in him as he recovered from his surprise the sun was shining and her sequins were iridescent she was wearing violets his impression embraced the trifles with a confused sense that they made a delightful whole the smart smiling woman in the sunshine the purple of the flowers and the warmth of her familiar tones so you come to victoria every day and you haven't been to see me she said when did you leave paris i i've done nothing of course you know the world and his wife is dead mrs deane pitt when did i leave oh soon after the funeral i trust you've recovered from the bereavement she laughed are you on anything here not yet editors are so blind to their own interests well she put out her hand again and repeated her number when will you come in i'm nearly always at home about five good bye i'm going to the army and navy and i shall be late kent continued his way cheerfully the brief interchange of conventionalities had diverted his thoughts and his glimpse of this woman who took her debts with a shrug and had candidly adapted her ideals to her requirements till the former had all gone acted as a fillip to him she typified success of a kind and in a minute he had seemed to acquire something of her own vigour it made him happy also to observe that the manner of their parting had had no sequel and in recalling the mood in which he had walked through the champs elysees he decided that he had been extremely stupid to attach so much importance to it she was an agreeable woman towards whom his feeling was a friendship that he had once been in danger of exaggerating he would certainly call upon her at the first opportunity it was quite possible that she might be able to tell him something useful too before he fulfilled his intention however an unlooked for development occurred the office of the agent who had endeavoured to find a tenant for him was on the road to the station and a day or two later the man ran out after him and asked if he was still willing to let no kent replied shortly that the opportunity had presented itself too late but after he passed on he reflected the house was wanted at once by some americans who had considered it previously they now made an offer of three and a half guineas a week for a period of six or twelve months it appeared to kent that he had been very idiotic in dismissing the suggestion off hand with three and a half guineas a week less the rent and taxes he could send cynthia to the country for a few months which was exactly what she stood in need of and though he could not leave london himself he could shift alone somewhere till he found a berth and she rejoined him cynthia and he discussed the idea lengthily she was opposed to the separation but she agreed that it would be very unwise of them to refuse to let the house she said that they might all live together in apartments on the money fresh air and peace would be delicious if kent were with her but she thought that she would rather stay with him in london than go away by herself this point was debated a good deal there was much against it it was absurd to deny that their anxieties and the restraint imposed by her charge of the baby had told upon her health in a little village where living was cheap she would not only recover her roses as soon as he earned a trifle she could have a nursemaid if they took lodgings together on the other hand they must be reconciled to going to a suburb and a suburb would be twice as expensive as the country by himself humphrey could get a top bedroom in bloomsbury for the same sum that he now spent on third class railway tickets the logic was inexorable and the only further question to decide was where she should go she recollected that a few years back miss wix had been sent to a cottage at monmouth to re coup after an attack of influenza the spinster had spoken very highly of it all the picturesque surroundings the attention she had received and the cosy accommodation if miss wix praised it there could be little to complain of surely as to the terms cynthia knew that they had been ridiculously low she determined to write to her aunt and ask if she remembered the address on second thoughts though she said she must ask her in person she had not paid her a visit yet nor had kent and an inquiry by post wouldn't do at all they went the following morning having looked in on the agent and informed him that they were prepared to accept the offer and to give up possession at the end of the week the payments of course were to be made monthly in advance miss wix lodged in hunter street and they found that in her improved circumstances she boasted two rooms the parlour that she had acquired was furnished chiefly with a large round table a number of berlin wool antimacassars and a waxwork bouquet under a flyblown shade and at the table which was strewn with letters the spinster had been sourly engaged upon her advice for winsome words she welcomed them politely and offered to have some tea made if they would like it but as it was one o'clock they said that they weren't thirsty the request for a five years old address evidently perturbed her very much but after a rummage behind the folding doors she emerged with it and to mollify her cynthia referred again to her journalism and reiterated congratulations mr turquand told humphrey or we should never have known aunt emily why have you kept it so quiet we were delighted by the news i think it is very clever of you indeed there is nothing to be delighted about i kept it quiet because i did not wish it known a very sufficient reason mr turquand is much too talkative i think you ought to be very proud said kent a lady journalist may i am i allowed to look at some of the copy as i can't prevent you seeing it whenever you like to spend a penny said miss wix bitterly it would be mere mockery to prevent you now you underrate your public he murmured winsome words has an enormous circulation i hear among chits exclaimed the spinster with sudden wrath among chits and fools smack 'em and put 'em in an asylum if you want to then read it aloud cynthia shall hear what i have to do in order to live if louisa weren't your mother my dear i'd say that it's a greater shame to her than to me i would if she weren't your mother that's what i'd say well let's have a look said humphrey quickly where is it now then what's this oh miserable maidie 'yours is indeed a sad story miserable maidie because you seem to have no one to turn to for help and counsel i am so glad you resolved to come to your auntie bluebell and tell her all about it so you and your lover have parted in anger and now you are heartbroken and would give worlds to have him back ah my dear i can feel for you it's the old old story ' that'll do snapped miss wix 'the old old story' my word i'd 'old story' the sickly little imbecile if i had her here she sat bolt upright her eyes darting daggers and her pink tipped nose disdainful haven't you had enough of it yet what do you think of me i think with respect of anyone who can earn a salary said kent i see there's one to anxious parent may i glance at your advice to anxious parent 'my dear friend were you i never young yourself and didn't you love your little ermyntrude's papa if so you can certainly feel for two young things who rightly believe that love is more valuable than a good settlement let them wed as they wish and be thankful that ermyntrude is going to have a husband against whom you can urge no other objection than that he is unable to support her' i'm a sensible woman cynthia said miss wix quivering and for me to have to write that incomes don't matter and sign myself 'auntie bluebell' is heavy at your mother's door her mortification was so evidently genuine that kent gave her back her copy with replies to a lover of winsome words and constant daffodil unread and as soon as was practicable he and cynthia rose and made their adieux the apartments in the cottage proved to be vacant and as the references of the american family were satisfactory and the inventory was taken without delay there was nothing in the way of the migration being effected by the suggested date cynthia had proposed that her husband should try to obtain his old bedroom at turquand's where he could have the run of a sitting room for nothing and this idea was adopted with the approval of all concerned humphrey saw her off at paddington and kissing her affectionately told her to make haste and get strong and the close of a week which had opened without a hint of such developments saw cynthia living with her baby in monmouth and kent reinstalled in his bachelor quarters in soho chapter xxi it was very jolly to be back with turquand the first evening while they smoked with the enjoyable consciousness of there being no last train to catch was quick with the sentiment of their old association and after a letter arrived from cynthia in which she clapped her hands with pleasure the respite was complete kent had been impatient to hear how the place struck her and she wrote that she had been agreeably astonished the cottage was roomier than she had expected and beautifully located it was furnished very simply of course but there was a charm in its simplicity and freshness the landlady was a rosy cheeked young woman who had already fallen in love with baby and overwhelmed her with attentions if you do not see what you want please step inside and ask for it kent smiled at that it was a quotation from one of the streatham shop windows also there was a quite respectable garden which her bedroom overlooked there are fruit trees in it not my bedroom the garden and a little not too spidery bench where i know i shall sit and read your answer when it comes she wrote a very happy spontaneous sort of letter and kent's spirits rose as he read it there was the rustle of dimity and the odour of lavender in the pages and momentarily he pictured her sitting on the bench under the fruit trees and thought that it would be delightful if he could run down one day and surprise her there it was very jolly to be back with turquand though the satisfaction was perhaps a shade calmer than during the first year of his married life he had fancied that it would be it was convenient moreover to be in town and a relief to feel that the unsettled accounts with the tradespeople round leamington road were at any rate not waxing mightier nevertheless he missed cynthia a good deal not only in the daytime when he was alone but even in minutes during the evening when he was in turquand's company it was curious how much he did miss her and the baby the baby whose newest accomplishment was to stroke his father's cheek and murmur poor until the attention was reciprocated when he bounded violently and grew red in the face with ridiculous laughter soho too though it saved him train fares soon began to appear as distant from a salary as streatham turquand remained powerless to put any work in his way and despite his economies and the cheapness of monmouth kent found his expenses dismaying he was encroaching on the money laid aside for the landlord and the rates and if nothing turned up there would speedily be trouble again the butcher who had supplied no had been to the agent for mr kent's address and he presented himself and his bill with no redundance of euphemism when another advertisement had been inserted ineffectually the respite was over and anxiety returned as yet kent had not called on mrs deane pitt and on the afternoon following his interview with the butcher he paid his visit to the lady he was very frank in his replies to her questions he did not disguise that it was imperative for him to secure an appointment at once and when she agreed with him that it was immensely difficult instead of answering that it was likely some opening might be mentioned to her his face fell he felt that it behoved him to deprecate his confidences you must forgive my boring you about my affairs he said and what are you doing are you at work on another book now i've a serial running in fashion she said and they print such ghastly long instalments that it takes me all my time to keep pace with them you haven't bored me at all a post on a paper is a thing you may have to wait a long time for i'm afraid you see you aren't a journalist really are you you're a novelist i'm nothing said kent with a dreary laugh for that matter i wouldn't care if it weren't on a paper i'd jump at anything a secretary ship for preference secretaryships want personal introductions they aren't got through advertisements she hesitated i can tell you how you might make some money if you'd like to do it she added tentatively it's between ourselves if it doesn't suit you you'll be discreet oh of course said kent with surprise but i can promise you in advance that any means of making some money will suit me just now what are you going to say she looked at him steadily with a slow smile how would you like to write a novel for me she asked instantaneously he did not grasp her meaning how he exclaimed do you mean you are offering to collaborate with me i can't do that she said quickly i'm sure you know i should be delighted but i shouldn't get the same terms if i did and i haven't the time either that's just it i'm obliged to refuse work because i haven't time to undertake it no but it might be a partnership as far as the payment goes if you care to write a novel i can place it under my own name and you can have well a couple of hundred pounds almost as soon as you give it to me i can guarantee that you can have a couple of hundred a week or two after it's finished whether i sell serial rights or not she took a cigarette out of a box on a table near her and lit it a shade nervously kent sat pale and disturbed that such things were done at all events in france he knew but her proposal startled him more than he could say or than he wished to say his primary emotion was astonishment that mrs deane pitt had had the courage to place her literary reputation in his hands and then as he reflected an awful horror seized him at the thought of a year of his toil of effort and accomplishment going out for review with another person's name on it the pause lasted some time i don't much fancy the idea he said at last slowly thanks and it wouldn't assist me i want money now not a year hence a year hence she murmured a year hence would be no use to me but you could do it in a month pray don't mistake me i'm not anxious to get any kudos at your expense i don't want you to do the kind of thing that i suppose you have done in this novel of yours that's making the round now i don't want introspection and construction and all that all i want is to buy shoes for my poor little children and what i suggested was that you should knock off a story at your top speed i don't care a pin what it's like only turn me out a hundred thousand words a hundred thousand words cried kent in a month you might as well suggest my carrying off one of the lions out of trafalgar square the eye of the beholder isn't a hundred thousand words and i worked at it day and night and then it took me a year besides that's another thing it is going the round the story mightn't be any use to you if i did it i can place it said mrs deane pitt with emphasis don't concern yourself about its fate my friend your responsibility will be limited to writing it your book took a year i've no doubt you considered and corrected and spent an afternoon polishing a paragraph supposing you take six or seven weeks then do you mean to say you couldn't write two thousand words a day no i don't believe i could not if you offered me the mint said kent but you can put down the first words that come into your head anything will do naturally it would be no use to me if you wrote 'mother hubbard went to the cupboard' over all the pages but any trivial thing in the shape of a story i assure you i can arrange for at once indeed it is practically arranged for all that remains is for you to give it to me she puffed her cigarette silently and the young man mused the plan was repugnant to him but if as she said anything would do well perhaps he could manage it in the time he did not know two hundred pounds would certainly be salvation and for seven weeks' work a magnificent reward i'll tell you she continued after a few moments if you liked to do me a short story or two now and again we should have money from those in the meanwhile i don't want to persuade you against your convictions if you have any but our business together would pay you better than an appointment even if you found one and though that's nothing to do with it it would be a tremendous benefit to me as well see with our two pens we can produce double the work and we share the advantage of the popularity i've gained oh i quite appreciate the pecuniary pull he answered i could hardly write short stories while i was fagging at a novel though i think myself one goes back to the novel all the fresher for the break she said but of course everybody has his own system of working would you care to write me a couple of three thousand word stories first we can discuss the book later if you let me have two stories to morrow night i could give you five guineas each for them on saturday to morrow is out of the question you don't realise how slowly i write and i haven't the motives say the next day say by thursday but it must be by then the man goes out of town on saturday and i want him to read them before he goes if i can have the manuscripts on thursday you can have ten guineas saturday night it's a very good offer said kent you must get a royal rate well i couldn't always offer you so much but then i don't often want them quite so long two of three thousand words and to end happily for choice not too strong if they will illustrate well all the better but you needn't give yourself any trouble on that score it's the artist's affair i'll do them said humphrey i suppose i must make an attempt to imitate your style it isn't necessary i generally begin with a very short sentence like 'it was noon' or 'it rained' you might do that but i really don't know that it matters mr kent yes he said this is a confidential matter i rely on your honour not to mention it to a living soul of course i don't know how much married you are but i depend on you not to tell your wife it would ruin me if it came out he assured her that she might trust him and having pledged himself to the lighter task he resolved on his way home that he would undertake the heavier too she did not want a year of his best work he doubted if he could contemplate that even if refusal meant strawberry hill for cynthia and the baby and the workhouse for himself she asked only a few weeks of his worst money was indispensable he must make it in whatever way he could a ghost eh he was rising finely in the career of literature his first novel had received what was almost the highest possible cachet his second was declined with thanks and now no mode of livelihood was left him but to be a ghost his throat was tight with shame there were tears in it that passed he reflected that with two hundred pounds in his pocket he would be able to sit down to another novel on his own account he might be luckier with that than with the eye of the beholder what were a few weeks compared with two hundred pounds mrs deane pitt must have thought him a fool to hesitate practical herself indeed but well for all that it was rather fascinating to feel that so intimate a confidence was going to subsist between them she had been a trifle nervous too as she took that cigarette he hoped he hadn't been a prig she was very nice it distressed him to think that she had been afraid of him even for a second two hundred pounds he wondered what share it was half or more than half or less with a woman however he could not go into that his admission that five guineas seemed a lot to him for a three thousand word story had probably been injudicious and it must have made him sound very ignorant besides well that couldn't be helped and he would be glad if the partnership paid her well whatever terms she obtained she must be perfectly aware that her offer was a liberal one to a man in his position and he was grateful to her he felt it again she had been nice he began to revolve a plot for the first of the stories and by the time he reached home he had vaguely thought of one when turquand came in it had shaped saying that he had work to do kent left him and went upstairs he drew a chair to the table and sat down and wrote slowly painfully the man was an artist and he could not help the care he took he sneered at himself for it mrs deane pitt had impressed on him that anything would do and here he was meditating and revising as if it were a story to submit to the most exclusive of the magazines in his own name he dashed his pen in the ink and threw a paragraph on the paper but he could not go on his consciousness of that slip shod paragraph higher up clogged his invention so that he had to go back to it and put it right presently a touch of cheerfulness crept into his mood that was well said yes she would praise that the pride of authorship possessed him he wrote with pleasure and at two o'clock when a third of the tale was achieved he went to bed feeling exhilarated it was no easy duty to him to complete both stories by thursday morning and confronted by the necessity for making turquand a further excuse for retirement he almost wished now that he were living alone he was vastly relieved that the other accepted his allusions to something that would keep him busy for a month or so with no apparent perception of a mystery after the first inevitable question was shirked the journalist put no more and behaved as if the explanation had been explicit neither kent's friendship nor his admiration for him had ever been so warm as while he decided that turquand's experience must lead him to suspect something like the truth and enabled him to conceal the suspicion under his normal demeanour with cynthia the ghost was less fortunate though he barely divined it by her answer he told her as much as he was free to tell he wrote that he had work on hand at last and that they would have ten guineas on saturday and a large sum in a couple of months where the stuff would appear he could not say without a falsehood and he trustee she would not be curious on the point the reservation that he regretted gave to his tone an aloofness that he did not design cynthia refrained from inquiring but she was hurt she felt that he might have imparted such intelligence a little more enthusiastically at a little greater length did he suppose that her interest was limited to the payment was she only held sympathetic enough to mind the baby when they were obliged to discharge the nurse now that he returned to work her husband was going to treat her as a child again just as he had done when he was engaged on his book she did not perceive that while he had been writing the book she had occupied the position most natural to her she did not detect that the attitude in which she recalled it was a new one it was however the attitude of a woman the hidden chagrin and urbanity of her reply was a woman's these things were part of a development of which while they had remained together neither she nor the man who missed her had been acutely aware chapter xxii mrs deane pitt paid kent the ten guineas a few days after the saturday on which she had expected to receive the editor's cheque and she made no secret of being delighted with the two tales they were based upon rather original ideas and after she had had them typewritten and read them she talked to him about them with the frankest appreciation possible kent almost lost sight of his regret that they weren't to appear under his own name as the lady expressed her approval and declared enthusiastically that to call them excellent was to say too little he found it very stimulating to hear his work praised by mrs deane pitt especially as it was work done for her although she had professed to be careless of the quality it was not to be supposed that she would not rather sign good stuff than bad and the warmth and gaiety of her comments took the sting from the association and lent it a charm when he began her novel it was with the discomfiting consciousness that the breakneck speed imposed on him would prevent the labourer being worthy of his hire he was too hurried to be able to frame a scenario and neither he nor the lady who was to figure as the author had more than a hazy idea of what the book was going to be about he had mentally sworn to keep his critical faculty in check and to produce a chapter of two thousand words every day if he did not bind himself to the accomplishment of a fixed instalment daily the book would not be finished in double the time at his disposal and he rose at seven and worked till about midnight on the day on which chapter i was done he had corrected in a fashion as he composed and he did not read it through when he put down his pen that would be too disheartening he remembered the opening chapter of the eye of the beholder and contrasted with the remembrance these pages that he had perpetrated appeared to him puerile and painful he folded them up and posted them to mrs deane pitt with a note before he slept whether you will want the novel after you have seen this i don't know he wrote i am sending it to you to ascertain it is a specimen of the rubbish the thing will be if i have to turn it out at such a rate i will call on the chance of your being in to morrow afternoon he found her at home and she welcomed him with a humorous smile you have read it asked kent with misgiving yes i've read it she said violet pray don't look so frightened of me why 'violet' well the type of modesty well what's the matter with it it'll do all right kent drew a breath i'm glad to hear you say so i'm bound to confess i thought it very slovenly myself oh nonsense she said have you gone on with it no i waited for your verdict i thought you might call me names and cry off i'll go on with it now though like steam do i suppose you couldn't manage a five thousand word story for me this week could you it would be good business he stared ruefully no indeed not if i'm to write a chapter a day oh the chapter a day please get the novel done at the earliest moment possible that's the chief thing you will won't you i should be so grateful to you if you finished it in six weeks i promise to finish it as quickly as i can he said even if i didn't care to serve you i should do that for my own sake when i get two hundred pounds i shall be at the end of my troubles happy man said mrs deane pitt would that two hundred pounds would see the end of mine and as you do want to serve me you'll do it even more quickly than you can or try that's very nice of you i wonder how true it is one of the answers one has to make isn't it then when you're behind with the work and your wife wants to be taken out somewhere you'll nobly remember there's a miserable woman in victoria street depending on you and persuade mrs kent to go with a sister or a cousin or an aunt you'll say to yourself 'excelsior' and other improving mottoes meaning 'loyalty forbids' i'll say 'loyalty forbids' when i want to go out by myself my wife's in the country tant mieux if it isn't shocking she laughed i'm afraid a woman on the spot would prove too strong for me am i grossly selfish poor boy who has got no wife she looked at him as she had looked across the supper table in the avenue wagram he could not think of anything to say of a nature that commended itself to him and he exclaimed abruptly oh you may rely on me mrs deane pitt i'll never go anywhere i'll be a hermit by the way you don't know i'm in soho now perhaps i'd better give you the address certainly she said i may want to write to you the hermit of soho well when you've been good and done penance thoroughly hermit you may come and see me sometimes i'll allow you that distraction come in whenever you like and you can tell me how the thing is going any afternoon you please at this time and don't come in trembling at me any more i don't expect you to write me a masterpiece in six weeks poor boy kent kept his word to her doggedly and although he continued to rise early he was seldom free to join turquand until about nine o'clock in the evening when the chapter was done he would go downstairs and light another pipe and turquand would put away his book or his paper without any indication of curiosity with a woman such a state of things would have been impossible but turquand's manner was so unforced that by degrees kent came to own that he was tired or to make some other allusion to his labour quite freely and not once did the other say to him well but what is it you're doing on the days that he called on mrs deane pitt it was later still before he could loll in the parlour the temptation to go to her however was more than he could resist he realised very soon that she had an attraction for him which was not in the least like friendship and which he could never term friendship any more in moments as he sat writing in his shabby bedroom under the tiles the thought of her would suddenly creep into him and beat in his pulses till he was assailed by a furious longing to be in her presence and though he often denied the longing he frequently obeyed it he would throw down his pen and change his coat and leave the house impetuously seeing her in fancy all the way to the flat during a fortnight or so he sought some reason for the visit would she like the heroine to go on the stage when her husband lost his money did she think it would be a good idea to kill the husband and introduce a new character to reinstate the girl in luxury but presently such excuses were abandoned for one thing mrs deane pitt was too much occupied with her serial to accord any serious consideration to his work and for another she welcomed him as a matter of course it was agreeable to her to see this man who was in love with her and whom she liked looking at her with eyes that betrayed what he would not allow his tongue to acknowledge oh i'm glad she would say i was hoping it was you sit down and make yourself comfortable no bring me that cushion first and talk to me and be amusing sometimes she received him radiantly sometimes wearily on one afternoon she declared she was in the best of spirits and had just been wishing for someone to bear her company on the next she sighed that she was worried to death and that he had only arrived in time to save her from extinction bills she would yawn when he questioned her bills a dressmaker a schoolmistress i forget which some wretch threatens something i know don't look so concerned i shall survive cheer me up then the servant would enter with the tea things and afterwards in the cool shadows of the drawing room through which the perfume of the heliotrope that grew in a huge bowl under the crimson lamp floated deliciously there would be cigarettes and a half hour that he found exquisite in its air of intimate familiarity though no verbal admission was ever made there were seconds in which kent's voice as plainly as his face told her what he felt for her and seconds in which the tones of the woman said i'm quite conscious of the effect i have on you we both understand of course occasionally he had a glimpse of her children and once when he was there mrs deane pitt took the boy on her lap among the folds of her elaborate tea gown and fondled him do you think i make a nice mother mr kent she said flashing a glance this monkey doesn't appreciate his privileges she kissed the child three times and in the gaze that she lifted over his curly head there was for an instant provocation that shook the man but such incidents as this were exceptional and as a rule kent could not have cited a single instance of coquetry when he took his leave and returned to the attic nor did the passion she had aroused in him militate against the success of his enterprise taking success to mean its completion by the given date perhaps he was more industrious even in the perception that she was always warmest when he had done the most i finished the thirtieth chapter last night then she would be delightful and if she had appeared harassed at all her languor would speedily give place to gaiety the tremulous afternoons were never so quick with the sense of alliance so entirely fascinating to him as when he was able to surprise her by some such report the desire to please the woman became fully as strong a stimulus to the ghost as his eagerness to receive the money that would permit him to begin a third novel for himself the two short stories had been published now in a periodical in which kent would have been very proud to see his own name and though he did not grudge them to her he could not help feeling as he read them that they were better than he had known and that it would be eminently satisfactory to resume legitimate work after the fortieth chapter was scrawled conclusion was in sight and though he could not quite sustain his earlier pace he never turned out less than one thousand words a day had anybody told him a couple of months before that he could do even this he would have ridiculed the statement but the consciousness that acceptance was certain had been very fortifying he scarcely allowed himself leisure to eat after passing the fortieth chapter the stuff was undeniably poor though it was not so jejune as it seemed to kent the worst part was the construction for ignorant what the next development was to be he was often forced to write sheets of intermediate and motiveless dialogue until an idea presented itself but for the style hasty as it was there was still something to be said instinctively kent gave to a commonplace redundancy a literary twist and the writing had almost invariably a veneer though the matter written might be of no account during the final week he did not go to victoria street at all he could not suppress the artist in him wholly and for the climax he meant to do his utmost it was a sop to his conscience he could remember the last chapter and forget the rest he had sent or taken the manuscript to mrs deane pitt piece by piece and he took her the last of it on the evening that he wrote the end a telegram had told her to expect him he had written the book in seven weeks but he felt as exhausted as if he had built a house in the time brick by brick with his own hands she read the pages that he had brought while he watched her from an arm chair and with the candour which was so striking a feature in such an association she cried that the scene was admirable that she could not have done it half so well kent's weariness faded from him as they talked and momentarily he regretted that he had not been able to write a book for her equal to the eye of the beholder with regard to her negotiations however she was not so outspoken it was only by chance that kent had seen the two short stories she had not even told him for what paper they were intended there was some delay in paying the two hundred pounds and her explanations were vague and various the partner with whom she always dealt was on the continent she would not sign an agreement before american copyright was arranged she generally ran her stories as serials before they were issued in book form and it was not decided what she was going to do half a dozen reasons for postponement were forthcoming she gave him his share at last though and very cordially and he felt some embarrassment in taking her cheque when the moment arrived its being his earliest experience of business with a woman if he had had others he would have appreciated her action in paying him in full and only a little late more keenly than he did though he was far from ungrateful to her as it was he put the cheque in his pocket as carelessly as he could manage and said well you've done me a tremendous service mrs deane pitt and by jove i thank you for it heartily oh rubbish she replied the work's been as useful to me as to you you've nothing to thank me for it makes more difference to me said kent it means you hardly know what it means i needn't look out for a berth now i can sit down to another novel i owe you that if you like to think so she smiled but her tone was constrained i should be glad if somebody owed me something i'm more used to its being the other way round i feel a croesus we ought to celebrate this accession to wealth it demands a festivity if i get seats for a theatre will you go to dinner with me somewhere to morrow night what shall we go to see have you been to daly's yet i'm engaged to morrow night and the next to night then this evening i am dining out there's the card on my desk what a fashionable person you are exclaimed kent rather enviously would friday evening suit you yes i'm free on friday but a theatre is awfully stifling this weather isn't it well we needn't go to a theatre he said we might dine at richmond will you drive down to richmond and have dinner at the star and garter on friday mrs deane pitt promised that she would but the animation with which she had given him the cheque had deserted her and after a minute she said i suppose your starting another novel for yourself needn't stand in the way of our business together there are several things i can offer you if you care to do them oh thanks said kent but i'm afraid i'd better stick to the novel i want to do all i can with it you see l'un n'empeche pas l'autre a short story now and then won't interfere with it surely i can place a ten thousand word story at once if you like to write it for me the refusal was difficult and he hesitated how to express himself he had never contemplated the association as a permanent one and now that an alternative was open to him its indignity looked doubly repellant he was surprised that mrs deane pitt expected it to continue couldn't she understand that he felt it a humiliation that he had adopted the course merely as a desperate measure in a desperate case he had taken her comprehension for granted i'd rather not if you don't mind he said awkwardly it would take me off my own work more than you can imagine my motive for doing this was to make it possible for me to devote myself heart and soul to a novel and that is what i want to do she looked downcast when do you mean to begin it you could knock off ten thousand words first couldn't you and i believe an occasional short story would come as a relief to you too i wouldn't persuade you against your will pray don't think that but as a matter of fact there is no reason why you shouldn't make a few pounds a week all the time you're writing your book you know if you like i don't want another novel yet but i can take almost any number of short stories or if you preferred it you might write me a short thing that could be published in paper covers at a shilling will you think it over i don't want to hurry your decision she hummed a snatch of tune and picked up a new song that was lying on the piano have you seen this she said carelessly it's pretty kent took it from her and played with the leaves in a pause he was conscious that he must decline now and definitely and the insistence of her request made the duty harder every second mrs deane pitt sauntered about the room she felt blank and annoyed with herself was this her reward for liking the man enough to give him two hundred pounds in a lump instead of paying him by instalments which would have been infinitely more convenient to her if you won't think me boorish he said at last abruptly i'd rather keep to my intention i'm not a boy i need all the time at my disposal to succeed in she gave a forced laugh how much younger do you want to be if the money doesn't attract you it won't be in your way i suppose and you can do it to oblige me come i'm quite frank i own that you're very useful to me you don't mean that you're going to strike and leave me in the lurch the face upturned to him was more earnest than her words her brown eyes widened and fastened on him and for an instant his resolution broke down but it was his work and his ambition his fidelity to his art that she was asking him to waive he would not nobody so sorry as the 'striker' he said in a tone to match her own let me be your banker when i'm going into a dozen editions mrs deane pitt and i'll serve you all you want the service you ask me to day is just the one i can't do bien she murmured i suppose you know your own business best but she was plainly disappointed and though she speedily spoke of another subject her voice lacked spontaneity kent's courage knew no approving glow and if during the minutes he remained she had begged him to assist her by returning the cheque he would most certainly have done it he thought that she must hate him though in truth he had never appealed to her so strongly and it was the only occasion on which he had ever taken leave of her without regret to cynthia he wrote immediately telling her he had been paid two hundred pounds and enclosing twenty five that she might have a surplus to draw upon without applying to him he also remitted to paris the amount necessary to redeem her ring and his watch and chain and the rest he had now an opportunity of going down to see her and he told her that she might expect him on monday or tuesday in the following week the picture he had once seen of surprising her in the garden had long since ceased to present itself to him and he was not impatient to find himself in his wife's company in the circumstances he questioned if mrs deane pitt would be disposed to go with him to richmond after what had passed to refuse a woman's petition to augment her income but to invite her to dinner at richmond was rather suggestive of the bread and the stone yet now that propinquity was not her ally he was fervently glad that he had had strength to refuse it was a partnership that every month would have made more difficult to sever and she had apparently looked for it to extend over years as to richmond he hoped the engagement would be fulfilled it would pain him intensely otherwise he owed her too much to be reconciled to their separating with coldness and he determined to send a note reminding her of her promise her reply allayed his misgivings it was confirmed by her demeanour when they met indeed her display of even more good fellowship than usual made him feel rather guilty she seemed to divine his reflections and to assure him that such self reproach was needless she had never been brighter or more informal with him than in the hansom as they drove down her air implied that their previous interview had been a trivial folly which as sensible people they must banish from their minds and she talked of everything and nothing with the gaiety of a schoolgirl on an unforeseen excursion and the piquancy of a woman who had observed and lived her vivacity was infectious and kent's constraint gradually melted in a rush of the warmest gratitude for her forbearance he was so entirely at her mercy here and he thought that few women similarly placed would have refrained from planting at least one little sting among their verbal honey his admiration began to comprise details he remarked the hat she wore and the delicacy of a little ear against her hair's duskiness he noted with pleasure the quick petulant twitch of a corner of her mouth as her veil got in the way and the appreciative gaze of young men in the cabs that rolled towards them a gaze which invariably terminated in a swift scrutiny of the charming woman's companion when the hotel was reached he had never been livelier and often as he had read an opposite opinion he found it very delightful to see the woman he was in love with eat and drink her champagne it was intimate it lessened the noli me tangere mien of feminine fashion and brought her closer the attire of an attractive woman who has never belonged to him has always a mystery for a man though he may have had three wives and kept a dressmaker's shop but liveliness was succeeded by a vaguer emotion as they lounged on the terrace over their coffee and liqueurs under the moon the river shone divine limitless in its glint and shadow her features took tenderness from the tremulous light and sometimes a silence fell which as he yielded himself to the subtile endearment of the moment soft as the breath of love on his face kent felt to be the supplement of speech a woman who could have uttered epigrams in the mood that possessed him now would have disgusted him and insensibly their tones sank she spoke gently seriously presently some allusion that she made begot a confidence about her earlier life her marriage it disturbed him to hear that she had been fond of deane pitt when she married him yet he was grieved when she owned how quickly her illusions had died her belief that she might have been a better woman if she had married a different man was pathetic in its revelation of unsuspected heart aches and sympathy made him execrate the feebleness of words her voice acquired an earnestness that he had never heard in it before and while he was stirred with the sincerest pity for her a throb of rapture was in his veins that she could be talking so to him the minutes were ineffable in which she seemed to discard the social mask and surrender more and more of her identity to his view spiritually she appeared to be lying in his arms and when she checked herself and rallied with a laugh which was over taken by a sigh he felt that he could have listened to her for ever how solemn we've become she exclaimed and we came out to be 'festive' to night i shall always remember the 'you' of to night he said they were silent again she passed her hand across her eyes impatiently as if to wave away the pictures of the past by transitions their tones regained their former cheerfulness she mentioned the hour and drew her wrap about her it was time to return it has been delicious she murmured looking up at the stars only you let me bore you by talking of yourself so stupid of me you know said kent you know i wanted to tell you you won't think so badly of me perhaps i i'm sure you have now sometimes if i confessed my thoughts you'd never say so any more really her eyes flashed mockery you mustn't tell me then i might be vain the cab bowled over the white roads rapidly the flutter of her scarf on his shoulder stole through his blood and the clip clop sound of the horse's hoofs seemed to him to waken echoes in his inside do you know it was very indiscreet of me to come down here with you she laughed supposing somebody had met us and then what would be thought what could be thought he asked unsteadily scandal perhaps i'm very angry with you you've made me do wrong why did you make me do wrong when i had such faith in you you've given me the happiest evening of my life said kent is that the wrong do you think happiness must always be right it's a convenient creed happiness at any price and let the woman pay it eh that's a man's philosophy you're quite right though but then you're at the happiest time of life no nobody is ever that the happiest time of life's the past believe me or believe me not the past is always beautiful to morrow i shall regret to day so shall i said kent but very much indeed i appreciate it now what are you cynical for you only put it on it's not 'you' really 'wise judges are we of each other' how do you know you said that to me once before in paris said what oh the quotation when at your place after the varietes what a memory yes you're certainly resolved to try to make me vain but i'm adamant did you know that i'm made of stone do you treasure up what every woman says to you the answer is a wounded gaze it's dark to see expressions but i'll take it for granted i remember what you said to me half an hour ago and i know your bitterness is a sham you were meant to be oh 'meant' she cried recklessly a woman's what she's made i'm afraid i've been made untidy do you mind driving in a hansom with such a figure she plucked at her veil in the strip of looking glass and bent her face to him for criticism the brilliance of the eyes that she widened glowed into him as she leant so and his arms trembled to enfold her his mouth was dry as he muttered a response the sweetness of june was in the air that caressed them as they sped through the moonlight with every sentence she let fall with every glance she shot at him she dizzied him more and he sat strained with the struggle to retain his self command through his febrile emotions the horror of proving false to cynthia loomed like an angel betokening the revulsion of his remorse he could imagine the afterwards he knew how he would feel and there were instants in which he prayed for the drive to finish and permit escape but there were instants also in which he ceased to fight and steeped in the present yearned only to forget his wife though tardy remembrance should be a double scourge her fingers were busy at a knot of violets in her dress and she held the flowers up to him looking round smiling shall i give you a buttonhole she inquired gaily it would be an appropriate conclusion my ideals my withered hopes and my dead violets oh i shiver to think of what i said to you did i gush towards the last i've a fearful a ghastly misgiving that i gushed if you acknowledge that i did i'll never forgive you but you shouldn't have encouraged me stoop for the souvenir it cost a penny symbolic of the sentiment though lost to sight to memory dear it will be a very dear memory won't it use me one day i shall come in as material the hard woman of the world who bares her soul on impulse and the star and garter terrace to the man she likes and stands revealed as as what i wonder what you'd make of me child i shall never get this buttonhole in if you don't turn i've admitted i'm a spectacle but you might suffer for a second her hair swept his cheek as she wrestled with refractory stalks and the dark eyes grew and fastened on him again the hansom sped on the quietude was left behind and the lights of the west end twinkled around them there was the rattle of traffic kent was laughing at something she had said and he heard himself with surprise or was it himself the cab rolled to a standstill and they got out the lift bore them to her landing the servant opened the door good night he said i won't come in oh come in it's not ten o'clock you'll have a brandy and soda before you go she entered without waiting for his reply and he followed her reluctantly only the lamp had been lighted and the room was full of crimson shadow he stood watching her unpin her hat before the mirror and pull at her gloves i don't think i'll stop he said again really i've something to do if i can't persuade you she answered listlessly her gaiety had deserted her and there was weariness in her attitude as she drooped by the mantelshelf her air her movements had a languor now she put out her bare hand slowly and kent's clung to it he stood holding her hand in a pause i can't leave you said kent chapter xxiii it was a little less than a fortnight after the dinner at richmond that kent brought mrs deane pitt the ten thousand word story that she had wanted and like the two earliest stories that he had written for her it was work to which he would have been glad to see his own name attached he had promised to let her have half a dozen short stories as soon after its completion as possible and it was his delight to surprise her by the versatility as well as the originality of the invention that he displayed in these in one he wrote an idyll in another a gruesome little sketch bound to attract attention by its weirdness in a third he seemed to be running through the stalest of devices towards the most commonplace of conclusions until lo in the last half column there came a literary thunder clap and this story was even more startling than its predecessors but all the links fitted if a reader liked to take the trouble to look back and the tragedy had been foreshadowed from the beginning the tales tickled the fancy of the editor for whom they were intended they tickled it so much that he asked mrs deane pitt to contribute regularly for a few months and the lady accepting the compliment and the invitation kent continued to supply the society mirror with an idyll or a tragedy or a comedy every week astonished at his own fecundity it was amazing how his hand was emboldened i his imagination stimulated by the knowledge that his work was accepted before it was penned there were weeks during which he turned out a story for mrs deane pitt nearly every day all the stories were built upon more or less brilliant ideas each of them was noteworthy and distinctive when it appeared in the society mirror or elsewhere and if his share of the swindle had been punctiliously paid to him now he would have been making a good deal of money even as it was he was making it in a sense for his partner always credited him with the sums that were not forthcoming entering them in an oxidised silver memorandum book that she kept in one of the drawers of her desk when he said that it did not matter about that she laughingly told him not to be a fool his conscience was not dull however and there were hours when kent suffered scarcely less acutely than one realises that a wife may sometimes suffer in similar circumstances his remorse then was just what he had known it would be from making his projected visit to monmouth he had excused himself it was repugnant enough to play the hypocrite in his letters and by degrees cynthia ceased to refer to his coming but while her silence on the point relieved him from the necessity for telling her further falsehoods it intensified his shame his abasement was completed by the seventh rejection of the eye of the beholder he sent it off again at once to messrs kynaston to get it out of his sight but the return of the ill starred package had revived all the passion of his disappointment concerning it and he could not get rid of the burning at his heart so easily as he did of the parcel the weight of the slighted manuscript lay on his spirit for days after thurgate and tatham's refusal the irony of it that mrs deane pitt could place his hasty work in the best papers was enabled to pay him two hundred pounds for writing a novel of which he was ashamed while his own book to which he had devoted a year was scorned on all sides true he had had in his own name very much better reviews than those that had been accorded so far to the novel written for her but what a profession once he owned to her something of what he was feeling he couldn't help himself he wanted her to comfort him the eye of the beholder has come back again he groaned really she said how many is that god knows it's awfully hard that you can place whatever i do eva and i get my best stuff kicked back to me from every publisher's office in london i'm miserable she smiled she did not mean to be unsympathetic but kent hated her for it furiously as she turned her face there's much in a name she said with a shrug what's the difference though your terms aren't bad 'miserable one' whether the name is mine or yours by the way i can work another tale for the metropolis if you'll knock it off for me i was going to write to you kent never appealed to her for pity again but a little later there came a letter from cynthia replying to his brief announcement of thurgate and tatham's rejection her consolation and prophesies of success yet overflowed four sheets and the man's throat was tight as he read them well he must do the tale for the metropolis but he would write some short stories for himself as well he determined it had not been a lucrative occupation when he essayed it before but those early stories had been the wrong kind of thing he perceived it now he would write some short stories of the pattern that was so successful when it was signed eva deane pitt he soon began to see his work over her signature in almost every paper that he looked at if he turned the leaves of a magazine on a book stall a tale of his own met his eyes signed eva deane pitt if he picked up a periodical in a restaurant a familiar sentence might flash out of the pages at him and there would be another of his stories by eva deane pitt yes he would submit to the editors on his own account he would not receive such terms as she that he knew he doubted strongly whether he would even receive so much as she spared to him after retaining the larger share but he could and he would get what was dear to him the recognition and the kudos to which he was entitled he found that he did not write so quickly for himself as in his capacity of ghost but he was not discouraged for he felt that he was writing better for a week he did nothing for the woman at all he wrote all day and half the night as humphrey kent and when a manuscript was declined by the society mirror he sent it to the metropolis and forwarded the story rejected by the metropolis to the society mirror he could not abandon his work for her entirely but under the pressure that she put upon him and his new interests he wrote for her more and more hastily wrote frank and unmitigated rubbish at last and on one occasion candidly told her so she had telegraphed to him at six o'clock begging him to call and he had risen from his table feeling that his head was vacant she clamoured for a two thousand word story by the first post the following morning and insisted as usual that anything would do he assured her that he was too exhausted even to invent a motive how could he produce two thousand words before he slept she overruled his objections hanging about him with caresses she made him promise that the sketch should reach her in time write twaddle dearest boy was her parting injunction but write it a motive a mercenary girl jilts her lover because he is poor and then her new fiance loses his fortune and the jilted lover succeeds to a dukedom what does it matter write a story that noah told to his family in the ark only cover enough pages write any rot simply fill it out i depend on you humphrey mind he went home and did it on the lines she had laid down she wanted drivel she should have it he did not stop to think at all he wrote without a pause or a correction as rapidly as his pen would glide and posted the tale to her before half past ten a note went with it i have done as you ordered he scribbled don't blame me because no editor will take such muck now you are obeyed she had no complaint to make when he saw her next and it was after this that kent's work for her was uniformly fatuous while he lavished on his own a wealth of fastidious care for which she would have mocked him had she known he visited her at much longer intervals now for a disgust of her caresses was growing in him a horror of the amorous afternoons which ended always with a plea for additional tales but that cowardice prevented him he would have stayed away altogether there grew something like horror of the woman herself insatiable no matter with how much work he might supply her coaxing him for two little stories more anything will do i must have a new costume darling really while a batch of manuscript that he had brought to her lay in her lap he could remember now with her arms about him the many original ideas that she had had from him at the beginning and he felt with a shudder that her clutch was deadly first she had had his brains and now she stole his conscience he foresaw that if the strain that she put upon him continued a day must come when the imagination that she was squeezing like an orange would be sterile or fruitful of nothing better than the literary abortions with which his mistress was content his dismay at his position did not wane it became so evident that by degrees a coldness crept into the woman's manner towards him he was at no pains to dispel it that their relations drifted on to a purely business footing inspired him with no other fear than that presently she might make him a scene and entail upon him the disagreeable necessity for declaring as delicately as he could that his infidelity to his wife had been a madness that he violently regretted and would never repeat the obvious retort would be so superficially true that fervently he trusted that the necessity would not arise meanwhile the short stories submitted in his own name with silent prayers had all been refused but undeterred by the failure he wrote more and more the present tenants of no were anxious to renew their agreement for another six months and he was pleased to hear it the prospect of meeting cynthia again frightened him and closing readily with the off er that afforded him a respite he remained at his literary forge in soho writing for mrs deane pitt and for himself seeing sometimes three of his tales for her published by different papers in the same week and finding the tales submitted in the lowlier name of humphrey kent returned without exception he would once have said that such a state of things couldn't be but now he discovered that it could be and was there was not at this stage a periodical or magazine in london that humphrey kent did not essay in vain and there were not more than three or four of the kind that one sees in a club or an educated woman's room in which his stuff did not appear at a substantial rate of payment when it was supposed to be by mrs deane pitt there were not in london five papers making a feature of fiction which did not repeatedly reject the man's best work signed by himself and accept his worst signed by somebody else not five of the penny or sixpenny publications not five among the first or second class not five editors appraising fiction in editorial chairs who did not either find or assume a story bearing the unfamiliar name of humphrey kent to be below their standard while they paid ten or twelve guineas for a tale scribbled by the same author in a couple of hours when it was falsely represented to be by mrs deane pitt during nine months he was never offered a single guinea by an editor for a tale every story that he submitted during nine months was declined and every story that he gave to mrs deane pitt was sold raging he swore that some day he would set the facts forth in a novel and even as he swore it he knew that they would be challenged and that in at least one literary organ of eminence a critic would write we do not find the situation probable once an editor did know his name he was the editor of a fashionable magazine and kent had called at the office to inquire about a manuscript that had been lying there for a long while the gentleman was very courteous he did not remember the title and unfortunately he could not put his hand on the tale at the moment but he promised to have a search made for it and to read it as soon as it was found a letter from him and the manuscript reached kent the same week it was as considerate a letter of rejection as any one could dictate the editor began by saying that the story was clever as all mr kent touched was clever but and then he proceeded to analyse the plot to demonstrate that the motive was too slight for the purpose the tone was so kindly that though kent could not perceive the justice of the criticism he was sensible enough to try he felt a glow of gratitude towards the writer and his appreciation was deepened when the following post brought him a copy of the current issue of the magazine with compliments he opened it at once and the first thing that he saw in it was a story done for mrs deane pitt the story that he had written tired and insolently careless about the mercenary girl and the jilted lover and the succession to the dukedom and this too he swore should be some day recorded in a novel though a critic knowing less about it than the author would not find the situation probable now when he was least expecting it there came to him the first gleam of encouragement that he had had since he received his last review messrs kynaston wrote offering to undertake the publication of the eye of the beholder if he were willing to accept forty pounds for the copyright he did not hesitate even for an instant he said thank god as devoutly as if he had never expected more for it turquand had just come in it's a wicked price grunted turquand but i suppose you'll take it if you can't get them to spring take it i could take them to my heart for it oh thank god i mean it yes it's beggarly it's awful but at any rate the book 'll see the light price it isn't a price at all but the thing 'll be published there's quite enough money for us to live while i'm writing my next and this will send me to it with double energy i shall go to kynaston's to morrow morning he did go and though he was less enthusiastic there his attempt to induce the publisher to increase the terms was but weak seven rejections had made a high hand unattainable i got a hundred for my first he said and you offer me forty for my second it isn't scaling the ladder with rapidity the other was longer perhaps suggested mr kynaston tapping his fingers together pensively three volumes don't you reckon that this will make three volumes then said kent two it's unfortunately short that's the only fault i have to find with it i like it it's out of the common but there isn't enough of it he sighed i am sorry that 'forty' is the most i can say i considered the subject very deeply before i wrote you very deeply indeed his expression implied that he had lain awake all night considering and that regret at being unable to offer more might even keep him awake again to night he did not disguise his opinion of the novel however especially after the matter was settled send us something else mr kent he said warmly as he saw the author downstairs and pressed his hand something a trifle longer and we shall be able to do better for you yours is a very rare style you have remarkable power if i may say so if fine work always meant a fine sale the eye of the beholder should see six editions i shall get it out at once good day to you and don't forget make your next book a little longer turquand would not be back for some hours and kent did not hurry home he sauntered through the streets reflecting he resolved that now he would do ghost work no more and he wondered how eva would receive the announcement disappointing as she would doubtless find it she would not have had much to complain of he thought he congratulated himself anew on their liaison having ended since it left him but one association to sever instead of two again an access of remorse in its most poignant form assailed him and he wished he could bear his good news to cynthia in lieu of writing it wished he could confess to cynthia wondered if the desire to do so was mad this desire had fastened on kent more than once he thought he would feel less guilty towards her would be less guilty towards her if she knew there had been moments when if they had not been separated he would have told her the truth in a burst and whether she pardoned him or not have lifted his head feeling happier for the fact that the avowal had been made he did not imagine that his craving to confess to her was any shining virtue he was conscious just as he had been conscious in paris when he had informed her casually of the supper in the avenue wagram that it was as much the weakness of his character as its nobility which urged him to voice the load that lay on his mind but weak or noble the longing was always there and at times it mastered him completely sleet began to fall and he went into a tea room and ordered some coffee a copy of fashion lay on the table and mechanically turning the pages he noticed that the feature of the issue was an instalment of a story in three parts by lady cornwallis the name arrested his attention for she was the widow of a man who had been a connection of the late deane pitt's and kent was aware that eva and she were on friendly terms he glanced at the heading with an ironical smile the lady was not known to him as an author though she had figured prominently of late in the witness box where a shrewd solicitor and a dressmaker of distinction had posed her in a quite romantic light he surmised bitterly that her maiden effort in fiction had been remunerated more handsomely than his second novel what was his astonishment on glancing at the opening paragraph to discover that the story by lady cornwallis was another of the stories that had been written by himself for mrs deane pitt as a matter of fact the editor thinking that her name would be a draw just now had offered lady cornwallis a hundred pounds for a tale to run through three numbers lady cornwallis who had never tried to write anything more elaborate than a love letter in her life and who was being dunned to desperation for an account at a livery stable had gone to mrs deane pitt to do it for her mrs deane pitt who wrote much less quickly than she pretended had relegated the duty to kent it was a literary house that jack built lady cornwallis fearing that her friend might ascertain how much the editor paid had ingenuously halved the sum with her mrs deane pitt confident that the young man would be unable to ascertain had given to him ten pounds at the details of the transaction kent could only guess as he sat staring at his work while his coffee got cold but the evolution of the story perpetrated in a soho attic for ten pounds and published as lady cornwallis's at the cost of a hundred was interesting he was fiercely and inconsistently resentful in one way it mattered nothing to him since his stuff wasn't printed over his own name it was unimportant over whose name it appeared but the perception did not lessen his angry sense of having been duped he remembered the circumstances in which he had written this tale and the lies that eva had told him about it was he to become the ghost of every impostor in london though he did not refer to the discovery that he had made it lent a firmness to his tone when he informed her that his book was accepted and that he was going down to the country to devote a year to another she heard him without remonstrance whatever her faults she had the virtue of being a woman of the world and she did not endow the parting for which she was partially prepared with any tactless tragedy for an instant only recalling the benefit of histrionics at richmond she considered the feasibility of sentiment begetting a reconciliation then she dismissed the idea the man was remorseful not of having become estranged from her but of having succumbed and sentiment would be wasted to day besides it would make the interview painful for him and she didn't care for him half enough to be eager to give him a bad time she shrugged her shoulders everything has an end she said languidly even daniel deronda i owe you a lot of money by the by i'm afraid i can't square accounts with you at the moment but i suppose you don't mind trusting me you owe me nothing said kent if my boorishness has left any liking for me possible let me have the pleasure of feeling that i did you one or two trifling services but he did not go down to the country more than ever he felt that to rejoin his wife with his guilt unacknowledged would be a greater trial than he could endure she was so innocent if she had been a different kind of woman his reluctance would have been duller and easier to overcome but to have been false to cynthia made him feel as if he had robbed a blind girl that he could not delay rejoining her much longer he was distressfully aware it was ten months since she had gone away and even if the people in streatham wished to retain the house for a third half year as he understood was likely their return to new york or wherever they had come from being indefinitely postponed that would be no reason why he and cynthia should not live together at monmouth or somewhere else he had written her that messrs kynaston had taken the eye of the beholder and during the next day or two he was in hourly expectation of her reply on the third afternoon after he had posted his letter the door opened and she came into the room he had not heard the bell ring and at the sound of her footstep he turned quickly and then almost before he realised it his wife was in his arms laughing and half crying saying how glad she was to see him how delighted she was at the book's acceptance i had to come she exclaimed i had to oh darling you don't mind because the money isn't much think what kynaston said of it and for your next you'll get proper terms well are you surprised to see me let me look at you you're different what have you been doing to yourself and baby you wouldn't know baby he talks i've been praying you'd be at home i wouldn't let them show me in i've been picturing walking in on you all the way in the train sweetheart she squeezed him to her again and then held him at arm's length regarding him gaily you've changed she repeated you look more serious and i am i all right am i a disappointment you're beautiful said kent slowly you have changed too he gazed at her with a curious sense of unfamiliarity striving to define to himself the alteration that puzzled him her face had gained something besides the hues of health it seemed to him that her eyes were deeper that her smile was more complex vaguely he felt that he had thought of her as a girl and was beholding a woman that he had insulted a woman who was lovelier than any he had known aren't you going to invite me to take off my things may i do he said with the same sense of strangeness can i help you he took them from her awkwardly and put her into a comfortable chair and made up the fire it's a new hat it suits you i always liked you in a little hat did you i get it down there i trimmed it myself she said mind the pin you shall have some tea or would you rather have dinner you must be hungry tea please and cake can you produce cake there's a confectioner's just round the corner he rang the bell then madeira i didn't tell the servant who i was better say 'my wife' casually when she comes in i suppose you don't have ladies to tea and madeira cake as a rule not as a rule he said no she laughed again and stretched her shoes to the blaze luxuriously so this is the room this is where you lived before we knew each other how funny that it should be the first time i've been in it i've often imagined you here and it isn't the least bit like what i fancied of course i always saw the window over there well talk to me tell me all what you are thinking about i believe you find me plain now the hat's off tea was brought to them in about a quarter of an hour and they sat before the fire sipping it and stealing glances at each other the woman's amused delicious kent's guilty and tortured he was tempted to kiss her but could not bring himself to do it deliberately and with every phrase that fell from her lips his heart grew heavier you've scarcely been to strawberry hill all the time i hear she said this is very good tea humphrey not very often i've been so busy yes it isn't bad is it the landlady gets it for me are they offended with me h'mph they'll look over it you'll have to be very nice and repentant i will i'll go this week if i can this week you must take me to night she cried what do you suppose is going to become of me i can't stop here shall i give you another cup kent felt the blood sinking from his face his hands shook as he bent over the fire and for a moment he had no voice to reply you don't go back to monmouth to night he asked harshly without looking at her n no she said i can't go back till to morrow i was thinking of the child he muttered he's as safe with the nurse as with me she answered i wouldn't have left him even for a day if he hadn't been i see said kent his pause appeared to him to become significant and terrible i can't go there with you this evening he said abruptly it can't be done i have to be here there is some one i must meet i mean i can take you there but i can't possibly stay you you must forgive me cynthia still he was not looking at her when she spoke her tone was different you will do as you like she said quietly he lifted himself and faced her cynthia well cynthia don't think i don't care for you she did not answer but she was very pale and her lips were proudly set you're angry with me he stammered what prevents you your business if you're too late for a train there are hansoms it would be expensive i know 'expensive' perhaps it might cost half a sovereign cynthia it's impossible oh please don't let's talk about it she said i made a mistake that's all i've made a good many since i married you this was one more i can't go gasped kent fighting for his words i if i cared for you less i should i can't go because there's something i must tell you first if but you won't i want you to know i've a confession to make to you it's over but i've acted badly to you i haven't the right to go to you for god's sake don't hate me more than you can help i've been unfaithful her first sensation was as if without warning he had dealt her a brutal blow in the face there was the same staggered sense of fright succeeded by the same sick wave of horror another woman had known him her brain did not leap for details instantaneously as a man's would have leapt in the inverse situation the name the woman bore her position what had such things to do with it curiosity to compare her with herself in looks would follow now while she stared at him with bloodless features she was conscious of nothing but the pollution another woman had known him kent stared back at her appalled at her aspect but he divined what she felt no more than he could have understood her emotions had she analysed them for him another woman had known him was the tumult in her soul he believed her pride outraged that he had known another woman the difference was enormous the curiosity and thirst for vengeance apart the wife's sensation was what the husband's would have been had he heard of her own defilement but that he himself appeared to her defiled he could not grasp unworthy contemptible corrupt he realised but defiled no cynthia forgive me she swayed a little as his voice struck her agony i'll try you see why i couldn't go yes she said hoarsely i should have told you anyhow soon you aren't sorry i've told you i don't know i think i think i'm sorry just now i shall be able to thank you for that later i did it for the best said kent you were right he leant against the mantelpiece his chin sunk the only sound in the room came from the kettle on which the woman's eyes were fixed intently the clock of st giles in the fields tolled four what am i to do he said oh she moaned don't ask me i can't think yet you've killed me humphrey you've killed me he dropped before her chair and stroked her hand her pain writhed like a live thing at his touch but in pity for him she let the hand lie still and suffered did you love her so much she asked god knows i didn't and yet humphrey she wasn't i was mad she was a lady it wasn't love i didn't love her at all if you were a man you'd understand i sinned with my body but my mind she never had that it was with you with you it was the animal in me how can i explain to an angel presently she said does a woman ever learn to understand a man she gives him her life yet to the end they begin differently he has known everything before he comes to her and she has known nothing she's told that it doesn't matter that it's right she doesn't believe it in her heart the more she loves him the less she believes it but she tries to persuade herself she believes it it's wrong wrong to him she's a new girl and to her he is a new world how can marriage be the same thing to both you didn't love her but you gave yourself to her could a husband think less of his wife's sin for a reason like that kent rose and stood beside her dumbly some glimmer of her point of view reached him and confused him by its strangeness i'll do whatever you want what can i say help me to forget she said in a low voice will you help me to forget you'll let me come to you give me a few days wait a few days only i can't be your wife again humphrey all at once i can't ah don't think me unforgiving it isn't that come to me if you will and work and we'll be good friends together don't be afraid i won't make it bad for you i promise i'll never remind you even by a look are the terms too hard you're merciful the seconds crept away i must go she said i'll write to you shall you go to your mother's i must there's no train to monmouth after three will you send for a cab to take me to waterloo i'll tell them you were coming with me but something prevented you can i bathe my eyes in your room before i go kent showed her where it was and waited for her in the parlour then they went downstairs together to the cab she leant forward and gave him her hand don't be afraid of me she whispered again god bless you he said closing the door chapter xxiv cynthia wrote to him to go to her the day was bright and a promise of spring was in the air as he journeyed down some of its brightness seemed to tinge his mood and he was conscious of a vague wonder at the pleasurable emotions that stirred him as fields and hedgerows shot past she was on the platform awaiting him though he had not telegraphed the time of his arrival he saw her at once and was momentarily a prey to misgivings her welcoming smile as they advanced towards each other dissipated his dread but it revived his embarrassment and his embarrassment appeared to her pitiable i knew she said frankly that you would come by this train she gave orders to a porter about the luggage and kent passed into monmouth by her side he heard that her brother had come down to see her and was at the cottage now caesar was having a holiday and had been spending a fortnight with his parents he was going back this evening but i made him stay till to morrow mrs evans found him a room a few doors off he understood that it was to lessen the awkwardness of the first evening for him that she had detained her brother and he was grateful to her you must know the place well by now he said looking about him every inch i think it's so pretty i'm sorry it isn't summer you'd see we have a lot of artists then i got rather chummy with two girls painting here in the autumn we used to go to tea at each other's lodgings i learnt a lot that's our house the one at the corner there's mrs evans at the gate she calls you 'the master' she hopes the master will find her cooking good enough for him for tea she's made some hot cakes specially in your honour as they drew nearer a nurse approached wheeling a child he heard that it was humphrey and bent over the little fellow timidly cynthia hung about them praying that the boy would not cry she asked him who the gentleman was and having been repeatedly told that papa was coming he answered papa whereat she triumphed and the man was pleased in the parlour which struck kent agreeably with its quiet old fashioned air the right hand of mccullough was perusing a financial paper he put it aside to greet kent cordially his presence dominated the evening and in the knowledge that he was departing early next day kent even found him amusing though to be amusing was not his aim ostensibly he had come to england on a financial mission and his vague allusions to it were weighted by several names of european importance occasionally his attention wandered and he lapsed into a brown study obviously preoccupied by millions for this he apologised in case it had been unnoticed and rallied cynthia on the yellow backs that were visible on the bookshelf i'm afraid i see a lot of yellow backs he said lifting a playful finger a novel by a woman of which the speaker had written that it's dialogue would move every literary artist to enthusiasm lay on the window sill kent had already observed it with gratification and caesar acknowledged that he had read it he conceded that it possessed a superficial smartness superficial was his latest word and when his discourse took a literary turn his authoritative opinions were peppered with it kent's bedroom was furnished very plainly but it was exquisitely neat his gaze rested with thankfulness on a large table of a solidity that seemed to promise that it would not wobble beside the blotting pad was an inkstand of whose construction the primary object had been that it should hold ink a handful of early flowers was arranged in a china bowl there was a knot in his throat as he contemplated these preparations the more touching for their simplicity and when he sat down the table confirmed its promise and he found that the position afforded him a view of a corner of the garden it was here that he worked by degrees the frankness of her manner became more spontaneous in cynthia and his embarrassment in her society was sometimes forgotten they were as she had promised the best of friends their rambles together had a charm which one associates with a honeymoon but in which their own honeymoon had been lacking in these rambles kent was never bored it appeared to him delightful to place himself in her hands and be taken where she listed in the april twilight to seek shelter from showers in strange quarters was adventurous and milk had a piquancy drunk with cynthia in farmyards he signed the extension of the streatham agreement with gladness the alteration in her impressed him still more strongly now that he had opportunities for studying it and the gradual result of three years presenting itself to him as the fruit of ten months was startling his wife had become a woman in her tone in her bearing in her comments which often had a pungency though they might not be brilliant she was a woman in the composure with which she ignored their anomalous relations a very fascinating woman withal whose composure while it won his admiration disturbed him too as the weeks went by it was in moments difficult to identify her new personality with the girl's whose love for him had been so constantly evident among her other changes had she grown to care less for him he could not be surprised if she had shortly after his arrival messrs kynaston had begun to send his proof sheets and in may the eye of the beholder was published in the walk that they took after cynthia had read it she and kent spoke of little else it had amazed him to perceive how eager he was to hear her verdict and at her first words i'm proud of you the colour rushed to his face he would never have supposed that her approval could excite him so much or that her views would have such interest for him when the criticisms began to come in it was delicious as they sat at breakfast to open the yellow envelopes and devour the long slips with their heads bent together and then after he had paid a visit to the child he would go up to his room and wish that the corner of the garden that he overlooked contained the bench despite the seven rejections and the opinion of messrs cousins' reader that the construction rendered the novel hopeless the criticisms were magnificent the more important the paper the less qualified was the praise the lighter periodicals were sometimes a little superior but the authoritative organs were earnest and cordial and in no less powerful a pronouncement than the spectator's the construction was called masterly the saturday review repeated that mr kent's style was admirable and the athenaeum and the daily chronicle and the times and every paper to which a novelist looks described him as a realist of a high order delusions die hard and the bitter reviewer rending the talented young author's book is a companion myth to the sleepless editor poring indefatigably over illegible manuscripts in quest of new talent as a matter of fact it is only to his reviewers that the struggling novelist ever owes a thank you and kent wrote with exultation and confidence under the stimulus of the encouragement that he received the eye of the beholder did not sell in thousands you may lead a donkey to good fiction but you cannot make him read but in a moderate degree it was a success even with the public and work had an irresistible attraction in consequence nevertheless the question whether cynthia's attitude was not perhaps the one that had become most natural to her haunted kent with growing persistency had it been possible he would have asked her he found himself wishful of a little tenderness from the woman who had once wearied him or from the woman who had sprung from her she was merciful she was charming she drew him towards her strongly but she talked to him as a sister might have done the suggestion of a honeymoon in their rambles now tantalised him by its illusiveness and he was piqued by the feeling that their intercourse was devoid even of the incipient warmth of courtship it occurred to him that the book that he was writing might be dedicated to her and the idea pleased him vastly it begot several other ideas which he indulged roses were transferred from a shop window to cynthia's bosom and he sent to town for a story that she had said she would like to read her surprise enchanted him and he wished as her gaze rested on him that he could surprise her oftener the thought of the evening to be passed beside her would come to him during the day and fill him with impatience to realise the picture again tea was no sooner finished than they put on their hats to wander where their humour led them generally they returned at sunset and sometimes they returned under the stars supper would be awaiting them and afterwards they sat and talked or dreamed by the open window until all too early she gave him her hand and said good night his heart followed her surely kent comprehended that the feeling that she awoke in him was more than admiration more than pique was something infinitely different from the calm affection into which his first fancy had subsided he knew that the conditions that she had imposed had aroused no ephemeral ardour but had illumined in himself as vividly as in her a development that possession had left obscure he knew he loved her he loved her and he was unworthy of her love he could not speak that was for her but his eyes besought and the woman read them she made no sign so speedily her pride forbade it her manner towards him remained unchanged but tenderness tugged at her pride and joy at what she read flooded her soul she would be contemptible to condone so soon she told herself he would never know how he had made her suffer never suspect how in minutes the unutterable recollection that she had hidden for his sake had wrenched and tortured her while she talked to him so easily she prayed that he never might know but to yield at his first sigh because he looked unhappy how could she contemplate it yet was his unhappiness her sole temptation she trembled was she despicable to long for his arm about her again was it degraded to feel that even to day in july kent was lonelier than he had been hitherto his wife could seldom contrive to accompany him when he went out and the excursions were in any case curtailed she seemed to care less for walking and there were little tiresome things that demanded her attention or to which at least she chose to give it the child missed her when he woke at eight o'clock if she was not at home to run in to him she wanted to practise on the wheezy piano there was needle work she was compelled to do always something the first time kent was merely disappointed and came back early in low spirits but after the third of his solitary walks misgivings oppressed him with double weight she was indifferent no other explanation was possible she was indifferent and no longer chose to mask it you're always busy he told her at last i miss you dreadfully cynthia is it so important that what you are doing should be gone on with to night i should like to finish it to night she said constrainedly yes i'm sorry you miss me but the girl is clumsy with her needle one can't expect perfection yesterday something else prevented you you have only been out with me once this week surely more than that she said calmly twice i think once you went with me on tuesday there's all day for the boy cynthia you might spare me the evening she bent lower over the pinafore engrossed by it it isn't only the boy poor little chap what a tyrant you'd make him out yesterday i didn't feel like going i was up to my eyes in a book kent regarded her hungrily i've very little claim on you i know but when i first came 'sh she said what a mountain out of a molehill if i haven't been with you since tuesday we must have our walk together toil morrow kent found this very unsatisfactory it was a concession and he did not seek her society as a concession the walk as usual latterly was short and neither had the air of enjoying it very much they roamed along the dusty roads for the most part in silence and for the rest with platitudes he could not avoid seeing that her companionship was reluctantly accorded and after their return when she put out her hand in the stereotyped good night he resolved not to beg her to go with him any more he wasn't without a hope that by refraining from the request he might move her to gratitude but her avoidance of him did not diminish and when august came he questioned whether he ought to leave her for a while the part that she had allotted to herself was plainly more than she could sustain to relieve her temporarily of his presence might be the most considerate plan he could adopt but the notion repelled him violently though she was colder and ill at ease she enchained him he had very little and that little he was loath to lose to look at her across the room unobserved in their long pauses was not charged with regret only the bitterness had an indefinable joy as well he liked to note the effect of lamplight on her profile as she read took pleasure in her grace when she moved to spare her what distress he could however was his duty yes if she wished it he would go he debated where he sat smoking by the window one evening whether she would wish it if she knew how dear she had grown to him whether if he stammered to her something of his remorse his pain had become almost intolerable the hour was very still in the west on the faint azure some smears of flame colour lingered then while he stared out faded and hung in the sky like curls of violet smoke over the myriad tints of green came the low whinny of a horse his wife sat sewing by the table and turning he watched the rhythmical movement of her hand a passionate longing assailed him to free his tongue from the weight that hampered it and cry to her he loved her though she might not care to hear he knocked the ashes from his pipe and sauntered nearer aren't you going to smoke any more she said not now i've been smoking all day you should try to write without i ought to but i never could he touched the muslin on her lap diffidently it was on her lap what are you making another pinafore yes do you think it's pretty his hand lay close to her own but she held the garment up to him and perforce he drew back it was not so easy to voice emotion as to feel it half an hour crept away shadows filled the room and a grey peace brooded over the grass outside the tones deepened and beyond a ridge of blackened boughs the moon swam up he decided that he would speak after supper but after supper when she resumed her sewing he felt that it would be useless he sat by the hearth holding a paper that he did not read presently the landlady was heard slipping the bolt in the passage and cynthia pushed her basket from her preparing to retire with her change of position a reel escaped and rolled to the fender kent had not noticed where it fell but he became conscious with a tremor that she was stooping by his side in rising it seemed to him that her figure brushed his arm as if with a caress she had drawn apart from him before he could do more than wonder if it had been accidental but now he watched her with a curious intentness she wandered about the room a little aimlessly righting a photograph settling a flower in a glass on the shelf having gathered up her work she hesitated and sought some books when she had chosen them her arms were full and she could not give him her hand but she did not say good night either a she passed him on the threshold her face was lifted and for a moment her gaze engulfed him when he dared to interpret it kent stole shakenly up the stairs the way was dark but ahead in a room of which the door had been left ajar his eager eyes saw light the end
