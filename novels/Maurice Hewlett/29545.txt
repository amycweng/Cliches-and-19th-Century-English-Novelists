country of things as they are the spaniard weaves no glamour about facts apologises for nothing extenuates nothing lo que ha de ser no puede faltar if you must have an explanation here it is chew it englishman and be content you will get no other one result of this is that circumstance left naked is to be seen more often a strong than a pretty thing and another that the englishman inveterately a draper is often horrified and occasionally heartbroken the spaniard may regret but cannot mend the organ his own will never suffer the same fate chercher le midi a quatorze heures is no foible of his the state of things cannot last for the sentimental pour into the country now and insist that the natives shall become as selfconscious as themselves the sudexpress brings them from england and germany vast ships convey them from new york then there are the newspapers eager as ever to make bricks without straw against teutonic travellers and journalists no idiosyncrasy can stand out the country will run to pulp as a pear bitten without by wasps and within by a maggot will get sleepy and drop but that end is not yet the lord be praised and will not be in your time or mine the tale i have to tellan old one as we reckon news nowmight have happened yesterday for that was when i was last in spain and satisfied myself that all the concomitants were still in being i can assure you that many a don luis yet bitterly poor and bitterly proud starves and shivers and hugs up his bones in his capa between the bidassoa and the manzanares many a wildhearted unlettered manuela applies the inexorable law of the land to her own detriment and with a sob in the breath sits down to her spinning again her mouldy crust and cup of cold water or worse fare than that joy is not for the poor she saysand then with a shrug lo que ha de ser but as a matter of fact it belongs to george borrows day this tale when gentlemen rode ahorseback between town and town and followed the riverbed rather than the road a stranger then in the plains of castile was either a fool who knew not when he was well off or an unfortunate whose misery at home forced him afield there was no genus tourist the traveller was conspicuous and could be traced from spain to spain when you get on youll see that is how tormillo weaselled out mr manvers by the smell of his blood a great roomy haggard country half desert waste and half bare rock was the spain of immemorially old immutably the same splendidly frank acquainted with grief and sin shameless and free like some brown gipsy wench of the wayside with throat and half her bosom bare who would laugh and show her teeth and be free with her jest but if you touched her honour ignorant that she had one would stab you without ruth and go her free way leaving you carrion in the ditch such was the spain which mr manvers visited some fifty years ago the spanish jade chapter i the pleasant errand into the plain beyond burgos through the sunless glare of beforedawn upon a softpadding ass that cast no shadow and made no sound well upon the stern of that ass and with two bare heels to kick him alone in the immensity of castile and as happy as a king may be rode a young man on a may morning singing to himself a wailing winding chant in the minor which as it had no end may well have had no beginning he only paused in it to look before him between his donkeys ears and thenarre burra hijo de perrahe would drive his heels into the animals rump in a few minutes the song went spearing aloft again en batallaaa temeroosaa i say that he was young he was very young and looked very delicate with his transparent alabaster skin lustrous grey eyes and pale thin lips he had a sagging straw hat upon his round and shapely head a shirtand a dirty shirtopen to the waist his faja was a broad band of scarlet cloth wound half a dozen times about his middle and supported a murderous long knife for the rest cotton drawers bare legs and feet as brown as walnuts all of him that was not whiteybrown cotton or red cloth was the colour of the country but his cropped head was black and his eyes were very light grey keen restless and bold he was sharpfeatured careless and impudent but when he smiled you might think him bewitching his name he would give you as esteban vincazwhich it was not his affair was pressing pleasant and pious of that he had no doubt at all he was intending the murder of a young woman his eyes as he sang roamed the sunstruck land and saw everything as it should be life was a grim business for man and beast and herb of the field no better for one than for the others the winter corn in patches struggled sparsely through the clods darnels tares deadnettle and couch the vetches of last year and the thistles of next contended with it not in vain the olives were not yet in flower but the plums and sloes were powdered with white all was in order when a clump of smokyblue iris caught his downward looks he slipped off his ass and snatched a handful for his hat the swordflower he called it and accepting the omen with a chuckle jumped into his seat again and kicked the beast with his naked heels into the shamble that does duty for a pace as he decorated his hatstring he resumed his song en batalla temerosa andaba el cid castellano con bucar ese rey moro que contra el cid ha llegado a le ganar a valencia he hung upon the pounding assonances and his heart thumped in accord as if his present adventure had been that crowning one of the heros accept him for what he was the graceless son of his parentshorsethief sheepthief contrabandist bully trader of womenhe had the look of a seraph when he sang the complacency of an angel of the weighing of souls and why not he had no doubts he could justify every hour of his life if money failed him wits did not he had the manners of a gentlemanand a gentleman he actually was hidalgo by birthand the morals of a hyaena that is to say none at all i doubt if he had anything worth having except the grand air the rest had been discarded as of no account schooling had been his he had let it slip if his gentlehood had been negotiable he had carded it away nowadays he knew only elementary thingshunger thirst fatigue desire hatred fear what he craved that he took if he could he feared the dark and god in the sacrament he pitied nothing regretted nothing for to pity a thing you must respect it and to respect you must fear and as for regret when it came to feeling the loss of a thing it came naturally also to hating the cause of its loss and so the greater lust swallowed up the less he had felt regret when manuela ran away it had hurt him and he hated her for it that was why he intended at all cost to find her again and to kill her because she had been his amiga and had left him three weeks ago it had been at the fair of pobledo the fair had been spoiled for him he had earned nothing and lost much esteem to wit his own esteem mortally wounded by the loss of manuela whose beauty had been a mark and its possession an asset and timevaluable timelost in finding out where she had gone friends of his had helped him he had hailed every arriero on the road from pamplona to la coruna and when he had what he wanted he had only delayed for one day to get his knife ground he knew exactly where she was at what hour he should find her and with whom his tongue itched and brought water into his mouth when he pictured the meeting he pictured it now as he jogged and sang and looked contentedly at the endless plain presently he came within sight and since he made no effort to avoid it presently again into the street of a mudbuilt village few people were astir a man slept in an angle of a wall flies about his head a dog in an entry scratched himself with ecstasy a woman at a doorway was combing her childs hair and looked up to watch him coming entering in his easy way he looked to the east to judge of the light sunrise was nearly an hour away he could afford to obey the summons of the cracked bell filling the place with its wrangling with the creaking of its wheel he hobbled his beast in the little plaza and followed some straying women into church immediately confronting him at the door was a hideous idol a huge and brown wooden christ with black horsehair tresses staring white eyeballs staring red wounds towered before him hanging from a cross esteban knelt to it on one knee and remembering his hat doffed it sideways over his ear he said his two paternosters and then performed one odd ceremony more several people saw him do it but no one was surprised he took the long knife from his faja running his finger lightly along the edge laid it flat before the cross and looking up at the tormented god said him another pater that done he went into the church and knelt upon the floor in company with kerchiefed women children a dog or two and some beggars of incredible age and infirmities beyond description and rose to one knee fell to both covered his eyes watched the celebrant or the youngest of the women just as the servers little bell bade him simple ceremonies done by rote and common to latin europe certainly not learned of the moors mass over our young avenger prepared to resume his journey by breaking his fast a hunch of bread and a few raisins sufficed him and he ate these sitting on the steps of the church watching the women as they loitered on their way home esteban had a keen eye for women pence only i mean the lack of them prevented him from being a collector but the eye is free he viewed them all from the standpoint of the cabinet one he approved she carried herself well had fine ankles and wore a flower in her hair like an andalusian now it was one of his many grudges against fate that he had never been in andalusia and seen the women there for certain they were handsome a sevillana for instance would they wear flowers in their hairover the earunless they dared be looked at manuela was of valencia more than half gitana a wonderfully supple girl when she danced the jota it was like nothing so much as a snake in an agony her hair was tawny yellow and very long she wore no flower in it but bound a red handkerchief in and out of the plaits she was vain of her hairheart of god how he hated her then the priest came out of church fat dewlapped greasy very short of breath but benevolent goodday goodday to you he said you are a stranger from the north my reverence from burgos ha from burgos this morning a fine city a great city yes sir its true it is where they buried our lord the campeador so they say you are lettered and early afoot yes sir i am called to be early i still go south seeking work no doubt you are honest i hope yes sir a very honest christian but i seek no work i find it you are lucky said the priest and took snuff and where is your work in valladolid perhaps esteban blinked hard at that last question no sir he said not there do what he might he could not repress the bitter gleam in his eyes the old priest paused his fingers once more in the snuffbox there again you have a great city ah and there was a time when valladolid was one of the greatest in castile the capital of a kingdom chosen seat of a king pattern of the true faith his eyelids narrowed quickly you do not know it no sir said esteban gently i have never been there the priest shrugged vaya it is no affair of mine he said then he waved his hand wagging it about like a fan go your ways he added with god always at the feet of your reverence said esteban and watched him depart he stared after him and looked sick altogether he delayed for an hour and a quarter in this village a material time the sun was up as he left ita burning globe just above the limits of the plain chapter ii the traveller at large ahead of esteban some five or six hours or rather converging upon a common centre so far removed from him was one osmund manvers a young english gentleman of easy fortune independent habits and analytical disposition also riding also singing to himself equally early afoot but in very different circumstances he bestrode a horse tolerably sound had a haversack before him reasonably stored he had a clean shirt on him and another embaled a brace of pistols a new testament and a don quixote he wore brown kneeboots a tweed jacket white duck breeches and a straw hat as little picturesque as it was comfortable or convenient neither revenge nor enemy lay ahead of him he travelled for his pleasure and so pleasantly that even time was his friend health was the salt of his daily fare and curiosity gave him appetite for every minute of the day he would have looked incongruous in the elfin landscapein that empty plain under that ringing skyif he had not appeared to be as extremely at home in it as young esteban himself but there was this farther difference to be noted that whereas esteban seemed to belong to the land the land seemed to belong to mr manversthe land of the spains and all those vast distances of it the enormous space of ground the dim blue mountains at the edge the great arch of sky over all he might have been a young squire at home overlooking his farms one eye for the tillage or the upkeep of fence and hedge another for a covey or a hare in a farrow he was as serene as esteban and as contented but his comfort lay in easy possession not in being easily possessed occasionally he whistled as he rode but like esteban broke now and again into a singing voice more cheerful i think than melodious if she be not fair for me what care i how fair she be an old song but henry chorley made a tone for it the summer before mr manvers left england and it had caught his fancy both the air and the sentiment they had come aptly to suit his scoffing mood and to help him salve the wound which a miss eleanor vernon had dealt his hearta miss eleanor vernon with her clear disdainful eyes she had given him his first acquaintance with the hotandcold disease if she be not fair for me well she was not to be that let her go spin then andwhat care i how fair she be he had discarded her with the dover cliffs and resumed possession of himself and his seeing eye by this time a course of desultory journeying through brittany and the west of france a winter in paris a packet from bordeaux to santander had cured him of his hurt the song came unsought to his lips but had no wounded heart to salve mr manvers was a pleasantlooking young man sanguine in hue grey in the eye with a twisted sort of smile by no means unattractive his features were irregular but he looked wholesome his humour was fitful sometimes easy sometimes unaccountably stiff they called him a character at home meaning that he was liable to freakish asides from the common rotted road and could not be counted on it was true he for his part called himself an observer of manvers which implied that he had rather watch than take a side but he was both hottempered and quicktempered and might well find himself in the middle of things before he knew it his crooked smile however seldom deserted him seldom was exchanged for a crooked scowl and the light beard which he had allowed himself in the solitudes of paris led one to imagine his jaw less square than it really was i suppose him to have been five foot ten in his boots and strong to match he had a comfortable income derived from land in somersetshire upon which his mother a widow lady and his two unmarried sisters lived and attended archery meetings in company of the curate the disdain of miss eleanor vernon had cured him of a taste for such simple joys and now that by travel he had cured himself of miss eleanor he was travelling on for his pleasure or as he told himself to avoid the curate thus neatly he referred to his obligations to church and state in somersetshire by six oclock on this fine may morning he had already ridden farfrom sahagun indeed where he had spent some idle days lounging and exchanging observations on the weather with the inhabitants he had been popular for he was perfectly simple and without airs never asked what he did not want to know and never refused to answer what it was obviously desired he should but man cannot live upon small talk and as he had taken up his rest in sahagun in a moment of impulsewhen he saw that it possessed a churchdome covered with glazed green tilesso now he left it high heaven he had cried sitting up in bed what the deuce am i doing here nothing nothing on earth lets get out of it so out he had got and could not ask for breakfast at four in the morning he rode fast desiring to make way before the heat began and by six oclock with the sun above the horizon was not sorry to see towers and pinnacles or to hear across the emptiness the clangorous notes of a deeptoned bell the muezzin calls the faithful but for me another summons must be sounded that town will be palencia there i breakfast by the grace of god coffee and eggs palencia it was a town of pretence if such a word can be applied to anything spanish where things either are or are not and theres an end it was as drab as the landscape as weatherworn and austere but it had a squat officer sitting at the receipt of custom which sahagun had not and a file of anxious peasants before him bargaining for their chickens and hay upon the horsemans approach the functionary raised himself looking over the heads of the crowd as at a greater thing saluted and inquired for gatedues with his patient eyes i have here said manvers who loved to be didactic in a foreign language a shirt and a comb the new testament the history of the ingenious gentleman don quixote de la mancha and a toothbrush much of this was greek to the doganero who however understood that the stranger was referring in tolerable castilian to a provincial gentleman of degree the name and manvers twisted smile together won him the entry the officer just eased his peaked cap go with god sir he directed assuredly said manvers but pray assist me to the inn the providencia was named indicated and found there was an elderly man in the yard of it placidly plucking a live fowl a barbarity with which our traveller had now ceased to quarrel leave your horrid task my friend he said take my horse and feed him the bird was released and after shaking by force of habit what no longer or only partially existed rejoined its companions they received it coldly but it soon showed that it could pick as well as be picked now said manvers to the ostler give this horse half a feed of corn then some water then the other half feed but give him nothing until you have cooled him down do these things and i present you with one peseta omit any of them and i give you nothing at all is that a bargain the old man haled off the horse muttering that it would be a bad bargain for his grace to which manvers replied that we should see then he went into the providencia for his coffee and eggs chapter iii diversions of travel if sahagun puts you out of conceit with castile you are not likely to be put in again by palencia for a secondrate town in this kingdom is like a piece of the plain enclosed by a wall and only emphasises the desolation at the expense of the freedom and as in a windy square all the city garbage is blown into corners so the walled town seems to collect and set to festering all the disreputable creatures of the waste mr manvers his meal over hankered after broad spaces again he walked the arcaded streets and cursed the flies he entered the cathedral and was driven out by the beggars he leaned over the bridge and watched the green river and that set him longing for a swim if his maps told him the truth some few leagues on the road to valladolid should discover him a fine wood the wood of la huerca beyond which skirting it in fact should be the pisuerga here he could bathe loiter away the noon and take his merienda which should be the best palencia could supply muera marta y muera harta let martha die but not on an empty stomach he said to himself he knew his don quixote better than most spaniards he furnished his haversack then with bread ham sausages wine and oranges ordered out his horse satisfied himself that the ostler had earned his fee and departed at an ambling pace to seek his amusements but though he knew it not the finger of fate was upon him and he was enjoying the last of that perfect leisure without which travel lovemaking the arts and sciences gardening or the rearing of a family are but weariness and disgust just outside the gate of palencia he had an adventure which occupied him until the end of this tale and indeed some way beyond it the puerta de valladolid is really no gate at all but a gateway what walls it may once have pierced have fallen away from it in their fight with time and now buttresses and rubbishheaps a moat of blurred outline and much filth alone testify to former pretensions beyond was to be found a sandy waste miscalled an alameda a littered place of brown grass dust and loose stones fringed with parched acacias and diversified by hillocks upon which in former days of strife standards may have been placed mangonels planted perhaps napoleonic cannon it was upon one of these mounds which was shaded by a tree that manvers observed and paused in the gateway to observe the doings of a group of persons some seven boys and lads and a girl a kind of uncouth courtship seemed to be in progress or as he put it the holding of a rude court he thought to see a circe of picaresque spain with her swinish rout about her to drop metaphor the young woman sat upon the hillock with the half dozen tatterdemalions round her in various stages of amorous enchantment he set the girl down for a gipsy for he knew enough of the country to be sure that no marriageable maiden of worth could be courted in this fashion or if not a gipsy then a thing of nought to be pitied if the truth were known at any rate to be skirted her hair which seemed to be of a dusty gold tinge was knotted up in a red handkerchief her gown was of blue faded to green her feet were bare if a gipsy she was to be trusted to take care of herself if but a sunburnt vagrant she could be let to shift and yet he watched her curiously while she sat as impassive as a young sphinx and wondered to himself why he did it suppose her of that sort you may see any day at a fair jigging outside a booth in red bodice and spangles a waif a little whoknowswho suppose her pretty to deathwhat is she even then but an iridescent bubble as one might say thrown up by some standing pool of vice as filmy very nearly as fleeting and quite as poisonous it struck him as he watchednot the girl in particular but a whole genus centred in heras really extraordinary as an obliquity of providence that such ephemerids must abound predestined to misery must come and sin and wail and go with souls inside them to be saved which nobody could save and bodies fair enough to be loved which nobody could stoop to love had the scheme of our redemption scope enough for thisfor this trifle along with santa teresa and the queen of sheba and isabella the catholic he perceived himself slipping into the sententious on slight pretencebut presently found himself engaged hatless shoeless and coatless were the oafs who surrounded the object of his speculations some lying flat with elbows forward and chins to fist some creeping and scrambling about her to get her notice or fire her into a rage some squatting at an easy distance with ribaldries to exchange but there was one sitting a little above her on the mound who seemed to consider himself in a sort her proprietor he was master of the pack warily on the watch able by position and strength to prevent what he might at any moment choose to think on infringement of his rights a sullen grudging silent and jealous dog manvers saw him and asked himself how long she would stand it at present she seemed unaware of her surroundings he saw that she sat broodingly as if ruminating on more serious things such as famine or thirst her elbows on her knees and her face in her two hands that was the true gipsy attitude he knew all the world over but so intent she was that she was careless of her person careless that her bodice was open at the neck and that more people than manvers were aware of it a flower was in her mouth or he thought so judging from the blot of scarlet thereabouts her face was set fixedly towards the towntoo fixedly that he might care since she cared so little whether she saw him there or not and after all not she but the manners of the game centred about her was what mattered manners indeed the fastidious in our young man was all on edge he became a critic of spain where in england france or italy could you have witnessed such a scene as this or what people but the spaniards among the children of noah know themselves so certainly lords of the earth that they can treat women mules prisoners jews and bulls according to the caprices of appetite that an italian should make public display of his property in a woman or his scorn of her was a thing unthinkable yet if you came to consider it so it was that a spaniard should not set aside said he to himself the grand air and what has the spaniard which the brutes have not hotly questioning the attendant heavens manvers saw just such an act of mastery when the lumpish fellow above the girl put his hand upon her and kept it there and the others thereupon drew back and ceased their tricks as if admitting possession had and seisin taken as the lawyers call it to manvers a hateful thing he felt his blood surge in his neck damn him ive a mind and they pray to a woman but the girl did nothingneither moved nor seemed to be aware then the drama suddenly quickened the actors serried and the acts down to the climax followed fast emboldened by her passivity the oaf advanced by inches visibly he looked knowingly about him collecting approval from his followers he whispered in her ear hummed gallant airs regaled the company with snatches of salt song fixed as the sphinx and unfathomable she sat on broodingly until piqued by her indifference maybe or swayed by some wave of desire he caught her round the waist and buried his face in her neck and then all at once she awoke shivered and collected herself without warning shook herself free and hit her bully a blow on the nose with all her force he reeled back with his hands to his face the blood gushed over his fingers then all were on their feet and a scuffle began the most unequal you can conceive and the most impossible it was all against one with stones flying and imprecations after them and in the midst the tawnyhaired girl fighting like one possessed a minute of thishardly so muchwas more than enough for manvers who when he could believe his eyes pricked headlong into the fray and began to lay about him with his crop dogs sons of dogs down with your hands he cried in spanish which was fluent if imaginative but his science with the whip was beyond dispute and the diversion coming suddenly from behind scattered the enemy into headlong flight the field cleared the girl was to be seen she lay moaning on the ground her arms extended her right leg twitching she was bleeding at the ear chapter iv two on horseback now manvers was under fire for the enemy reinforced by stragglers from the town had unmasked a battery of stones and was making fine practice from the ruins of the wall he was hit more than once his horse more than he both were exasperated and he in particular was furious at the presence of spectators who comfortably in the shade watched and had been watching the whole affair with enviable detachment of mind and body with so much to chafe him he may be pardoned for some irritability he dismounted as coolly as he could and led his horse about to cover her from the stones come he said as he stooped to touch her i must move you out of this saint stephenblessed young manhas forestalled this particular means of going to heaven oh damn the stones he used no ceremony but picked her up as if she had been a dressmakers dummy and set her on her feet where after swaying about and some balancing with her hands she presently steadied herself and stood dazed and emptyeyed her cheek was cut her ear was bleeding her hair was down the red handkerchief uncoiled her dusky skin was stained with dirt and scratches and her bosom heaved riotously as she caught for her breath take your time my dear said manvers kindly and she did by tumbling into his arms here then was a situation for the student of manners a brisk discharge of stones from an advancing line of skirmishers a strictly impartial crowd of sightseers a fidgety horse and himself embarrassed by a girl in a faint he called for help and getting none shook his fist at the callous devils who ignored him he inspected his charge who looked as pure as a child in her swoon all her troubles forgotten and sins blotted out he inquired of the skies as if hopeful that the ravens as of old might bring him help at last seeing nothing else for it he picked up the girl in both arms and pitched her on to the saddle there with some adjusting he managed to prop her while he led the horse slowly away he had to get the reins in his teeth before he had gone ten yards the retreat began it was within two hours of noon or nothing had saved him from a retirement as harassing as sir john moores it was the sun not ravens that came to his help meantime the girl had recovered herself somewhat and when they were out of sight of the town and its inhabitants showed him that she had by sliding from the saddle and standing firmly on her feet hulloa said manvers whats the matter now do you think you can walk back you cant you know he addressed her in his best castilian i am afraid you are hurt let me help but she held him off with a stiffening arm while she wiped her face with her petticoat and put herself into some sort of order she did it deftly and methodically with the practised hands of a woman used to the public eye she might have been an actress at the wings about to go on nor would she look at him or let him see that she was aware of his presence until all was in orderher hair twisted into the red handkerchief the neck of her dress pinned together her torn skirt nicely hung her coquetry her skill in adjusting what seemed past praying for her pains with herself were charming to see and very touching manvers watched her closely and could not deny her beauty she was a vivid beauty fiercely coloured with her tawny gold hair sunburnt skin and jadegreen farseeing eyes her coiled crimson handkerchief and bluegreen gown she was finely made slim and in contour hardly more than a child and yet she seemed to him very mature a practised hand with very various knowledge deep in her eyes and a wide acquaintance behind her quiet lips with her reordered toilette she had taken on selfpossession and dignity a reserve which baffled him without any more reason than this he felt for her a kind of respect which nothing certainly in what he had seen of her circumstances could justify yet he gave her her titlewhich marks his feeling senorita he said i wish to be of service to you command me shall i take you back to palencia she answered him seriously i beg that you will not sir if you have friends he began and she said at once i have none or parents none relatives none none then your i know what you would say i have no house then said manvers looking vaguely over the plain what do you wish me to do for you she was now sitting by the roadside very collectedly looking down at her hands in her lap you will leave me here if you must she said but i would ask your charity to take me a little farther from palencia nobody has ever been kind to me before she said this quite simply as if stating a fact he was moved you were unhappy in palencia yes she said i would rather be left here the enormous plain of castile treeless sunstruck empty of living thing made her words eloquent absurd said manvers if i leave you here you will die in palencia said the girl i cannot die and then her grave eyes pierced him and he knew what she meant great god said manvers then i shall take you to a convent she nodded her head where you will sir she replied her gravity far beyond her seeming station gave value to her confidence that seems to me the best thing i can do with you manvers said and if you dont shirk it there is no reason why i should now can you stick on the saddle if i put you up she nodded again up you go then he would have swung her up sideways ladyfashion but she laughed and cried no no put a hand on his shoulder her left foot in the stirrup and swung herself into the saddle as neatly as a groom there she sat astride like a circusrider and stuck her arm akimbo as she looked down for his approval bravo said manvers you have been ahorseback before this my girl now you must make room for me he got up behind her and took the reins from under her arm with the other arm it was necessary to embrace her she allowed it sedately then they ambled off together making a darby and joan affair of it but the sun was now close upon noon burning upon them out of a sky of brass there was no wind and the flies were maddening after a while he noticed that the girl simply stooped her head to the heat as if she were wilting like a picked flower when he felt her heavy on his arm he saw that he must stop so he did and plied her with wine from his pocketflask feeding her drop by drop as she lay back against him he got bread out of his haversack and made her eat she soon revived and then he learned the fact that she had eaten nothing since yesterdays noon how should i eat she asked when i have earned nothing nohow but by charity he agreed had palencia no compassion she grew dark and would not answer him at first presently asked had he not seen palencia i agree he said but let me ask you if i may without indiscretion how did you propose to earn your bread in palencia i would have worked in the fields for a day sir she told him but not longer for i have to get on where do you wish to go away from here to valladolid she looked up into his faceher head was still near his shoulder to valladolid never there this made him laugh to palencia never there to valladolid never there where then lady of the seagreen eyes she veiled her eyes quickly to madrid i suppose i wish to work can you find work there surely it is a great city do you know it yes i was there long ago what did you do there i worked i was very well there she sat up and looked back over his shoulder she had done that once or twice before and now he asked her what she was looking for she desisted at once nothing was her answer he made her drink from the flask again and gave her his pocket handkerchief to cover her head when she understood she laughed at him without disguise did he think she feared the sun she bade him look at her neckwhich was walnut brown and sleek as satin but when he would have taken back his handkerchief she refused to give it and put it over her head like a hood and tied it under her chin she then turned herself round to face him is it so you would have it sir she asked and looked bewitching my dear said manvers you are a beauty shall he be blamed if he kissed her not by me since she never blamed him her clearseeing eyes searched his face her kissed mouth looked very serious and also very pure then as he observed her ardently she coloured and looked down and afterwards turned herself the way they were to go and with a little sigh settled into his arm manvers spurred his horse and for some time nothing was said between them but he was of a talkative habit with a trick of conversing with himself for lack of a better man he asked her if he was forgiven and felt her answer on his arm though she gave him none in words this was not to content him i see that you will not he said to tease her well i call that hard after my stoning i had believed the ladies of spain kinder to their cavaliers than to grudge a kiss for a cartload of stones at the head well well im properly paid laws go as kings will i know god help poor men he would have gone on with his baiting had she not surprised him she turned him a burning face caballero caballero have done she begged him you rescued me from worse than deathand what could i deny you see sir i have lived fifteen seventeen years in the world and nobodynobody i sayhas ever done me a kindness before and you think that i grudge you she was really unhappy and had to be comforted they became close friends after that she told him her name was manuela and that she was valencian by birth a gitana no indeed she was a christian you are a very bewitching christian manuela he told her and drew her face back and kissed her again i am told that theres nothing in kissing once its the second time that counts in the very actfor eyes met as well as lipshe noticed that hers wavered on the way to his beyond him over the road they had travelled and the ceremony over he again asked her why she passed it off as before saying that she had looked at nothing and begged him to go forward ahead of them now through the crystalline flicker of the heat he saw the dark rim of the wood the cork forest of la huerca for which he was looking and which hid the river from his aching eyes no footburnt wanderer in sahara ever hailed his oasis with heartier thanksgiving but it was still a league and a half away he addressed himself to the task of reaching it and we may suppose manuela respected his efforts at any rate there was silence between the pair for the better part of an hourwhat time the unwinking sun vertically overhead deprived them of so much as the sight of their own shadows and drove the very crows with wings adust to skulk in the furrows the shrilling of crickets the stumbling hoofs of an overtaxed horse and the creaking of saddle and girth made a din in the deadly stillness of this fervent noon and since there was no other sound to be heard it is hard to tell how manvers was aware of a traveller behind him unless he was served by the sixth sense we all have to warn as that we are not alone sure enough when he looked over his shoulder he was aware of a donkey and his rider drawing smoothly and silently near the pair of them were so nearly of the colour of the ground he had to look long to be sure and as he looked manuela suddenly leaned sideways and saw what he saw it was just as if she had received a stroke of the sun she stiffened he felt the thrill go through her and when she resumed her first position she was another person chapter v the ambiguous third god save your grace said esteban for it was he who sitting well back upon his donkeys rump with exceedingly bright eyes and a cheerful grin now forged level with manvers and his burdened steed manvers gave him a curt goodday and thought him an impudent fellowwhich was not justified by anything esteban had done he had been discretion itself and indeed to his eyes there had been nothing of necessity remarkable in the pair on the horse if a ladyduchess or baggagehappened to be sharing the gentlemans saddle an arrangement must be presumed which could not possibly concern himself that is the reasonable standpoint of a people who mind their own business and credit their neighbours with the same preoccupation but manvers was an englishman and could not for the life of him consider esteban as anything but a puppy for seeing him in a compromising situation so much was he annoyed that he did not remark any longer that manuela was another person sitting stiffly strained against his arm every muscle on the stretch as taut as a ships cable in the tideway her face in rigid profile to the newcomer esteban was in no way put out many good days light upon your grace he cheerfully repeatedso cheerfully that manvers was appeased goodday goodday to you he said you ride light and i ride heavy otherwise you had not overtaken us esteban showed his fine teeth and waved his hand towards the hazy distance from the tail of his eye he watched manuela in profile who knows that sir lo que ha de seras we say ah who knows that manuela strained her face forward well said manvers i do for example i have proved my horse hes a galician and a good goer it would want a brave borico to outpace him esteban slipped into the axiomatic as all spaniards will theres a providence of the road sir and a saint in charge of travellers and we know sir a cada puerco viene su san martin manuela stooped her body forward and peered ahead as one strains to see in the dark your proverb is oddly chosen it seems to me said manvers esteban gave a little chuckle from his throat a proverb is a stone flung into a pack of starlings it may scare the most but may hit one by mine i referred to the ways of providence under a figure destiny is always at work no doubt said manvers slightly bored it might have been your destiny to have outpaced me the odds were with you on the other hand as you have not it must have been mine to have overtaken you you are a philosopher asked manvers fatigue deliberately in his voice estebans eyes shone intensely he had marked the changed inflection i studied the humanities at salamanca he said carelessly that was when i was an innocent since then i have learned in a harder school i am learning stillevery day i learn something new i am a gentleman born as your grace has perceived why not a philosopher manvers was rather ashamed of himself of course of course why not indeed i am very glad to see you while our ways coincide esteban raised his battered straw i kiss the feet of your grace and hope your graces ladymanuela quiveredis not disturbed by my company for to tell you the truth sir i propose to enjoy your own as long as you and she are agreeable i am used to companionship he shot a keen glance at manuela who never moved she will speak for herself no doubt said manvers but she did not the gleam in estebans light eyes gave point to his next speech i have a notion that the senora is not of your mind sir he said and am sorry i can hardly remain as an unwelcome third in a journey it would be a satisfaction to me if the senora would assure me that i am wrong manuela now turned her head with an effort and looked down upon the grinning youth why should i care whether you stay or go she said her eyelids flickered over her eyes as though he were dust in their light he showed his teeth why indeed senora god knows i have no reputation to bring you though the company of a gentleman the son of a gentleman never comes amiss they say but two is company and three is a fair i have found it so and so doubtless has your ladyship she made him no answer and had turned away her face long before he had finished after that the conversation was mainly of his making for manuela would say nothing and manvers had nothing to say the cork wood was plain in front of him now he thanked god for the prospect of food and rest in fifteen minutes thought he he should be swimming in the pisuerga the forest began tentatively with heath sparse trees and mounds of cistus and bramble manvers followed the road which ran through a portion of it until he saw the welcome thickets on either hand deep tunnels of dark and shadowy places where the sun could not stab then he turned aside over the broken ground and estebans donkey picked a dainty way behind him when he had reached what seemed to him perfection he pulled up now young lady he said i will give you food and drink and then you shall go to sleep and so will i afterwards we will consider what had best be done with you yes sir she replied in a whisper manvers dismounted and held out his hand to her there was no more coquetting with the saddle she scarcely touched his hand and did not once lift her eyes to himbut he was busy with his haversack and had no thoughts for her esteban meantime sat the donkey looking gravely at his company blinking his eyes smiling quietly recurring now and then to the winding minor air which had been in his head all day he was perfectly unhampered by any doubts of his welcome and watched with serious attention the preparations for a meal in the open which manvers was making with the ease and despatch of one versed in camps ham and sausage rolls of bread a lettuce oranges cheese dates a bottle of wine another of water salt olives a knife and fork a plate a corkscrew every article was in its own paper some were marked in pencil what they were all were spread out upon a horseblanket in good enough order for a fieldinspection nothing was wanting and esteban was as keen as a wolf even manvers rubbed his hands he looked shrewdly at his neighbour good alforjas eh excellent indeed sir said esteban hoarsely it was hard to see this food and know that he could not eat of it manuela was sitting under a tree her face in her hands how far away said manvers is the water do you suppose the water esteban collected himself with a start the water he jerked his head towards the display on the blanket it is under your hand caballero that bottle i take it holds water manvers laughed yes yes i mean the river i am going to swim in the river dont wait for me he turned to the girl take some food my friend ill be back before long her swift transitions bewildered him she showed him now a face of extreme terror she was on her feet in a moment rigid and her eyes were so pale that her face looked empty of eyes like a mask what on earth was the matter with her he understood her to be saying i must go where you go i must never leave you words like that but they came from her mouthed rather than voiced as the babbling of a mad woman all that was clear was that she was beside herself with fright looking to esteban for an explanation he surprised a triumphant gleam in that youths light eyes and saw him grinningas a dog grins with the lip curled back but esteban spoke i think the lady is right sir affection is a beautiful thing he added politely the loss will be mine manvers looked from one to the other of these curious persons so clearly conscious of each other yet so strict to avoid recognition his eyes rested on manuela whats the matter my child she met his glance furtively as if afraid that he was angry plainly she was ashamed of her panic her eyes were now collected her brow cleared and the tension of her arms relaxed nothing is the matter she said in a low voice i will stay here she was shaking still she held herself with both her hands and shook the more i think that you are knocked over by the heat and all the rest of your troubles said manvers and i dont wonder repose yourself hereeatdrink dont spare the victuals i beg and as for you my brother i invite you too to eat what you please and i place this young lady in your charge dont forget that shes had a fright and good reason for it shes been hurt i leave her in your care with every confidence that you will protect her every word spoken was absorbed by esteban with immense relish the words pleased him to begin with by their spanish ring manvers had been pleased himself it was the longest speech he had yet made in castilian but he had no notion of course how exquisitely apposite to the situation they were esteban became superb he rose to the height of the argument and to that of his inches took off his old hat and held it out the length of his arm let the lady fear nothing senor caballero of my soul i engage the honour of a gentleman that she shall have every consideration at my hands which her virtues merit no morehe looked at the sullen beauty between him and the englishmanno more for that would be idolatrous and no less for that would be injustice vaya senor caballero vaya vd con dios manvers nodded and strolled away chapter vi a spanish chapter his removal snapped a chain these two persons became themselves manuela with eyes ablaze strode over to esteban well she said you have found me what is your pleasure he sat very still on his donkey watching her he rolled himself a cigarette still watching and as he lighted it looked at her over the flame speak esteban she said quivering but he took two luxurious inhalations first discharged in dense columns through his nose then he said breathing smoke i have come to kill you manuelitafrom pobledo in a day and a half she had folded her arms and now nodded i know it i have expected you of course said esteban inhaling enormously he shot the smoke upwards towards the light where it floated and spread out in radiant bars of blue manuela was tapping her foot well i am here she said i might have left you but i have not why dont you do what you intend there is plenty of time said esteban and continued to smoke he began to make another cigarette do you know why i chose to stay with you she asked him softly do you know esteban he raised his eyebrows not at all it was because i had a bargain to make with you he looked at her inquiringly but he shrugged it will be a hard bargain for you my girl he told her i believe you will agree to it she said quickly seeing that of my own will i have remained here i will let you kill me as you pleaseon a condition name your condition said esteban i will only say now that it is my wish to strangle you with my hands she put both hers to her throat good she said that shall be your affair but let the caballero go free he has done you no harm on the contrary said esteban i shall certainly kill him when he returns have no doubt of that then i shall have his horse immediately without fear she went up to him where he sat his donkey she saw the knife in his faja but had no fear at all she came quite close to him with an ardent face with eyes alight she stretched out her arms like a man on a cross kill kill esteban but listen first you shall spare that gentlemans life for he has done you no wrong he laughed her down wrong and you come to me to swear that on the cross of christ daughter of swine you lie tears were in her eyes which made her blink and shake her headbut she came closer yet in a passion of entreaty she was so close that her bosom touched him kill esteban killbut love me first her arms were about him now as if she must have love of him or die esteban esteban she was whispering as if she hungered and thirsted for him he shivered at a memory love me once love me once esteban closer and closer she clung to him her eyes implored a kiss loose me you jade he said less sharply but she clove the closer to him and one hand crept downwards from his shoulder as if she would embrace him by the middle too late manuelita too late he said again but he was plainly softening she drew his face towards hers as if to kiss him then whipped the long knife out of his girdle and drove it with all her sobbing force into his neck esteban uttered a thick groan threw his head up and rocked twice then his head dropped and he fell sideways off his donkey she stood staring at what she had done chapter vii the sleeper awakened manvers returned whistling from his bath at peace with all the world of spain in a large mood of benevolence and charitable judgment his mind dwelt pleasantly on manuela but pity mixed with his thought and he added some prudence on his own account that childshes no morei must do something for her not a bad un ill swear not fundamentally bad i dont doubt her as i doubt the male hes too glib by half shes distractingly prettywhat nectarine colour the mouth of a childthat droop at the cornersand as soft as a childs too he shook his head no more kissing or i shall be in a mess when he reached his tree and his luncheon to find his companions gone he was a little taken aback his genial proposals were suddenly chilled queer couplei had a notion that they knew something of each other so theyve made a match of it then he saw a brass crucifix lying in the middle of his plate hulloa he stooped to pick it up it was still warm he smiled and felt a glow come back now thats charming of her thats a pretty touchfrom a pretty girl shes no baggage depend upon it the string had plainly hung the thing round her neck the warmth was that of her bosom he held it tenderly while he turned it about ill warrant now that was all she had upon her not a maravedi beside i know its the last thing to leave em im repaid more than repaid ill wear you for a bit my friend if you wont scorch a heretic here he slipped the string over his head and dropped the cross within his collar ill treat you to a chain in valladolid was his final thought before he consigned manuela to his cabinet of memories he poured and drank hacked at his hambone and ate by the lord he went on commenting theyve not had bite or sup too busy with their matchmaking too delicate to feast without invitation which he pondered the puzzle he had invited manuela he was sure had he included her swain if not the thing was clear she wouldnt eat without him and he couldnt eat without his host it was the best thing he knew of esteban he finished his meal filled and lit a pipe smoked half of it drowsily then lay and slept nothing disturbed his three hours rest not even the gathering cloud of flies whose droning over a neighbouring thicket must have kept awake a lighter sleeper but manvers was so fast that he did not hear footsteps in the wood nor the sound of picking in the peaty ground it was four oclock and more when he awoke sat up and looked at his watch yawning and stretching at ease he then became aware of a friar with a brown shaven head and fine black beard who was digging near by this man whose eyes had been upon him waiting for recognition immediately stopped his toil struck his spade into the ground and came towards him bowing as he came good evening senor caballero he said i am fray juan de la cruz at your service from the convent of n s de la pena near by i have to be my own gravedigger but will you be so obliging as to commit the body while i read the office to this abrupt invitation manvers could only reply by staring fray juan apologised i imagined that you had perceived my business he said which truly is none of yours it will be an act of charity on your parttherefore its own reward may i ask you said manvers now on his feet what or whom you are burying come the friar replied i will show you the body manvers followed him into the thicket good god whats this the staring light eyes of esteban vincaz had no reply for him he had to turn away sick at the sight fray juan de la cruz told him what he knew a young girl riding an ass had come to the church of the convent where he happened to be cleaning the sanctuary the reverend prior was absent the brothers were afield she was in haste she said and the matter would not allow of delay she reported that she had killed a man in the wood of la huerca to save the life of a gentleman who had been kind to her who had indeed but recently imperilled his own for hers if you doubt me she had said go to the forest to such and such a part there you will find the gentleman asleep he has a crucifix of mine the dead man lies not far away with his own knife near him with which i killed him now she had said i trust you to report all i have said to that gentleman for i must be off good god said manvers again god indeed is the only good said fray juan and his ways past finding out but i have no reason to doubt this girls story she told me moreover the name of the manor his names as you may say had he more than one then manvers asked him but without interest the dead was nothing to him but the deed was much this wild girl who had been sleek and kissing but a few hours before now stood robed in tragic weeds fell purpose in her green eyes and her childs mouthstretched to murder and her youthhardy enough to stab the unfortunate young man said fray juan was the son of a more unfortunate father but the name that he used was not that of his house his father it seems but manvers stopped him excuse mei dont care about his father or his names tell me anything more that the girl had to say i have told you everything senor caballero said fray juan and i will only add that you are not to suppose that i am violating the confidences of god far from that she made no confession in the true sense though she promised me that she would not fail to do so at the earliest moment i had it urgently from herself that i should seek you out with her tale and rehearse it to you in justice to her i am now to ask you if it is true so far as you are concerned in it manvers replied its perfectly true i found her in bad company at palencia a pack of ruffians was about her and she might have been killed i got her out of their hands knocked about and wounded and brought her so far on the road to the first convent i could come at that poor devil there overtook us about a league from the wood she had nothing to say to him nor he to her but i remember noticing that she didnt seem happy after he had joined us he had been her lover i suppose she gave me to understand that said fray juan gravely manvers here started at a memory by the lord he cried ill tell you something when we got to the wood i wanted to bathe in the river and was going to leave those two together well she was in a taking about that she wanted to come with methere was something of a scene he recalled her terror and estebans snarling lip i might have saved all thisbut how was i to know i blame myself but what puzzles me still is why the man should have wanted my life can you explain that fray juan was discreet robbery he suggested but manvers laughed i travel light he said he must have seen that i was not his game no no he shook his head it couldnt have been robbery fray juan i say was discreet and it was no business of his but it was certainly in his mind to say that esteban need not have been the robber nor manvers portmanteau the booty however he was silent until the englishman muttered god in heaven what a country and then he took up his parable all countries are very much the same as i take it since god made them all together and put man up to be the master of them and took the woman out of his side to be his blessing and curse at once the place whence she was taken they say can never fully be healed until she is restored to it and when that is done it is not a certain cure such being the plan of this world it does not become us to quarrel with its manifestations here or there senor caballero if you are ready i will proceed assistance at the feet a handful of earth at the proper moment are all i shall ask of you he slipped a surplice over his head the office was said fray juan said manvers at the end will you take this trifle from me a mass i suppose for that poor devils soul would not come amiss fray juan took that as a sign of grace and was glad that he had held his tongue far from it he said it would be extremely proper it shall be offered i promise you now said manvers after a pause i wonder if you can tell me this which way did she go off fray juan shook his head no lo se she came to me in the church and spoke and passed like the angel of death may she go with god i hope so said manvers then he looked into the placid face of the brown friar but i must find her somehow upon that addition he shut his mouth with a snap the survey which he had to endure from fray juans patient eyes was the best answer to it oh but i must you know he said better not my son said fray juan it seems to me that you have seen enough your motives will be misunderstood manvers laughed they are rather obscure to mebut i cant let her pay for my fault you may make her pay double said fray juan no said manvers decisively i wont its my turn to pay now the friar shrugged it is usually the woman who pays but lo que ha de ser the everlasting phrase that proverb serves you well in spain fray juan said manvers who was in a staring fit it is all we have that matters other nations have to learn it here we know it manvers mounted his horse and stooping from the saddle offered his hand adios fray juan vaya vd con dios said the friar and watched him away pobrecita he said to himselfunhappy manuela chapter viii reflections of an englishman but manvers was well upon his way riding with squared jaw with rein and spur towards valladolid he neither whistled nor chanted to the air he was vacuus viator no longer travelled not for pleasure but to get over the leagues for him this country of distances and great air was not castile but broceliande a land of enchantments and pain he was no longer fancyfree but bound to a quest consider the issues of this day of his from bathing in pastoral he had been suddenly soused into tragedys seethingpot his idyll of the tanned gipsy with her glancing eyes and warm lips had been spattered out with a brushful of blood the scene was changed from sunny life to wan death here were the staring eyes of a dead man and his mouth twisted awry in its last agony he could not away with the shock nor divest himself of a share in it if he by mischance had taken up with manuela he had taken up with esteban too the vanished players in the drama loomed in his mind larger for that fateful last act the tragic sock and the mask enhanced them what mystery lay behind manuelas sidelong eyes what sin or suffering what knowledge how gained justified estebans wizened saws these two were wise before their time when they ought to have been flirting on the brink of life here they were breasting the great flood familiar with death hating and stabbing a pretty child with a knife in her hand and a boy murderedwhat a country and where stood he manvers the squire of somerset with his thirty years his university education and his seat on the bench exactly level with the curate to be counted on for an archery meeting well enough for diversion but when serious affairs were on hand sent out of the way was it not so that he as the child of the party was dismissed to bathe while his elders fought out their deadly quarrel i put it in the interrogative but he himself smarted under the answer to it and although he never formulated the thought and made no plans and could make none i have no doubt but that his wounded selfesteem seeking a salve found it in the assurance that he would protect manuela from the consequences of her desperate act that his protection was his duty and her need the english mind works that way we cannot endure a breath upon our fair surface we must direct the operations of this world or the devils in it manvers was not of course in love with manuela he was sentimentally engaged in her affairs and very sure that they were and must be his own yet i dont know whether the waking dream which he had upon the summit of that plateau of brown rock which bounds valladolid upon the north was the cause or consequence of his implication he had climbed this sharp ridge because a track wavered up it which cut off some miles of the road it was not easy going by any means but the view rewarded him the land stretched away to the four quarters of the compass and disappeared into a copperbrown haze he stood well above the plain which seemed infinite cornland and waste riverbed and moor were laid out below him as in a geographers model he thought that he stood up there apart contemplating time and existence he was indeed upon the convex of the world projecting from it into illimitable space consciously sharing its mighty surge this did not belittle him on the contrary he felt something of the helmsmans pride something of the captains on the bridge he was driving the world he soared perched up there apart from men and their concerns all spain lay at his feet he marked the way it must go it was possible for him now to watch a man crawl like a maggot from his cradle and urge a painful way to his grave and to his exalted eye from cradle to grave was but a spans length from such sublime investigation it was but a step to sublimity itself his soul seemed separate from his body he was dispassionate superhuman allseeing and allcomprehending now he could see men as winged ants crossing each other nearing drifting apart interweaving floating in a cloud blown high blown low by wafts of air and here presently came one manvers and there driven by a gust went another manuela at these two insects as one follows idly one gull out of a flock he could look with interest and without emotion he saw them drift touch and part and each be blown its way helpless mote in the dust of the great plain from one to the other he turned his eyes the manvers gnat flew the straighter course holding to an upper current the manuela wavered but tended ever to a lower plane the wind from the mountains of asturias freshened and blew over him in a singular moment of divination he saw the two insects of his vision caught in the draught and whirled together again a spiral flight upwards was begun in evernarrowing circles they climbed bid fair to soar they reached a steadier stream they sped along together but then as a gust took them they dipped below it and steadily declined wavering whirling about each other down and down they went until they were lost to his eye in the dust of heat he saw them no more manvers came to himself and shook his senses back into his head the sun was sinking over portugal the evening wind was chill had he been dreaming what sense of fate was upon him come up rosinante take me out of the cave of montesinos he guided his horse in and out of the boulderstrewn track to the edge of the plateau and there before him many leagues away like a patch of whitewash splodged down upon a blue field lay valladolid the city of burning and pride illustration upon a blue field lay valladolid chapter ix a visit to the jewellers if god in his majesty made the spains and the nations which people them perhaps it was his mercy that convoked the spanish citiesas his servant philip piled rock upon rock and called it madridand made cesspits for the cleansing of the country behold the castilian the valencian the murcian on his glebe you find an exact relation established the one exhales the other the man is what his country is tragic hagridden yet impassive patient under the sun he stands for the natural verities you cannot change him move nor hurt him he can earn neither your praises nor reproach as well might you blame the staring noon of summer or throw a kind word to the everlasting hills the bleak pride of the castillano the flint and steel of aragon the languor which veils andalusian firetravelling the lands which gave them birth you find them scored in large over mountain and plain and riverbed and bitten deep into the hearts of the indwellers they are as seasonable there as the flowers of waste places and will charm you as much so spanish travel is one of the restful relaxations because nothing jars upon you you feel that you are assisting a destiny not breaking it not discovery is before you so much as realisation but in the city spanish blood festers and all that seemed plausible in the open air is now monstrous full of vice and despair whereas outside the man stood like a rock and let fate seam or bleach him bare here within walls he rages shows his teeth blasphemes or sinks into sloth you will find him heaped against the walls like ordure hear him howl for blood in the bullring appraise women as if they were dainties in the alamedas loaf scratch pry where none should pry go begging with his sores trade his own soul for his mothers his pride becomes insolence his tragedy hideous revolt his impassivity swinish his rock of sufficiency a rook of offence god in his mercy or the devil in his despite made the cities of spain and yet the man so superbly at his ease in his enormous spaces is his own conclusion when he goes to town the permutation is logical he is too strong a thing to break his nature it will be aggravated but not deflected leave him to swarm in the plaza and seek his nobler brother go out by the gate descend the winding suburb which gives you the burnt plains and far blue hills now on one hand now on the other as you circle down and down with the walls mounting as you fall touch once more the dusty earth traverse the deep shade of the ilexavenue greet the oxteams the filing mules as they creep up the hill to the town you are bound for their true great spain and though it may be ten days since you saw it or fifty years you will find nothing altered the spaniard is still the flower of his rocks o dura tellus iberiae from the window of his garret don luis ramonez de alavia could overlook the town wall and by craning his neck out sideways could have seen if he had a mind the corniceangle of the palace of his race it was a barrack in these days and had been so since ruin had settled down on the ramonez with the rest of valladolid that had been in the sixteenth century but no ramonez had made any effort to repair it every one of them did as don luis was doing now and accepted misery in true spanish fashion not only did he never speak of it he never thought of it either it was therefore it had to be he rose at dawn every day of his life and took his sop in coffee in his bedgown sitting on the edge of his bed he heard mass in the church of las angustias in the same chapel at the same hour once a month he communicated and then the sop was omitted he was shaved in the barbers shopgomez the sevillian kept itat the corner of the plaza gomez the little dapper blackeyed man was a friend of his his newspaper and his doctor he took a high line with gomez as you may when you owe a man twopence a week that over he took the sun in the plaza up and down the centre line of flags in fine weather up and down the arcade if it rained he saw the diligence from madrid come in he saw the diligence for madrid go out he knew and accepted the salutes of every arriero who worked in and out of the city and passed the time of day with micael the lame waterseller who never failed to salute him at noon he ate an onion and a piece of cheese and then he dozed till three as the clock of the university struck that hour he put on his capasummer and winter he wore it with melancholy and good reason by ten minutes past he was entering the shop of sebastian the goldsmith in the plaza san benito in the which he sat till dusk motionless and absorbed in thought talking little seeming to observe little and yet judging everything in the light of strong common sense summer or winter at dusk he arose flecked a mote or two of dust from his capa seated his beaver upon his grey head grasped his malacca and departed with a be with god my friend to this sebastian the goldsmith invariably replied at the feet of your grace don luis he supped sparingly and the last act of his day was his one act of luxury his cup of chocolate or glass of agraz according to season at the cafe de la luna in the plaza mayor this was his title to table and chair and the respect of all valladolid from dusk until nineon the last stroke of which saluting the company who rose almost to a man he retired to his garret and thin bed pepe the head waiter at the luna who had been there for thirty years gomez the barber who was sixtythree and looked forty sebastian the goldsmith well over middle age and the old priest of las angustias who had confessed him every friday and said mass at the same altar every morning since his ordination god knows how long ago would have testified to the fact that don luis had never once varied his daily habits within time of memory they would have been wrong of course like all clean sweepers for in addition to his inheritance of ruin misfortunes had graved him deeply valladolid knew it well his wife had left him his son had gone to the devil he bore the first blow like a stoic not moving a muscle nor varying a habit the second sent him on a journey the barber the waterseller pepe the waiter sebastian the deft were troubled about him for a week or more he came back and hid his wound speaking to no one of it and no one dared to pity him and although he resumed his routine and was outwardly the same man we may trace to that last stroke of fortune the wasted splendour of his eyes the look of a dying stag which once seen haunted the observer he was extraordinarily handsome except for his narrow shoulders and hollow eyes flawlessly clean in person and dress a tall straight hawknosed sallow gentleman the archbishop of toledo was his first cousin a cadet of his house he was entitled to wear his hat in the presence of the queen and he lived upon fivepence a day manvers reaching valladolid in the evening reposed himself for a day or two and recovered from his shock he saw the sights conversed with affability with all and sundry drank agraz in the cafe de la luna he must have beamed without knowing it upon don luis for his brisk appearance twisted smile and abrupt manner were familiar to that watchful gentleman by the time that sweeping aside the curtain like a buffet of wind he entered the goldsmiths shop in the plaza san benito he came in a little before twilight one afternoon holding by a string in one hand some swinging object taking off his hat with the other as soon as he was past the curtain of the door can you he said to sebastian in very fair spanish take up a job for me a little out of the common as he spoke he swung the object into the air caught it and enclosed it with his hand don luis in a dark corner of the shop sat back in his accustomed chair and watched him he sat very still a picture of mournful interest shrouding his mouth in his hand sebastian first master of his craft in a city of goldsmiths was far too much the gentleman to imply that any command of his customer need not be extraordinary bowing with gravity and adjusting the glasses upon his fine nose he replied that when he understood the nature of the business he should be better instructed for his answer thereupon manvers opened his hand and passed over the counter a brass crucifix it is difficult to disturb the selfpossession of a gentleman of spain sebastian did not betray by a twitch what his feelings or thoughts may have been he gravely scrutinised the battered cross back and front was polite enough to ignore the greasy string and handed it back without a single word it may have been worth half a real to watch his treatment of it was cheap at a dollar manvers however flushed with annoyance and spoke somewhat loftily am i to understand that you will or will not oblige me sebastian temperately replied you are to understand senor caballero that i am at your disposition but also that i do not yet know what you wish me to do manvers laughed and the air was clearer a thousand pardons he said a thousand pardons for my stupidity i can tell you in two minutes what i want done with this thing he held it in the flat of his hand and looked from it to the jeweller as he succinctly explained his wishes i want you he said to encase this cross completely in thin gold plates conscious of sebastians portentous gravity perhaps of don luis in his dark corner he showed himself a little selfconscious also and added its a curious desire of mine i know but theres a reason for it which is neither here nor there make for me then he went on of thin gold plates a matrix to hold this cross it must have a lid also which shall open upon hinges here he indicated the precise pointsand close with a clasp here let the string also be encased in gold i dont know how you will do itthat is a matter for your skill but i wish the string to remain where it is intact within a gold covering this casing should be pliable so that the cross could hang if necessary round the neck of a personas it used to hang do i make myself understood the castilians are not a curious people but this commission did undoubtedly interest sebastian the jeweller professionally speaking it was a delicate piece of work humanly could have but one explanation so at least he judged what don luis may have thought of it theres no telling if you had watched him closely you would have seen the pupils of his eyes dilate and then contractjust like those of a caged owl when he becomes aware of a mouse circling round him but while don luis could be absorbed in the human problem it was not so with his friend points of detail engaged him in a series of suggestions which threatened to be prolonged and which maddened the englishman was the outline of the cross to be maintained in the casing undoubtedly it was otherwise you might as well hang a cardcase round your neck the hinges nowmight they not better be here and here than there and there manvers was indifferent as to the hinges the fastening let the fastening be one which could be snappedto and open upon a spring the chainah there was some nicety required for that from his point of view sebastian said with the light of enthusiasm irradiating his face that that was the cream of the job manvers wishing to get out of the shop begged him to do the best he could and turned to go at the door he stopped short and came back there was one thing more inside the lid of the case in the centre of the cross he wished to have engraved the capital letter m and below that a date may that was really all except that he was staying at the parador de las diligencias and would call in a weeks time he left his cardmr osmund manvers filcote hall taunton oxford and cambridge clubelegantly engraved and then he departed with a jerky salute to don luis grave in his corner that card after many turns back and face was handed to don luis for inspection while sebastian looked to him for light over the rim of his spectacles m for manvers he said presently since don luis returned the card without comment that is probable i imagine it is possible said don luis with his grand air of indifference with an englishman anything is possible sebastian did not pretend to be indifferent he hummed an air and played it out with his fingers on the counter as he thought then he flashed into life the twelfth of may that is just a week ago i have it senor don luis hear my explanation this thing of nought was presented to the gentleman upon his birthdaythe twelfth of may the giver was poor or he would have made a more considerable present and he was very dear to the gentleman or he would not have dared to present such a thing nor would the gentleman i think have treated it so handsomely handsomely he made a rapid calculation ah que he is paying its weight in gold nowthis was in his air of triumphnow what had don luis to say that weary but unbowed antagonist of hunger and despair after shrugging his shoulders considered the matter while sebastian waited why do you suppose he asked at length that the giver of this thing was a man i do not suppose it cried sebastian i never did suppose it the cross has been wornhe passed his finger over its smooth backand recently worn men do not carry such things about them unless they are what this gentleman is said don luis a woman gave him this a wench sebastian bowed and with sparkling eyes readjusted his inferences that being admitted we are brought a little further m does not stand for manversfor what gentleman would give himself the trouble to engrave his own name upon a cross it is the initial of the givers nameand observe senor don luis he is very familiar with her since he knows her but by one he looked through his shop window to the light as he began a catalogue mariamariquitamaritornesmargarita marianamercedesmiguela he stopped short and his eyes encountered those of his friend fast upon him ominous and absorbing he showed a certain confusion any one of these names it might be senor don luis or manuela said the other still regarding him steadily or manuelatrue said sebastian with a bow and a perceptible deepening of colour in any case don luis rose removed a speck of dust from his capa and adjusted his beaverin any case my friend we may assume the th of may to be our gentlemans birthday adios hermano sebastian was about to utter his usual ceremonial assurance when a thought drove it out of his head stay stay a moment don luis of my soul he snapped his fingers together in his excitement ah que muttered don luis who had his hand upon the latch a birthdaywhat is it a thing of every year is he likely to receive a brass crucifix worth two maravedis every year and every year to sheathe it in gold never this marks a solemnitya great solemnity listen i will tell you it marks the end of a liaison she has left himbut tenderly or he has left herbut regretfully it becomes a touching affair do you not agree with me don luis raised his eyebrows i have no means of agreeing with you sebastian it may mark the end of a storyor the beginning who knows he threw out his arms and let them drop senor god who cares chapter x further episodes in the life of don luis ramonez goldsmithing is the art of valladolid and sebastian was its master that was the opinion of the mystery and his own opinion he never concealed it but he had now to confess that manvers had given him a task worthy of his powers to cut out and rivet the links of the chain which was to sheathe a piece of string and leave it all its pliancyi tell you don luis of my soul he said peering up from his board there is no man in our mystery who could cope with itand very few frail ladies who could be worthy of it don luis added that there could be few young men who could be capable of commanding it but sebastian had now conceived an admiration for his client fantasia vaya the english have the hearts of poets in the bodies of beeves did your grace ever hear of dona juanitawho in the french war ran half over andalusia in pursuit of an englishman i heard my father tell the tale not his person claimed her but his heart of a poet well he married her and from camp to camp she trailed after him while he helped our nation beat bonaparte but one day they received the hospitality of a certain hidalgo and had removed many leagues from him by the next night when they camped beside a river dinner was eaten in the tents and dessert served up in a fine bowl sola says the englishman that bowlit is not ours my heart no says juanita it is the hidalgos and was packed with our furniture in the hurry of departing por dios says the englishman it must be returned to him but how he could not go himself for at that moment there entered an alguazil with news of the enemy what then juanita will go says the englishman and went out buckling his sword senor don luis she went on horseback all those leagues beset with foes in the night and rendered back the bowl i tell you the hearts of poets don luis who had been nodding his high approval now stared ah que but the poet was dona juanita it seems to me he said pardon me dear sir not at all our spanish ladies are not fond of travel it was the englishman who inspired her he was a poet with a vision in his vision he saw her going safely then he could say she will go because he to whom time was nothing saw her in the act he did not give directionshe went out to engage the enemy then she wentvaya you may be sure sebastian went on that my client is a poet and a fine fellow you may be sure that the gift of this trifle has touched his heart it was not given lightly the measure of his care is the measure of its worth in his eyes don luis allowed the possibility by raising his eyebrows and tilting his head sideways a shrug with an accent as it were then he allowed sebastian to clinch his argument by saying that the englishman seemed to be getting the better of his emotion for here was a week said he and he had not once been into the shop to inquire for his relic sebastian was down upon the admission what did i tell you my friend is not that the precise action of our englishman who said juanita will ride and went out and left her at the table precisely the same and juanita rodeand i by god have wrought at the work he gave me to do and finished it vaya don luis it is not amiss it had to be confessed that it was not and manvers calling one morning later was as warm in his praises as his spanish and his temperament would admit he paid the bill without demur sebastian though he was curious was discreet don luis however thought proper to remark upon the crucifix when he chanced to meet its owner in the church of las angustias that church contains a famous statue of juan de junis a mater dolorosa most tragic and memorable manvers in his weeks prowling of the city had come upon it by accident and visited it more than once she sits our lady of sorrows upon a rock in her widows weeds exhibiting a grief so intense that she may well have been made larger than life in order to support a misery which would crush a mortal woman it is so fine this emblem of divine suffering that it obscures its tawdry surroundings its pinchbeck tabernacle gilding and red paint when she is carried in a paso as whiles she is no spangled robe is put over her no priests vestment no crown or veil seven swords are driven into her bosom she is unconscious of them her wounds are within but they call her in valladolid senora de los chuchillos it was in the presence of this august mourner that manvers was found by don luis ramonez after mass he had been present at the ceremony but not assisting and had his crucifix open in the palm of his hand when the other rose from his knees and saw him after a moments hesitation the old gentleman stayed till the worshippers had departed and then drew near to manvers and bowed ceremoniously you will forgive me for remarking upon what you have in your hand senor caballero he said when i tell you that i was present not only at the commissioning of the work but at its daily progress to the perfection it now bears my friend don sebastian had every reason to be contented with his masterpiece i am glad to learn from him that you were no less satisfied manvers who had immediately shut down his hand now opened it yes he said its a beautiful piece of work i am more than pleased it is a setting said don luis which in this country we should give to a relic of the true cross manvers looked quickly up i know i know it must seem to you a piece of extravagance on my part but there were reasons good reasons i could hardly have done less don luis bowed gravely but said nothing manvers felt impelled to further discussion had he been a spaniard he would have left the matter where it was but he was not so he went awkwardly on its a queer story for some reason or another i dont care to speak of it the person who gave me this trinket did meor intended mean immense service at a great cost she too said don luis looking at the dolorosa may have had her reasons it was a woman said manvers with quickening colour i see no harm in saying so i was going to tell you that she believed herself indebted to me for some trifling attention i had been able to show her previously that is how i explain her giving me the crucifix it was her way of thanking mea pretty way i was touched don luis waved his hand it is very evident senor caballero your way of recording it is exemplary her way perhaps was no less so you will think me of a sentimental race manvers laughed and i wont deny itbut its a fact that i was touched don luis who throughout the conversation had been turning the crucifix about now examined the inscription he held it up to the light that he might see it better manvers observed him but did not take the hint which was thus rather bluntly conveyed him the case once more in his breastpocket he saluted don luis and went his way shortly afterwards he left valladolid on horseback perhaps a week went by perhaps ten days and then don luis had a visitor one night in the cafe de la luna a meanlooking pale and harassed visitor with a closecropped head whose eyebrows flickered like summer fires in the sky who would not sit down who kept his felt hat rolled in his hands whose deference was extreme and accepted as a matter of course he was known in valladolid it seemed pepe knew him called him tormillo a sus pies was the burthen of his news so far a los pies de vd senor don luis don luis took no sort of notice of him but continued to smoke his cigarette he allowed the man to stand shuffling about for some three minutes before he asked him what he wanted that was exactly what tormillo found it so difficult to explain his eyebrows ran up to hide in his hair his hands crushed his hat into his chest quien sabe he gasped to the company and don luis drained his glass then he looked at the man well tormillo tormillo shifted his feet ha he gasped who knows what the senores may be pleased to say how am i to know they ask for an interview a short interview in the light of the moon two caballeros in the campo grandeready to oblige your excellency and who pray are these caballeros and why do they stand in the campo don luis asked in his grandest manner tormillo wheedled in his explanations that which they have to report senor don luis he began craning forward whispering grinning his extreme goodwilloho it is not matter for the cafe it is matter for the moon and the shade of trees and these caballeros don luis paid the hovering pepe his shot rose and threw his cloak over his shoulder follow me he said and saluting the company walked into the plaza he crossed it and entered a narrow street where the overhanging houses make a perpetual shade there he stopped who are these gentlemen he said abruptly tormillo seemed to be swimming worthy men senor don luis worthy of confidence to me they said little it is for your graces ear they have titles they are written across their foreheads it is not for me to speak who am i tormillo but the slave of your nobility the more he prevaricated the less don luis pursued him stiffening his neck shrouded in his cloak he now stalked stately from street to street until he came to the puerta del carmen through the battlements of which the moon could be seen looking coldly upon valladolid he was known to the gatekeeper who bowed and opened for him the wicket the great space of the campo grande lay like a silver pool traversed only by the thin shadows of the trees at the farther end of the avenue which leads directly from the gate two men were standing close together beyond them a little were two horses one snuffing at the bare earth the other with his head thrown up and ears pricked forward don luis turned sharply on his follower guardia civil si senor si whispered tormillo and his teeth clattered like castanets don luis went on without faltering and did not stay until he was within easy talking distance of the two men then it was that he threw up his head with a fine gesture of race and acknowledged the saluting pair tormillo at this point turned aside and stood miserably under a tree wringing his hands good evening to you friends i am don luis ramonez at your service the pair looked at each other presently one of them spoke at the feet of senor don luis your business is pressing and secret si senor don luis pressing and secret and serious we have to ask your grace to be prepared i thank you my preparations are made already present your report he took a cigarette from his pocket and lit it with a steady hand the flame of the match showed his brows and deepset eyes if ever a man had acquaintance with grief printed upon him it was he but throughout the interview the glowing weed could be seen a waxing and waning rim of fire lighting up his grey moustache and then hovering in midair motionless the officer appointed to speak presented his report in these terms we were upon our round about the wood of la huerca six days ago and had occasion to visit the convent of la pena upon information received from the prior we questioned a certain religious who admitted that he had recently buried a man in the wood after some hesitation which we had the means of overcoming he conducted us to the grave we disinterred the deceased who had been murdered senor don luis proceed said don luis coldly i am listening sir said the officer it was the body of a young man who had come from pobledo he called himself esteban vincaz tormillo under his tree across the avenue howled and rent himself don luis heard him precisely he said to the officer have the goodness to wait while i silence that dog over there he went rapidly over the roadway to tormillo grasped him by the shoulder and spoke to him in a vehement whisper that was the single action by which he betrayed himself he returned to his interview i am now at leisure again let us resume our conversation you questioned the religious you say when did the assassination take place don luis it was upon the twelfth of may ah said don luis the twelfth of may and did he know who committed it senor don luis it was a woman the wasted eyes were upon the speaker and made him nervous he turned away his head but don luis continued his crossexamination she was a fair woman i believe a valencian senor si said the man fair and false a valencian of valencia they say la carne es herba la herba agua el hombre muger la muger nada her name said don luis began with m senor si it was manuela the dancing girlcalled la valenciana la fierita and a dozen other things but pardon me the liberty your worship had been informed i knew something said don luis and suspected something i am much obliged to you my friends justice will be done good night to you he turned touching the brim of his hat but the man went after him a thousand pardons senor don luis but we have our duty to the state eh said don luis sharply well then you had best set to work upon it if your worship has any knowledge of the whereabouts of this woman i have none said don luis if i had i would impart it and when i have it shall be yours go now with god he crossed the pathway of light laid his hand on the shoulder of the weeping tormillo come i need you he said tormillo crept after him to his lodging and the guardias civiles made themselves cigarettes the following day a miracle was reported in valladolid don luis ramonez was not in his place in the cafe de la luna sebastian the goldsmith gomez the pert barber pepe the waiter micael the waterseller of the plaza mayor knew nothing of his whereabouts the old priest of las angustias might have told if his lips had not been sealed but in the course of the next morning it was noised about that his worship had left the city for madrid accompanied by a servant chapter xi gil perez de segovia before he left valladolid manvers had sold his horse for what he could get and had taken the diligencia as far as segovia not a restful conveyance the diligencia of spain therefore in that wonderful city of towers silence and guarded windows he stayed a full week in order as he put it that his bones might have time to set illustration the towers of segovia there it was that he became the property of gil perez who met him one day on the doorstep of his hotel saluted him with a flourish and said in dashing english good morning mister i am the man for you i espeak english very good dutch what you like i show you my city you pleasedeh he had a merry brown face half of a quiz and half of a rogue was welldressed in black wore his hat which was now in his hand rather over one ear manvers met his saucy eyes for a minute saw anxiety behind their impudence could not be angry burst into a laugh and was heartily joined by gil perez that very good said gil you laugh i very glad that tell me is all right he immediately became serious i serve you well sir theres no mistake i am gil perez too well known to the landlord of this hotel you see he showed his teeth which were excellent and he had also manvers reflected shown his hand for what it was worthwhich argued a certain security gil perez he said on an impulse i shall take you at your word do you wait where you are he turned back into the inn and sought his landlord who was smoking a cigar in the kitchen while the maids bustled about from him he learned what there was to be known of gil perez that he was a native of cadiz who had been valet to an english officer at gibraltar followed him out to the crimea nursed him through dysentery of which he had died and had then begged his way home again to spain he had been in segovia a year or two acting as guide or interpreter when he could living on nothing a day mostly and doing pretty well on it he has been in prison i shall not conceal from your honour said the landlord he stabbed a man under the ribs because he had insulted the english gil perez loves your nation he considers you to be the natural protectors of the poor he will serve you well you may be sure thats what he told me himself said manvers the landlord rested his eyeslarge brown and solemn as those of an oxupon his guest he told you the truth senor he will serve you better than he would serve me you will be his god i hope not said manvers and went out to the door again gil perez who had been smoking out in the sun threw his papelito away stood at attention and saluted smartly what was the name of your english master manvers asked him gil replied at once e call capitan rodney royalorse artillery e say gunner e was a gentleman sir im sure he was said manvers my master espeak very good espanish e say damn your eyes all the time and call me little devil just the same ah said gil perez shaking his head e very good gentleman to me sirgood master i loved im e dead for a minute he gazed wistfully at the sky then as if to clinch the sad matter he turned to manvers i bury im all right he said briskly and nodded inward the fact manvers considered for a moment ill give you he said and looked at gil keenly as he said it ill give you one peseta a day he saw his eyes fade and grow blank though the genial smile hovered still on his lips then the light broke out upon him again all right sir he said i take and thank you very much manvers said immediately ill give you two and gil perez accepted the correction silently with a bow by the end of the day they were on the footing of friends but not without one short crossing of swords after dinner when manvers strolled to the door of the inn he found his guide waiting for him gil was in a confidential humour it seemed you care see something sir what sort of a thing for instance he was asked gil perez shrugged what you like sir he peered into his patrons face and there was infinite suggestion in his next question you see fine women manvers had expected something of the sort and had a steely stare ready for him no thanks he said drily and gil saluted and withdrew he was at the door next morning affable yet respectful confident in his powers of pleasing of interesting of arranging everything but he never presumed again he knew his affair three days sightseeing taught master and man their bearings manvers got into the way of forgetting that gil perez was there except when it was convenient to remember him gil on his part learned to distinguish between his patrons soliloquies and his conversation he never made a mistake after the third day if manvers in the course of a ramble stopped abruptly buried a hand in his beard and said aloud that he would be shot if he knew which way to turn gil perez watched him closely but made no remark even look here you know this wont do failed to move him beyond a state of tension like that of a cat in the act to pounce he had found out that manvers talked to himself and was put about by interruptions and if you realise how sure and certain he was that he knew much better than his master what was the very thing or the last thing he ought to do you will see that he must have put considerable restraint upon himself but loyalty was his supreme virtue from the moment manvers had taken him on at two pesetas a day he became the perfect servant of a perfect master he could have no doubt naturally of his ability to servehis belief in himself never wavered but he had none either in his gentlemans right to command i believe if manvers had desired him to cut off his right hand he would have complied with a smile very good master you wanta my and i do if he had a failing it was this nothing on earth would induce him to talk his own language to his master he was unmoved by encouragement unconvinced by the fluency of manvers castilian periods he would have risked his place upon this one point of honour espanish no good sir for you an me he said once with an irresistible smile too damsilly for you capitan rodney e teach me englisha speech now i know it too much no sir you know what they

two e say that be blowed e say in english they understan im too much believe meis the best for you an me sir all people understan that espeech taken as a guide he installed himself as body servant silently tactfully but infallibly manvers caught him one morning putting boots by his door hulloa gil perez he called out what are you doing with my boots gils confidential manner was a thing to drink that mozo mastere fool e no maka shine i show him how capitan rodney lika is boots see is a face in em he smirked at his own as he spoke and was so pleased that manvers said no more the same night he stood behind his masters chair manvers contented himself by staring at him gil perez smiled with his bright eyes and became exceedingly busy manvers continued to stare and presently gil perez was observed to be sweating the poor fellow was selfconscious for once in his life obliged to justify himself he leaned to his masters ear that mozo sir too much of a dam fool imposs you estand im i tell im this gentleman no like garlic down his neck i say you breathe too ard my fellowtoo much garlic this gentleman say crikey what a stink that no good there was no comparison between the new service and the old and so it was throughout gil perez drove out the chambermaid and made manvers bed he brushed his clothes as well as his boots changed his linen for him saw to the washin fine he made himself indispensable but when manvers announced his coming departure there was a short tussle preceded by a pause for breath gil perez inquired of the sky searched up the street searched down a group of brown urchins hovered as always about the stranger ready to risk any deadly sin for the chance of a maravedi or the stump of a cigar gil snatched at one by the bare shoulder and spoke him burning words canalla he cried him horrible flea thou makest the air to reekimpossible to breathe fly thou gnat of the midden or i crack thee on my thumb the boys retired swearing and gil with desperate callingup of reserves faced his ordeal ver good master we go when you like we see escorialfine placesee la granja come by madrid thata way i get orses ow you please then he had an inspiration and beamed all over his face or mules we ave mules mules cheap orses dear too much in segovia manvers could see very well what he was driving at i think ill take the diligencia gil perez gil shrugged ow you like master fine air thata way ver cheap way to go you take my advice you go coupe i go redonda more cheap give me your passport masteri take our place yes i know said manvers but im not sure that i need take you on with me i travel without a servant mostly gil grappled with his task he dropped his air of assumption his eyes glittered i save you money master you find me good servantmake a difference yes oh a great deal of difference manvers admitted i like you you suit me excellently well but he considered what he had to do in madrid and frowned over it manuela was there and he wished to see manuela he had not calculated upon having a servant when he had promised himself another interview with her and was not at all sure that he wanted one on the other hand gil might be useful in a number of waysand his discretion and tact were proved while he hesitated gil perez saw his opportunity and darted in i know madrid too much he said all the ways all the peoples i know imposs you live appy in madrid withouta me he smiled all over his faceand when he did that he was irresistible you try he concluded just like a child manvers on an impulse drew from his pocket the goldset crucifix look at that gil perez he said and put it in his hands gil looked gravely at it hack and front he nodded his approval pretty thing and he decided offhand in valladolid they make open it said manvers but it was opened before he had spoken gils eyes widened while the pupils of them contracted intensely he read the inscription pondered it to the crucifix itself he gave but a momentary glance then he shut the case and handed it back to his master i find er for you he said soberly and that settled it chapter xii a glimpse of manuela gil perez had listened gravely to the tale which his master told him he nodded once or twice and asked a few questions in the course of the narrativequestions of which manvers could not immediately see the bearing one was concerned with her appearance did she wear rings in her ears he had to confess that he had not observed another was interjected when he described how she had grown stiff under his arm when esteban drew alongside gil had nodded rapidly and became impatient as manvers insisted on the fact of course of course he had said and then he asked did she stiffen her arm and point the first and last fingers of it keeping the middle pair clenched manvers understood him and replied that he had not noticed any such thing but that he did not believe she feared the evil eye he went on with his story uninterrupted until the climax he had found the crucifix he said on his return from bathing and had been pleased with her for leaving it then he related the discovery of the body and his talk with fray juan de la cruz here came in gils third question did she return your handkerchief he askedand sharply manvers started by george she never did he exclaimed and i dont wonder at it he said on reflection if she had to knife that fellow and confess to fray juan and escape for her life she had enough to do of course she may have left it in the wood gil perez pressed his lips together she got it still he said we find eri know where to look for it if he did he kept his knowledge to himself though he spoke freely enough of manuela on the way to madrid this manuela he explained is a valencianawhere you find fair women with black men valencianos like moorslove too much white women i think manuela is not gitanilla she is what you call a alfanalf then she is like the gitanas as proud as a fire but all the same a christianmake free with herself a gitana never dare love christian manimposs she do that sometimes all the same she do it i think manuela made like that committed to the statement he presently saw a cheerful solution of it soon see he added and considered other problems that dead man follow manuela to kill er he decided when e find er with you master e say now i know why you run hija de perra now i kill two and get a orse you see yes said manvers i see that and you think that he told her what he meant to do of course e tell said gil perez with scorn make it too bad for er make er feel sick brute cried manvers but gil went blandly on e ate er so much that e feel ungry and thirsty e eat before e kill must do ittoo ungry then she go near im twisting erself aboutshowing erself to please him you kiss me my eart she say i love you all the same kiss methen you kill e look at ershe very fine girlgive pleasure to see e think i love er firststrangle afterand go on looking she old im fast and drag down is eadall the time she know where e keep navaja she cling and kissthen nip out navaja and click e dead man enthusiasm burned in his black eyes he stood cheering in his stirrups senor don dios that very fine i give twenty dollars to see er make im love manvers for his part grew the colder as his man waxed warm he was clear however that he must find the girl and protect her from any trouble that might ensue she had put herself within the law to save him from the knife she must certainly be defended from the perils of the law from what he could learn of spanish justice that meant money and influence these she should have but there should be no more pastorals her kisses had been sweet the aftertaste was sour in the mouth gil perez with his eloquence and dramatic fire had cured him of hankering after more of them the girl was a rip and there was an end of it he did not blame himself in the least for having kissed a riponce there was nothing in that but he had kissed her twiceand that second kiss had given significance to the first to think of it made him sore all over it implied a tender relation it made him seem the girls lover why it almost justified that sickfaced grinning rascal whose staring eyes had shocked him out of his senses and what a damned fool he had made of himself with the crucifix he ground his teeth together as he cursed himself for a sentimental idiot for the rest of the way it was gil perez who cried up the questuntil he was curtly told by his master to talk about something else and then gil could have bitten his tongue off for saying a word too much a couple of days at the escorial with nothing of manuela to interfere served manvers to recover his tone before he was in the capital he was again that good and happy traveller to whom all things come well in their seasons to whom the seasons of all things are the seasons at which they come he liked the bustle and flaunt of madrid he liked its brazen front its crowded carreras and appetite for shows there was hardly a day when the windows of the puerta del sol had not carpets on their balconies files of halberdiers went daily to and from the palace and the atocha escorting some gilded swinging coach and every time the madrilenos serried and craned their heads viva isabella abajo don carlos or sometimes the other way about the cries went up politics buzzed all about the square in the mornings evening brimmed the cafes manvers resumed his soul became again the amused observer gil perez bided his time and contented himself with being the perfect bodyservant which he undoubtedly was on the first sunday after arrival without any order he laid before his master a ticket for the corrida such a one as comported with his dignity but not until he was sure of his ground did he presume to discuss the gory spectacle then at dinner he discovered that manvers had been more interested in the spectators than the fray and allowed himself free discourse the queen and the court the alcalde and the prime minister the manolos and manolashe had plenty to say and to leave unsaid he just glanced at the performersimpossible to omit the espadacorchuelo the first in spain but the fastidious in manvers was awake and edgy he had not liked the bullfight so gil perez kept out of the arena i see one very grand old gentleman there master was one of his chance casts you see im e grandee of espain too much poor proud all the same put is at on so soon the queen come indon luis ramonez de alavia whos he asked manvers great gentleman of valladolid said gil perez grandee of espainno moneyonly pride he did not add as he might that he had seen manuela or was pretty sure that he had that was delicate ground but manvers who had forgotten all about her went cheerfully his ways and amused himself in his desultory fashion after the closepent streets of segovia where the wayfarer seems throttled by the houses and one looks up for light and pants towards the stars and the air he was pleased by the breadth of madrid the puerto del sol was magnificentlike a lake the alcala and san geronimo were noble rivers feeding it he liked them at dawn when the hosepipe had been newly at work and these great spaces of emptiness lay gleaming in the mild sunlight exhaling freshness like that of dewy lawns when under the glare of noon they lay slumbrous they were impressive by their prodigality of width and scope in the bustle and hum of dusk with the cafes filling and spilling over on to the pavements he could not tire of them but at night the mystery of their magic enthralled him how could one sleep in such a city the puerto del sol was then a sea of dark fringed with shores of bright light the two huge feeders of itwith what argosies they teemed shrouded craft illustration madrid by night that touch of the east which you can never miss in spain wherever you may be was unmistakable in madrid in spite of court and commerce in spite of newspaper stock exchange or cortes the cloaked figures moved silently swiftly seldom in pairs without speech with footfall scarcely audible now and again manvers heard the throb of a guitar now and again with sudden clamour the clack of castanets but such noises stopped on the instant and the traffic was resumedwhatever it wassecret swift impenetrable business for the most part this traffic of the night was conducted by menyoung or old as may be the capa hid them all kept their semblance as secret as their affairs here and there but rarely walked a woman superbly as spanish women will with a selfsufficiency almost arrogantly strong robed in white hooded with a white veil the mantilla came streaming from the comb swathed her pale cheeks and enhanced her lustrous eyes but from top to toe she was whatever else she may have been and it was not difficult to guess in white manvers watched them pass and repass at a distance they looked like moths but close at hand showed the carriage and intolerance of queens they looked at him fairly as they passed unashamed and unconcerned their eyes asked nothing from him their lips wooed him not there was none of the invitation such women extend elsewhere far otherwise it was the men who craved the women who dispensed when they listened it was as to a petitioner on his knees when they gave it was like an alms imperious freemoving highheaded creatures they interested him deeply it was true as gil perez was quick to see that at his first bullfight manvers had been unmoved by the actors but stirred to the deeps by the spectators if he had cared to see another it would have been to explore the secrets of this wonderful people who could become animals without ceasing to be men and women but why jostle on a bench why endure the dust and glare of a corrida when you can see what madrid can show you the women by the manzanares or the nightly dramas of the streets love in spain he began to learn is a terrible thing a grim tussle of wills a matter of life and death of meat and drink he saw lovers still as death with upturned faces tense and white eating the iron of guarded balconies hour by hour they would stand there waiting watching hoping on no one interfered no one remarked them he heard a woman wail for her loverwail and rock herself about careless of who saw or heard her and indeed neither seen nor heard once he saw a couple close together vehement speech between them a lovers quarrel terrible affair the words seemed to scald the man had had his say and now it was her turn he listened to her touched but not persuadedhad his reasons no doubt but she manvers had not believed the heart of a girl could hold such a gamut of emotions she was young slim very pale her face was as white as her robe but her eyes were like burning lakes and her voice hoarse though she had made herself had a cry in it as sharp as a violins to out the very soul of you she spoke with her hands too with her shoulders and bosom with her head and stamping foot she never faltered though she ran from scorn of him to deep scorn of herself and appealed in turn to his pride his pity his honour and his lust she had no reticence set no bounds she was everything or nothing he was a god or dirt of the kennel in the endand what a climaxshe stopped in the middle of a sentence covered her eyes sobbed gave a broken cry turned and fled away the man left alone spread his arms out and lifted his face to the sky as if appealing for the compassion of heaven manvers could see by the light of a lamp which fell upon him that there were tears in his eyes he was pitying himself deeply senor jesu have pity manvers heard him saying what could i do woe upon me what could i do to him there as he stood wavering returned suddenly the girl as swiftly as she had gone she came back like a white squall ah son of a thief ah son of a dog and she struck him down with a knife over the shoulderblade he gasped groaned and dropped and she was upon his breast in a minute moaning her pity and love she stroked his face crooned over him lavished the loveliest vocables of her tongue upon his worthless carcase and won him by the very excess of her passion the fallen man turned in her arms and met her lips with his manvers shaking with excitement left them here again was a manuela manuela her burnt face on fire her eyes blown fierce by rage her tawny hair streaming in the wind manuela with a knife hacking the life out of esteban came vividly before him ah those soft lips of hers could bare the teeth within an hour of his kissing her she must have bared them when she snarled on that other and her eyes which had peered into his to see if liking were therehow had they gleamed upon the man she slew her sleekness then was that of the cat but she had had no claws for him why had she left him her crucifix after all had she murdered the fellow or protected herself she told the monk that she had been driven into a cornerto save manvers and herself was he to believe thator his own eyes his eyes had just seen a spanish girl with her lover and his judgment was warped manuela might be of that sortshe had not been so to him nor could she ever be so since there was no question of love between them now and never could be come now thus he reasoned with himself come now let us be reasonable he had pulled her out of a scuffle and she had been grateful she was pretty he had kissed her she was grateful and had knifed a man who meant him mischiefand she had left him a crucifix gratitude again what had her gipsy skin and red kerchief to do with her heart and conscience beware my son of the pathetic fallacy he told himself and as he turned into the carrera san geronimo beheld manuela robed in white pass along the street he knew her immediately though her face had but flashed upon him and there was not a stitch upon her to remind him of the ragged creature of the plain a white mantilla covered her hair a white gown hid her to the ankles he had a glimpse of a white stocking and remarked her highheeled white slippers startling transformation but she walked like a freemoving creature of the open and breasted the hot night as if she had been speeding through a woodland way that was manuela who had lulled a man to save him after a moment or so of hesitation he followed her keeping his distance she walked steadily up the carrera looking neither to right nor to left many remarked her some tried to stop her a soldier followed her pertinaciously till presently she turned upon him in splendid rage and bade him be off manvers praised her for that and quickening gained upon her she turned up a narrow street on the right it was empty manvers gaining rapidly drew up level they were now walking abreast with only the streetway between them but she kept a rigid profile to himas severe as proud and fine as the arethusas on a coin of syracuse the resemblance was striking straight nose short lip rounded chin the strong throat unwinking eyes looking straight before her and adding to these beauties of contour her splendid colouring and carriage of a young goddess it is not too much to say that manvers was dazzled it is true he was confounded by the excess of her beauty and by his knowledge of her condition his experiences of life and cities could give him no parallel but they could and did give him a dangerous sense of power this glowing salient creature was for him if he would one word and she was at his feet for a moment as he walked nearly abreast of her he was ready to throw everything that was natural to him to the winds she stirred a depth in him which he had known nothing of he felt himself trembling all overbut while he hesitated a quick step behind caused him to look round he saw a man following manuela and presently knew that it was gil perez and gil with none of his own caution walked on her side of the street and overtaking her took off his hat and accosted her by some name which caused her to turn like a beast at bay nothing abashed gil asked her a question which clapped a hand to her side and sent her cowering to the wall she leaned panting there while he talked rapidly explaining with suavity and point it was very interesting to manvers to watch these two together to see for instance how gil perez comported himself out of his masters presence or how manuela dealt with one of her own nation they became strangers to him people he had never known he felt a foreigner indeed the greatest courtesy was observed the most exact distance gil perez kept his hat in his hand his body at a deferential angle his weaving hands were never still manuela her first act of royal rage ended held herself superbly her eyes were half closed her lips tightly so and she so contrived as to get the effect of looking down upon him from a height manvers imagined that his name or person was being brought into play for once manuela looked at her companion and bowed her head gravely gil perez ran on with his explanations and apparently convinced her judgment for she seemed to consent to something which he asked of her and presently walked on her way with a high head while gil perez still holding his hat and still explaining walked with her but a little way behind her a cooling experience manvers strolled back to his hotel and his bed with his unsuspected nature deeply hidden again out of sight he wondered whether gil perez would have anything to tell him in the morning or whether on the other hand he would be discreetly silent as to the adventure he wondered next where that adventure would end he had no reason to suppose his servant a man of refined sensibilities remembering his eloquence on the road to madrid the paean he blew upon the fairness of valencian women he laughed heres a muddy wash upon my bloodboltered pastoral he said aloud heres an end of my knighterrantry indeed there was nearly an end of himfor almost at the same moment he was conscious of a light step behind him and of a sharp stinging pain and a blow in the back he turned wildly round and struck out with his stick a man doubled in two ran like a hare down the empty street and vanished into the dark manvers feeling sick and faint leaned to recover himself against a doorway and probably fell for when he came to himself he was in his bed in the hotel with gil perez and a grave gentleman in black standing beside him chapter xiii chivalry of gil perez he felt stiff and stupid with a roasting spot in his back between his shoulders but he was able to see the light in gil perez eyeswhich was a good light saying well so farbut i look for more neither gil nor the spectacled gentleman in blackthe surgeon he presumedspoke to him and disinclined for speech himself manvers lay watching their tiptoe ministrations with spells of comfortable dozing in between in the course of which he again lost touch with the world of spain when he came to once more he was much better and felt hungry he saw gil perez by the window reading a little book the sunblinds were down to darken the room gil held his book slantwise to a chink and read diligently moving his lips to pronounce the words gil perez said manvers what are you reading gil jumped up at once you better sir praised be god i read he said a little catholic book which calls itself the garden of the soulver good little book what you call ver ealthyver good for im but you are better

why don luis should want to have me stabbed i tell you sir said gil perez esteban vincaz was don bartolome ramonez son to don luis bad son e was if you like sir wil oats what you call all the sama nobleman all the sama only son to don luis manvers considered this oracle with what light he had don luis supposes that i killed his son then he said is that it e damsure said gil perez blinking fast on manuelas accounteh like a shot cried gil perez with enthusiasm so of course he thinks it his duty to kill me in return of course e does sir said gil i tell you e is proud like the devil i

that now i want to know one more thing how on earth did don luis find out that i was in the wood with manuela and his son ah said gil perez now you aska me something who knows he shrugged profusely then his face cleared leave it to me sir i ask tormillo he was on his feet as if about to find the assassin there and then stop a bit said manvers stop a bit gil now i must tell you that i also saw manuela last night ah said gil perez softly and his eyes glittered i saw her in the street manvers continued watching his servant she was all in white gil perez blinked this fact yes sir he said that is true poor girl his eyes clouded over poor manuela he was heard to say to himself i followed her for a while said manvers and saw you catch her up and stop her then i went away and then that rascal struck me in the back now do you suppose that don luis means to serve manuela the same way gil perez did not blink any more i think e wisha that he said but i think e wont why not because i tell manuela what i see at the corrida she was there too she know it already bless you she dont care but i care said manvers sharply ive got her on my conscience i dont intend her to suffer on my account that said gil perez is what she wanta do he looked piercingly at his master you know sir i ask er for your andkerchief well manvers raised his eyebrows i tell you whata she do she look allaways in the

no good she keepa that in there where is it he was asked he tried to be his jaunty self but failed not ere sir i ave iti senda to the wash manvers looked keenly at him but said nothing he had a suspicion that gil perez was telling a lie you had better get her out of madrid he said after a while there may be trouble let her go and hide herself somewhere until this has blown over give me my pocketbook he took a couple of bills out and handed them to gil theres a hundred for her get her into some safe placeand the sooner the better well see her through this business somehow gil perezvery unlike himselfsuddenly snatched at his hand and kissed it then he sprang to his feet again and tried to look as if he had never done such a thing he went to the door and put his head out listening doctor coming he said all righta leave you with im of course its all right said manvers but gil shook his head don luis make me sick he said no use e come ere you mean that he might have another shot at me gil nodded very wideeyed and serious he was e try i know im too much manvers shut his eyes i expect hell have the decency to wait till im about again anyhow ill risk it what you have to do is to get manuela away yessir said gil in his best english and admitted the surgeon with a bow then he went lightfooted out of the room and shut the door after him he was away two hours or more and when he returned seemed perfectly happy manuela quite safa now he told his master where is she gil he was asked and waved his hand airily for reply she all right sir near ere quita safe presently i see er he could not be brought nearer than that questioned on other matters he reported that he had failed to find either don luis or tormillo and was quite unable to say how they knew of his masters relations with the valencian girl or what their further intentions were his chagrin at having been found wanting in any single task set him was a great delight to manvers and amused the slow hours of his convalescence his wound which was deep but not dangerous healed well and quickly in ten days he was up again and inquiring for manuelas whereabouts better not see her he was advised until it was perfectly certain that don luis was appeased gil promised that in a few days time he would give an account of everything it is doubtful however whether he would have kept his word had not events been too many for him one day after dinner he asked his master if he might speak to him on receiving permission he drew him apart into a little room the door of which he locked hulloa gil perez said manvers what is your game now sir said gil holding his head up and looking him full in the face i must espeak to you about manuela she is in the carcel de la cortetomorrow they take er to the

make yourself oney we say and the flies willa suck you manuela too much oney all the time i know that because she tell me everything to tell you dont tell me said manvers bedam if i do said gil perez chapter xiv trial by question the court was not full when manvers and his advocate with gil perez in attendance took their places but it filled up gradually and the judge of first instance when he took his seat upon the tribunal faced a throng not unworthy of a bullfight bestial leering inflamed faces peering eyes agog for mischief all the nervous expectation of the sudden the bloody or terrible were there there was the same dead hush when manuela was brought in as when they throw open the doors of the toril and the throng holds its breath gil perez drew his with a long whistling sound and manvers who could dare to look at her thought he had never seen maidenly dignity more beautifully shown she moved to her place with a gentle consciousness of what was due to herself very touching to see the crowded court thrilled and murmured but she did not raise her eyes once only did she show her feeling and that was when she passed near the barrier where the spectators could have touched her by leaning over more than one stretched his hand out one at least his walking cane then she took hold of her skirt and held it back just as a girl does when she passes wet paint this little touch which made the young men jeer and whisper obscenity brought the water to manvers eyes he heard gil perez draw again his whistling breath and felt him tremble directly manuela was in her place standing facing the assize gil perez looked at her and never took his eyes from her again she was dressed in black and her hair was smooth over her ears knotted neatly on the nape of her neck the judge a fatigued monumental person with a long face pointed whiskers and the eyes of a dead fish told her to stand up as she was already standing she looked at him with patient inquiry but he took no notice of that her selfpossession was indeed remarkable she gave her answers quietly without hesitation and when anything was asked her which offended her either ignored it or told the questioner what she thought of it from the outset manvers could see that the judges business was to incriminate her beyond repair her plea of guilty was not to help her she was to be shown infamous the examination ran thus judge you are manuela daughter of incarnacion presa of valencia and have never known your father manuela bows her head answer the court manuela it is true judge it is said that your father was the gitano sagruel manuela i dont know judge you may well say that remember that you are condemning your mother by such answers your mother sold you at twelve years old to an unfrocked priest named tormes manuela yes for three pesos judge disgraceful transaction this wretch taught you dancing posturing and all manner of wickedness manuela he taught me to dance judge how long were you in his company manuela for three years judge he took you from fair to fair you were a public dancer manuela that is true judge i can imaginethe court can imagineyour course of life during this time this master of yours this tormes how did he treat you manuela very ill judge be more explicit manuela in what way manuela he beat me he hurt me judge why so manuela i cannot tell you any more about him judge you refuse manuela yes judge the court places its interpretation upon your silence he looked painfully round as if he regretted the absence of the proper means of extracting answers manvers heard gil perez curse him under his breath the judge made lengthy notes upon the margin of his docquet and then proceeded judge the young gentleman don bartolome ramonez first saw you at the fair of salamanca in manuela yes judge he saw you often and followed you to valladolid where his father don luis lived manuela yes judge he professed his passion for you gave you presents manuela yes judge you persuaded him to take you away from tormes manuela no judge what do i hear manuela i said no it was because he said that he loved me that i went with him he wished to marry me he said judge what don bartolome ramonez marry a public dancer be careful what you say there manuela manuela he told me so and i believed him judge i pass on you were with him until the april of this yearyou were with him two years manuela yes judge and then you found another lover and deserted him manuela no i ran away from him by myself judge but you found another lover manuela no judge be careful manuela you will trip in a moment you ran away from don bartolome when you were at pobledo and you went to palencia what did you do there manuela i cannot answer you judge you mean that you will not manuela i mean that i cannot judge this is wilful prevarication again i have authority to compel you manuela you have none judge we shall see manuela we shall see you left palencia on the th of may in the company of an englishman manuela yes judge he is here in court manuela yes judge do you see him at this moment manuela yes but she did not turn her head to look at manvers until the judge forced her judge i am not he i am not likely to have taken you from palencia and your proceedings there look at the englishman she hesitated for a little while and then turned her eyes upon him with such gentle modesty that manvers felt nearer to loving her than he had ever done he rose slightly in his seat and bowed to her she returned the salute like a young queen the judge had gained nothing by that i see that you treat each other with ceremony there may be reasons for that we shall soon see this gentleman then took you away from palencia in the direction of valladolid and made you certain proposals what were they manuela he proposed that i should return to palencia judge and you refused manuela yes judge why manuela i could not go back to palencia judge why manuela there were many reasons one was that i was afraid of seeing esteban there judge you mean don bartolome ramonez de alavia she nodded answer me manuela yes yes judge you are impatient because your evil deeds are coming to light i am not surprised but you must command yourself there is more to come manvers who was furious asked his advocate whether something could not be done directly her fear of esteban was touched upon he said the judge changed his tactics the advocate smiled be patient sir he said the judge has been instructed beforehand you mean said manvers that he has been bribed i did not say so the advocate replied the judge returned to palencia what other reasons had you was his next question but manuela was clever enough to see where her strength lay my fear of esteban swallowed all other reasons she saved herself and with unconcealed chagrin the judge went on towards the real point judge the englishman then made you another proposal manuela yes sir he proposed to take me to a convent judge you refused that manuela no sir i should have been glad to go to a convent judge you however accepted his third proposal namely that you should be under his protection manuela i was thankful for his protection when i saw esteban coming judge i have no doubt of that you had reason to fear don bartolomes resentment manuela i knew that esteban intended to murder me judge don bartolome overtook you you were riding before the englishman on his horse manuela yes i could not walk i was ill judge don bartolome remained with you until the englishman ran away manuela he did not run away why should he he went away on his own affairs judge after looking at his papers i see the englishman went away after the pair of you had killed don bartolome manuela that is not true he went away to bathe and then i killed esteban with his own knife i killed him because he told me that he intended to murder me and the english gentleman who had been kind to me i confess iti confessed it to the alguazils and the carcelero you may twist what i say as you will to please your friends but the truth is in what i say judge silence it is for you to answer the questions which i put to you you forget yourself manuela but i will take your confession as true for the moment supposing it to be true did you not stab don bartolome in the neck in order that you might be free manuela i killed him to defend myself and an innocent person i have told you so judge why should don bartolome wish to kill you manuela he hated me because i had refused to do his pleasure he wished to make me bad judge lifting his hands and throwing his head up bad was he not jealous of the englishman manuela i dont know judge did he not tell you that the englishman was your lover did you not say so to fray juan de la cruz manuela he spoke falsely it was not true he may have believed it judge we shall see have patience manuela having slain your old lover you were careful to leave a token for his successor you left more than that your crucifix from your neck and a message with fray juan manuela yes i told fray juan the whole of the truth and begged him to tell the gentleman because i wished him to think well of me i told him that esteban judge softly softly manuela why did you leave your crucifix behind you manuela because i was grateful to the gentleman who had saved my life at palencia because i had nothing else to give him had i had anything more valuable i would have left it nobody had been kind to me before judge you know what he has done with your crucifix manuela manuela i do not judge what are you saying manuela the truth judge i have the means of confuting you you told fray juan that you were going to madrid manuela i did not judge in the hope that he would tell the englishman manuela if he told the gentleman that he lied judge it is then a singular coincidence which led to your meeting him here in madrid manuela i did not meet him judge did you not meet him a few nights before you surrendered to justice manuela no judge did you meet his servant manuela i cannot tell you judge did not the englishman pay for your lodging in the carcel de la corte did he not send his servant every day to see you manuela the gentleman was lying wounded at the hotel he had been stabbed in the street judge we are not discussing the englishmans private affairs answer my questions manuela i cannot answer them judge you mean that you will not manuela did you not know that the englishman caused your crucifix to be set in gold like a holy relic manuela i did not know it judge we have it on your own confession that you slew don bartolome ramonez in the wood of la huerca and you admit that the englishman was protecting you before that dreadful deed was done that he has since paid for your treatment in prison and that he has treasured your crucifix like a sacred relic manuela you are pleased to say these things i dont say them you wish to incriminate a person who has been kind to me judge i will ask you one more question manuela why did you give yourself up to justice manuela after a painful pause speaking with high fervour and some approach to dramatic effect i will answer you senor juez it was because i knew that don luis would contrive the death of don osmundo if i did not prove him innocent judge rising very angry silence the court cannot entertain your views of persons not concerned in your crime manuela but she shrugged and looked away judge you can sit down chapter xv nemesisdon luis manvers reiterated question of how in the name of wonder don luis or anybody else knew what he had done with manuelas crucifix was answered before the day was over but not by gil perez or the advocate whom he had engaged to defend the unhappy girl this personage gave him to understand without disguise that there was very little chance for manuela the judge he said had been instructed he clung to that phrase when manvers said let us instruct him a little he took snuff and replied that he feared previous instruction might have created a prejudice he undertook however to see him privately before judgment was delivered but intimated that he must have a very free hand manvers rejoinder took the shape of a blank cheque with his signature upon it the advocate fanning himself with it in an abstracted manner went on to advise the greatest candour in the witnessbox beware of irritation dear sir he said the judge will plant a banderilla here and there you may be sure that is his method you learn more from an angry man than a cool one for my own part he went on you know how we standwithout witnesses i shall do what i can you may be sure i hope you will get something useful from the prisoner manvers said a little of master estebans private history should be useful it would be perfectly useless if you will allow me to say so replied the advocate the judge will not hear a word against a family like the ramonez so noble and so poor perhaps you are not aware that the archbishop of toledo is don luis first cousin that is so but is that allowed to justify his rip of a son in goading a girl on to murder cried manvers the advocate again took snuff shrugging as he tapped his fingers on the box the ramonez say you see sir that don bartolome may have threatened her moved by jealousy jealousy is a wellunderstood passion here the plea is valid and good might it not stand for manuela too he was asked i dont think we had better advance it don osmundo he said after a significant pause gil perez pale and all on edge had been walking the room like a caged wolf he swore to himselfbut in english out of politeness to his master thata dam thief ah juez of my soul if i see you twist in ell is good for me presently he took manvers aside and his eyes full of tears asked him sir you escusa manuela if you please she maka story ver bad to ear she no likei see er red as fire burn like the devil sir she ver unfortunata girltoo beautiful to live and all these ogsoh my god what can she do he opened his arms and turned his pinched face to the sky what can she do oh my god he cried so beautiful as a rose an so poor and so a child you sorry sir hey he asked and manvers said he was more sorry than he could say that comforted him he kissed his masters hand and then told him that manuela was glad that he knew all about her she dam glad sir that i know she say to me las nightwhat i shall tell the juez will be the very truth senor don osmundo shall know what i am she say to im i could never say it to thata juez too easy say it tomorrow she say e know me for what i amtoo bad girl i think she is a noble girl said manvers shes got more courage in her little finger than i have in my body shes a girl in a thousand gil perez glowed and lifted up his beaten head esplendideh he cried out by god i serve er on my knees on returning to the court the beard and patient face of fray juan greeted our friend he had very little to testify save that he was sure the englishman had known nothing of the crime the prisoner had told him her story without haste or passion he had been struck by that she said that she killed don bartolome in a hurry lest he should kill both her and her benefactor she had not informed him nor had he reported to the gentleman that she was going to madrid the englishman said that he intended to find her and witness had strongly advised him against it he had told him that his motives would be misunderstood as in fact they have been brother the advocate suggested fray juan raised his eyebrows and sighed quien sabe was his answer manvers then stood up and spoke his testimony he gave the facts as the reader knows then and made it clear that manuela was in terror of esteban from the moment he appeared and even before he appeared he had noticed that she frequently glanced behind them as they rode and had asked her the reason her fear of him in the wood was manifest and he blamed himself greatly for leaving her alone with the young man i was new to the country you must understand he said i could see that there was some previous acquaintance between those two but could not guess that it was so serious i thought however that they had made up their differences and gone off together when i returned from bathing when pray juan showed me the body and told me what had been done i was very much shocked it had been in one sense my fault for if i had not rescued her esteban would not have suspected me or intended my death that i saw at once and my desire of meeting manuela again was that i might defend her from the consequences of an act which i had in that one sense brought aboutto which she had at any rate been driven on my account i will ask you sir said the judge one question upon that was that also your motive in having the crucifix set in pure gold no said manvers not altogether i doubt if i can explain that to you i am of that opinion myself said the judge with an elaborate bow but the court will be interested to hear you the court was this girl manvers said was plainly most unfortunate she was ragged poorly fed had been illused and was being shamefully handled when i first saw her i snatched her out of the hands of the wretches who would have torn her to pieces if i had not interfered from beginning to end i never saw more shocking treatment of a woman than i saw at palencia not to have interfered would have shamed me for life what then i rescued her as i say and she showed herself grateful in a variety of ways then esteban vincaz came up and chose to treat me as her lover i believe he knew better and think that my horse and haversack had more to do with it well i left manuela with him in the woodhardly i may suggest the act of a loverand never saw esteban alive again but i believe manuelas story absolutely i am certain she would not lie at such a time or to such a man as fray juan the facts were extraordinary and her crime done as it was in defence of myself was heroicor i thought so her leaving of the crucifix was to me a proof of her honest intention i valued the gift partly for the sake of the giver partly for the act which it commemorated she had received a small service from me and had returned it fiftyfold by an act of desperate courage to crown her charity she left me all that she had in the world i do not wonder myself at what i did i took the crucifix to a jeweller at valladolid had it set as i thought it deservedand i see now that i did her there a cruel wrong permit me to say sir said the triumphant judge that you also did don luis ramonez a great service through your act however intended he has been enabled to bring a criminal to justice i beg pardon said manvers she brought herself to justiceso soon as don luis ramonez sent his assassin out to stab me in the back and in the dark and this again was a proof of her heroism since she thought by these means to satisfy his craving for human blood manvers spoke incisively and with severity the court thrilled and the murmuring was on his side the judge was much disturbed manuela alone maintained her calm sitting like a pensive hebe her cheek upon her hand the judges annoyance was extreme it tempted him to wrangle i beg you sir to restrain yourself the court cannot listen to extraneous matter it is concerned with the consideration of a serious crime the illustrious gentleman of your reference mourns the loss of his only son i fail said manvers to see how my violent death can assuage his grief the judge was not the only person in court to raise his eyebrows if manvers had not been angry he would have seen the whole assembly in the same act and been certified that they were not with him now his advocate whispered him urgently to sit down he did still mystified the judge immediately retired to consider his judgment manvers advocate left the court and was away for an hour he returned very sedately to his place with the plainly expressed intention of saying nothing the court buzzed with talk much of it directed at the beautiful prisoner whose person bearing motives and fate were freely discussed oddly enough at that moment half the men in the hall were ready to protect her manvers felt his heart beating but could neither think nor speak coherently if manuela were to be condemned to death what was he to do he knew not at all but the crisis to which his own affairs and his own life were now brought turned him cold he dared not look at gil perez the minutes dragged on the judge entered the court and sat in his chair he looked very much like a codfishwith his gaping mouth and foolish eyes he pulled one of his long whiskers and inspected the end of it detected a split hair separated it from its happier fellows shut his eyes gave a vicious wrench to it and gasped as it parted then he stared at the assembly before him as if to catch them laughing frowned at manvers who sat before him with folded arms lastly he turned to the prisoner who stood up and looked him in the face manuela he said you stand condemned upon your own confession of murder in the first degreemurder of a gentleman who had been your benefactor of whose life and protection you desired for reasons of your own to be ridded the court is clear that you are guilty and cannot give you any assurance that your surrender to justice has assisted the ministers of justice those diligent guardians would have found you sooner or later you may be sure if anyone is to be thanked it is perhaps the foreign gentleman whose candourand here he had the assurance to make manvers a bowwhose candour i say has favourably impressed the court but nevertheless the court in its clemency is willing to allow you the merits of your intention it is true that justice would have been done without your confession but it may be allowed that you desired to stand well with the laws after having violated them in an outrageous manner it is this desire of yours which inclines the court to mercy i shall not inflict the last penalty upon you nor exact the uttermost farthing which your crime deserves the court is willing to believe that you are penitent and condemns you to perpetual seclusion in the institution of the recogidas de santa maria magdalena manuela was seen to close her eyes but she collected herself directly she looked once piercingly at manvers then surrendered herself to him who touched her on the shoulder turned and went out of the court everybody was against her now they jeered howled hissed and cursed her a spoiled plaything had got its deserts manvers turned upon them in a white fury dogs he cried will nothing shame you but nobody seemed to hear or heed him at the moment and gil perez whispered in his ear that no good master this canalla all the same swine you come with me sir i tell you dam good thing he had recovered his old jauntiness and swaggered before his master clearing the way with oaths and threatenings manvers followed him in a very stern mood by the door he felt a touch on the arm and turning saw a tall elderly gentleman cloaked in black he recognised him at once by his hollow eyesockets and smouldering deeply set eyes you will remember me senor caballero in the shop of sebastian the goldsmith he said and manvers admitted it he received another bow and the reminder we met again i think in the church of las angustias in valladolid yes indeed manvers said i remember you very well then you remember no doubt saying to me with regard to your crucifix which i had seen in sebastians hands then in your own that it was a piece of extravagance on your part you will not withdraw that statement today i suppose that which lay latent in his words was betrayed by the gleam of cold fire in his eyes manvers coloured you have this advantage of me senor he said that you know to whom you are speaking and i do not it is very true senor don osmundo the gentleman said severely i will enlighten you i am don luis ramonez de alavia at your service manvers turned white he had indeed made manuela pay double so much for sentiment in spain chapter xvi the herald a card of ample size and flourished characters bearing the name of el marques de fuenterrabia was brought up by gil perez who is he manvers inquired and gil waved his hand this olda gentleman he explained e come embassador from don luis e say what you do next senor don osmundo you tell im siris my advice but i dont know what i am going to do said manvers irritably how the deuce should i know you tell im that sir gil said softly thata best of all what do you mean i mean sir then e tell you what don luis e do show him in said manvers the marques de fuenterrabia was a whitewhiskered irascible personage of stately manners and slight stature he wore a blue frockcoat and nankeen trousers over ridingboots his face was one uniform pink his eyes small fierce and blue they appeared to emit heat as well as light for it was a frequent trick of their proprietors to snatch at his spectacles and wipe the mist from them with a bandana handkerchief unglazed his eyes showed a blank and indiscriminate ferocity which manvers found exceedingly comical they bowed to each otherthe marques with ceremonious cordiality manvers with the stiffness of an englishman to an unknown visitor gil perez hovered in the background as it were on the tips of his toes the marques having made his bow said nothing his whole attitude seemed to imply well what next manvers said that he was at his service and then the marques explained himself my friend don luis ramonez de alavia he said has entrusted me with his confidence it appears that a series of occurrences involving his happiness honour and dignity at once can be traced to your excellencys intromission in his affairs i take it that your excellency does not deny pardon me manvers said i deny it absolutely the marques was very much annoyed que que he muttered and snatched off his spectacles glaring ferociously at them he wiped them with his bandana if don luis really imagines that i compassed the death of his son said manvers i suppose he has his legal remedy he had better have me arrested and have done with it the marques his spectacles on gazed at the speaker with astonishment is it possible sir that you can so misconceive the mind of a gentleman as to suggest legal process in an affair of the kind whatever my friend don luis may consider you he could not be guilty of such a discourtesy one may think he is going too far in the other direction indeedthough one is debarred from saying so under the circumstances but i am not here to bandy words with you my friend don luis commissions me to ask your excellency for the name of a friend to whom the arrangements may be referred for ending a painful controversy in the usual manner if you will be so good as to oblige me i need not intrude upon you again do you mean to suggest senor marques said manvers after a pause that i am to meet don luis on the field pardon said the marques in such a way as to answer the question my dear sir he was assured i would just as soon fight my grandfather the thing is preposterous the marques gasped for air but manvers continued had your friends age been anywhere near my own i doubt if i could have gratified him after what took place the other day he caused a man of his to stab me in the back as i was walking down a dark street in my country we call that a dastards act the marques started and winced as if he was hurt but he remembered himself and the laws of warfare and when he spoke it was within the extremes of politeness i confess sir he said that i was not prepared for your refusal it puts me in a delicate position and to a certain extent i must involve my friend also it is my duty to declare to you that it is don luis intention to break the laws of spain an outrage has been committed against his house and blood which one thing only can efface moved by extreme courtesy don luis was prepared to take the remedy of gentlemen but since you have refused him that he is driven to the use of natural law it will be in your poweri cannot denyto deprive him of that also but he is persuaded that you will not take advantage of it should you show any signs of doing so i am to say don luis will be forced to consider you outside the pale of civilisation and to treat you without any kind of toleration to suggest such a possibility is painful to me and i beg your pardon very truly for it in truth the marques looked ashamed of himself manvers considered the very oblique oration to which he had listened i hope i understand you senor marques he said you intend to say that don luis means to have my life by all means the marques bowed that is so senor don osmundo but you suggest that it is possible that i might stop him by informing the authorities no no said the marques hastily i did not suggest that the authorities would never interfere the british embassy might perhaps be persuadedbut you will do me the justice to admit that i apologised for the suggestion oh by all means said manvers you thought pretty badly of mebut not so badly as all that quite so said the marques and then the surprising gil perez descended from midair and lowed to the stranger my master don osmundo senor marques is incapable of such conduct said heand looked to manvers for approval he struggled with himself but failed his guffaw must out and exploded with violent effect it drove the marques back to the door and sent gil perez scudding on tiptoe to the window you are magnificent all of you cried manvers you flatter me into connivance let me state the case exactly don luis is to stab or shoot me at sight and i am to give him a free hand is that what you mean admirable but let me ask you one question am i not supposed to protect myself the marques stared i dont think i perfectly understand you don osmundo reprisals are naturally open to you we declare war that is all oh said manvers you declare war then i may go shooting too naturally said the marques that is understood no dam fear about that said gil perez to his master chapter xvii la recogida sister chucha the nun who took first charge of newcomers to the penitentiary was fat and kindly and not very discreet it was her business to measure manuela for a garb and to see to the cutting of her hair she told the girl that she was by far the most handsome penitent she had ever had under her hands it is a thousand pities to cut all this beauty away she said for it is obvious you will want it before long so far as that goes you will find the cap not unbecoming and ill see to it that you have a piece of lookingglassthough by ordinary that is forbidden good gracious child what a figure you have if i had had one quarter of your good fortune i should never have been religious she went on to describe the rules of the institution the hours and nature of the work the offices in chapel the recreation times and hours for meals manuela she said was not the build for rope and mat work i shall get reverend mother to put you to housework i think she said that will give you exercise and the chance of an occasional peep at the window you dont deserve it i fancy but you are so handsome that i have a weakness for you all you have to do is to speak fairly to father vicente and curtsey to the reverend mother whenever you see her above all no tantrums leave the others alone and theyll let you alone theres not one of them but has her scheme for getting away or her friend outside thats occupation enough for her it will be the same with you your friends will find you out youll have a novio spending the night in the street before tomorrows over unless i am very much mistaken she patted her cheek ill do what i can for you my dear manuela curtseyed and thanked the good nun all i have to do she said is to repent of my sinwhich has become very horrible to me lalala cried sister chucha keep that for father vicente if you please my dear that is his affair our patroness led a jolly life before she was a saint no doubt you should not have stabbed don bartolome and of course the ramonez would never overlook such a thing but we all understand that you must save your own skin if you couldthats very reasonable and i hear that there was another reason here she chucked her chin i dont wonder at it she said with a meaning smile the girl coloured and hung her head she was still quivering with the shame of her public torture she could still see manvers eyes stare chilly at the wall before them and believe them to grow colder with each stave of her admissions her one consolation lay in the thought that she could please him by amendment and save him by a conviction so it was hard to be petted by sister chucha she would have welcomed the whip would have hugged it to her bosomthe rod of salvation she would have called it but compliments on her beauty caresses of cheek and chinwas she not to be allowed to be good as for escape she had no desire for that she could love her don osmundo best from a distance what was to be gained but shame by seeing him her shining hair was cut off the cap the straight prison garb were put on she stood up slimnecked an arrowy maid with her burning face and seagreen eyes chastened by real humility she made a good confession to father vicente and took her place among her mates it was true what sister chucha had told her every penitent in that great and gaunt building was thrilled with one persistent hope worked patiently with that in view and under its spell refrained from violence or clamour there was not one face of those files of greygowned girls which at stated hours entered the chapel knelt at the altar or stooped at painful labour through the stifling days which did not show a gleam stupid vacant vicious morose pretty sparkling whatever the face might be there was that expectation to redeem or enhance it to make it human to make it womanish there was or there would be some day any day a lover outsideto whom it would be the face of all faces manuela had not been two hours in the company of her fellowprisoners before she was told that there were two ways of escape from the recogidas religion or marriage these were but the religious alternative was not discussed sister chucha it transpired had chosen that waybut do you wonder cried the girl who told manuela with shrill scorn most of the sisters had once been penitentsvaya look at them my dear cried this young amazon conscious of her own charms she was a plump andalusian blackeyed merry and quick to change her moods love had sent her to saint mary magdalene and love would take her out again that chucha she owned was a kind soul she always put the pretty ones to houseworkit gives us a chance at the windows i have fernando who works at the sandcarting in the river he never fails to look up this way some day he will ask for me she peered at herself in a pail of water and fingered her cap daintily how does my skirt hang now manuela too short i fancy did you ever see such shoes as they give you here lucky that nobody can see you this was the strain of everybodys talk in the house of las recogidasin the whitewashed galleries where they walked in squads under the eye of a nun who sat reading a good book against the wall in the court where they lay in the shade to rest prone with their faces hidden in their arms or with knees huddled up and eyes fixed in a stare they talked to each other in the hoarse tearful staccato of spain which beginning low seems to gather force and volume as it runs until like a beck in flood it carries speaker and listener over the bar and into tossing waves of yeasty water manuela through all kept her thoughts to herself and spoke nothing of her own affairs there may have been others like her fixed to the great achievement of justifying themselves to their own standard she had no means of knowing her standard was this that she had purged herself by open confession to the man whom she loved she was clean sweetened and full of heart all she had to do was to open wide her house that holiness might enter in besides this she had at the moment the consciousness of a good action for she firmly believed that by her surrender to the law she had again saved manvers from assassination if don luis could only cleanse his honour by blood he now had her hearts blood that should suffice him she grew happier as the days went on meanwhile it was remarked upon by mercedes and dolores and half a dozen more that distinguished strangers came to the gallery of the chapel the outlines of them could be descried through the grille for behind the grille was a great white window which threw them into high relief it was the fixed opinion of mercedes and dolores that manuela had a novio chapter xvii the novio it is true that manvers had gone to the chapel of the recogidas to look for or to look at manuela this formed the one amusing episode in his weeks round in madrid where otherwise he was extremely bored and where he only remained to give don luis a chance of waging his war to be shot at in the street or stabbed in the back as you are homing through the dusk are to be sure not everybodys amusements and in an ordinary way they were not those of mr manvers but he found that his life gained a zest by being threatened with deprivation and so long as that zest lasted he was willing to oblige don luis the weather was insufferably hot one could only be abroad early in the morning or late at nightboth the perfection of seasons for the assassins game yet nothing very serious had occurred during the week following the declaration of war gil perez could not find tormillo and had to declare that his suspicions of a manchegan teamster who had jostled his master in the puerta del sol and made as if to draw his knife were without foundation what satisfied him was that the manchegan that same evening stabbed somebody else to death that show e is good fellowtoo much after is enemy said gil perez affably so manvers felt justified in his refusal to wear mail or carry either revolver or swordstick and by the end of the week he forgot that he was a marked man on sunday he told gil perez that he intended to visit the chapel of the recogidas the rogues face twinkled good sir good we go i show you manuela allholy like a nun i know whata she do look for eaven all day that chucha she tell me somethingand the portero e damgood fellow resplendent in white duck trousers mr manvers was remarked upon by a purely native company of sightseers quickeyed ladies in mantillas were there making play with their fans and scentbottles attendant cavaliers found something of which to whisper in the coolfaced englishman with his fair beard blue eyes and eyeglass his air of detachment which disguised his real feelings and of readiness to be entertained which they misinterpreted the facts were that he was painfully involved in manuelas fate and uncomfortably near being in love again with the lovely unfortunate she was no longer a pretty thing to be kissed no longer even a handsome murderess she was become a heroine a martyr a thing enskied and sainted he had seen more than he had been meant to see during his ordeal in the audienciaher consciousness of himself for instance as revealed in that last dying look she had given him that long look before she turned and followed her gaolers out of court he guessed at her agonies of shame he understood how it was that she had courted it in fine he knew very well that her heart was in his keepingand thats a dangerous possession for a man already none too sure of the whereabouts of his own when the organ music thrilled and opened and the recogidas filed insome hundred of themhis heart for a moment stood still as he scanned them through the gloom they were dressed exactly alike in dull clinging grey all wore closefitting white caps were nearly all deadwhite in the face they all shuffled as convicts do when they move closeordered to their work afield it shocked him that he utterly failed to identify manuelaand it brought him sharply to his better senses that gil perez saw her at once see her there master see there my beautiful the man groaned under his breath and manvers looked where he pointed and saw her but now the glamour was gone gil was her declared lover the squire of somerset could not stoop to be his valets rival the squire of somerset however observed that she held herself more stiffly than her comates and shuffled less the prison garb clothed her like a weed she had the trick of wearing clothes so that they draped the figure not concealed it were as wax upon it not a cerement that which fell shapeless and heavily from the shoulders of the others upon her seemed to grow rather from the waistto creep upwards over the shoulders as ivy steals clinging over a statue in a park here said he is a maiden that cannot be hid call her a murderess she remains perfect woman call her convict magdalen she is some mans solace he looked at gil perez motionless and intent by his side and heard his short breath there is her mate he thought to himself and was saved they filed out as they had come in they all stood turned towards the exit and waited until they were directed to move then they followed each other like sheep through a gateway looking so far as he could see at nothing expecting nothing and remembering nothing a downtrodden herd he conceived them their wits dulled by toil he was not near enough to see the gleam which kept them alive nuns gave them their orders with authoritative hands quick always and callous by routine probably not intended to be so harsh as they appeared he saw one girl pushed forward by the shoulder with such suddenness that she nearly fell another flinched at a passionate command another scowled as she passed her mistress he watched to see how manuela who had come in one of the first and must go out one of the last would bear herself and was relieved by a pretty and enheartening episode manuela as she passed drew her hand along the top of the bench with a lingering trailing touch it encountered that of the nun in command and he saw the nuns hand enclose and press the penitents he saw manuelas look of gratitude and the nuns smiling affection he believed that manuela blushed that gratified him extremely and enlarged his benevolent intention had gil perez seen it he thought not gil perez black eyes were fixed upon manuelas form they glittered like a cats when he watches a bird in a shrubbery the valet was quite unlike himself as he followed his master homewards and asked leave of absence for the eveningfor the first time in his period of service manvers had no doubt at all how that evening was spentin rapt attention below the barred windows of the house of the recogidas that was so gil perez played the bear as they call it from dusk till the small hoursperfectly happy in a rapture of adoration which the squire of somerset could never have realised all the romance which if we may believe cervantes once transfigured the life of spain and gilded the commonest acts till they seemed confident appeals for the applause of god feats boldly done under heavens thronged barriers is nowadays concentred in this one strange vigil which all lovers have to keep gil perez the quick the admirable servant the jaunty adventurer the assured rogue had vanished here he stood beneath the stars breathing prayers and praisesnot a little valet sighing for a convicted magdalen but a young knight keeping watch beneath his ladys tower and he was not alone there at due intervals along the frowning walls were posted other servants of the sleeping girls behind them other knights at watch and ward the prayer he breathed was the prayer breathed too for dolores or mercedes in prison virgin of atocha virgin of the pillar virgin of sorrow of divine compassion send happy sleep to thy handmaid manuela shed the dew of thy love upon her eyelids keep smooth her brows keep innocent her lips dignify me thy servant gil perez more than other men that i may be worthy to sustain this high honour of love his eyes never wavered from a certain upper window it was as blank as all the rest differed in no way from any other of a row of fiveandtwenty to him if was the pride of the great building o fortunate stars he whispered to himself that can look through these and see my love upon her bed o rays too much blessed that can kiss her eyelids and touch lightly upon the scented strands of her hair o breath of the night that can fan in her white neck and stroke her arm stretched out over the coverlet to you nightwind and to you stars i give an errand you shall take a message from me to lovely manuela of the golden tresses tell her that i am watching out the dark tell her that no harm shall come to her whisper in her ear mingle with her dreams and tell her that she has a lover tell her also that the nights in madrid are not like those in valencia and that she would do well to cover her arm and shoulder up lest she catch cold and suffer there spoke the realist the romantic realist of spain for it is to be observed that gil perez did not know at all whereabouts manuela lay asleep and could not naturally know whether her arm was out of bed or in it he had forgotten also that her hair had been cut offbut these are trifles happy he he had forgotten much more than that when manvers told him that he intended to pay manuela a visit on the day allowed gil perez suffered the tortures of the damned jealous rage consumed his vitals like a corroding acid which reason and loyalty had no power to assuage yet reason and loyalty played out their allotted parts and it had been a fine sight to see gil grinning and gibbering at his own white face in the lookingglass shaking his finger at it and saying to it in english since it was his masters shavingglass gil perez my fellow you shut up he said it many times for he had nothing else to sayjealousy deprived him of his wits and he felt better for the discipline when manvers returned there was no sign upon gils brisk person of the stormy conflict which had ravaged it manvers had seen her and by sister chuchas charity had seen her alone the poor girl had fallen at his feet and would have kissed them if he had not lifted her up no my dear no he said it is i who ought to kneel you have done wonders for me you are as brave as a lion manuela but i must get you away from this place no no don osmundo she cried flushing up indeed i am better here she stood before him commanding herself steeling herself in the presence of this man she loved against any hint of her beating heart he had himself well in hand her beauty her distress and misfortune could not touch him now all that he had for her was admiration and pure benevolence fatal offerings for a woman inflamed so soon as she perceived it her courage was needed for another tussle her blood lay like lead in her veins her heart sank to the deeps of her and she must screw it back again to the work of the day he took her hand and she let him have it what could it matter now what he had of hers manuela he said there is a way of freedom for you if you will take it a man loves you truly and asks nothing better than to work for you i know him hes been a good friend to me will you let me pay you off my debt his name is gil perez you have seen him i know hes an honest man my dear and loves you to distraction what are you going to say to him if he asks for you she stood handfasted to the man who had kissed herand in kissing her had drawn out her soul through her lips who now was pleading that another man might have her dead lips the mockery of the thing might have made a worse woman laugh horribly but this was a woman made pure by love she saw no mockery no discrepancy in what he asked her she knew he was in earnest and wished her nothing but good and she could see without knowing that she saw how much he desired to be rid of his obligation to her therefore she reasoned she would be serving him again if she agreed to what he proposed hereif laughing had been her moodwas matter for laughter that when he tried to pay her off he was really getting deeper into debt look at it in this way you owe a fine sum principal and interest to a jew you go to him and propose to borrow again of him in order that you may pay off the first debt and be done with it the jew might laugh but he would lend and manuela who hoarded love hugged to her heart the new bond she was offered the deeper he went into debt the more she must lend him there was pleasure in thisshrill pleasure not far off from pain but she was a child of pleasure and must take what she could get her grave eyes uncurtained searched his face is this what you desire me to do is this what you ask of me my dear said he i desire your freedom i desire to see you happy and cared for i must go away i must go home i shall go more willingly if i know that i have provided for my friend she urged a halfhearted plea i am very well here don osmundo the sisters are kind to me the work is light i might be happy here what he cried in prison it is what i deserve she said but he would not hear of it you are here through my blunders he insisted if i hadnt left you with that scoundrel in the wood this would never have happened and theres another thing which i must say he grew very serious im

hidalgo for your novio chapter xix the war opens returning from his visit climbing the calle mayor at that blankest hour of the summer day when the sun is at his fiercest raging vertically down upon a street empty of folk but glittering like glass and radiant with quivering air manvers was shot at from a distance so far as he could judge of thirty yards he heard the ball go shrilling past him and then splash and flatten upon a church wall beyond he turned quickly but could see nothing not a sign of life was upon the broad way not a curtain was lifted not a shutter swung apart to all intents and purposes he was upon the castilian plains unarmed though he was he went back upon his traces down the hill expecting at any moment that the assassin would flare out upon him and shoot him down at pointblank he went back in all some fifty yards there was no man in lurking that he could discover after a few moments irresolutionwhether to stand or proceedhe decided that the sooner he was within walls the better he turned again and walked briskly towards the puerta del sol sixty yards or so from the great plaza within sight of it he was fired at again and this time he was hit in the muscles of the left arm he felt the burning sting the shock and the aching the welling of blood was a blessed relief on this occasion he pushed forward and reached his inn without further trouble he sent for gil perez who whisked off for the surgeon by the time he brought one in manvers was feverish and so remained until the morning tossing and jerking through the fervent night with his arm stiff from shoulder to fingerpoints that a dam thief sir e count on you never looka back said gil perez nodding grimly capitan rodney e all the same as you walka is blessed way never taka no notice of anybody

never shootyou see manvers felt that to walk backwards would be at least as tiresome as to walk forwards and be shot at in a city which now held little for him but danger and ennui not even manuelas fortunes could prevail against boredom as he lay upon his hateful bed disgust with spain grew upon him hand over hand he became irritable to gil perez he announced his determination this sort of thing must end gil bowed and rubbed his hands you go ome sir is besta place for you don luis e kill you for sure you go e go ome esleep on is olda bedtoo mucha satisfy under his breath he added poor

about er too much what he knew he kept hidden but one day he went to the recogidas and asked to see sister chucha he was obsequious but impassioned full of cajolery but not for a moment did he try to impose upon his countrywoman by any assumption of omniscience that was reserved for his master and was indeed a kind of compliment to his needs sister chucha heard him at first with astonishment then it was for you gil perez that the gentleman came here gil nodded it was for me sister how could it be otherwise i thought that the gentleman was interested gil peered closely into her face that gentleman is persecuted manuela can save him from the danger he stands inbut only through me sister i love her more than life and the sky but i am content and she will be content that life shall be dumb and the sky dark if that gentleman may go free let me speak with manuelayou will see the nun was troubled too many see manuela she said only yesterday there came here a man ha said gil perez fiercely what manner of a man a little man she told him that came in creeping rounding his shouldersso and swimming with his hands he saw manuela and left her trembling she was white and greyand very cold that man said gil folding his arms was our enemy let me now see manuela it was more a command than an entreaty sister chucha obeyed it she went away without a word and returned presently leading manuela by the hand she brought her into the room released her and stood watching and listening eyes leaped to meetmanuela was on fire but gils fire ate up hers senorita you have surrendered in vain these men must have blood for blood the patron lies wounded and will die unless we save him senorita you are willing and i am willingspeak she regarded him steadily you know that i am willing gil

and she is everything to me sister you may trust me with her the nun turned from him to the motionless beauty by her side you my child what do you say to this project shall i let you go manuela wavered a little she swayed about and balanced herself with her hands but she quickly recovered sister chucha she said let me go the soft green light from her eyes spoke for her chapter xx meeting by moonlight by moonlight in the sheeted park four persons met to do battle for the life of mr manvers while he lay grumbling and burning in his bed behind the curtains of it don luis ramonez was there the first to cometall and gaunt with undying pride in his hollow eyes like a spectre of rancour kept out of the grave behind him tormillo came creeping a little restless man dogging his masters footsteps watching for word or sign from him these two stood by the lake in the huge empty park still under its shroud of white moonlight don luis picked up the corner of his cloak and threw it over his left shoulder he stalked stately up and down the arc of a circle which a stone seat defined tormillo sat upon the edge of the seat his elbows on his knees and looked at the ground but he kept his master in the tail of his eye now and again furtively but as if he loved what he feared he put his hand into his breast and felt the edge of his long knife once indeed when don luis on his sentrymarch had his back to him he drew out the blade and turned it under the moon watching the cold light shiver and flash up along it and down not fleck or flaw was upon it it showed the moon whole within its face this pair each absorbed in his own business waited for the other tormillo saw them coming and marked it by rising from his seat he peered along the edge of the water to be sure then he went noiselessly towards them looking back often over his shoulder at don luis but his master did not seem to be aware of anyone he stood still looking over the gloomy lake tormillo having gone half way waited gil perez hailed him is that you tormillo the muffled figure of a girl by his side gave no sign it is i gil perez be not afraid if i were afraid of anything i should not be here i have brought manuela of her own will good said tormillo give her to me we will go to don luis yes you shall take her i will remain here senorita will you go with him manuela said i am ready tormillo turned his face away and gil perez with passion whispered to manuela my soul my life manuela one sign from you and i kill him she turned him her rapt face no sign from me brotherno sign from me my life sighed gil perez soul of my soul she held him out her hand pray for me she said he snatched at her hand knelt on his knee stooped over it and then jumping up flung himself from her take her you tormillo tormillo took her by the hand and they went together towards the semicircular seat in whose centre stood don luis like a black statue softfooted went she swaying a little like a gossamer caught in a light wind don luis halfturned and saluted her master said tormillo manuela is here as if she were a figure to be displayed he lightly threw back her veil manuela stood still and bowed her head to the uncovered gentleman i am ready senor don luis she said he came nearer watching her saying nothing i killed don bartolome your son she said because i feared him he told me that he had come to kill me but i was beforehand with him there it is true that i loved don osmundo who had been kind to me you killed my son said don luis and you loved the englishman i own the truth she said and am ready to requite you i thought to have satisfied you by giving myself upbut you have shown me that that was not enough now then i give you myself of my own will if you will let don osmundo go free will you make a bargain with me he knew nothing of don bartolome your son don luis bowed manuela turned her head slowly about to the still trees to the sleeping water to the moon in the clear sky as if to greet the earth for the last time for one moment her eyes fell on gil perez afar offon his knees with his hands raised to heaven i am ready she said again and bowed her head tormillo put into don luis hands the long knife don luis threw it out far into the lake it fled like a streak of light struck skimmed along the surface and sank without a splash he went to manuela and put his hand on her shoulder she quivered at his touch my child said he i cannot touch you you have redeemed yourself go now and sin no more he left her and went his way stately along the edge of the water he stalked past gil perez at his prayers as if he saw him notas may well be the case but gil perez got upon his feet as he went by and saluted him with profound respect immediately afterwards he went like the wind to manuela he found her crying freely on the stone seat her arms upon the back of it and her face hidden in her arms she wept with passion her sobs were pitiful to hear tormillo not at all moved waited for gil perez esa te quiere bien que te hace llorar he said she loves thee well that makes thee weep i weep not said gil perez it is she that weeps as for me i praise god aha gil perez tormillo beganthen he chuckled for you my friend theres still sunlight on the wall gil nodded i believe it then he looked fiercely at the other man go you with god tormillo and leave me with her tormillo stared spat on the ground no need of your chuck chuck to an old dog i go gil perez adios hermano gil perez sat on the stone seat and drew manuelas head to his shoulder she suffered him illustration
